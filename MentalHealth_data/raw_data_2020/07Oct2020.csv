0,I really need to talk to someone please can someone dm me,07Oct2020,1
1,"Hey so my wife has decided that she‚Äôs ready to seek counseling. She has a lot of trauma (sexual, general abuse, abandonment, near-death). She‚Äôs very scared about starting her journey. As we have different sources of trauma and different life experiences, I‚Äôm not sure what I can do or say to support her without her feeling as if I‚Äôm overbearing. I‚Äôve also mentioned to her the EMDR and brain spotting that I have done and she‚Äôs said that she does not believe in that sort of work and wants to ‚Äújust talk to someone.‚Äù Any advice?",07Oct2020,1
2,"i don‚Äôt really know where im going with this but i cant talk to anybody about it because they don‚Äôt fully understand. lately i‚Äôve been incredibly stressed out to the point where im losing hair, im only 24. everything always feels like it‚Äôs pushing down on me and no matter how hard i try it always feels like sadness and doubt are right around the corner. my job pays me little to nothing to where i can‚Äôt really afford bills, i don‚Äôt feel like i can actually tell anybody my issues, i catch myself just thinking about suicide, and i just always feel so used. i care about people and the people i socialize with but i just wish i could be more open with them about things without feeling like a burden or as if i‚Äôm looking for attention. 

i‚Äôm posting this because i feel like someone on here may be going through the same shit as me and i just want to let you know that your not alone, we‚Äôre in this boat together, and one day we will see land. we can‚Äôt give up or give in, we have to be strong (i may even be talking to myself at this point but still)",07Oct2020,1

4,"Recently I've been visiting a certain spot in a forest near my house and I've seen myself spending almost  the whole night there and sometimes even while its still day out. Whenever I go there time seems to slow down. Nothing moves, no sounds are made, wind stops blowing, all thats left is an eerie feeling of anticipation to feel something again, to do something, for any change at all. I almost feel locked in place when I go there. Its a large clearing with just a stone in the middle, but something about it feels familiar, and I don't want to leave. What the hell is going on?",07Oct2020,1

8,"My name is Mackenzie. A fellow teenager of 14, nearly 15.

This post will be  incredibly long, but is of  an incredibly important nature, so please read it all.

First, I wrote a poem, or a song.

Pain-

My insecurities are burning through me,
I change who I am so that people don't see
The pain that I'm in, and I try constantly,
To face them, embrace them, my insecurities.

My emotions confuse me, they're tearing me up, 
I put on a smile but that ain't enough. 
I'm losing this battle, my feelings are too rough, whe I feel like giving up, but I try to act tough. 

I try hard to focus, on the good things I have, 
My friends are amazing, my family love me back. 
But my feelings suppress them, I start to lose track, 
Of what I have left, and I continue to crack. 

Depression, emotions, these unspoken things, 
Anxiety, fear, that constant feeling, 
That you are not worth it, that you don't fit in, 
Take over your body, they are life destroying. 

People say that I'm perfect, but little does that help, 
I know these things are true, but I still push myself, 
Further and further, down into the ground, 
I'm up in the clouds, reality knocks me down. 

Maybe I'm stupid, maybe I'm broken 
I bottle my problems, I give into them. 
I know that just talking can help, I've got friends, 
But I'm not worth the effort and so I pretend. 

I struggle, I worry, I cry and I scream, 
But I know it's no use, I can't be heard or seen. 
I wonder what life would be like without pain. 
Breathing in the harsh air, til I don't breathe again. 

And, hopefully you have got this far, now a message. 

As someone who struggles, like many teenagers, and young people, with insecurities, worries, depression, judgment, harassment or bullying, and someone who is aware of the harsh rise in mental health issues, I wrote the song/poem to try and spread as much awareness as possible.
 The pressure put on the young today can have massively overbearing effects on later years. Being young as I am, some may find things that I've said or will say invalid, but I believe that anyone can take the time to understand issues like these, regardless of wether they are young or not.
 I'm not going to pretend that I have experienced, or fully understand what everyone else is going through, but I make an effort to try. What I do understand is that bottling up your issues worries or whatever you may label them, can destroy a life.
 In spreading this message, I hope to make people see, understand, realise that, as I have been reminded by my friends, that you are perfect. There is not just one definition of the word perfect, there has been billions, and currently is  over 7.8 billion definitions of the word. Each individual different, each perfect by their own way. You are beautiful. You are worth it, worth everything, to me, to everyone in your life, and even the planet.
 That's billions of people, each of whom love you, each of  whom  is also perfect. Each little quirk that you have, each individual aspect of you, every little thing about you, is perfect. 5here will be people who disregard this post, but I guarantee this  post  also applies to them perhaps less or perhaps more so. 
There is only one life you get to live for definite right now, so live it in the light. Cringy or blunt or metaphoric though that may sound, it is entirely true. Live your life, embrace your pain, anxiety, sadness, and everything else, and use them to push you, towards happiness, towards your goals, towards your future. These words may help, and I hope infinitely that they do, but they may not. For that, I apologise wholeheartedly and solemnly.
 I may not be experienced, or have experienced everything that I have spoken or will speak about.,but I have experienced enough to not want to stand back and watch others suffer, weather it be less, equally or more than I have. If you are or feel close to the edge, step back. Go to the people you love, and talk to them. Talking, I know can feel like the hardest thing, but it is the most rewarding thing too. 
And if you feel like there is no one that loves you, find someone. Remember that there will forever be people that love you, for you. No matter what. 

Please, spread this message, tell me if I have missed something, said something wrong, criticise me, thank me, talk to me. Message me if you want to, to talk about anything and I'll try my best to help. 
Spread this message for Andrew Leach. For James Myles. For McKenzie Adams, for Hailie Mass on. For Niegel Shelby. For the 264+million people who suffer from depression. For the 7.8 billion people who suffer from mental health issues. For you, for me, for us. 

Please repost this, share this, spread this in any and every way you can. 

Please, do not spread hate or cause unnecessary damage in the commennts or community, or anywhere at all. And if you read this far, thank you very, very much.",07Oct2020,1
9,"TW: heavily discusses negative mental health and intentional death by oneself and self injury. 

hi all. please stop reading now if you are triggered easily. this is a rant/need for advice. reddit is the only place i have to explain these things- everyone else is going through too much.

a close family member passed away in august in a lost battle with depression. i survived an attempt a few months ago and have gotten better since. but around me, my loved ones may be loosing the same battle.

my family always had a negative mental health record. it has taken lives in my family. and now another is gone. im fearful that my mother, father and brothers may be taking the same road. my mom is drinking and smoking and getting worse. i know my parents dont want to exist.

my girlfriend (im a lesbian) isnt okay either. not one of my friends are okay. one of them in specific is at a point where i start to panic when they text me. im terrified. i dont know how to help anymore. im so tired. im so angry. i love all my friends and for years ive tried so hard to support them all through their issues. i cant take it. i began to self injure every day starting january. i am a few weeks clean and i feel guilty for feeling not so bad while my world is falling apart around me. i know soon i will face another few months of what caused me to self injure in the first place. i know the school will try to send me to a mental hospital again. im scared. my life is falling apart. my friends and family are dying. 

if i take a break from them all i know at least one will end up dead. ive been told im the only thing keeping them alive. im trying to hard to help all these people and it hurts. i cant stop. i know for a fact once one friend goes, so will the rest. we all know it. we all know it‚Äôs inevitable. i dont know what to do. im lost. i cant sleep anymore in case one of them needs me in the middle of the night. i cant do this.",07Oct2020,1
10," Hey guys, I thought I would make you aware of a sub that has been made called [r/ThinkMagick](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThinkMagick/) that is a new safe and open space designed to help those who face persecution/mental health issues for their beliefs. In the past I have faced targeted persecution for who I am and the faith I follow so I understand how it feels to be treated badly for a belief.

I know many people in life suffer because of their chosen faith, because they do not align with common thought or beliefs. I have not found a sub-reddit that caters to providing a safe space where people can get help from like minded people and hopefully make friends and discuss their interests with others.

ThinkMagick is a combination of discussion page, support group and community that attempts to break down barriers and bring people who are different together.

I hope this is the right space to share it as I understand this isn't necessarily directly tied to mental health, however too many people suffer and thereby do not practice their craft in peace. Being treated fairly and equally is just as important to the craft as ritual work and belief, for everyone deserved equality, regardless of belief. I thought I would share it here as I am a practicing witch (be it a baby-witch) and understand the difficulties some face, thereby I created this page to help others who are facing equally challenging times. 

This page is a mental health page designed to help practitioners of alternate faiths/beliefs who suffer from discrimination or mental health issues. I decided to highlight it here as often people who practice do not realise there are other like minded people out there who are willing to help.  

(P.s Sorry if I have breached any community rules. I am unsure if I have. I apologise if I have. If so please let me know and remove the post. I would be grateful if you could let me know where else to post this as I feel encouraging good mental health amongst practitioners needs to be wider spread and have greater emphasis placed upon it)",07Oct2020,1

12,"You‚Äôre afraid of online class? That‚Äôs illogical so it‚Äôs impossible!

Want therapy? Why? We don‚Äôt have family history so it‚Äôs impossible that you‚Äôre crazy! You should be able to fix yourself so deal with it yourself after I tell you and make you ‚Äúpromise‚Äù to be better.

Oh, you‚Äôre crying? I can‚Äôt f-ing understand you so fix your speech while I keep talking down on you on things I assumed from what little I saw from your recent behavior that I only noticed because it resulted in problems and of course I should ignore the fact that  you‚Äôre literally crying!

And also why are you so distant? You don‚Äôt make sense even if I just never really spent enough time with you to know that all your behavior has been consistent for the past decade plus you‚Äôre starting to withdraw even more.

13,"F22. Growing up I progressively got worse and worse handelling symptoms of ADHD (which I've only just recently started the process of being diagnosed with) along with misphonia. Instead of helping me she always cirtisied me, everything related to ADHD was me being lazy and selfish and with the misphonia it was always again me being selfish and it inconveniencing her ending in her not getting mw help or at least making an effort not to trigger it.

Fast forward to now and I have gotten better at handelling both of these but my resentment stands. And my misphonia has not eased when it comes to her,she still does all the stuff that irritate me (chewing gum, eating crisps) knowing full well they do, never gotten me help for it. It's bad association mixed with a mental health disorder- association being I used to stick wet tissue in my ear to block out the sound and scratch myself until I bled when she did these things that irritate me. 

She knows I may have ADHD and according to numerous online tests I've taken my symptoms suggest severe, and she knows that the noise thing is misphonia, yet she has never even bothered to look into these things as some sort of redemption and apologise for never trying to help me or support me. My life has been impossibly hard and I don't know how to forgive her and move past this.",07Oct2020,1
14,This is just my 2nd visit to the doctor on my 15th day of Sertraline. I actually feel a little better now. I feel a little more optimistic compared to other days where my brain was fogging up and numbing.,07Oct2020,1
15,"Through a series of hard life challenges that I couldn't quite match up to I have found myself stuck. Seems I've been pretty depressed for the past 2 and a half years. Things started not working out in California and I had to leave the west coast. That cut deep. When things were going bad out there I was embarrassed about failing and never talked to my friends and the people I care about with it. I began isolating myself.
 By the time I moved back to my hometown I went from having all of the friends and being a respected member of my community to not being able to show my face to all but 5 of my closest friends. I was starting to get better. A year after being home I was getting involved with the local burner community and bringing my projects to events and volunteering. It was starting to bring back a part of my sense of self as burning man plays a large part in my life and my ideals. I had found a new job and was performing adequately. 
Let's jump forward to just before Covid. 
My grandmother pretty suddenly passed away. My aunt (mother's sister) (bad history) did not tell me or my mom when grandma got sick. We learned through extended family just before she passed. Losing my grandmother, feeling helpless and seeing my mother in distress had gotten me drinking. Then covid happened. Furloughed from work and isolated at home got my drinking more. 
I was trying to cope with the stress of being alone and furthermore being stuck to dwell on my failures. At this time I started feeling paralyzed. When I am with friends I have plenty to say but cannot open my mouth. At home I have things to but I cannot move to do them. I got stuck in a fantasy where I win the lotto don't have to work and can afford all the mental care I need. 
Work called me back in. Damn it felt great. I was working again and I was feeling like there was some purpose to all this.  That's been fading. I still feel so and am so isolated from my friends but powerless to change it. I started drinking less but it just makes me aware of my failures and hate myself more.  Dread is taking its place. I spend the majority of my time lost in my fantasy while stagnating in my life and career.",07Oct2020,1

18,"Today I decided to look through some past videos/pictures in my phone. 

Looking through them, I began to feel a sense of sadness, as they showed old friendships of people who are no longer in my life anymore and exciting experiences that I feel like I failed to savor in the moment in which they were occurring. A part of me misses having a close knit group of friends- my life responsibilities and the beginning of a serious relationship led me to live a reserved day-to-day lifestyle that limited my ability to hold a close relationship with friends. They were there willing to spend time with me, listen to me, and just laugh and suddenly, one day, life led us all apart. It‚Äôs difficult to believe you can make such strong relationships with other people, only for them to be almost non-existent in the future. I suppose, in a way, I‚Äôve began to feel lonely.

After having lived your life through the ups and downs and reflecting on the great memories of the past involving people you are no longer in touch with, how exactly do you feel about those old memories? Is it the same sense of sad nostalgia? How has your philosophy in life changed growing older regarding the topic?",07Oct2020,1
19,"This is my first post ever, so go easy on me. I have had a feeling for a while that the world I exist in is not real. Obviously it's real enough that I can touch this and interact with it, but I have this itch at the back of my brain that I might be the only thing that's actually real. The people, the places, the things could just be a part of my own mind or a simulation or whatever. I've wrestled with it for a while and the only people I've told are my wife and a psychiatrist. Neither of those were particularly fruitful. They both tried to be helpful, but how convincing can something be if you aren't sure it's real either. I try not to talk about it with my wife because it makes her sad to think that I doubt her existence, which is fair. Not believing in the world can make it tough to get close to people, tough to feel empathy. I try to live life like everything is real so that I'm not just cold and heartless, but I sometimes have a tougher time feeling bad for people that I have no connection to. To some of you I probably sound like a loon, and to some of you this might sound all too familiar. And wouldn't that be convenient. How convincing would it be to not be alone in this. I think that's half of the problem, convenience. The world seems too perfect. I don't mean perfect like sunshine and rainbows,  I mean it sucks a little too perfectly. There's always something wrong, there's always something dividing people so that we don't realise how fabricated it all feels. I've had a pretty easy life. I've had struggles too though. Just enough for people to go ""eh that's being in your 20s"". I think some people do stupid dangerous things to check if they really can die. I'm far too afraid that I can too try it. What if everything just ends after that. Or worse what if it is real and then I make everyone I care about sad. It just feels like an endless and unsolvable problem that is slowly going to drive me insane. For those of you deeply concerned, yes I have sought medical help, and am taking medicine for depression and anxiety attacks. I guess it's just easier to talk about it here where I'm faceless and so are you. Where I can't see the pain in people's eyes when they realize how impossible it is to convince someone that you are real. That they're real.",07Oct2020,1
20,There is this kid in my class that I am kinda friends with. And he does one thing that annoys the hell out of me.

He always says something every week about how he has something that makes his life so hard. And of course that‚Äôs possible but the thing that he has that makes his life hard changes every week.

21,"Background:
Hello, I‚Äôm a therapeutic counselor of sorts. I help give people the understanding they need to solve their problems. And I‚Äôd like to help as many people as I can especially during this pandemic, very depressive times. I used to have debilitating social/general anxiety, I‚Äôd wake up every morning with a panic attack, and I was extremely depressed but I solved all of those things for myself, went on to solve it for the people around me, and now I‚Äôd like to try to solve your problems as well. What I‚Äôm offering is 4 free sessions each an hour long, extended if needed. And if you‚Äôd like to keep speaking with me after the first few sessions then you pay for the 5th and so on. The payment plan is income based starting at $25 an hour. You can stop after the 4th session as well no judgment. 

Why I do this:
I used to be a super depressed person, extremely nihilistic, so I know how it feels, and I understand how it feels when people don‚Äôt understand how painful anxiety and depression can be. I‚Äôve also battled with eating disorders, and a myriad of other common mental health issues. But now I don‚Äôt have these issues so I teach people what I taught myself. And when I was dealing with these problems I went to therapists but they just did not help me, they felt uncaring, intimidating, or they couldn‚Äôt relate to me, biggest I felt they weren‚Äôt being themselves which felt disingenuous. 

Qualifications:
People told me I‚Äôve helped them be who they are today. I‚Äôve talked people out of suicide. I‚Äôve helped people overcome body image issues, anxiety, etc and given them healthy ways to keep progressing. I‚Äôm also a little well read in psychology &amp; sociology. 

Note: 
I am not a licensed mental health professional. That‚Äôs why the first 4 sessions are free so you don‚Äôt have to pay for a service you don‚Äôt agree with or jump into anything you don‚Äôt like. I‚Äôm not claiming I‚Äôm a doctor or I can change your life, but I can definitely help. If you have any questions message me. 

At the very least. I‚Äôm someone to talk to that has pretty decent advice on a lot of topics.",07Oct2020,1

There‚Äôs a drive for death and to wipe out other people through my rage especially partners if they offend me or get in my way, so I don‚Äôt physically hurt them but I do discount them and walk away from them in a cruel fashion as a result. Then there‚Äôs the drive to simply be me and happy and just bonding. Why do I have so many different ones and how does one control them all without one taking the reins and being in control longer than I want it to as a result?",07Oct2020,1
24,"Like, you are still mad at the person, but at the same time you are not feeling the anger in your body. Something like that. Because being mad is pretty annoying and overwhelming, but I also don't want to stop being mad at the person. I just want to stop feeling it physically.",07Oct2020,1
25,"Lately, I've(F16) had suspicions that my boyfriend(M18) doesn't like me being around him anymore. I have extremely bad anxiety and tend to overthink things so much but I'm not too sure about this. 
It started with me losing all of my friends during quarantine (lost alot because i continued his relationship ship which is no way his fault but still. And he's the only person I really get to interact with. He started a band with a group of friends and things were fine. I was invited to practices and it was cool being able to hang with people. But the last time I was invited, my boyfriend started making jokes that made me uncomfortable.
 I'm a very jealous person I will admit. But I have told him that I am working on it and will not blame him or be angry at him for anything out of his control. But while we were there, he made a comment about not being able to find a sexy enough Mexican milf in any pornos he watches and it just made me kind of sad because I'm the complete opposite of that. I'm pale, very petite. Anyways, the joke was made but of course I'm not going to get angry in front of everyone so i kind of just went silent and waited to go home. But he noticed and we talked about it and he said that i took the joke the wrong way. So i just dropped it. 
But then i stopped getting invited to these outings. It  didnt bother me too badly, it just made me sad being stuck in my toxic ass house for weeks at a time while I know my boyfriend was having fun and making music. And I've always loved his music so much and I love hearing him play and now I dont feel involved at all. 
But today, he told me he plans on practicing tomorrow, since they have a show on halloween, and I was cool with it. But his phone rang earlier and it was from the band group chat and someone asked if they could bring their friend and his sister and someone else in the group said ""the more the merrier"" so of course i was like ""hell yeah :))))"".
So when he came back into the room I was like, 
""Hey could I come with you to practice tomorrow?"" And he started making up excuses like ""well you probably won't have much fun"" ""hang with your sister tomorrow"" (shes in town this week) so I decided to test my theory. Does he not want to be around me? So I asked him ""it's okay if I cant, I understand y'all have a show soon and you guys dont want any distractions."" Then he acted sad and was like ""yeah sorry it's just gonna be us tomorrow :("" 
I just seriously need to know if I'm in the wrong for being upset. I dont care about him being around girls or anything, I just dont understand why one band member can invite his friend and sister but another band member cant invite his girlfriend?",07Oct2020,1
26,"So...2 weeks ago i started my 2nd year at university. It started off great, I was loving everything; the parties, hanging out with mates etc...but in my 2nd week my flatmate got a positive corona test and we all
had to isolate for 10 days. Since being in isolation i started to notice small things in myself which I hate, and then I noticed my hair is thinning at my crown. I‚Äôm only 19 so this has hit me really hard. Noticing all these small things i hate about myself and my hair thinning has led to me developing really bad anxiety. I‚Äôve had 2 panic attacks in the last week and it‚Äôs only getting worse. I can‚Äôt take my mind off it and it feels like my crown really stands out and it‚Äôs all anybody can see when they look at me. I can‚Äôt focus on any uni work, and i‚Äôm too anxious to leave my uni bedroom and go into the kitchen. The hair thinning isn‚Äôt that obvious yet (although it‚Äôs obvious to me, i can feel it too as the hair is getting thinner), and i know it‚Äôs something stupid to be getting upset over, but it‚Äôs affecting my life in such a drastic way i cant seem to cope with everyday life.

The anxiety is making me feel so down about myself; ive lost all self confidence. i‚Äôm speaking to a beautiful girl and i just can‚Äôt see how she‚Äôd see anything nice in me now. It‚Äôs such a stupid thing to be upset over but i‚Äôm honestly really struggling to cope. I‚Äôve sent my mum a text explaining things and i think i‚Äôm going to go home as soon as my isolation is over and speak to someone about it and see if there‚Äôs anything that can be done to help. I realise this isn‚Äôt the end of the world, but to me it feels like i‚Äôm losing everything. i‚Äôm sorry if i sounds pathetic, i hate the fact i‚Äôm posting this on here, but i just need to talk to people about it.

33,"Ok like I already suffer from terrible tics and spasms ever since I've been a kid and they seem to get much worse when I start causing pain from having too many tics and twitches and spasms(which are mainly from jaw clenching squeezing my eyes shut very hard literally every 3 seconds or opening them up as wide as I can because the uncontrollable urge seems to come from in my eyelids, I also have a problem of twitching my nose kind off like on bewitched to the point my nostrils get sore and scabby and irritated and even swollen also as the uncontrollable urge to keep moving my jaw and grinding my teeth and when that starts becoming painful, NOW THAT'S when shit hits the fan because I've got temporomandibular joint syndrome where i get that clicking sound in the corner of my jaw(and pain and discomfort) when I'm eating or something that involves moving the back corner of my jaw.

So to get straight to the point yes the tics and spasms are so freaking bad they cause great daily pain in my jaw my face my eyes, wherever I get bad tics and this is the worst part here the tics get even worse because I seem to be addicted to this pain caused by the tics, I feel like I'm teasing the pain like performing never ending tics to see if it will be painful,so just saying the tics get much worser when I'm in pain because I get this uncontrollable urge to see how far I can push my limits until I really get real bad pain no matter how much pain I'm in from these tics I will still do these tics mostly just to see if I get the pain from it which it usually does anyway and even though I'm in extreme pain from this i can't stop but feel I NEED the reassuraning pain in order to stop the urge to do the tics 
And at the moment I'm having jaw and nose tics RIGHT NOW as we speak and they have already started to give me great pain but as I said I can't help but have to feel that pain again and again and again and it just keeps going on all day every day!!!

New to this sub so hope my post is ok

I‚Äôve struggled with my mental health for a lot of years now, I have good times and rough times as I‚Äôm sure everyone does. 

For the past 12 months or so I‚Äôd been in a really awesome place mentally; I‚Äôd come off all my meds with the help of my doctor and everything felt pretty good. Then something happened at work and it‚Äôs knocked me completely sideways. I‚Äôve lost all sense of being good enough at work and my moods have been erratic AF. 

Past couple of days I‚Äôve swung between feeling ok and then suddenly being ‚Äúeverything is terrible and I want to die‚Äù and back again - this can happen within the space of hours and it‚Äôs pretty scary and a rough ride. 

I have a really close friend who I‚Äôve been confiding in lately and they‚Äôve been a great source of support, until now. I told them about how I‚Äôve been feeling and they‚Äôve totally ghosted me. They‚Äôve read my message but that‚Äôs it.

But it's like the thoughts just happen randomly and I say them aloud without realizing. I kinda told my therapist but I played it down... I'm worried about admitting to what I've actually been saying because again I don't think I'm actually suicidal, but for some reason I say these things out loud anyway. Also it's really hard to be honest with a therapist about this over zoom when I don't want my fianc√© to overhear me... we have a small house and he lost a sister to suicide and I just don't want to scare him. I'm really worried I'll skip and say one of these things when he's in the same room but so far I only slip when I'm alone and he's asleep, thankfully. So I tried to explain what was happening to my therapist using nicer sentences like ""I'm stupid"" but I think maybe I didn't explain it well... I feel like I'm losing control of myself and it's starting to scare me. Last night I had an urge to slap myself and I did and I don't know why I did that?! Is it possible to not realize you want to harm yourself? Can depression get to the point where I'm acting without my own consent?

Just to share about myself When I was seven years old I was stabbed in the heart by my grandma due to her having schizophrenia. I almost died 3 times. Before that my childhood was full of alcohol, abuse and neglect. I have dealt with being suicidal and depression.  For years I struggled with knowing who I was after being put in foster care and later on figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. I was angry for everything that happened to me and I had no control of. I have triggers that I have healed from and things I still deal with. I struggle with feeling safe, I have anxiety and minor things that I know how to manage now. I have done the work to get the healing I need. For many years and I can say because of that I am happy. I am in the process of being a life coach because I just want to give back and help others. My point is, is that I am a safe place. And I encourage you, even if life has made you a victim in the past...does not mean you have to stay one. You can be happy no matter what has happened to you.

This is my first ever Reddit post, so I'm not really sure what I'm doing... and to be perfectly honest I'm having a hard time even typing. I just don't know where else to go. I'm here for some advice or possibly insight?

From what I can tell I'm extremely mentally ill. I've experienced psychosis and other mental health issues for the past 6/7 years, and it has left me unable to function. I spend some days quite literally paralyzed. The severity of this constant confusion/depression gave me no option but to drop out of high school. Every day is worse than the last. I can hardly go an hour without severely dissociating from what I know to be real. Some moments it feels like I'm drowning in my thoughts, and they can be pretty nonsensical. My emotions range from overwhelming and intense to barely noticeable. Pretty much all I think about is killing myself. Every minute has began to be marked by fantasizing about how I would. The only reason I haven't is because I have a little sister, but I've nearly lost the emotional strength to hold out- even for her. It feels weird to talk about myself in this way, so I'm sorry if this comes off as self centered.

Does anybody have any insight as to what could be wrong with me? Advice on what I could do to alleviate the pain? I do not have a support system in my day to day life. All comments are appreciated no matter what.

Like I can just feel it, belly laughs and all. But so often when I meet someone, I can just feel someone having bad intentions with me, or selfish intentions if not meant to be bad.

 I'm pretty sure it's not a depression thing because I don't want to die or have suicidal thoughts. When I was younger, I really didn't care one way or another.

66,"I am here because I just need to vent a bit, I think. I just tried to turn in a long post, but my internet cut out and there it goes. I cried the whole time writing it, but now feel drained. Maybe that is better?

I know I am screwed up mentally. Everyday I find another landmine my parents or family left me. It's rare I find something positive. I will forever be grateful to my wife, for seeing something in me that is worth a relationship. I know it hasn't been easy. I vented some of the things that my family did... But does it matter what they did? The effect matters more I think.

Sorry, part of my issue is I don't feel much anymore, if I ever did. I feel love and care around my wife, but that was a while after we began dating. I enjoy solving problems and reading, but that is a mental joy at solving puzzles a form of ennui. I don't feel anything else but sadness and anger... And I haven't since I was about 8 or 9.

I am just in a state of not knowing what to do. Financially we have been screwed by 2020, and things had just begun to look up. I graduated in December, and I was looking for work. There were various delays and things got postponed... We had to move back home with my mother as she was the only relative with space for us at all. We are in a storage room and have minimal space since February.

I got deathly sick in February, and it wasn't solved until March as Covid hit; just a gall bladder issue that took a month to be recognized. We've been stuck with my... Wonderful and charming mother, since then. We are starting to reach a point we will be unable to afford to move where I find work. I don't know a way to work from home as an editor or using my English degree. I hoped we would move closer to a publishing house around May at the latest, but things have been crazy in America. I am at the point, that I feel I'm self destructing my marriage and ruining my only good relationship.

My wife, my only good and truly supportive relationship, and I have argued more in the last months than in the previous 6 years. We have recognized it as both stress and environment, but this is getting out of hand. I don't know where to go or how to cope. To others I would suggest selling any possessions to keep themselves afloat, but we are both Spartan in decorations. She makes things as her creative outlet and all she owns are tools and things she's made. I collect books, but the few I own worth something are beyond priceless to me, and not worth the emotional drain. I.e. $50 for something that carries memories of me feeling worth attention. I have a collection of video games I could sell... I don't think I'd get more than $400 from a stupid investor as they have been kept and used. I collected them to play with any future children I have. Things I wish my parents had cared about.

Even if I sold everything I had... and got lucky, I can't see us getting enough to move and afford even a hotel room long enough to get a paycheck. I suppose camping may be an option by next year... But I am nothing but frazzled trying to solve this issue. Maybe I am borrowing from the future, but I just see this as writing on the wall.",07Oct2020,1

72,"This is partially going to be a vent, but I'll get to the point in the end///

Ever since I started going to college, my mental health has been in a steep decline. I remember looking up ways to commit suicide painlessly in the waiting room of my academic counselor after I found out I got a ""C"" in Anatomy as my final grade. I tried to choke myself to death when I failed a midterm in Microbiology. I'm trying to get into the nursing program, but I've been rejected two times. As a result, I took a short CNA semester class over the next summer. 

My CNA instructor gave a lesson about suicide and how certain methods of suicide isn't serious and that they were just seeking attention, such as the slitting your wrists horizontally or vertically debate. I dunno why, but it kinda set me off a few months afterwards because it made me wonder if my past attempts could be seen as attention seeking and if I need to go harder so people won't think I'm some sort of childish, attention seeking, dumbass wasting everyone's time and money. My instructor also said that people who commit suicide are selfish, and it still kinda haunts me. I think about suicide at least once a week ever since I became a CNA. I know that some people will miss me, but sometimes I feel like I'm sinking further and further down into a pitch black ocean with no light in sight so I don't know what to do. 

Every time I talk to people in major, I feel like an idiot. I know I don't belong here, but I have no choice. If I don't become a nurse like my parents wants me to be, my dad might commit suicide and I'll destroy whatever hope/joy my mom has left inside her. My classmates thinks I'm stupid, my CNA teacher thinks I'm a useless moron, and I for sure know I'm an idiot. I'm just stuck here now. I don't even know if I want to do this anymore. 

I recognize that I need to talk to a therapist, but my parents don't believe that mental health is real and if I bring up that I might have depression, my parents will tell me that I have no right to be depressed because they lived through the Khmer Rouge, don't even know if all their family is alive, and that I'm being childish and lazy. Not only that, but if I somehow manage to get to talk to a therapist, I'm scared of being institutionalized. I'd talk to the suicide hotline, but I heard the stories of cops being called and busting into your house if you seem suicidal at the moment. I don't want to leave my house.

The fact that no one knew me before played a big role in my well-being. Everything was new. I can finally be far from everything that has a link with my chaotic life. 

When I failed, my depression got worse, I‚Äôve never felt that low in my life, even after someone I loved passed away. But I could have been able to begin everything again.

77,"Grew up on a dysfunctional family. You can go through some of my older posts if you‚Äôd like to here more. Basically I was homeschooled but not really taught anything and pretty isolated. I had behavioral issues as a kid, swearing, not listening, not wanting to go to bed on time, acting like a dog, throwing things, getting into things, demanding things, getting my little brother to also act up, lying. Ect. And was hypersexual by age 6.

Some bad things I did 
Grew knife at my older sister while she was holding my younger brother when I was like 2
Bit my sister in the stomach because she wouldn‚Äôt pick me up 
Did sexual things towards animals
Abused animals 
Worst was between ages 6-11 doing sexual things with my younger brother off and on worst was when I was when he was 9 and I was 11 and penetration happened
I‚Äôve always talked back, didn‚Äôt want to listen been really lazy, wanted things my way.

As a kid I would cry for my older sister who was more like a mom to me an my actual mom
Cried during white fang 
Cried over some kids books involving animals 
Cried over a intendo ds dog game that had the dog leave at the end 

I think I‚Äôm a born female psychopath.

I‚Äôm currently 24 and getting older seems scary and like something I can‚Äôt handle. My head is never clear. I constantly ask myself what‚Äôs the point of living. I‚Äôm chronically bored and so messed up. I cry often and out to others. I constantly think about how and when I will die. I barely do anything for myself and it‚Äôs like as soon as I wake up I just lay there with a sick feeling not wanting to move or be conscious. I really don‚Äôt see how this could ever get better.

They get to feel butterflies in their chest as they spend time with the one they love. They get to feel happy. They feel wanted. I feel none of these things. I know that I'm not destined to be alone. But man, it really feels like that sometimes. Endless nights laying in an empty bed, waking up with no text notifications on my phone, no girlfriend telling me that they hope I have a great day, none of that. My life is completely devoid of intimacy, and it has frozen my heart almost completely. In a way, I feel starved of human touch, I feel like something is missing. But here's the scariest part of all this:

I *know* that being in a relationship won't mend me. I know exactly what would happen. It would feel incredible for the first week or so, but eventually, I would end up feeling just as shitty as before. Nothing will change. But it's easy to hope that one thing will fix it all.

83,"Hello All, I don't really know how to start this. We'll start with formalities. Hi, I'm 18 years old. I'm not gonna say my name. Uhhhh I guess I'm just depressed. I feel empty most of the time and things and people that used to cheer me up, don't anymore. I don't feel like I'm here anymore either. I feel like I'm just floating watching myself. The only thing I feeling I feel so strongly now is nostalgia. I wish I could just go back to when things weren't so bad. The thing is that everything, all these negative feelings, came crashing down on me. I think it began when I started remembering all the repressed memories. I forgot about them for a while and one night they just came to visit me again. I was sexually abused by a cousin when I was about 6 years old. After that......I'm getting embarrassed just writing about it. Well afterwards, I started having sexual intrusive thoughts of many people who shouldn't be the subject of sexual thoughts. It wasn't just sexual intrusive thoughts, but just intrusive thoughts in general. They make me feel like a bad person. The way it happens is like two people talking, but one says something horrible and the other one then begins scolding the other person saying that they shouldn't have said that. I don't know how to explain it. The way I dealt with this was through escapism. One thing I am proud of myself of possessing is my imagination. So I used it and started creating fake scenarios lasting all night and then they began to last all day and eventually I lived my life as if I was in that reality. I couldn't walk into a room without putting on my desired character from whichever scenario I had created. One thing about me is that I don't know how to talk. I stutter and I look around everywhere except the person who I'm talking to. I know it sounds dumb, but it makes me feel like shit. It makes me think that ill never get to establish a real connection with anyone. It makes me feel alone. I become awkward with even those who are close to me. And slowly I start to isolate myself and it extends to some time of me not reaching out or answering messages. I've lost a few friends because of this. I wish i could tell them that I did care, but that I needed that time for myself. It makes me sound selfish. I'm just a bit of a introvert. Well now that you know this, let me bring you to my present time. Now as I'm writing this. Well, I feel empty and I kind of wish a car would hit me while I'm crossing the street.  I feel like a fraud because nobody knows who I am really. I feel, I'm sorry if this makes me sound selfish, but I feel like I go out of my way for others, but nobody does the same for me. I feel immense pressure because my family refers to me as the glue of this family and I'm scared that if I leave, my family will disintegrate. Everyday i feel as if something bad is going to happen and my heart begins to pound too fast and i feel like throwing up. Well basically I just feel on edge every single day. I just want peace. I just want to go to sleep at 9 pm without a single worry, instead of at 4 am with all my worries clouding my head. Well I'm gonna be honest actually, I just want to die. And If I keep feeling like this, then eventually I will take my life. I really don't look forward to the future at all or what it'll bring. I might just be in the moment, but I think nothing grand will ever happen to me. I'll probably just live a boring life with nothing to look forward to. Anyways that's it. I just wanted to get this off my chest.

88,"I (20F) just transferred to university after 2 years of community college and I was looking so forward to making new friends and actually getting to connect with others. Now all of my classes are remote and I'm still at home living with my parents.

I've always been better at talking and being friendly with others in person so I don't know how I'm going to make friends online. I only have one friend that I talk to regularly but our friendship has more to do with us being friends for so long and not that we have a lot of interests in common so her friendship isn't fulfilling enough to combat my loneliness if that makes sense. 

It's also hasn't even been a full week of classes and I'm already stressed out about learning and remembering everything I need to so I can do well in my classes and hopefully get into my major next quarter.

To top it all off, my relationship with my mom hasn't been great lately and it's getting and will probably continue to get worse while I'm stuck at home instead of being at an apartment like I was supposed to before the pandemic. 

All of this combined has made my depression come back full force. Yesterday I had a small yelling match with my mom about how we don't have respect for one another (I didn't say I was perfect, she gets mad when I don't clean when she tells me to) and how I don't feel like she loves me. I cried and full-on sobbed on like 15 separate occasions every time I thought about how she doesn't seem to care about me and I haven't talked to her since. My dad doesn't know about anything because he was on a walk when we fought.

Typically I turn to reading, listening to music, or watching youtube videos and while it helps distract, my chest still feels heavy and it feels like my usual coping strategies aren't working as much as they used to. I was hoping to start eating healthier and exercising this quarter but my depression and stress are causing me to stress eat unhealthy stuff and just sit in bed. The light at the end of the tunnel is looking so dim and far off. I don't know what to do and my hope for the better isn't strong.

I know it's unlikely that someone is going to read this but I feel like I just needed to let it all out somewhere.

TL;DR Feeling lonely from lack of friends, stressed from online classes, and relationship with mom isn't great atm. Struggling with depression again and finding it hard to cope. Just wanted to let it all out.",07Oct2020,1
89,"Let's start the story, the way that I start imagining I'm some kind of God is by spinning around and listening to music, yes I would spin my body for something even hours on end without stopping because it fueled my desire to be a supreme being. I would imagine myself as a all powerful being who stopped war and famine all across and it is very cringe and embrassing when I look back at it. I also keep on browsing and googling issue that someone my age shouldn't be focus to like religious war and politics, it just make my head hurt so much. I kept hearing from the religious people how they are superior and let listening to atheist on why they are better, it just makes my head hurt. I know it doesn't effect me personally but the thought that it happens to someone else just make my head hurt so much that I skipped school on multiple occasions, sometime weeks on end. Please help me, I recently discovered a passion toward art but couldn't focus properly sue to this. Adding to that my Muslim friends and family are becoming more and more radical by the day, it just makes me so angry at how racist, homophobic and xenophobic they are.

90,"I recently went through a personal tragedy that led to total annihilation of my social standing and image. This came with a lot of social isolation  but a few people stuck around, one of them is my ex and her friend. Basically, it was due to things I said and did when I was 16-17 of age, now being 21 it all resurfaced but somehow my ex is making this personal tragedy all about her, how it affected her being associated with me and despite public pressure she is associating with me, that I should be grateful. She has brought up things from our relationship in context of my past (I dated her last year, ending it before everything went to shit, she didn't even know me back then), I didn't ask for her support nor did I ask for any sort of association, making it all about herself, asking for accountability and reminding me how painful it was for seems disingenuous and she keeps bringing this up again and again without any consideration about how it makes me feel, it's about how she felt. I wanted her to stop talking to me and told her straight up about how I felt about the situation and blocked her from my social media. Now her friend is saying I'm perceiving things wrong and that her intentions are in the right place but it feels dishonest to say the very least, that blocking her was ""really wrong and that she's hurt"".

Also TL;DR. Prepare for a rant. 

Hello everyone. I don't post here often, but I wanted to immediately report on a very difficult last couple of days that I had in regards to my mental health...specifically, OCD-related issues. My goal here is to both encourage people to stay positive during hard times, as well as to remind those of us who have had experience coping with our issues to keep on it.

I also wanted to be a little humble, as I have frequently given people my own perspective on how to deal with intrusive thoughts, and after this little stint of mine, I now believe that I never gave the matter enough weight. I apologize for this and will be more open-minded and empathetic in the future. 

Anyway, it all started randomly before bed on Sunday. I was coming back upstairs and saw my beloved dog waiting for me on the top of the stairs. Then, boom, I was hit with a particularly horrific intrusive thought (it still makes me tear up thinking about it sometimes). I haven't had a particularly bad reaction to an IT in years; in fact, it had been so long since I truly freaked out over one that I couldn't remember how much time had passed since my last episode, and I was convinced that I had mastered them. 

Then, that night, it was as if I was in the throes of a PTSD flashback. I holed up and panicked, meanwhile freaking my dog out. I should have called out of work the next day, because yesterday morning I got on post, and basically started to cry and fighting panic. Ended up asking if I could go home and I was allowed to take a sick day (my workplace was awesome, by the way. I couldn't have asked for more help and support), and basically just went home and cried for 3 or 4 hours and attempted but failed to take a nap. 

My wife was truly my guardian angel, too, as before bed that night we talked about everything that happened and she reminded me about the reality of life and death and being out of control in every way, but never judged me and helped pull me back together. If it wasn't for my wife and her love, I promise that I would still be a sobbing wreck sitting here after calling out of work a second day in a row. 

That said, I was able to go into work today; did get teary eyed to and at work at times, but otherwise it was a much better morning. Everyone was awesome; it's just that my job, for now, is very, very slow and I am bogged down by other stressors in life...so I think everything came together to just reinvigorate my OCD. 

Still, I had never imagined that last weekend is when I would relapse with an extreme OCD episode. Overall, I have learned a lot from it, and am still struggling quite a bit...but doing well for the most part, and just seeing how to approach this sort of situation going forward. 

 Thank you!",07Oct2020,1

I have entire separate lives that I keep boxed up and separated. For one example, I can‚Äôt under any circumstances begin to bring myself to tell my parents about my partner, and I don‚Äôt think I can have him meet them.

I guess I‚Äôm venting because it haunts me every night, I literally don‚Äôt sleep because of it, I have headaches over it, it makes me cry and sob but I hide it from my parents, and it drives me to be constantly unsatisfied in my relationship, where I live, and affects my job.

98,"So, I have a small favor to ask. Out of the blue tonight, I decided to write a book/diary on what its like to live with a mental illness. If anyone of you would like to be interviewed or put your input in the comments below I would truly appreciate it (if interview PM me). I understand that this is a super sensitive question to ask, and I‚Äôm not trying to force anyone because I understand it can be super hard to talk about, but I would love to let people know who don‚Äôt live with a mental illness what its like to live with one. I do have anxiety, but I want to leave my personal bias out of this as much as possible.

ever since i was a kid i‚Äôve had the feeling that i‚Äôm meant for huge things and i never knew what that meant or what i would be doing. i just had the feeling. i lived in a small town up until my mother moved out of state. i didn‚Äôt go with her but eventually i made the decision to go. she has had a lot of piece of shit men in her life. that also affected me. the reason she moved was because of a man who i won‚Äôt name. anyway, i moved there. i lived there for 2 years. i dropped out of high school. lost my mind. grew hatred for myself. got diagnosed with bipolar disorder, panic disorder, and anxiety. i ended up running away and going back to my dads in the small town. i worked my ass off, saved money, bought a car, got a girlfriend. eventually we broke up and i met another girl. we ended up breaking up, i was lost. i quit my job. started stealing. got caught in the act. house was raided. guns, drugs, money, etc. this was a year ago. i never was charged but i want to be. i want to be rid of this guilt. i am a piece of shit. i have changed my entire life around, but i still did it. i still made those choices. during the time i was stealing i had another girlfriend. one who i got pregnant and we lost the baby. then we broke up. my life just feels like a movie and i don‚Äôt know where to go or what to do. i know this post is all over the place. i‚Äôm sorry. i‚Äôm at rock bottom with no idea on where to go or what to do. i make music now. i try to tell all of these stories but my life is such a cluster fuck i don‚Äôt know where to turn. i recently got a new job. i start this week. can i come back from this? should i end my life? should i continue? should i overcome all of this and get famous? what the hell do i do. please help me. i‚Äôm sorry for the low detail, i really don‚Äôt know where to turn. i‚Äôd love personal conversations but comments are perfectly fine. please :(",07Oct2020,1

102,"For reference, I'm 13 and from England. About a year ago I started having mild suicidal thoughts and getting a bit depressed but I just ignored it.

Only to be met with the response 'you're 13, how can you be depressed' and my mum said once you get back to school you'll be so much better don't worry.

Well, now I'm back at school, and surprise surprise its the worst its ever been. I'm incredibly depressed, I  been driven to self-harm and I have frequent suicidal thoughts. I also think I may have anxiety but I don't say that I do have depression or anxiety because I'm not diagnosed by a professional.

103,"Hello. Sorry if I seem a little closed off... I usually only talk to my friends about this. I‚Äôve recently been going to therapy. It‚Äôs okay and it helps but sometimes I want to hurt myself. Mostly slamming my head against the wall lightly kind of hurting myself I guess. Sometimes I feel like I want to be put in a mental hospital because of how bad I‚Äôve been neglecting my needs. I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed with anything and my parents refuse that me as a child seeming them yell at eachother and hit eachother hasn‚Äôt affected me. I recently got yelled at by my father. I don‚Äôt remember much of what he said besides ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your fucking problem why isn‚Äôt your work turned in‚Äù (referring to me not doing my work because many of my friends have been self harming and having attempts so I‚Äôve been really unmotivated) I remember he said to stop putting my friends over my work and that I ‚Äúneed to focus on what really matters.‚Äù

It‚Äôs like my mental health means nothing to him. My therapist says I might be unmotivated because I tend to try to cater to my friends needs because I‚Äôm afraid if I don‚Äôt they‚Äôll leave.
I have a lot of trauma, it just really hurts to have them say that I‚Äôm just a hypochondriac and that I‚Äôm just anxious. Because I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôve tried to get therapy for years and my mother only put me in therapy when I said it‚Äôs the only thing I want for my birthday.

I hope I get diagnosed soon so I can start trying to heal better and someone finally admitting that something is wrong. I wish I could get an understanding of myself but it‚Äôs like everytime I do it‚Äôs not who I am, it‚Äôs like every time I try to admit something is wrong I doubt it. 
I

I have trauma from a lot of things that would take too long to get into, I‚Äôve been emotionally abused a lot in my past and sexually assaulted and groomed so now I‚Äôm afraid of love. 
I‚Äôm dating someone at the moment and I trust him so I‚Äôm starting to try and re-write what my brain has learned. Some days I love him to death and wanna be with him forever but sometimes it‚Äôs like I want to push him away, I know he loves me and I know he cares yet I feel afraid of him. I don‚Äôt know why, honestly. It‚Äôs terrifying to feel love for the first time since I tend to attach myself to people. 
I just wish I knew what I needed to correct and how to work on it so bad but I only have therapy once a week, it‚Äôs a nightmare.

I would tell my therapist about the thoughts of me wanting to hurt myself (slamming my head against the wall and throwing myself on the floor, I already bully myself a lot mentally.)
It‚Äôs been like this since I was 11 or 12. I had my hopeful period and I believed in myself but now I believe I was just dissociated. I don‚Äôt remember a thought from that time besides basic thoughts like ‚Äúwe should dance to this,‚Äù or ‚Äúgo eat/ shower‚Äù
My therapist doesn‚Äôt deal with these kinds thoughts and I think it‚Äôs taking a toll. I black out randomly sometimes and collapse on the floor from being so weak. I feel like my dad is gonna hell at me any minute, I feel like I don‚Äôt even deserve food sometimes. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong, I hate it. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm looking at a fogged mirror towards my problems. I can see why they happened but most times I don‚Äôt see what part of life they affect or what the problem is causing me mentally. My parents liked to call me disgusting for neglecting my physical health around 13 or 12. I really wish I could help myself.


I‚Äôm sorry if this was all over the place, there‚Äôs so many thoughts in my mind and so many things to do that lately I‚Äôve just been stressing out and shutting down. I‚Äôd like to hear what you have to saw about this. Thank you for reading.",07Oct2020,1
104,"To preface this I want to say that I‚Äôm currently going through the process of finding out if I have adhd so will bring this up with my psychiatrist, but I was hoping to gain some info on what I‚Äôm going through as from what I‚Äôve seen it doesn‚Äôt seem to be related to the possible adhd diagnosis.

I have trouble dealing with other people‚Äôs emotions. Now, I have the full range of emotions, so I understand why people have emotions, I just don‚Äôt know how to respond or care about other people having these emotions. I don‚Äôt know if this is a lack of sympathy, empathy, both, or even something else. 

For example; say someone is going through a break up. I know that I would be so upset if I was going through that, and I care about this person very much, but I can‚Äôt bring myself to care about what they‚Äôre going through. I know that I need to fake caring and being supportive, but it‚Äôs almost annoying that they‚Äôre being emotional. I know I sound like a selfish asshole and I really wish I could care but I just don‚Äôt?

I don‚Äôt know what sympathy and empathy are, from what I understand I have empathy because I know that I would hate to be in that situation, but do I have sympathy because I know to reassure people?

108,"Imma dive right into it. 

I‚Äôve stolen over an ounce of weed from almost all of the members living in my fraternity house over 3 months . I had a routine for each room specifically, knowing when to enter, where it was, and how much to take. I would have a list and rotate between rooms, kinda like a game. But hey it‚Äôs not my fault, I can‚Äôt be spending too much money on weed. 

When they would go out to bars, I would tell them I would follow them in 20 minutes, just to find one of their empty rooms and steal a few beers or pour some vodka into my bottle for some free shit. 

I would stay up till 2 am until everyone was sleep so I could go down to the fridge and take some food. Sometimes small, sometimes sandwiches on a good day. It‚Äôs a free meal. 

Fortunately for me, there was another brother who got caught red-handed stealing once, so every time something goes missing, I never worried about being suspected. For the most part, I took optimal amounts. Enough to not need to steal for another few days, but not enough where it was noticeable every time. 

More examples, 

A couple of years ago I‚Äôd use my roommate‚Äôs credit card on Uber and EatStreet without his knowledge. He asked me and I said no idea , ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even use Uber bro, Lyft gang here!‚Äù I also took his entire CBD bottle, and blamed it on drunk people stealing it at our party. 

While in quarantine with my four friends. I told them I am not smoking weed anymore. However, every time they would go to bed and leave the weed bag outside, I would have to take a few hits. Or maybe take a few beers from the fridge every few days. I would also tell them I do not want to pay for groceries since I am ‚Äúfine on my own‚Äù and make myself free meals at night when all went to bed. 

When I was in charge of door for my fraternity parties, I would tell people to Venmo my personal account for entry, and took a neat 15% and transferred the remaining to my fraternity social Venmo. 

While I was ordering McDonalds on my friend‚Äôs phone, I went to his Venmo app and cancelled a few of the requests he sent me, and then deleted the confirmation emails. 

I took $150 from my dad in 6th grade so I could go on a shopping spree afterschool in Candylicious, a popular candy store. 

I pretended to be sick in 5th grade P.E so I could sit on the bench, and sneak into the locker room to steal one of the other kids‚Äô best football trading card, which was the only one at the school. Since I knew they would lock down the locker room to see who took it, it was in my placed in my shoe nicely. 

In 7th grade, I literally stole a PSP from my friend who lived abroad in the Middle East. Since I knew we would not keep in contact, it was a very easy opportunity. Why did I do it? Well, what if my main PSP ran out of charge? 

I‚Äôve stolen at least one thing from virtually every person I know. Whether it be money, weed, booze, something of value I want. 

And this is just the stealing.... now the lying. Since the post is getting long, I‚Äôll try to sum fast. Things I‚Äôve lied about. 

-My high school friends (grew up in Middle East) think I was born in the USA and have an American passport, and that my dad moved there in the 90‚Äôs and came back. Also, 
my College friends (In the US) think I am actually from Abu Dhabi/Dubai, but in reality I only grew up there and my parents are Lebanese. 

-All my high school friends think my fraternity is insanely cool. But that‚Äôs how I make it out to be. In reality, it‚Äôs pretty nerdy and parties rarely happen, and I didn‚Äôt wanna join, looking back. 

-I‚Äôve lied about my lifting stats, about PED usage, about my GPA to my parents, and hidden my daily booze binge from people. 

Why do I lie? So people think my life is actually better and easier than it really is. So I don‚Äôt have to face any wrong, which I have rarely made anyway. 

Out of all those instances, I have felt bad one and only one time. The $150 Candylicious spending spree was not worth it and my father was struggling financially at the time. 

There is so much more I want to delve in regarding childhood, but I will leave it at that.

A few days ago I had a dream where I had a group of 5 friends. We had a lot of fun together. I fell in love with one of them and we started dating. We went for vacations and hung out together.

I've had these kind if dreams in the past, just not so vivid, so as all of this was unfolding I had a feeling that it was a dream. My in-dream girlfriend even reminded me that this time I'm not in a dream. I was convinced and I was having the best time of my life. And then I woke up. Everything, everyone just gone.

I thought I would just forget it ever happened, but it's been almost one week and I just can't. I even call out her name sometimes thinking that she's there only to be reminded that it's not real. 

Please help me, I feel like complete shit. I'm feeling really depressed and no matter how hard I try I can't forget them and the stuff we did together.",07Oct2020,1
120,"Hey y‚Äôall this is my first time posting anything like this. I just want to vent to a safe community and to people who get it. 
I‚Äôm a stay at home mom. I absolutely adore my daughter and my husband. 5 months ago my whole family packed up and moved to another state. (My husbands in the military) Before we moved I had a really awesome job, good friends who I‚Äôve known for years, a lot of family, and a babysitter so I would be able to work. I was incredibly happy and I loved my home state. I was finally really recovering and feeling better. I‚Äôm diagnosed with depression, anxiety, substance disorder, and ptsd. I met my husband 2 years ago and while I agree we moved really fast, I‚Äôm happy that I‚Äôm married to him and that we have a beautiful family. He‚Äôs great and supportive and tries to understand my mental health the best that he can. When we found out we were moving, I was excited and terrified at the same time. 
We move and are living on a military base. It‚Äôs a really nice place and for the most part I‚Äôm impressed with my living situation/house. There‚Äôs a lot of bugs which make me really uncomfortable but I make the best of it. As we settle in more, I meet the neighbors and people around base. They‚Äôre absolutely horrible people. A lot of our neighbors are 10-15 years older then us and we feel as if we‚Äôre being judged by our neighbors because my husband hasn‚Äôt been in the military as long as they have. So we keep to our selves for the most part. That‚Äôs really difficult for me because I haven‚Äôt been able to make any friends. Every time I try and reach out to someone and try and create a friendship, it‚Äôs either a mlm scheme, they‚Äôre rude and judgmental, or plans fall through and we never meet up. I try and stay in contact with my friends home but I know they‚Äôre really busy and have their own lifes.
My husband has been working extremely long hours. I get to see him for maybe a hour or 2 a night and then he goes to bed because he has to get up really early in the morning. That leaves me taking care of our kid all day every day. (I‚Äôm aware that the military life is the life I signed up for but saying that doesn‚Äôt make it any easier.) While I love my kid, I would love to be able to have a hobby, have some time to myself, and be my own person. Recently it feels like my only personality trait is the fact that I‚Äôm a mom. 
As stated above a struggle with a substance abuse problem. I got clean almost 2 1/2 years ago. Where I‚Äôm living, meetings aren‚Äôt happening in person. Meetings are a big way for me to make friends and reach out and build a community and a support system. With how everything is going on in my life, I‚Äôve even struggling and having some really strong urges to pick up again and I really don‚Äôt want to do that. Along with my urges to use, I‚Äôve been feeling like I may need more psychiatric help then what I‚Äôm receiving right now. What I‚Äôm feeling like I need, is not possible to do because that would mean I‚Äôd leave my daughter and my husband is not able to take the time off. I just feel like I‚Äôm trapped and stuck in a loop of doing the same thing every single day. I‚Äôm extremely unhappy.
Anyways, thank you for taking time to read my rant. Even if no one responds to me, it‚Äôs really nice just getting all of my emotions and feelings out there.",07Oct2020,1

127,"Disclaimer: I'm not claiming to have anything I don't. I have PTSD, but that's it.

Trigger warning: mention of suicidal thoughts, mention of someone using slurs that aren't theirs to reclaim.

I feel trapped in my mind and thoughts. I try to be optimistic, I try to think positively about myself, but I can't. I don't understand why this is so hard for me. I only see everything wrong with everything I do. I never have motivation or inspiration no matter how creative I'm feeling or how much I want to write or make a story. I even lied to my therapist when she asked me if I had any suicidal thoughts because I felt like she'd judge me or be disappointed because I got so far than spiraled back down. I feel like I'm being way to overdramatic. I constantly question everything I do and everyone I'm around. I only ever focus on how I failed, and not how I could get any better. Even though I always go to sleep anywhere from 7-9 pm but mostly no later and mostly closer to 9 pm, I always wake up anywhere from 1-6 am, and can't fall back asleep. This morning I woke up at 1:20 am and right now for me it's 4:40 and I still haven't gotten any more sleep. I also have school at 8:39.
I've been so, so forgetful. I'll think about something highly important or interesting, look at something, even if it's plain like a literal white wall, and forget every single thing about what I was thinking about. Am I insane, or is this normal? Is something wrong with me?
My cishet white parents really like to say things such as ""what's up ma n*****"" to friends, or, ""imma go smoke a f**"" (we're not from the place that that's normal, which I forgot the name of) and such.

128,"First time poster, so forgive me. Also on mobile. This is really long so I apologize... I just have a lot going on. 

Hello, I am a 23f with a mental illness history of Manic Bipolar, Depression, Generalized Anxiety and PTSD. I have been in and out of therapist offices since I convinced my mom my depression was serious after 4 years of self harm(age 17. Clean since the week after my 21st birthday!) I was in counceling up until the Virus started in March, but they moved it to telephone calls and I personally was not comfortable with that for anxiety and in general privacy issues, so therefore they discharged me from their practice. So my only support through this has been my boyfriend, who is truly a saint but does not quite know how to help with my lows and anxiety. 

I have ALWAYS been scared of not being able to have children, different issues with my period made me paranoid this would be an issue. So in June and my right ovary somehow grew a cyst that burst, and the male OBGYN i DID NOT WANT(PTSD from sexual assaults) but had no choice in having told me this seriously impacted my chances of children. I lost it. THEN I developed Colitis last month, which if i get a reoccurance could lead to Chrohns or Ulcerative Colitis. (but supposedly no cyst in right ovary, just enlarged and that could be causing my pain) So far of what I read, it is possible, but hard to have kids with this. And then to top it all off, last night I had another hospital trip that resulted in me finding out my ovarian cyst was hemmoraging(AFTER being told it might be Crohns or UC on admittance, which led to a panic attack while everyone could see me because of lack of beds). 

At this point, its been four months of pain and overwhelming anxiety about whats going on with me and if I am going to be able to do the one thing I want in life(have kids). My boyfriend and I had agreed to try when I got better in case of my cyst reoccurring...obviously it didn't happen. Just popped again so who knows how much of a chance I have now. The OBGYN office is calling me tomorrow for my appointment so hopefully Ill get some answers but in general... Im terrified. Im constantly having anxiety attacks throughout the day because I start to think about this and what my life is and may be looking like the rest of my life. I'm in general having massive anxieties about doctors and hospitals and all the scary what ifs. 

I took two DBT classes with my two therapists, and in general have tried to build coping mechanisms and they aren't working because I cant seem to calm down. The only slight relief is my prescription of Xanax but it only does so much. I know the rest is on me to handle, Im just having a really hard time figuring out a mindset to spin this to help my anxiety like I was taught by my therapists. I know this is long, and everywhere, so thank you if you've read this far, and thank you so much for any advice anybody could give me.",07Oct2020,1
129,"Heya. I'm a 23 year old who's been in mental health care for the last ten years. my diagnoses were just updated so we're talking ADHD, PTSD, BPD, OCD and generalized anxiety disorder. My medications are: 300 mg seroquel prolong at night and 18mg concerta in the morning.

My doctor started me on a new med, trintellix, last week so I have been taking it for 6 days now.

I am constantly so afraid my muscles lock up. I live alone but have to hold a knife at all times because I feel like there's someone behind my shower curtain, there's someone under my bed, I can't turn my back to a room without almost starting to cry, I can't look into mirrors or open the curtains because I feel like people would watch me. If I have to do something besides sit on my bed so I can see the whole room (and I still feel like there's someone under my bed) I run and swipe the knife around so no one can get me. I can barely sleep with the lights on. It seems to get worse with caffeine and nicotine.

130,"I find that a good percentage of my anxiety and frustration comes from the feeling that my friends, colleagues and family can't resist giving me totally useless and often badly thought out advice.

I've tried to explain to people that no amount of positive thinking helps me to overcome a depression, that even trying to think positively is like trying to piss into a gale force wind. That yes, I did think about getting a regular routine, but my brain won't shut off because it's touching a pillow and weather I'm reading, listening to an audio book, walking the streets or snuggled up in bed, my brain will decide when it's going to let me sleep. No, I don't need my fucking Chakras cleansed and my star sign has nothing to do with my condition.

It's hard to keep being gracious and not seem like an ungrateful asshole. But most of this advice implies that they think I have never considered all of my options before, or that I'm simply not trying hard enough, or that I'm akin to a petulant child who just doesn't want to get better.

How do you explain to your wife or best friend who is just trying desperately to help you that they are just making everything worse? I've tried using those exact words to avoid confusion and it never ends well.  It's almost like them trying to help is more about them making themslves feel better than helping you, and now you've taken it away from them  you are the asshole.

She has revealed she is very sad sometimes and cuts herself, probably once a month.

Recently, she‚Äôs shared an account with me as the only follower and the whole account is dedicated to how bad she is.

The whole account is filled with posts about how much she hates herself, how ugly she is, how she wants to end it and how she can‚Äôt take it much longer.

She hasn‚Äôt posted on there in months but she sometimes tells me how she is still extremely sad and today asked me my thoughts on self harm and suicide and wrote my a paragraph on how much she hates herself.

She‚Äôs amazing to everyone else and very pretty yet she thinks so badly of herself. She‚Äôs been bullied in the past and been betrayed by two people who she‚Äôs called her friends and has a hard time opening up to others.

138,"I‚Äôm 18F, and I think I‚Äôm a toxic person.

I wasn‚Äôt popular growing up. I was bullied and alone from kindergarten - grade 1. I went to a small Christian school, then switched to a bigger public school for grade 2. I quickly became friends with a girl, Mandy. Mandy was overweight and wanted to be my friend because I was ‚Äúpretty.‚Äù I specifically remember this one day we were sitting in the grass at recess while I made her a flower crown out of dandelions. I put it on her and she looked at me and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never had a friend as nice and pretty as you.‚Äù We were best friends until grade 4, when I met another girl who I liked better. (Becca.) One day I just walked up to Mandy and told her I thought she was annoying, and I didn‚Äôt want her around me.

Becca and I are still friends. Over the years we‚Äôve cycled multiple third girls in and out of our group. First was in grade 7, when the girl was our ‚Äúbestie‚Äù for the year but eventually she pissed me off and I cut her off entirely. Next was grade 8/9, when we had a new third girl. She was overweight and had a very annoying/grating personality. I felt better about myself around her because she was overweight, and her personality made me look mature. I knew she had bad things going on at home but I really didn‚Äôt care. I kind of thought of her as the backup in the group. In reality, Becca was spending more time with her than with me and I took it out on the other girl. She moved after grade 9 and I cut contact.

In grade 9 I reconnected with a former friend from elementary school at a youth group. (Hanna.) In elementary school, I met her on my first day. She sat on the bus with another girl who I liked better, so I just kicked Hanna out and convinced the other girl to do the same. When we reconnected, I saw we had both gained some weight. (She was always chubby as a child, I was always skinny but had gone up to about 150 lbs in grade 9 because of an eating disorder.)

I do this thing subconsciously when I meet new people. If they‚Äôre skinnier or prettier than me, I feel inferior and they usually end up being the ‚Äúdominant‚Äù one in the friendship. (Like Becca.) If I feel like I‚Äôm better looking than them, I‚Äôm the dominant one. (Like Hanna.)

Basically whenever I hung out with Hanna, my personality felt different. I was more outgoing, more flirty with guys, and just more ‚Äúpopular acting‚Äù than normal. Because of this Hanna tended to be shy and quiet and listened to what i said. I had another acquaintance at school who was the same. Hanna and I both play the violin and are good at it, but she‚Äôs extremely competitive and it would often drive me insane. She would talk about how her lessons were more expensive than mine, or that she was going to make a career out of it and I wasn‚Äôt. I genuinely didn‚Äôt care about any of it. We went to different schools, so I would completely trash talk her to Becca and others at school about how she was ‚Äúpretentious‚Äù and ‚Äúfull of herself.‚Äù

Now that I‚Äôve graduated, I don‚Äôt see people as often anymore. (Especially because of covid.) I do miss Becca, but I don‚Äôt miss Hanna at all since she‚Äôs gone to college. (I‚Äôm taking a year off.) The only reason why I would want to hang out with her would be to feel superior again. Her parents are strictly against drinking, tattoos, etc and she‚Äôs very ‚Äúgood girl‚Äù Christian. I‚Äôve sort of lost my belief in religion these past few years. I could tell it made Hanna feel insecure when I showed her a new tattoo I got or talked about times I went out with friends, which made me want to do it more.

The other time my personality got ugly was before schools shut down. I had dated this guy (Derek) a couple years back, but we broke up. Last year we had some exchange students from Italy and he got really close with one of the girls. She flirted with every guy but never when they were all together. I deeply disliked her even though I had no interest in getting back together with Derek. So I started ‚Äúbefriending‚Äù her. We paired together for projects and other things, and I started talking to Derek again (which caused him to ignore her for a little while.) I added her on Snapchat so I could see if she was staying at home or going out on the maps, and I sat near her to hear if she was talking about or to him. Overall I just interfered with shit a lot.

I absolutely was not one of the popular girls in high school. We had a group of them, pretty stereotypical with the popular girl theme. I‚Äôm not overly attractive or ugly, I was just one of the background people that everyone knew to some degree. (Small school.)

I‚Äôve been thinking about this for awhile and I‚Äôm realizing I‚Äôm a toxic person. Everyone I pulled into my friend group either ended up getting kicked out/banished, or got accused of something and was cut off by the school as a whole. I really didn‚Äôt give a damn about any of them, except for Becca. I could care less what happens to them. The majority I can‚Äôt even remember their birthday or favourite colour. I only seem to make friends so I can get something out of it. I don‚Äôt really feel either bad or good about realizing I‚Äôm being toxic, it‚Äôs more just a feeling of ‚Äúoh, ok that makes sense.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm genuinely a good friend to Becca, and care deeply about her. I also care deeply about my family. It‚Äôs just people who come into my life, and I see as temporary or for gain that this happens to.",07Oct2020,1

I've told her about what I've been emotionally going through for the last 7 years and my father actually told her to kick me out for trying to make up excuses and that 'it couldn't be that bad' if I waited this long to tell her.

141,"21F. A few days ago I decided to skip class for the first time this semester and sleep in. When I went to sleep I dreamed that I could predict people‚Äôs deaths. When I woke up, I found out that my prof had cancelled class anyway on the one day I skipped. I laughed and thought it was a nice coincidence. 

It‚Äôs been three days, and everytime I‚Äôve slept since then, I‚Äôve dreamed about family members dying, usually my mom + extended family. Like I literally just woke up from a dream where my sister murdered my mom and aunt and decided to make this post. 

The reason I think this might be my depression is because when I get really low I often dream about myself or others dying. I dream about death fairly often as a whole but it‚Äôs usually me dying or me killing others as opposed to this. 

The reason I‚Äôm not so sure it might be depression is because 9/10 I am aware I‚Äôm dreaming at night. Idk why but I just nearly always know and I can shift and change the dream how I please.

147,"Sorry for reposting, I just wanted to give it a test because I've already tried 3 different subreddits and I didn't wanna type out another long paragraph just to find out I don't have enough karma points or something


But I'm only almost 19 and my whole life has been nothing but problems, when I was only 7 my mom decided to divorce my dad and in the process she decided to up and go with some guy she hasn't seen in years, she ended up sending me to his place after I only met him twice and well long story short I had to share a bed with him and if always wake up to his hands on my/in my pants. I've always been to scared to say anything because I didn't wanna screw over my mom so I've kept quite all these years 

The next traumatic thing to happen  was when said guy and my mom finally got a house together,  he ended up turning very unpleasant and started neglecting us leaving my mom to have to find a way to do everything, and so in that process I'd always have to worry about stuff like if we'd have food to eat or even of the power would be on when I got home from school because with it being left up to my mom that only had child support to depend on she was hardly ever able to pay it and would always have to depend on some silver lining like the fact they were required to turn it on in the winter

Fast forward to when I turned 14 I need up going to live with my dad, and with that I had to start yet another new school, well the traumatic thing to happen there was the typical situation, I was the new kid and with all the stuff previously I decided to just stay to myself anymore and so In the process some popular kid decided to make memes about me saying I was a school shooter all because I was the new quit kid, so somehow I ended up getting kicked out and nearly arrested over it even tho his own cousin showed proof that he started it all. 


So I ended up having to move back home which at this point my now step dad hasn't gotten real bad to where he's barely talk to anyone and I guess it really affected Ted my mom because it turned into where I'd come home from school only to find her trying to off herself with a broken piece of glass, and that turned into a habit to where if come home only to find out either she tried to off herself again or that she addmited herself to the hospital again, 


Now let's jump to when I was 1t  now this situation is more my fault but I ended up taking whatever way I could to get out of the house so I ended up loving with a chick I just started dating, well the whole time I was there I was treated like I was their personal little maid, and the whole family was just toxic, the thing I'm getting to here is the girl I was dating convinced/threatened me into having a kid with her by saying she'd off herself because she wasn't happy and that only a baby could make her happy and what not, so me being stupid and only being 15 eventually gave in only for her to up and ditch the day she found out she was pregnant, and yes I tried and tried to be there but shed always ghost and block me any time she dated a new dude. But that's more on me for being dumb I guess


And the most recent thing to happen is back in like 2017 my step dad got us kicked out of our house and so he resulted in going to a motel, and we've remained in motels since then, at first it wasn't bad until he decided to up and quit his job only to mice an hour away all for some other job, and this place is horrible, he chose the cheapest motel and so as usual there's bugs here, not to mention everything's just shitty anyways, and I'm just loosing my mind because no matter what I try it's useless, and it's to the point I can't sleep unless I pass out from exhaustion anymore


I just don't know what to do with life, I feel so trapped anymore because all my hopes of going my own way have been crushed, and in the end I think this is what my step dad has been going for all this time. 


I just feel so lost in life anymore, I've isolated myself so much to where I ruin any friendships I do get, I feel like I don't even fit into society anymore. And I just have no idea what to do anymore

My mental health has just plummeted, the only reason I'm even still around is because I get all panicky when I think of ending it all because I get worried I'll mess it up and just be in even more pain then I already am. 

But sorry for this being so long, I just needed an out for all the stuff I've been bottling up I guess, and sorry if this all gets confusing I tried to simplify things so it wasn't longer then it already is",07Oct2020,1

149,"There's a person in my life that often talks in stories rather than answer any question directly or even just converse. These stories are often stories of their past - work experiences, interactions with friends, upbringing. These stories are nearly always used to paint this person in a positive light and/or show how they're a victim.

This person thinks very highly of themselves and believes they're honestly a cut above most. However, deep down it seems like they're incredibly insecure. 

I initially assumed this was a sort of narcissistic personality issue. However, I'm confused at the constant use of stories vs direct conversation. Sometimes, these stories can go on for long periods of time, wearing people out.",07Oct2020,1

Just an hour ago I was told that I had to leave within 3 months time, that she wouldn't want anything to do with me anymore.

I've grown used to the fact that my mom doesn't listen to what I have to say and just pushes me away whenever I don't act according to her image but this is a new low. To sketch the situation I'm in: I'm a heart patient with half of my capacity cut off, unemployed and a second lockdown seems to be on its way shortly since the government is putting on stricter limitations.

A shimmering light enclapses my dreams,
A wall between you and me.
I want it to grow brighter, to see what‚Äôs on the other side,
my desire to end darkness growing bright.

To be or not to be, is only an illusion,
for what you are is different than who you know.
The path that lies ahead of you is fixed,
the journey to the wall being different for everyone.

An eternal darkness, that was mine,
the last cry of a wolf that howls,
an old street light flickering unnoticed,
electricity cut that stays eternally silent.

A dream,all a dream, or is it another delicately woven illusion?
For what it could be, I cannot answer.",07Oct2020,1
153,"My birth mother is manic depressive (Bipolar) I never got to know her because she was mentally unstable and still is now. From what my family members tell me she had very bad anxiety and was always irritable with a bad temper. That's pretty much all I know about her bipolar symptoms and I'm aware it can affect others who have it differently.

When I got into my late teens I started getting these kind of like ""mood shifts"" where I would feel fine and then I would get easily irritable and anxious and then go into this what I call""rage"" where I've become so angry I scream yell and argue with my family and friends! My doctor put me on a migraine preventive which is also used as a mood stabilizer and I didn't have that ""rage"" anymore. Since last year I started taking an antidepressants for nerve pain and the ""rage"" came back again along with severe depression and anxiety, panic attacks along mood shifts.

It's mostly is something to do with the antidepressants or maybe my anxiety is that severe, but sometimes I wonder if I could have bipolar like my birth mother. I did some research online and found that anxiety and anger can be connected to mania. I talked to a psychiatrist about it before, but he didn't take it seriously and said it was just anxiety and that ""I would know if I have bipolar. Getting an appointment with a new psychiatrist for another opinion isn't easy right now because of the virus, but I'm trying to get a phone appointment with my primary doctor this week to switch nerve pain medications.

158,"I'm trying to figure out how to word this without sounding super weird.

I have several inner voices that all weigh in on different day-to-day things. They each seem to have different roles and step in at different times:

* one that's very childlike --- happy but also easily confused, excited and brought out when there's things like sparkly colors
* one that's just sorta me and my inner monologue --- thinking about what I'm doing, how I'm feeling, standard stuff, ordering food, responding to conversations
* one that tries to keep things organized --- making sure I remember things and that I keep the childlike voice from being too present in professional contexts
* one that focuses on physical wellness --- saying things like 'don't forget to eat,' 'maybe just a small banana,' 'you can take a quick shower and then get in some water,' 'you've been feeling sick for a few days, maybe you should go to a doctor,' 'can you walk on that hurt ankle? maybe we can wrap it up?'
* one that focuses on emotional wellness --- talking softly and telling me 'it's okay babe, you can do this. you're doing so well. I'm so proud' (maybe one of my favorites although I appreciate them all, and she's super kind to the childlike voice)
* one that serves as almost an internal therapist --- stops me in my thoughts when I start getting anxious and questions whether the concerns are truly rational and how maybe they could be reframed, also considers if my approach to things and people could be altered to make things feel safer and more pleasant for everyone involved (sorry this one's hard to describe exactly, it's also one of the one's that argues the most with the other inner voices &amp; weighs in a lot on interactions with others)
* one that comes up when there's moral dilemmas or decisions to be made --- maybe a devil's advocate, but it presents both sides
* and then the worst one, which is almost like an abuser inside my head --- this one constantly tells me things I would never dream of saying to another human being. things like 'you're a failure,' 'you can't possibly do this,' 'you're worthless,' 'why are you even trying,' It yells at me if I upset someone and says I shouldn't be forgiven because I'm a terrible person. It also gets angry and punishing if I do something imperfectly or get something wrong. it goes on and on and it's really hard to manage

I've been working (mostly with the help of the therapist voice) to try to get the inner voices to collaborate more and be more supportive of each other rather than blaming or getting angry at each other. But it's still quite tricky

But yeah - is this something many people experience? I have heard people talking about their inner monologues. Is that what this is? I haven't talked to anyone about this before for fear of sounding crazy

159,"so some time last year I attempted suicide. 12 grams of paracetamol and some alcohol. the only thing I feel guilty for is hurting my family by doing it. went to therapy and essentially lied my way through to the other side because I didn't actually know what I was feeling. he asked me a series of questions, most of them I have forgotten so I wouldn't be able to re-answer. he interrupted a lot and mostly only listened to my parents and even when he talked to me I said what I thought was normal. so I decided to keep track of when things get bad and I've made a list of things that happen. they're not constant, but not frequent either. most of the time they come in waves.

Can't form sentence because words slip away after thinking them, only Able to focus on one word.

Extremely tense shoulders happening more often when I wake up

Concentration loss, pretty fuckin bad

Anxiety sometimes no reason

Struggling to get up

Emptiness.

Can hear people speak but can't properly register what they say sometimes

Random mood swings/sudden bursts of energy or get sad for no reason

Get angry at small things for no reason 

Suicidal thoughts, don't actually want to act on them

Dissociation, feel like I'm dreaming but know I'm not

Static vision
like a static TV screen over my eyes 

Sometimes don't actually know how I feel

Don't know how to explain emotions if I'm not feeling them in that current moment

feces changes consistency when in school, when at home it's normal but I tend to get diarrhea when in school

the doctor that I went to therapy with, in CAHMS (in Ireland)
said that I could have mild Asperger's, but it's so mild that it almost wouldn't be worth testing for. and I guess, my parents got an answer, so they were happy. it's Asperger's. that's why I tried to kill myself. i don't know.

I'm in a bit of a bad spot mentally right now and need some tips to stay grounded. It's kind of difficult to not drift off. Especially when my home environnement is causing me great stress and there isn't may places to go during this pandemic. I've just come from therapy and we were talking about how I've fallen into this habit of ""zoning out"" (I don't know what the best way is to describe it), when I get emotionally distressed. It's hinders me more than it helps now.

I know physical sensations soothe me, so I've ordered a weighted blanket to help, and brought some stress toys. I know auditory stimuli and moving visuals do not work - most of the time it's like a sensory overload and it makes me feel worse. Walking home from therapy today was awful because of the noise and everything and everyone moving. I don't know if anyone has any recommendations for noise cancelling headphones. The Headphones would be a bit more dangerous for me when I'm on the street, but they'll probably be handy when I'm indoors. 

I don't know where else to go with this. My therapist told me to also explore taste and smell to ground me. I don't know how to do that in a safe way without falling into self-harm territory. Eating for example, I've used in the past to distract/""soothe"" me, but it goes to extremes.

I never promoted binging I never said any of it. I said I eat well and exercise 6 days a week on 1000cal diet. On Saturdays once a week I eat between 2000-3000 cals in a meal becouse I fast. So I only eat once at night.

I am a M(14) and I think I suffer from a god complex, or at least I have been told too many times by my friends and now my family. I‚Äôm at a loss, I don‚Äôt know what to do. It‚Äôs becoming a struggle of mine and it‚Äôs making my life absolute hell. 

The reason they accuse me of this is because of how I act. I often want things to revolve around me, I‚Äôm often selfish and ignorant, a few other things I can pin point. People have constantly told me to change but it‚Äôs so hard to do so because of this problem, it haunts me and it‚Äôs making me lose my mind.

I feel as if my friendships are beyond repair and I want to save them as best as I can while helping myself. It‚Äôs hurting me, my family, my social life and everything I do. Affecting my day to day activities. There isn‚Äôt an hour of the day where I constantly worry if I have done something selfish or rude without realizing. 

I decided to turn to Reddit cause I have tried everything, I want help. I don‚Äôt want to be this way and I don‚Äôt want to lose my friendships. I‚Äôm not asking for pity, as most people think that I would because of what I do. I realize the things I do; but I can‚Äôt take responsibility for it. For me in my head, it feels like the whole world will end.
 
So Reddit, what do I do? All I ask is for help, not anything rude. I‚Äôm seeing my therapist Saturday but It‚Äôs freaking me out. Please send some advice or something until I can go.

tl;dr: I think I suffer from a god complex, what should I do? It‚Äôs affecting my friendships, my relationship with my family and it‚Äôs affecting my wellbeing.",07Oct2020,1
178,"The only thing that was keeping me going and I was proud of was my weightloss....


Now it's not. I feel like a failor. I've lost 30 kilos in 9 months. I still have a problem with binging once a week between 2000-3000 cals one day a week. 


I fast and eat healthy and on 1000 cals all of the other days and supervised by my doctor. Low calories due to medical issues. 

I'm still put down and belittled online all the time when I try to mention that I'm proud of my weightloss... I'm not doing well the last two days and have had two massive breakdowns. 


I feel I've failed at everything. That I don't want to get out if bed anymore. No one is willing to understand and it's all getting to much to bare..

I never promoted binging I never said any of it. I said I eat well and exercise 6 days a week on 1000cal diet. On Saturdays once a week I eat between 2000-3000 cals in a meal becouse I fast. So I only eat once at night. 

My meal is 2000-3000 once a week.

She's been resorting to alcohol to numb the pain for months and has been suicidal throughout. She has constant breakdowns, multiple times a week, and has trouble functioning in her daily life.

Today I am afraid she might act on her thoughts. She said she just wants to be with the child she lost, and the stress she's going through is too much for her.

187,"I don't know if this is the right sub for this, but I don't know a better place for this. 

I am struggling with 2020 situational depression. (I do have diagnosed PTSD.) It's a lot of things coming together - the US election, working from home, the fact that I haven't touched another human being except for medical exams in 7 months  - coming together and dragging me down. My therapist has assured that this is a normal, healthy response to a terrible situation, but it's vile and it's gotten so much worse since September.

When this all began, I would make plans for what I would do when it was safe and everything opened up. Work told us we would only be working from home for about two weeks. That was March 17.  I was happy to be kept safe and tried to figure out what this weird little moment in time was - and where I was going to find toilet paper. I wasn't happy about the isolation - I am very sensitive (see PTSD above) and it felt uncomfortable, but I'm also a high health risk for COVID so I just made plans for what I would do when it blows over, much as I do during a bad flu season.

I stopped doing that because... it's now October and there are zero signs of this blowing over. Flu season is approaching and will probably further isolate me. (I am in negotiations of opening my pandemic pod to a previous FWB if only to get some human touch, but pod negotiations are ongoing.) 

The pandemic and elections scare me but I'm mostly apathetic. I've lost interest in things. I've tried starting new projects to jump start enjoying life, but it's just not there. I struggle to see any kind of hopeful future - although this could very much be the PTSD talking, too. I'm tired all the time - although this could also be my medications, almost all of which cause tiredness. I've also been dealing with on-and-off flares with my physical health problems and limited access to doctors, which isn't fun either. I had been having a fun sexting thing going with a guy I met on an app early in the pandemic, with the goal of meeting once it's safe, and he pointed out last night that it's been more than a month since I texted him anything fun and sexy. And it's true because I cannot imagine having the energy to do that or the desire.

Like I said, my therapist is fully aware of what's going on (and encouraging my FWB negotiations to positively conclude so I can get some human touch) and believes it's a situational reaction to the fact that 2020 is happening. I just really don't like it, but don't know, either, how I can improve it.",07Oct2020,1
188,"Not necessarily after advice here I just need to vent a frustration.

Since me and my ex broke up she has become very outspoken on social media (she was quite quiet when we were together) which is totally fine I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs coming out of her shell, I‚Äôm just annoyed at the sort of content she posts.

She wrote this huge paragraph about how important mental health is to her and how she would help anyone in a position where they needed it, which again is totally fine, but she wasn‚Äôt like that with me during the last half a year of our two year relationship (specifically the time where my mental health really started to decline).

I worked at a company that required me to work away for three days of the week and that started at four in the morning, this didn‚Äôt stop her from calling me at midnight to start an argument that lasted between one and two hours. She would start arguments about a wide range of topics, sometimes it would be about sex or the lack of (my libido sort of took a nose dive during my mental decline), sometimes it would be because I was spending too much time with my best friend (she would mockingly accuse me of being gay with him, not that‚Äôd be an issue but I‚Äôm aware of my sexuality and know that I‚Äôm not), and sometimes it would be about other mundane topics that she decided were relevant at daft O‚Äôclock. If I were ever to have an illness, she would claim to have it worse, if there were ever any rules within our relationship, they would only apply to me. She spent a huge amount of time being jealous of both my male and female friends, often using the phrase ‚Äúyou‚Äôre boiling my piss‚Äù behind closed doors if a female friend so much as hugged me, yet would claim innocence at the things she would get up to, like how once she told me she approached someone in a supermarket because she found them attractive and it turned out to be me or she would say sexually explicit things about my friends when they were not around.

What really broke the camels back in this situation though was how during a phone call a few days before we group up I experienced for the first time in my life a panic attack, I was genuinely frightened as my arms started to go numb and my chest compressed and I was asking for help, yet all she did was continue to talk about something that was happening on her end of the phone call, as if I wasn‚Äôt wheezing and spluttering down the receiver.

My point is her post made her seem like a Good Samaritan when it came to mental health but I know for a fact she contributed to a percentage of my decline, and it took nearly everything I had to not start an argument either on that specific post or through private message.",07Oct2020,1

Let's get to the point:

&amp;#x200B;

My mind works too fast.

I can't think about anything 100 per cent because at the same time I'm thinking about A LOT of things and trying to proccess a lot of thoughts. My mind goes from a thought to another making random and often irrational connections between trails of thought; and it can't even proccess all the information it's creating in time. While I'm still processing one thought another comes, and then another, and then another, and then my head hurts and I don't know what I'm thinking; but then again I'm thinking about various things simultaneously and too fast for me to understand wat is going in that brain of mine.

&amp;#x200B;

This makes focusing on schoolwork really difficult and it's really annoying because my brain works faster than my mouth and I have trouble speaking and socializing.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine I'm doing a work about cells for high school. I'm trying to focus on cells, but at the same time I'm thinking about my favourite song, how the conclusion of the work is going to be, what I'm gonna do tomorrow, the solution to a math problem I heard yesterday, why bthe educative system sucks, how I'm gonna prepare for my next concert, what did x author meant when he wrote x book, how pretty the colour blue is, and many, many more until it all bcomes a black ball of wool (made out of thoughts) that I can't understand or unscramble.",07Oct2020,1

196,"Hey guys, 

So my girlfriend is a super sweet and talented girl with a heart of gold, but she's been having some very serious struggles with depression, obsessive thinking, and possibly ego/being a bit spoiled as a child.  

She has very large dreams, and I think she's totally capable of achieving them. She's broken them down into multi year, yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily goals in order to keep herself on track. Every week she makes a very detailed schedule for herself, and has every task planned out. Many of these things are creative things, as she is in the arts, so they aren't necessarily ""completable"", they are just things that you work on throughout your career. 

She's also found herself in the position of needing to support her father who is sick and can't work (Non pandemic related) , as well as her brother. She's able to do it with her job, but just barely, and I've been doing my best to help her out as much as i can. She's not in a terrible spot, aside from needing a little more income to support her family. Her job is kinda flexible. 

Over the last few months, she's been putting such intense and obsessive pressure on herself to use every single second of every day, sleeping later and trying to be up at 5:30am so she can do her other tasks (which her body is telling her it's not okay with). Listening to all kinds of books on how to use your time better, how to organize your life, etc. Her drive is admirable, but it's gotten to the point where if ANYTHING interrupts her day, including her family wanting to talk or her brother needing something, or oversleeping a little, it sends her into a big breakdown, where she can't stop crying or get out of bed. She obsessively goes through her calendar over and over again, and frantically readjusts things constantly - if something doesn't fit anymore, then the day is ruined. If even a single daily goal is interrupted, to her it then disrupts her weekly, monthly, and yearly goals, and exponentially adds years to when she will have achieved them, if at all. A lot of times she blames other people, her parents, her boss, or me and says i'm trying to stop her, or i'm not ambitious enough (even though I am quite ambitious, i just have a less intense approach to it) 

She simultaneously thinks she deserves bad things, and she has multiple times been feeling a need to punch herself for not completing her day or not getting up on time, wishing she didn't have a family and that they'd stop bothering her so she could just focus on the things she wants to achieve, wishing she could just be dead so she wouldn't have any pressure, etc. To my knowledge she hasn't explored the last part with intent, but once she gets into that rabbit hole it takes up the whole day basically.

These breakdowns are happening almost daily, and are creating a nasty downward spiral.  I've been strongly pushing her into doing some online therapy like Talk Space so she could have some professional help, and offered to pay for that, but she can't see how she could possibly fit that on her schedule, although she sees how it would be useful. I think she is about to sign up though, finally. She doesn't really talk to her friends, and doesn't read the news, so she's pretty isolated, and doesn't grasp how the pandemic has deeply affected the world. Everything is an excuse for why she isn't achieving her goals, and just a waste of precious time.

 She is generally okay when we see each other over the weekends, but then immediately the next day something tiny will be a trigger, and the whole cycle starts again. She can't see a middle ground between taking care of her mental health, and achieving her goals. It's either full steam ahead and use every second, or give it all up and lower her life expectations and kill her dreams. She's not able to see the big picture of how focusing on building herself now will enable her to achieve her goals down the line. 

I'm not sure how to be helpful or what to do. I think the online therapy would be a great start, but I can't figure out how to ride the line between being encouraging and motivational, and pulling her back from the edge so she doesn't have a really serious breakdown.",07Oct2020,1

201,"I feel like my family is all alone. 
My sister displays 7 of the 8 symptoms of HPD. She does not display any of the other unique symptoms associated with other Cluster B personality disorders. She has not been assessed, so many mental health professionals do not take me seriously when I express my concern for my sister's behavior. However, every time I describe her behavior or demonstrate her behaviors to a mental health professional, they say, ""Yep. That's what it sounds/looks like.""

Due to recent trauma and the circumstances involving Covid-19, her behavior has exacerbated. My family and I want to get her help before she finds herself in an unsafe/unstable situation. However, every time we have tried to express how her behavior makes us feel or how her behavior is negatively affecting her life, her behavior becomes worse and she accuses us of being abusive to her and we don't hear from her for days. We just walk on eggshells when she's around because we don't know what else to do. 

I believe I read in a medical journal that less than 1% of the population has HPD. I believe that most people who have it are diagnosed with Borderline PD because we have ways of dealing with that condition and it ""comes close"" to HPD. But, my sister doesn't have that. I am a graduate student in a behavioral health program and have spent months researching this. If she doesn't have HPD, I have no clue what else it could be. 

Anyway, I'm trying to find other people in this world who understand what my family is going through with her. Is there anyone else out there with siblings/family members with HPD? I want to learn how we can help her and how we can protect our own mental health when being around her.

202,"I just want to start by saying I never have and most likely (hopefully) will never harm my self in any way, especially not with blades. 

A few years ago, I was in a very bad place and involved with some really bad, really unhealthy people.  Some of those people self harmed and since I was their friend, they would be very open about it in a way that wasn't ok. There were very few boundaries and I saw things I wish to this day I had never seen. That part of my life is over but for years now I've been brought down by these horrible thoughts of blades and knives... well, cutting me. My imagination just goes wild. Even as I type this, I'm thinking of it, I feel a tingling in my wrists. 

When it began, I could usually just tuck my arms under my elbows and slowly the feeling would go away. Now, it's started up again after months of nothing and I have no idea what to do. I don't remember now, but I certainly don't think the horribly intrusive thoughts were as bad as they are currently. It'll keep me up. Any moment I'm not doing something that takes my full attention it invades my thoughts. I have to sort of fight with my imagination to pretend the blades are stabbing me in non triggering ways (to explain: If I think  now about getting a blade in my heart or in my toe, I feel nothing, it's not weird, it's just my imagination, but anything on my forearms and sometimes on my thighs feels horrible and makes me feel so unwell emotionally). 

I don't know what to do. With this pandemic, professional help is kind of out of the question. The thing that's really messing with me is I've never in my life heard of someone who's never self-harmed be so deeply affected by the idea of it like it this. I didn't even know it was possible. 1.

209,"About 6 months ago I struggled seriously with self-esteem issues and suicidal thoughts. I never told anyone about it and I never did anything to get over it, I just sorta ignored it. Now i don't give a fuck about anything anymore. All I do is go to the beach and drool over the same girl I have been chasing for months. I have no motivation or fear of punishment. I use to be a straight A student with a 4.5 GPA. Now I have like 15 missing assignments in every class. Whenever I am punished it doesn't bother me. I can't take anything or anyone seriously. Even when my dad hits me for missing assignments or disrespecting him, it doesn't even phase me. I'm not scared of dying. I'm not scared of pain. I'm not scared of being homeless. In the end none of it matters anyway. Is this normal?


 I use to have a almost obsessive crush on a girl and now I still like her, but I don't really care what she thinks of me anymore. I use to do everything in order to impress her and now I just don't give a single fuck. And like I said before I don't give a fuck about school anymore. I was the kid who would stay after class and takes only ap and college classes and now I don't give a fuck if I end up homeless and without an education.



 I was a d1 baseball player and might have a shot at college, but Idgaf about it anymore and I've started skipping practice for the past couple of months. I still don't have my permit, why would I need it if my friends could drive?    My mom was screaming at me about my grades and I laughed at her. It seemed so stupid that some one was mad at me for a grade. I just want to have a good time. I started smoking weed again and drinking alone. I know that's not healthy but no one knows any different so why not. I think I'm gonna drop out and move in with my brother and if he doesn't let me move in with him I'll just be homeless.

212,"Lately, I've(F16) had suspicions that my boyfriend(M18) doesn't like me being around him anymore. It started with me losing all of my friends during quarantine (lost alot because i continued his relationship ship which is no way his fault but still. And he's the only person I really get to interact with. He started a band with a group of friends and things were fine. I was invited to practices and it was cool being able to hang with people. But the last time I was invited, my boyfriend started making jokes that made me uncomfortable.

 I'm a very jealous person I will admit. But I have told him that I am working on it and will not blame him or be angry at him for anything out of his control. But while we were there, he made a comment about not being able to find a sexy enough Mexican milf in any pornos he watches and it just made me kind of sad because I'm the complete opposite of that. I'm pale, very petite. Anyways, the joke was made but of course I'm not going to get angry in front of everyone so i kind of just went silent and waited to go home. But he noticed and we talked about it and he said that i took the joke the wrong way. So i just dropped it. 

But then i stopped getting invited to these outings. It  didnt bother me too badly, it just made me sad being stuck in my toxic ass house for weeks at a time while I know my boyfriend was having fun and making music. And I've always loved his music so much and I love hearing him play and now I dont feel involved at all. 

But today, he told me he plans on practicing tomorrow, since they have a show on halloween, and I was cool with it. But his phone rang earlier and it was from the band group chat and someone asked if they could bring their friend and his sister and someone else in the group said ""the more the merrier"" so of course i was like ""hell yeah :))))"".

 So when he came back into the room I was like, 
""Hey could I come with you to practice tomorrow?"" And he started making up excuses like ""well you probably won't have much fun"" ""hang with your sister tomorrow"" (shes in town this week) so I decided to test my theory. Does he not want to be around me? So I asked him ""it's okay if I cant, I understand y'all have a show soon and you guys dont want any distractions."" Then he acted sad and was like ""yeah sorry it's just gonna be us tomorrow :(""

214,"As some of you may know, on October the 10th, it is the **World Mental Health Day**. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted or halted critical Mental Health services within 93% of the World‚Äôs countries, even though the demand for Mental Health is increasing, according to surveys. The survey from the WHO indicates that there is need for an *urgent* increase in Mental Health funding. The survey was created ahead of the World Mental Health Day, which will bring celebrities, world leaders and advocates all together to increase Mental Health investments in the wake of the pandemic. 

The WHO, or World Health Organisation have already highlighted the underfunding of Mental Health. For example, prior to the pandemic, the countries were spending less than 2% of their national health budgets on Mental Health. Due to the pandemic, the demand for Mental Health services has increased. For example, the main fears that are triggering people who are suffering from Mental Health are:

- Isolating 
- A big loss of income
- Bereavement
- Fear

Also, due to the pandemic, people are currently facing increased levels of anxiety, insomnia and the using of drugs and alcohol. COVID-19 can lead to different mental complications and neurological such as stroke, agitation and delirium. A survey had been conducted from June to August 2020 amount 130 different countries across the WHO‚Äôs six regions. The survey evaluated how mental, neurological and substance use (alcohol and drugs) has changed due to the pandemic, the types of services that have been disrupted and how different countries are currently adapting to overcome these challenges. The statistics had shown:

- 67% saw disruptions regarding counselling and psychotherapy; 65% to critical harm reduction services and 45% to opioid agonist maintenance treatment for opioid dependence. 
- 30% had reported that there were disruptions when trying to access medications for mental, substance use and neurological disorders. 
- Over 60% had reported that there was disruptions to Mental Health services for vulnerable people, children and adolescents (72%), older adults at (70%) and women that required postnatal services or antenatal (61%). 

89% of the countries worldwide have reported in the survey that the Mental Health and Psychosocial support is one of their top priorities and a part of their COVID-19 response plan. But, that being said, only 19% of those countries have the full additional funding to cover these support. **What does this mean**? It shows that more money needs to be invested into Mental Health. As the pandemic continues and looks like it won‚Äôt be going anywhere in a while, the demand for National and International Mental Health Programs is greater and grows by each day. Spending only 2% of the National‚Äôs health budget on Mental Health is simply not good enough. It‚Äôs been know that, pre COVID-19, nearly $1 trillion in economic productivity is lost annually from anxiety and depression alone. 

**World Mental Health Day 2020**

This Saturday, October the 10th 2020, the **World Health Organisation** is inviting the whole world to take part within *The Big Event For Mental Health*, which is an online event that will call for bigger and increased investments within Mental Health at every level.

Today has been bad. This whole year has been horrible. I woke up and realized I missed a zoom meeting for a class and then found out I missed the deadline on THREE quizzes and one important project. I began to have a panic attack, Hyperventilating, shaking the whole 9 yards but as soon as it started it stopped and I kind of just sat there and stared out my window. It was like the thoughts that were bothering me were inaccessible, I knew why I was upset logically but I could just not seem to access those thoughts at the moment. That's really the best way I can describe it. I was in almost like a catatonic state and couldn't really think or feel much of anything. It was like my body and mind were just too overwhelmed to deal with any more stress. And that's saying a lot as I have dealt with my fair share of extreme stress.

218,"Recently I've been having this problem where I'm on reddit or pornhub and my brain says ""I'm going to tie this image to this character/game or thing in your room.""

This then bleeds into when I'm watching a show or playing a game. 

I've had problems with intrusive thoughts before but this episode is hitting me really bad.

Or when I play the game itself. 

I've tried meditating and thought blocking, both of those remove the thought but every time the thought is removed it's like my thoughts have become a pendulum and it returns back to thinking of that image.

221,"Hey people reading this,

before i start, I want to say that my english is not that good, i live in germany.

So I've been thinking about killing myself for a few years now and it feels a bit strange to me, telling you guys my story of my life but I really need help or advice.

It all started when I was a 12 year old boy (I'm 18 now) there was this one guy who were friends with my family.

He knew alot about Computers and was also playing games (like I did). He always helped me out when I had problems with something. My parents really trusted him and so did I. 

My parents allowed me to stay at his home for a night or two. I really enjoyed it because he allowed me to stay up longer than my parents did, I always had to go to bed early at home.

When I was at his home we were always playing games until 4am or so, basically I always went to bed really really late. When I think about this now, it might've been his plan to make me tired, but I am not sure about that. The more often I've went to his home the more strange it become.

He said shit like: ""If you need cigarettes for you or your friends, just tell me"" same goes for alcohol.

I just denied it, I was 12 and he just seemed like a cool dude to me.

He often put his hands between my legs I didnt liked that so I told him to stop doing that.

He then laughed and said: ""It's alright, I wont do it again. I just wanted to make you feel good."" 

I told my parents about what happend and they didnt take me serious. So i also started not taking it serious and kept on visiting him until something happend, that changed my whole life.

I woke up because of a strange feeling in my genital area, my boxershorts were completely soaked so I looked down to see what is happening and saw him sucking on my penis. It did really hurt but I was so scared that I just pretended that I was sleeping until his phone rang he got up to get his phone and he saw that I was awake and asked if I liked it and if he should keep doing it. I said: ""yes, but I really have to go to school now I am already 2 hours late."" He then asked me if he should pick me up from school later. I denied, packed my stuff and ran out. When I was outside I started crying and ran to my home to tell my mother about what happend. (side info: he turned off my phone because I had school that day and I was wondering why my alarm didnt go off) 

I told her exactly what happend and she saw me crying but still had the audacity to ask me if I was really sure about that. She told me that I should go to school now and that we'll discuss everything after I got out of school.

So thats what I did, I went to school with a completely soaked boxershorts and tears in my eyes.

Nobody noticed how I was feeling and that really disgusts me.

My mother picked me up from school that day and told me i should talk with my dad about what happend. So that's what I did. He just couldnt believe what happend and took me directly to the police where I had to make a statement about what happend exactly. After I finished they asked me for my boxershorts for any evidence (they found saliva from him on my boxershorts) they got a search warrant and found a lot of child porn on his computer. He had raped a few kids and only 1 kid had the courage to make a statement against him. All he got was 3 FUCKING YEARS and I was done with my life. He is probably out there doing the same shit again destroying innocent souls..

I was in a clinic for 3 months after this happend but I denied any help so I started doing drugs when I was 14. First it was ""only"" cigarettes then weed then amphetamins/mdma and later heroin. 

Right now I am only addicted to weed and cigarettes which im proud of because it was a really hard time trying to get over to all those addictions I had.

Now I am a 18 year old boy sitting home without work and without a graduation playing computer games and taking drugs all day long.

I am diagnosed with PTSD, antisocial personality disorder

I basically can't get anywhere where a lot of people are and if I try I go crazy.

I feel like a worthless piece of crap who has nothing done in his life I just feel like this world isnt made for me.

225,"I recently got admitted to a hospital because I wanted to kms, they take everything from you. Since covid they had a no visitor policy but a 2 hour cell phone window everyday.  I didn't get ahold of my phone until day 3 of 5, when I turned on my phone I had alot of messages/pictures from my bf wondering where I'd been and telling me each day what he was up to. So that day when I got my phone I called. I knew he might be asleep due to working nights, he was asleep and he eventually ended up calling back the last 15 minutes of phone time. He seemed distant and quiet and blamed it on the fact he was tired and just woke up. Didn't seem like he cared at all.. (My roommate had texted the day I was admitted to say he might not hear from me for awhile because I hurt myself and was going to the hospital.) So, he knew that much. 

    The next day around phone time I turned on my phone to see just simple ""I'm omw home from work, I'm going to sleep "" texts. It was way different than the prevuous days but I shrugged it off to him being tired. I called him and once again he was quiet and distance, mentioned he was mad at me. I also soon realized he logged me out of all of his social media and the whole thing made me uneasy but I was glad to talk to him. In simple terms, I told him when I was being released and he didn't care much. He didn't come see me or anything,  just made plans with other people.

  It's been a half a wk since all of this and he is still emotionally unavailable. Seems to be keeping himself at a distance and shutting me out. He said something along the lines of ""The first 2-3 days I was worried so much and lost my sh*t having breakdowns..and then I just went numb."" I can't help but blame myself and feel helpless. I was hopeful when I got out to be getting the proper help I needed. As I went through abuse from the time I was a toddler- early 20s. I'd been housebound the past 4 years with agoraphobia so even getting help was a huge step for me.

So days ago I was going through an argument, I was on the wrong side, I agree but I used my words well. I didn't attack personally but I might have seemed pretentious. The other person attacked me and called me names which were hurtful because I don't call anyone as such.

Now the problem is I can't let it go and those words have been going through my head every now and then, that day was essentially ruined. I found myself thinking about revenge and bad thoughts about them even days later.

This has become a recurring thing for me. When wronged, I keep the calm and try to move on, but it takes toll on my mind. I play the event on repeat all day. I daydream about how befitting reply I'd have given. I make plans about all those vile things I'd do with them. It's just in the head. I asked a similar question in relationship advice, only to understand it doesn't have to do with interpersonal relationship. It has to do with me and how I process things. 

How to react to a conflict that doesn't leave me resentful later? How do I let go? How to convince myself the words someone says are just the projection of their own mind and not mine? How to stop ruminating about things?

I try to explain how I feel and I just get this reaction from everyone that shows the look on their face of ‚Äúhere we go again‚Äù. Everyone gets to run away from me and take a break or just not deal with it at all. While I end up alone with these thoughts and it just gets worse. How the hell do I feel loved and cared about again without saying ‚ÄúI want to feel love and cared about‚Äù because everytime I do that it feels like it‚Äôs something I had to ask for and I wouldn‚Äôt get it otherwise.,07Oct2020,1
232,"I genuinely think my personality type, upbringing, genetics and all of that has made me incapable of surviving in this world and this society. I'm not saying that I'm not responsible, I'm saying no matter what I do, the fact that I'm 'me' and programmed in this way it means I won't succeed. Like how some people are more confident than others, I'm less able to cope with life than others. And I know there thousands out there too, likely most of this sub, but that just makes me more angry and more annoyed at the world.

Why do we have to follow the rules and struggle through all these expectations. I can't do it, so now my only option is to what? Not live anymore? Doesn't seem fair tbh.

I have bad mental health, I can't work, my benefits have been cut and I have no partner anymore, no friends and my family mock me and don't understand at all. I am alone, I am incapable and pathetic and I am not going to make it.

235,"reposting because I got no answers before, but I really want feedback sorry if reposting isn't allowed

Won't go into too much detail, but this guy who was my best friend growing up, we used to tell each other everything, but as we got older it became more of a me talking to him and him listening and giving advice.

It stopped being a give and take for both of us and transformed into me taking and him giving. I want to help him, but every time I ask how he's doing he asks how I'm doing and says I don't need to worry about him and this makes me feel extremely guilty because I know this is wrong and I feel guilty because a part of me feels like he feels like he has to help me and doesn't want to stop because he thinks he'll destroy me if we stop being friends or stop talking about everything that's going wrong in my life.

Which is and isn't true. If we stop being friends completely, yes I will be totally crushed, but I just want to fix this back to normal. Even if it means not talking about the heavy stuff for a while.

And I've tried to do that, but once I stop talking about that he doesn't talk to me at all. Doesn't reach out, nothing. And when I try to have a casual conversation it's like nothing comes to mind of what to talk about because he doesn't keep up the conversation. I'm like how's your life bla bla bla, but there's a clear disconnect between our casual conversations now and what they used to be. We used to FaceTime for Horus talking about the most random shit making each other laugh, but now it's like dry conversations about ""so how's your life?"" ""good"" I mean there are some inside jokes shared and humor bounced off one another, but definitely not like it used to be.

And the only times we talk have these conversations is over FaceTime since he moved schools. over text it's like talking to a brick because I can't think of anything to text about because he won't talk about himself, and I don't even mean the heavy stuff, I'll ask a question and then be like ""but how are you?"" and he completely avoids the question and only answers mine about myself.

I've tried to not ask another and just say how are you, or start a conversation trying to ask how are you, but then he just goes no how are you?

and I can't think of anything else to talk to him about that doesn't relate to him helping me with my problems.

I really don't want to lose this friend, what can I do to fix this?

Like why is he so adamant on helping me and then when I try to ask about him he doesn't answer or keeps it to ""I'm fine"" and doesn't want to share about him?",07Oct2020,1

It feels like I'm stuck in my panic attack and I can't get out of it. Like it's a part of me. I did look up that there is a small percentage of people that can have like ...

238,"So here's the story. Ever since I was a kid, I've been insecure, timid, and sensitive. I was a good student but cracked under pressure.  I was always stressed and overwhelmed by the littlest things. Even so, my grades remained quite strong. Things went downhill after starting high school and after puberty. Social anxiety went through the roof and my own doubts and fears about myself exploded. I went away to college for the first time and crashed hard. I didn't have a clue on how to socialize on my own or build my own network. I was coming from a small town and relied on my brother as a social security blanket. Doctors started me on all sorts of medications over the years and diagnosed me with 3-4 disorders. The process has been slow and painful. Even the meds that helped, made things worse due to side effects like weight gain. I started tracking my hormones in my early 20s because I didn't know what else to do. Sure enough they were on the lower side, although normal. At 29, my hormones were so low that I started TRT. Treatment was amazing for about a month, but I had to stop due to blood pressure issues and elevated estrogen. I then tried adderall and ritalin which again was amazing, although only for a week before things got bad again. blood pressure and anxiety eventually spiked on both. Doctors are not sure what to do. My hunch is that my personality  predisposes me to certain conditions like anxiety and stress. I'm always in my head, over thinking. I also think hormones have played a role as well. At this point, the only treatment that makes sense to me is exercise and healthy habits like eating and daily mindfulness. Maybe that's been the trick this entire time but I was too stressed to even realize this. idk, any advice?",07Oct2020,1
239,"I posted this in offmychest and I got absolutely flamed for it. I think people weren‚Äôt quite understanding what I was saying. I am not supporting people who knowing fake mental illness for attention. I am talking about people who genuinely are struggling with some problems but are undiagnosed, wether it be that they can‚Äôt afford to go to a doctor, family or social stigma or any reason. I think that instead of shamming these people for being fakers and undiagnosed, we should help to try and give them ways where they could get help and receive a possible diagnosis, instead of saying that since they aren‚Äôt diagnosed they don‚Äôt know why there talking about or that there opinion doesn‚Äôt matter.


So I feel the need to make a disclaimer. Obviously, not everyone in the mental health community is doing this. Most aren‚Äôt but a couple bad apples ruin the bunch. 

For a while now on some subs i‚Äôve been seeing some posts about people‚Äôs friends faking mental illness or people self diagnosing and it seems to really upset people. For a group about helping people with mental health you‚Äôd think they be more open and welcoming. They talk about how mental illness isn‚Äôt a personality trait yet seem to get really offended when people who they seem as ‚Äúfaking it‚Äù for attention claim to have it. 

While I understand that that a professional diagnosis holds more weight than a self diagnosis, I think that basically everyone has had to self diagnose to some extent before or they would have never found out what was wrong and gone to seek help. Even if a person is genuinely faking it, that still shows that they have some mental problems and we should encourage them to get proper help like therapy. 
If you have cancer but it is undiagnosed, you still have cancer.

While I used to be somewhat guilty of this myself, I realized how harmful it can be to people seeking help but now feel that their problems aren‚Äôt significant enough. Even if you don‚Äôt have enough problems to classify it as a mental illness, you still have mental problems and it‚Äôs worth it to get help. 

Mental health is classless but many people seem to fail to understand this. Look at robin williams and kanye. Both of them have a ton of money and success, yet both suffer from mental illness. 

Next time your friend mentions something about their mental health, don‚Äôt just dismiss it because you feel they have a better life than you. Who are you to say someone doesn‚Äôt have a mental illness, you have no idea what going on in their head. There will always be someone who has it better than you and someone who has it worse than you, money can sometimes percent mental illness but not always. Mental health isn‚Äôt a competition, just because someone doesn‚Äôt have it as bad as you doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt suffering. Please advocate for them to get help instead of being petty and making it a competition. Thank you for coming to my rant.",07Oct2020,1

241,"Hi,

Between late 2018 - Feb 2020 I was casually seeing a girl. We never really discussed being in a serious relationship apart from a few times where I mentioned I wasn't looking for anything serious and she agreed. We saw each other a few times per week and things were fine.

In February of this year I told her that I still wasn't looking for something serious but this time she got upset and it seems like she was looking for more. I enjoy hanging out with her and although we agreed to be friends we still had a sexual relationship for a few months after that. I regret doing that now but thought we were on the same page about it being casual so didn't worry too much.

In July I met another girl who i went on two dates with and at which point my friend found out from a mutual friend in a random coincidence. She was very upset about it and felt like I had lied to her. I wish I had told her before going on the date, but thought since we weren't in a committed relationship it would be ok.

Since that time I have come to know that she has been suffering from depression since a child. Her father left their family at a young age and her mother doesn't seem to give her much attention. I have managed to get in touch with her sister who explained this to me and has mentioned she has tried to commit suicide several times.

I told her that I want to remain being her friend and we can still meet to watch movies etc. as before. The only issue now is that she has many bad episodes where she gets very upset/angry and often blames me for her issues. Sometimes she will make a sexual advance toward me and when I reject it she will get upset. I will occasionally receive a message from her mentioning she is thinking about suicide. I want to keep being her friend but I do not know how to deal with her blaming me for these issues. If I confront her about some of these issues she will act like I am tired of her and tell me she will hurt herself. She has cut herself for the first time a few weeks ago.

Does anyone have any advice on how I should deal with this situation? I am not sure how much of this I should accept but I would like to continue being her friend.

Thanks",07Oct2020,1

244,"
(16F) i‚Äôve been struggling with my mental health for quite a long ass time. it‚Äôs been hard these past few days trying to hide the pain and emotions, but it‚Äôs spiraling out of control. i‚Äôm a victim of sexual abuse, mental abuse, and physical abuse. i‚Äôve been used and betrayed by the ones i love. even though people tell me that they care about me, my trust is so fucked up that i can‚Äôt even believe it. i have strict nigerian parents who always question why i act the way i do, such as not eating or having an ‚Äúattitude‚Äù. my mother who seems to be more concerned asks me what‚Äôs eating me up.

i seriously wish i could tell her because i just don‚Äôt know how she‚Äôll take it. i remember when my school counselor told her that i had a suicidal plan and she was extremely upset about it. from that day i just continued to keep everything to myself. i even tried hiding my cuts. i have anxiety and depression (and maybe some other diagnoses i‚Äôm not sure yet). i push myself so hard in life and seriously feel like giving up. i sound like a hypocrite to my own self because i constantly tell others that suicide is not the answer and that there are people who actually care.

i use to be extremely encouraged to do things such as getting a job or getting my drivers license at 16 (which caused me to get a mental breakdown, but i got my shit (license). i got my first job at 15, but after leaving the first job the second and current job has really shown me another side to my mental health. i constantly would cry on the jobs or have mental breakdowns and anxiety attacks. my anxiety caused me not to be able to call out sometimes because i didn‚Äôt really wanna talk, so i‚Äôd just stay home. i never really felt appreciated at all the jobs i worked at no matter how hard working i was. i was supposed to go to work today but i just ended up telling my mom i ‚Äúcalled out‚Äù. it even caused me to cry to my mom because i hate that i can‚Äôt tell her what‚Äôs wrong with me. 
 
i perform very well in school, but it wasn‚Äôt till my sophomore year where i would constantly skip school to avoid the people and work. i use to always come to class late or i would be somewhere crying because of what happened at home or some shit. i was like a target to people (including the ones who i didn‚Äôt even know existed), for no reason. when i turned 16 i was extremely blessed to get a car that my mother and i were sharing. well i ended up getting into a car accident on my mother‚Äôs birthday which was on sept. 17, 2020. but a few days before it happened i went to my see my ex who kept harassing me and he took advantage and raped me again on sept 10., 2020 before my sisters birthday (yea it was hard trying to celebrate their birthdays). 

i had not spoken to him in a long time because all he wanted from me was sex and to harass me (which i was doing a good ass job by avoiding his bitch ass), but i don‚Äôt know what told me to go over there that night. i just wanted to settle things with him and ask him why did he keep doing this to me, but he hasn‚Äôt changed. now that you got a little back story, my mom just wants me to tell her what‚Äôs wrong but i just don‚Äôt want to hurt her or seem like a disgrace (which i am already).",07Oct2020,1

247,"Hello all, I am from the USA and something feels suspicious about the drug rehabilitation facility I work for but I can‚Äôt put my finger on it. The feeling is rooted in the sense that I‚Äôm being left in the dark about almost all practices‚Äîfrom policies to the hierarchy of people working there. There was no time to be trained. I was simply thrown into a Tech position and started working alone after a few days. There is no policy book and no instruction, notes, or guides to be seen anywhere at all for employees to refer to. I am told there are tasks to be done, but I am not given the ‚Äúhow‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of these tasks‚ÄîI am told to simply do them with no one present to instruct me. 

There are many processes that I have never been shown to do and when I ask for instruction from my bosses, they speak in nice tones wrapped in a thin layer of frustration. My other coworkers who have been here since reopening tell me that they still have no idea what is going on and they also received no training. One coworker has taken to playing online games while I‚Äôm left alone to stabilize clients who are having nuclear meltdowns. 

That‚Äôs just red flag number one. On multiple occasions, the clients have told me that the services provided to them in the facility are nothing like they were told about or what was advertised to them. Sometimes it‚Äôs little miscommunications; one client was told that they could use their cell phone after a few days. Other times, it‚Äôs big misunderstandings about the actual structure and function of their treatment as a whole. A client was told there would be massage therapy, dual diagnosis treatment, and EMDR‚Äîthey never received any of those things and they noted that their telehealth meetings with their therapists and case manager was seriously lacking in quantity and quality. 

Red flag number three: I did some digging and found that the facility has gone through name changes at least four times, and is about to go through a fifth name change. Is this constant name-changing fueled by creative whim, or is it motivated by the need to conceal something? I‚Äôve tried looking into the previous names of the facility, but every crumb of information about them seems to have been scrubbed off the internet.

All red flags aside, I am learning a lot as I go. I love being in an environment where I can put my education to use and the nomenclature feels both exciting and familiar. I care about my clients‚Äô wellbeing and put a great deal of my energy into building rapport with them and making them feel safe. As techs, I realize that we get to spend more time with clients than anyone else in the facility. I use my role as an opportunity to listen closely to them and do my best to amplify their voices through detailed documentation so that the Case Manager and therapists can obtain a nuanced depiction of our clientele. 

Nothing feels better than being able to watch our clients open up and heal. Gently guiding them to the realization that they are in fact intelligent, funny, unique, and worthy of healthy relationships is a priceless gift‚Ä¶ but I worry that the facility does not have the client‚Äôs or worker‚Äôs best interests in mind. 

Going forward, I don‚Äôt know if I should tough it out and stay for the ride or if I should start searching for work somewhere else. The more I think about it, the more it seems a bit dodgy. On one side of the coin, I see this as an opportunity to prepare myself for my Master‚Äôs program and to learn how to sharpen my advocacy skills. On the other side of the coin, I cannot in good conscience be part of a system that nebulously &amp; concretely takes advantage of vulnerable populations. 

The investigative part of me wants to see this situation from a bird‚Äôs eye view, but I‚Äôm not sure where to begin or what questions I should lead with. Is this lack of training and oversight normal for the industry, or is what I‚Äôm feeling just good old imposter syndrome? Has anyone else had similar experiences? 

Thanks all. Any advice or resources on how to navigate this would be much appreciated.",07Oct2020,1

Lately I feel like I cut off the people around me. 

I‚Äôve recently been in a relationship that lasted 11 months. During the relationship I kept noticing I am a rather closed off person compared to my ex (I‚Äôm generally not so good at trusting people). And when he tried to ‚Äòhelp‚Äô or ‚Äòprotect‚Äô me from some things I appreciated it in the beginning. But after a while, when I started to lose feelings for him, I hated him doing that. Maybe it was one of the reasons I broke up with him. He kept on acting as if I needed help. And by now I keep thinking that I don‚Äôt need help from anyone (especially men) at all. And this is something I remind myself of everyday. It‚Äôs so important for me to know that. 

This leads me to cut people off in some way. My family isn‚Äôt affected by it, because I know they will always stay family. But when it comes to friends, I don‚Äôt really have that emotional bond. Like, I laugh with them and have fun. But if I lost them, I wouldn‚Äôt care so much. This might also be caused by the fact that I might take a job offer and leave this place in January, so I‚Äôm trying to not get too attached to them. But I fear that my behavior will lead to me not making strong friendships at all in the future. I also keep telling myself that I generally don‚Äôt need anyone. I tell myself that I can do anything alone, because either way, I will only achieve what I want to achieve on my own. This life is my own responsibility. 

On the one hand this could be a very positive development, turning me into a strong, independent woman. Because I will turn 18 in a week. I‚Äôm growing up and this might be the result of it.

I encountered a patient today with obvious cut marks on his right arm.  I know he's going through a tough time in his life right now as well (divorce, mental health issues, custody battles, etc.).

For those of you who do or have cut: I want to be there for him.  I want him to know that I care.  I want to help him, if it is possible for me to help him.

261,"Minnesota, McLeod county.

&amp;#x200B;

two years ago, my 55 year old Father went on a severe manic episode.  to quickly summarize,  in the course of about 5 weeks he drove to colorado from minnesota and bought over $3k in marijuana, then transported it back.  he smoked said marijuana.  he destroyed every utility in his home trying to improve on the design.  he bought 14 antique player pianos, said he was gonna start a business.  many more things, of course, to the tune of about $45,000.  finally, he broke into his neighbors house at night and tried to ""plant"" asbestos so it would be condemned and he could buy the property.  arrested, jailed, transferred to psychiatric hospital, depakote, depression, and now we are here.

&amp;#x200B;

His mother told him that the depakote was preventing him from receiving gods love and guidance.. greeeeeat.  so he stopped taking it two weeks ago.  since then he has stopped going to work, drives around all day, marco polos his ENTIRE day including bathroom breaks, purchased a BROKEN 87"" 4k tv for something like $7k, bought 4 more antique pianos,  dissasembled his hot water heater WITHOUT disconnecting the gas, ripped the walls out of his house again, and last i believe last night he tried to forcibly gain entry into my childhood home to ""just take a look around and see what they've done with the place.""

&amp;#x200B;

so, the weird thing here is he is on probation and has a parole officer.  she will not return our calls, nor will the central office she works for.  myself and my stepmother have been trying to reach them for several weeks.  additionally, one of the stipulations of his probation is that he must follow his doctors medication recommendations.  not only has he confirmably not done that, but his DOCTOR confirmed that, said it was CLEAR that he was manic again, called the police himself, and when the police finally did find my father, they said ""he seemed fine"" and let him go.

&amp;#x200B;

so, hes been becoming increasingly agitated, and now my stepmother has gone to live with her children, for fear that she is no longer safe.  His local police remember him from last time, and any calls we make, they ignore because they don't want to deal with it.  I no longer know what to do, if we cannot reach his parole officer or her offices.  I am really afraid that  he is either going to hurt someone, or hurt himself very soon.

263,"I‚Äôm tired of convincing them that everything is fine when it isn‚Äôt. I feel like my parents are trying to keep me too close and my brain is literally starting to malfunction.

I have panic attacks all the time that cause me to act out on my impulses from my mom‚Äôs various threats to defund my education and berating and guilt-tripping whenever I encounter a road block. She says vicious things, like I have a downward spiral and I haven‚Äôt changed and I really just hate telling her about any bad thing that has happened to me because more than once, she has crushed my optimism and will to persevere when I have talked to her.

It feels like when I talk to her, no matter how hard I try to remain intact she always finds a way to break me. She just has such a grip over my head. I often resort to substances just so that I can escape it for just a fleeting moment of freedom from what feels like my own lack of free will. 

I hate how much I want her to approve of me. I know she never will and when she does, it‚Äôs only temporary, but I just keep falling into her trap. I don‚Äôt know how to escape her influence without using chemicals. I have just been so desperate for her approval ever since I was a child and she has toyed with it just to take it away from me. Even as a kid, I accused her of building me up just to break me down.

Right now I‚Äôm struggling to get through my classes and if I flunk out, despite the humiliation and shock from everyone she has boasted about me to, it will come as somewhat of a relief because it means that she will no longer have anything to hold over my head and I‚Äôll finally be free...

...but free to what? A dead end job from my lack of education? Free to whatever horrible way she‚Äôll try to manipulate me through next?

I‚Äôm just so mad because it feels like living in this situation, my brain literally does not work anymore. I was thriving in the beginning when I went off to school but then I hit a wall when I realized how much control she still had over me and I fell into a depression.

I feel pathetic for letting this even impact me at all but I sit down and try to work and just so many things go wrong because my brain is moving too slowly and I feel utterly disconnected from my own choices. One second I‚Äôm trying as hard as I possibly can and follow the rules to a T, then the next I blow off everything. It‚Äôs like I have two polar opposite selves fighting over my psyche constantly and whatever results my pursuits yield will reflect whichever one happens to be dominant in the moment by chance. 

I was competent in my youth, but I feel like I‚Äôm wearing down. I just don‚Äôt know how to handle the relationship I have with my mother anymore. Even when things are good... I live in constant fear of them going wrong again like they will inevitably do because I‚Äôm just so obsessed with her approval no matter how hard I try to force myself not to acknowledge her... to hate her even.

I just don‚Äôt know how to handle this anymore. I feel like I‚Äôm becoming every awful thing she ever accused me of becoming and I feel like no matter what I do or where I go, I‚Äôll never escape her grasp and she‚Äôll always be manipulating me in some way.

I just don‚Äôt know how to deal with it anymore. Every time I get my hopes up, it seems like they are quickly crushed. When she raised me, she smothered me and forced me not to experience things that would have allowed me to grow, taking control of those situations instead no matter how hard I begged her not to because even then young me knew what it would do to me in the long run.

And here I am now... just about everything I ever feared I would become... a complete and utter failure. I can‚Äôt think, I can‚Äôt control my own actions, not even therapy helps anymore, I can‚Äôt even bring myself to do the things I enjoy, and forming meaningful relationships with other human beings is out of the question because in my 21 years of being alive, I don‚Äôt thing I‚Äôve even managed to do that once.

I mentioned the suicidal thoughts and she said ""why would you want to do that"" I said well mental illness isn't particularly rational. She wanted to know why though. I told her I was bullied from age 4-17 by almost all my classmates for literally every reason possible. It made me upset talking about it and she said that everyone goes through things when their young and people move on from it. She said ""no adult is going to talk to you like that"" I told her it doesn't matter because from all those years it was drilled into my head so much that I started to believe it. She said I looked perfectly fine to her.

It just went on and on.

I was yelling at her trying to explain why I had mental illness, what mental illness was and that she clearly didn't understand. I shouted that she was basically saying I have no reason to be mentally ill and that she was upsetting me. She said ""oh sorry I didn't mean to do that"".

Also my social identity is not consistent at all, to the point where I can‚Äôt even make friends because like two weeks later I‚Äôll be somebody completely different and just vanish from whatever social circle I‚Äôve integrated into without a trace. I‚Äôm often very talkative and engaging when I first meet people, and then after like 2 days I‚Äôm not.

Whatever I do, I just can‚Äôt feel like the same person all the time. I keep trying to force myself to be consistent over and over again but it never works. I just get impulsive and completely derail myself but then turn around and get dead serious about what I‚Äôm going to do only to do a polar 180 flip and blow it off two seconds later.

It‚Äôs like I just can‚Äôt commit to anyone or anything ever and it‚Äôs driving me crazy. I want to accomplish things in life, but I don‚Äôt want to set myself up for disappointment failure, ironically, given the outcome of my actions. It‚Äôs like the second I slow down, I start to see the same people over and over again and slowly they start to grate my nerves so unless I bolt, I‚Äôll feel like an absolute sucker for dealing with their various kinds of bullshit for too long.

Anyway, my parents never let me deal with anything real growing up and I feel like an immature idiot perpetually as a result. My original plan was to join the military so that I‚Äôd stop being such a bitchy little waste of oxygen but it turns out that medically I can‚Äôt so basically I‚Äôm fucked and doomed to be a Peter Pan acting moron for the rest of my life with no hope. I honest to god hope that somebody sends me to prison or something one day because I feel like the only hope I have for my condition is going through something so tremendously painful and traumatic that the toxic childlike box that my parents forced me into fucking explodes and maybe kills me in the process - I don‚Äôt care what comes first, my death or the change I want to see in myself. It‚Äôs not worth it to be alive as who I am right now.

I swear to god I have just been a piece of shit for so fucking long and I don‚Äôt even know how to deal with it anymore. The person my parents accidentally raised me to be needs to die. Period. 

I have no valuable relationships and even my head is starting to implode on itself. I still fear death though and what really gets on my nerves is that maybe the one string even tying my to my will to live anymore is that shitty fucking entitled child inside of me whom I just want to badly to fucking die. It angers me beyond believe to think that the only thing that keeps me alive is the worst part of myself - that unrealistic part of my head that constantly makes me think I deserve things that I make no viable effort to attain.

And it‚Äôs like every time I try to honestly communicate with people, being completely honest, they tell me things like ‚Äúyou need to calm down‚Äù, or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre ignorant and dangerous‚Äù, or ‚Äúyou have a massive superiority complex,‚Äù and at the end of the day, taking all of that in, I just have no idea what to even call myself besides.... shitty.

The one comfort I take in my choices is that for as long as I live, I‚Äôm probably gonna do whatever it takes to keep people away from me so that no matter what I say or do, no one who doesn‚Äôt deserve it will have to face the consequences from my existence. 

I guess the best I can really do is yell about my problems online like I am doing right now because I have two choices: holding my degrading personality in and becoming so awful that my morals completely implode and I become an even worse human being, or just being myself in the least harmful way possible.

So that is basically the shitty story of my life. I have no idea what to do or why I even act the way I act or why therapy doesn‚Äôt even work on me anymore... and I‚Äôm stuck. Stuck being a shitty person in a shitty life and doing shitty things 24/7 while desperately clutching onto the hope (which I could almost call a delusion at this point) that some day I‚Äôll figure out how to not be terrible.
