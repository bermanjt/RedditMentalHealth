0,"What the title says. I can feel love in a platonic sense, but never romantically. As soon as someone admits feelings for me, even if we were great friends before, my go-to instinct is to cut them off. I feel absolutely horrible and fucking hate myself for doing so. At this point I can't even help it, but it's just a habit. I've lost too many friends because of this and I feel like I'm just in a cycle of constantly pushing my closest friends away. I've been trying so hard to stop doing this as of recent, but it's so mentally draining to pretend until I admit to them that I physically can not reciprocate their feelings. No matter how close we are. I'm afraid of hurting them by admitting this however. This is why I either enter a relationship against my will with them, or keep them waiting for an answer. The only time I admitted this to someone who had feelings for me, they didn't accept it at all. They threatened to kill themselves if I didn't get into a relationship with them, regardless of what I'd told them. And when I finally ended it, they screamed at me for lying to them/ leading them on, even though I told them everything beforehand. 

I don't know what to do about this. It's getting me seriously down as of late, as I don't want to push anyone else away. Has anyone gone or is going through a similar thing to this?",03Mar2020,1
2,"So recently I noticed a pattern in my behaviour which leads me to believe I might be depressed and possibly suffering from APD (sociopathy to be exact).

A couple days ago I was watching a video and the subject of sociopathy came up. The video explained how sociopaths are compulsive liars, have trouble forming social bonds, and shape their personality to fit the person they're interacting with.

While I don't usually jump to conclusions it seems to much of a coincidence for me to have almost the exact personality the video described. Growing I told so many lies my own parents don't even trust me anymore and at work I keep finding myself doing things I could easily get fired for all for my own benefit. I don't seek out these things, but when I see an opportunity to get something beneficial I take it and think about it afterwards. When I meet someone I fake being a social type of person while I'm a (probably autistic) introvert. The only thing I don't recoqnize in myself which fits sociopathy is arrogance. The last couple weeks I'm starting to feel more empty and emotionless, feeling worthless and generally feeling lazy and tired. I procrastinate A LOT and I regularly wake up to find myself cancelling plans to go to the gym or other productive things. 

I've also done some online tests (not the most reliable, I know) which all indicate I have a severe risk of being depressed and a very high risk of being a sociopath. They suggest consoling a professional but I'm too scared to confront my parents about it because I feel like they won't understand (my mom is not the brightest and my dad's autistic).

Is there anything I could do to confirm whether I'm depressed/ a sociopath? Is there a way to bring this to my parents in a way they will take me seriously?

Please, any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.",03Mar2020,1
3,"Life, could you please stop beating me and at least let me get up off the floor for a bit?

- Illness within my family, non stop causing me to use all of my sick and over 80% of vacation before March even started.

- Possibility of losing job due to said days off

-Awaiting FMLA/Short term disability to be approved ü§ûü§ûü§û

- Because of submitting for FMLA/ short term disability, I'm losing 28 hours worth of pay that I HAD PAID DAYS OFF FOR THAT WERE COUNTED AGAINST ME so now I want my fucking days back if you're gonna count that shit against me and not pay me for it, but no. I'll never see them nor a dime of what I EARNED VIA THOSE DAYS being you know PAID DAYS OFF?

- Being told I'm ""immature"" by my boss because of a work rule that severely prohibits me keeping contact with my mom whom is a serious fall risk and last time she fell, she laid there, on the floor FOR OVER 8 FUCKING HOURS and im expected to just deal with it? Also a serious coping mechanism that I'm restricted on using which does and HAS affected my productivity and concentration along with pure loathing of going to work everyday in fear ill get caught checking to see if I've a message from my family or switching songs. Yet, ""i ShOuLD Be ThAnKfUl I HaVE iT tHiS gOod"" (no cell phones what so ever to be seen outside of pockets or purses, i cant feel mine go off cause of nerve damage and the vibrations arent strong enuff thru my pants) i cant even, without fear of an immediate write up or termination, change my music or scroll whilst on break or lunch unless im practically out of outing the fucking building. 

- Im over having zero people on my side who genuinely give a shit

- Mental health(and physical obviously) are struggling SO badly I honestly am reaching a breaking point.

- Theres more, of course but as I sit here and type this out, I feel like a fool for even venting and getting this out of my system in a ""healthy"" way because it will do no good. 

Am I just a ""spoiled"" weak person, not worth of living or is there something SERIOUSLY wrong with society these days. Both perhaps?",03Mar2020,1

5,"Hiya! First off, sorry if this isn‚Äôt the right place to put this! I couldn‚Äôt find a more relevant subreddit, so I thought this would be close enough! 

As much as I‚Äôd hate to add onto the list (ADHD, depression, anxiety/social anxiety), but I think there‚Äôs something wrong with me... to put it bluntly, anyways.

You need to be diagnosed by a professional (i believe so anyways). I don‚Äôt even recall how the heck I got diagnosed with my other disorders, one day they were just _there_, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking this because I‚Äôm not so sure on how to go about it!

How would you go about getting checked for possible disorders? This has been on my mind for a while because I noticed something seemed very off about me, and it‚Äôs only got more apparent since then.


Sorry if I sounded... annoying, or really anything bad, in this. If I did, I‚Äôm sorry!! Never posted here or anything regarding this, so idk how to do this lmao


EDIT:// oh, if you wish for me to go deeper into it for more information or anything, lemme know and I‚Äôll reply back with my kindofalreadymade explanation (i do that out of habit lol)!

7,"I sometimes have weird dreams. Not weird as in something literally odd or unreal, as in some giant octopus coming out of space or something along those lines. I mean like I have dreams of common things happening, like being in a car ride, or talking with someone, though these dreams are not anything I had done/have experienced in the past. To say, it's more like glimpses into the future or something. I have poor memory, so I might just be wrong, but I swear I remember having dreams in the past and feeling d√©j√† vu of sorts whenever at random at some point about something I did or done around the current time of remembering. I experienced this quite a few times in my life, the most being four times in the span of two days, two each. Thinking logically, it probably is just me overthinking and falsely remembering things, but I thought I'd ask for a actual answer. I thought I'd try writing down my dreams, though as mentioned, I have poor memory, so I might end up forgetting to do so more than forgetting the dream.",03Mar2020,1
8,"I've struggled with moderate-severe depression and social anxiety my whole life. A few months ago I finally decided to do something about it and I'm actually seeing results. I started seeing a therapist, taking antidepressants, and for a while I fell in love (though I had to move overseas so it didn't work out). 

Since basically November I've been so much more confident, or at least *less* self conscious. When I look in the mirror I no longer see a hideous visage staring back at me, and I actually think I'm pretty attractive; wearing nicer clothes and grooming myself better have contributed to this. I'm still very lonely but I have a bit more hope that someday I'll find someone and I've been maintaining closer relationships with my friends, as hard as it is whilst I'm living abroad.

But, all that said, it feels weird to feel good. It's like I feel like I should be hating myself or having suicidal thoughts but I just can't find those thoughts in my brain and it's making me uncomfortable. I don't plan on stopping treatment or anything but I just wanted to know if anyone else has dealt with this. It's as though I don't know how to function like a normal human being with a healthy mind, it's so counterintuitive. Will this feeling ever end or will I always be a little uncomfortable no matter how much better I get? Any advice would be really appreciated.",03Mar2020,1
9,"I‚Äôve heard depression comes in episodes but I have been in the same mood with no highs or lows for years, since I was about 13 and I‚Äôm 21 now.

We didn‚Äôt argue about anything, had the same values and our goals aligned. When she ended things, I was completely blindsided. Her friends and family reached out to me about the breakup and told me they were very shocked that she ended things because everything appeared to be going well.

I‚Äôm overthinking about her friends and family saying they are shocked.

I‚Äôm overthinking about her mom telling me a couple days ago that she was ‚Äúso sure we would get married‚Äù.

I‚Äôm overthinking about a meme she showed me about being depressed. I‚Äôm overthinking about my response and her lack of reply.

I‚Äôm overthinking about how she is doing. Is she feeling okay? What can I do to help her? How can I support her?

I‚Äôm overthinking about the potential of us getting back together again after the dust settles - but also trying to accept that this may never happen.

I‚Äôm overthinking about the lack of closure and how I didn‚Äôt see this coming at all.

I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. I can‚Äôt stop worrying that she isn‚Äôt okay, but I don‚Äôt want to overwhelm her by coming at her with questions. I want to honor her feelings and give her space if that‚Äôs what she needs. But I am SO worried about her right now.

17,"So I am pretty sure I've struggled with depression for over 10-15 years. I have had ups and downs along the way, had thoughts of dying/wanting to die/or killing myself, binge ate and starved myself, had really high times and really low times. I've made attempts on my own life and thankfully none of them were successful. When I turned 21 I began drinking, responsibly at first, but over time I've started drinking to forget or suppress feelings. I've been easily irritated and exploded in fits of anger at the simplest thing, and I've also gotten incredibly sad and beaten myself up for the same little things. This is easily the hardest thing in my life I've had to admit to, and it was having to admit it to myself that I'm not ""fine"" and that I need help. The other hardest part has been opening up to my therapist, wife, parents, and a few friends. Since admitting I need help and that I've had a problem, it feels as though a weight has been lifted off of my chest. I can finally stop pretending that everything is ""fine"", and I can stop trying to tell myself I don't have a problem.
It is still extremely difficult opening up to people, and it is hard to accept the fact I need help because my mind is still trying to believe the lie I've been living for so long. I'm hopeful that with help I'll get better and finally be a happier person. I hope that for anyone suffering that you are able to reach out and get the help you need and deserve!

24,"Hello all. 34 year old male in the Eastern United States. I'm not sure if this is the right place to frame this question, so maybe if someone thinks there'd be a better avenue, please let me know. I will try not to be too long winded.

I've never had hoards of friends. I have several amazing friends and a great group of amazing acquaintances. The problem is, they're all somewhere else. I relocated a few states away two years ago for my wife's work and so now my closest friends are eight hours or so away. A couple of my best friends struggle with being very sociable, so sometimes texts and phone calls net a decent conversation, however most of the time I feel like I'm just reaching out and we exchange messages for a few minutes and that's that. I've been able to see a few of my good friends on one or two occasions since I've moved.

I haven't really made any friends since we've moved and it sometimes gives me feelings of anxiety thinking about the loneliness and whatnot. I do have a few acquaintances through work, but our interests very too greatly to see me spending too much time with them outside of work.

I came to think about posting this because I just came back from spending a residency weekend on campus at my school- I'm working on an Online MBA (mainly because of my work schedule, not because of any particular anti-social reasons or anything). I had an amazing time with the whole experience. With what little downtime we had, two of the guys in my group and I went out and had several beers, bonding for 6 hours or so before calling it a night. We exchanged numbers, and I connected on  LinkedIn with several people I met over the weekend.

When I got home and had a chance to wind down, I couldn't help but notice my first feelings were of overwhelming loneliness, missing the connection with the guys I met over the weekend too. Is this a normal feeling? Do other people experience these miniature existential crises? It's frustrating. I just don't really know how to process feeling like this, but I do feel like it would help if I could establish a friend group where I am now.

I'm not really sure what I hope to achieve by putting this all out there, beyond confirming my questions I guess. But any insight, or hell, even the conversation would be appreciated.",03Mar2020,1

So I finally found a new, private psychiatrist 6 months ago who has been a Godsend. He's an absolute genius, but also doesn't take himself that serious, is goofy, and is completely present every second when with him. Hard to explain. Anywho when I first saw him, he kind of pointed out some obvious things, ""You've been on serotonin targeting SSRI/SNRI's for over a decade, yet your anxiety hasn't really gotten any more than slightly better from my understanding."" So he said every brain is different and for some antidepressants just aren't the answer yet a lot of psychiatrists/docs keep throwing different versions of the same thing. Antidepressants he explained are like ice cream. Vanilla ice cream is a lot different than chocolate ice cream, but they are still just ice cream (I'm very aware of some SSRIs help a lot people tremendously).

Anyways 2 months ago, we started weaning off the SSRIs and he put me on this anti-convulsant (epilepsy) medication that many people with seizures take. It's off label use, yes, it is a mood stabilizer, but its mostly for epilepsy. He had a reason for why he wanted to target different wiring of my brain with but I didn't really understand. He put me on 200 mg and I noticed it helped a lot. Not a ton, but it helped (like going from a daily anxiety level of 8/10 to a 6-7/10. He said let's stay there for a bit. Well, two days ago I accidentally took double my dose. I didn't even realize it until later that night, but all day I was confused about why anxiety was like 2-3/10. For me, a 5/10 is my baseline. I know I shouldn't of but I felt so much better I said I'm going to take double my dose one more day just to make sure it wasn't a placebo. Felt just as good as the day before. Have 3 more weeks til I see him again, but I think he's on to something with this Lamictal.

Does anyone with a medical background understand why an epilepsy medication is helping me so much with my anxiety? It's baffling me. Trying not to get my hopes up finally something is going to work, but I feel really hopeful for the first time in a long time.",03Mar2020,1

I'm terrible with questions, and I know that's the most important aspect of a conversation, but I can never come up with any.

31,"I was born in Atlanta Georgia USA 1987. I survived a birth that was 2.5 months premature to a heroine addicted mother and have some very minor physical deformities.

These issues were the catalyst for me to invest in being diagnosed with any possible mental illness as my biggest struggles in life were, making friends, doing well in school, and doing things that I knew I was supposed to. 

This completely made me disregard the fact that I had not only had a drug addict mother but experienced severe abuse and neglect after being born. While in my mother's possession I had been kept in boxes alone, beaten, and burned. I have skin grafts from being less than a year old where I was held down and had boiling water poured on top of my foot where my mother thought she could hide it. As I grew older I was still physically neglected and I remember being driven in a car frequently feeling like it was going 100 MPH and my mother picking up some sort of medicine every weekend. It was a square bottle with pink liquid. I learned much later that she never got up on time to get her methadone before the place closed so even thought I held my eyes closed with my hands, and would stomp on an invisible brake, she never made the decision to leave earlier. 

I never knew who my real dad was, didn't have a friend until 12 , never was taken to a doctor as a kid even when needing stitches. 

After having a hard time becoming an adult I decided to see if I might have mental illness. I remember not doing well in school, not having friends, and not doing things I was supposed to do because my parents advice was ""Just do what you're supposed to do"".

Sounds an awful lot like ADHD.

I studied thousands of hours of math concepts, physics, how we build language, and how the brain works for years trying to fix my broken self. 

My struggle comes from being lied to my whole life so when I speak, I don't give people enough verbal information to work with. I had to extrapolate my whole life so I have assumed all of you could too. 

I've gained a very complex study of the physical world and now understand math like never before. I have never gone through the pomp and circumstance of ponzi scheme college so anything that I express that is factual is ruled off as mental illness. 

My issue is telling people what I need from them, being able to explain myself well enough, and why my understanding of certain situations are far more complex than most people. I was trying to fix a problem I didn't have which resulted in the development of a super power at the cost of losing a normal power. 

If you think you have mental illness from trauma, just wait before you tell someone. You probably haven't seen what your real issue is and it is a matter of facing the source of the problem. I personally believe most of, if not all mental illness is behavior illness. I also feel like people don't differentiate between mental disability and mental illness enough because of the stigma on depression.

If you have mental illness, wait on telling someone because they will not see the trauma in your life because you don't either. The first thing anyone should do when expecting mental illness inside themselves is studying how to be self aware and how to observe your emotions so that you can see clearly. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you know someone who has gone through this, STOP BEING INDIRECT TO THEM. STOP CODDLING US. Just tell us the fucking truth so that we don't have faith in you and act on your words. If you don't know what you are talking about, we can't explain that ""the stupid one told me to do that."" People who suffer from trauma need truth because life hasn't been seen for what it truly is yet but trauma victims. Not because they can't, but because we keep blaming the issue on mental disability.",03Mar2020,1
32,"I opened my eye at this morning to the fact that I‚Äôm a loser. I didn‚Äôt realize how bad it is.

In my major at school, literally no one cares about me. I have no friends. No one ever listens when I speak.

I realized that I talk to myself, mostly because no one ever listens and so there isn‚Äôt any point in speaking up.

It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm dumb. It‚Äôs that just that *no one has any respect for me at all,* and even when I suggest a good idea that will help, no one will ever listen. And that‚Äôs just the way it is. No one ever listens.

I think I‚Äôm going to stop trying. If they won‚Äôt listen, I shouldn‚Äôt even try to help. They don‚Äôt deserve it. I will just watch them suffer and I will suffer along with them knowing there is literally nothing I can do to help.

All I want to do is help. That‚Äôs all I ever want to do. I want to use my skills to make the world a better place. But I can‚Äôt, because I don‚Äôt have the skills needed to use my skills.

I just wish I was still depressed. Because it didn‚Äôt hurt like this when I was depressed. Nothing mattered because ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just kill myself anyways.‚Äù I was numb to everything.

36,"Hey all,

Sorry if this is long and rambling- Im not sure where to start on this, I guess lately Ive been feeling really empty. 

Recently I started a new job in a city 2 hours away from my home, I was very excited for this opportunity but I entered into a workplace that is predominately male. Because of this I have found it really hard to make connections, these guys are all bros and while they are polite I feel extremely isolated. 

I came from an office that really was more friendly and diverse..and I felt appreciated and supported so its really hard to walk into this dynamic, more than that I dont feel like Im making the positive impact I thought I would in my position.

I know a lot of the negative things i think my coworkers are thinking about me are probably based on my own thoughts and insecurities. Ive been there for 2 months and I literally go to work and go back to my apartment, its a beach town and i literally cannot  motivate myself to go watch a sunset even though Im 3 minutes from the beach. It all seems so useless without the people I love around me. 

I also have issues with drinking and smoking weed and Im really seeing i use it to quiet my mind. My mind is constanly racing, Im either trying to figure out what people are thinking of me or analyzing all of my actions and motivations and I just feel selfish for how self centric my thinking is. 

I lash out at my bf and lately cant even feel love for him..I feel like I love him when Im away and Im with him I almost feel disgusted. I just feel terrible. I feel like Im using him, I feel like a liar every time I say I love you. But Im just not sure if it is just my mental state thats making me feel this way. I feel.numb

My father recently passed, about 3 weeks ago and there was a lot that was unsaid, he was an alcoholic and very reclusive but always lived in our home. I am afraid I will turn out like him, just watching life go by and pushing people away. 

 In the past I used to hit myself pretty hard when I had a melt down, would threaten suicide and act recklessly; speeding down roads and opening my car door. 

Every time I leave home for work I cry, every time Im at work Im stressed, every time I come home I smoke and drink to soothe myself. I have always felt like I keep everyone at arms length, even my family. I sleep a lot these days because I dont really want to face reality or life. I was thinking about medication but I dont want to be dependent, any thoughts or experiences would be appreciated.

My main issues: Negative self thinking, loud inner dialogue, anxiety especially in social situations, explosive and irrational anger (sober and especially when drunk), inability to maintain relationships, self medication.",03Mar2020,1

42,"Howdy folks, I am a twenty five year old male from canada. I have always struggled with mental illness. But over the last several years I have noticed it start going down hill rapidly.

Growing up I was diagnosed with adhd and a learning disability(somthing to do with fine motorskills). I was relentlessly bullied and made to feel inferior by my peers throughout my tenure in school. I was called a spaz and re***d. As well as physically bullied. I remember in grade school  a group of kids stole one of my shoes and started playing monkey in the middle with it as I ran back and forth frantically trying to get it back. I ended up lashing out and was punished for it. In grade seven I went to a special private school for learning disabled kids where I thrived I made friends and became popular. Heck I even formed the student council which is still going on there. 

But after graduating grade eight I went back to public school and was once again bullied. One of the most noteable instances was where a guy set my beared on fire. I felt awkward and out of place and never really fit in. I would walk around on my breaks alone every day for the first three years.

In my senior year I started becoming severely depressed and could never seem to find anything to look forward too. Even when I had things to be excited about it didnt seem worth the effort. At seventeen near the end of my senior year I had fallen in with the wrong crowed in an attempt to have friends. I would hangout on the streets with the ""street kids"" and various other homeless people. One day I was hanging out with some of the kids from that group who werent street kids. 

They were my group of gay friends.. well at least I thought they were friends. We hung out in the dorm room at a local college of one of the guys boyfriends. Everyone but me had been either drinking or getting high. I decided to go out for a walk with one of them while he had a smoke. We chatted while he smoked then went back to the room. I sat down on the bed and everyone all of a sudden went quiet.

 Next thing I knew each of my arms was grabbed and I was pinned down laying face up on the bed while one of the boys started trying to undo my pants. While this was happening another of the boys started undoing his own pants. I kicked and struggled but they wouldnt let go. Luckily I was saved that day when a fire alarm went off and we were forced to evacuate the building. I have never been comfortable calling this sexual assault as they only managed to undo my pants and pull them down a bit. And to me it would be disrespectful to people who actually were violated.

I felt powerless at that moment. But for me the worst part happened the next day at school. When one of the guys involved started mocking me about it saying stuff like u/yaarimaspacepirate is gay hahahah!. I felt emberassed, humilisted and upset And cut ties with that group of ""friends"".

Moving forward a bit I had graduated highschool and fell into some more risky behaviours. Not wanting to feel weak and having a constant feeling of needing to prove somthing I got into security work and powerlifting.

I felt like I needed to toughen up and I went about it the only way I could think of. Now if you are wondering how powerlifting could be risky behavior. Its because I have a congenital heart defect infact I am going for heart surgery in the next couple months.

The security work wasnt so much risky behavior but some of the things I dealt with on the job over the years led to a substance abuse issue with alcohol and drugs.

Most of the issues from my job stemmed when I started at a hospital many calls I got sent on were high stress. Be it restraining a crack head. Or standing by while a mother and child flatlined during an emergency pregnancy incase the father went berserk. I saw and dealt with alot of things that drove me to the edge regularly. Then one day I had a call I went on where I came in contact with HIV and even though I was clean the incident that ensued around it traumatized me to the point where I didnt sleep for a month. 

Needless to say by the time I left the hospital I had started developing some unhealthy eating habits and gained alot if weight. As well as a drinking problem. I genuinely hate the taste of alcohol but the feeling of being drunk and forgetting seemed to solve all my problems at the time. I realize now I was wrong. After a year or so since I had left the hospital I began working as a bouncer. 

That was a stressful job as well and it was at that point my drug habit started. I began habitually using marijuana everyday all day. I would show up to work high and light up the second I left. This just got worse as time went on and stress built up. 

This particular year had been really hard on me as I had been struggling with coming out of the closet. It was also around this time I realized I was struggling with intimacy. Right after coming out I met a guy while I was working. He came over one day and we were snuggling on the couch watching familyguy on tv. 

All of a sudden as I was holding this guy in my arms he started laughing really hard. My body tensed up and for a moment I was back in the hospital emergency room restraining a crack head it scared me shitless and I panicked. I havent been able to be intimate since.

 Eventually I left my regular bar gig after my employer tried to have me break the law for them. I told him I wouldnt. I wasnt in the mood to put my saftey on the line for a place that I was getting assaulted at for minimum wage(two weeks in a row prior I had been assaulted on the job). It gave me a real perspective on my life as far as how I had fallen. After I left the bar I became even more depressed I started having suicidal thoughts and feeling worthless.  

I never admitted it to anyone because I was scared. I had experienced the mental health system while working in a hospital and didnt want to be like all the people I had to go on calls for over the years when I worked there. So I told myself to buck up and push onwards. My use of drugs and alcohol increased as this happened and I moved onto trying other substances. Things like tobacco for poppers and abusing adhd meds to get high when I had no weed(went through an entire bottle one day and could have died).

 For a while I had no job and lived in fear of becoming homeless. I had panic attacks everyday there were times I went hungry for three or four days at a time. But finally I landed another job in security and then worked everyday to get some money. I took as many shifts as I could and eventually it paid off I landed a regular overnight job(I ended up working seven days a week in the long run here due to staff shortages). And at this point my abuse of drugs and alcohol was in full swing. 

It started off slow I would smoke a vape pen on weekend shifts to get stoned. Then one night I was offered a one night personal contract for a bar job.
This was literally one of the worst nights of my life. A guy overdosed at a rave happening in the bar and I had to try and keep him alive until ems arrived. 

He was still breathing but it was incredibly shallow. 
So aside from moving him off the dance floor to lay him out safely, put him in recovery and administer narcan that the bar had on hand. And was trained to use. There wasnt much I could do. Sometimes I can still picture his face in my head. And the memories of that night randomly pop into my mind. When they do I get super quiet and distant. I was told he lived but it was genuinely one of the most harrowing experiences I ever dealt with. After this night my substance abuse really kicked off. I was drunk and stoned all day everyday even at work.

 It was also during this time that almost all if my friends dropped contact with me. I was incredibly hurt by them doing so and at the time felt betrayed.  After all I was struggling and suffering and I felt they abandond me. However I realize now they did it because they have to look after themselves first. My problems arent their problems and they did all they could.

I tried going to therapy during this time as well but it didnt help. I didnt want to help myself so how could I expect anyone to be able to help me. Not long after this I got a new job as supervisor closer to my family and moved. During my time in the place I moved to I started feeling increasingly more lonely. I was constantly worried I would be kicked out and lose my job.

Due to this I began drinking and popping one hundred mg edibles everynight. Id usually go through about three one hundred mg tablets and a bottle of wine a night. My life was spiraling out of control and I was giving up my will to live. I was a mess. 

Then it happened I was given notice to move out because I couldnt keep my shit together my room was a dump my life was a mess. I didnt want to be homeless and I was terrified. However thankfully I still had a job so I moved home.

From the get go since I got back it wasnt easy. I managed to stop the drugs for a bit but fell right back into using. As well as drinking. One night I came home from work and found all the empty liquor bottles I had gone through on the counter of the kitchen. I was forced to confront my drinking. That was almost six months ago. For months after I continued to smoke weed. But evantually That to stopped. It wasnt so hard when I was told I needed heart surgery.

It hasnt been easy. But since I moved home I have started saving in an investments account and have saved up for an ebike to get to work. I went back to school to finally finish somthing and I am excelling with online learning. I dropped out of college two times previously first was due to lack of motivation and the second was due to the substance abuse. And with the help of my dad whos a recovering alcoholic, my mom whos incredibly patient and my cat jag who comforts me by nuzzling my arm and head when I am anxious im getting through this. On top of this I have also lost a lot of weight I was two hundred and nintey lbs I am now down to two fourty six lbs(and dropping).

My job is going awsome and I am starting to feel some hope for the future. Mostly now I just worry about my upcoming aortic valve surgery and if I will somehow be the one-two percent exception who doesnt survive. None of the doctors are worried not my gp or my surgeon. But im still abit scared. However with the help of my friend at work. An older gentleman who had heart surgery last year I am learning to accept that I will most likely be okay.

Anyways sorry its a long post I just needed to vent and this seemed like a good place to unload.",03Mar2020,1

44,"Hey there, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but hey ho.

I'm going through a rough patch at the moment, a very tough patch. Without going into depth it's an old sexual assault case being resurfaced and doing through the courts.

I'm only young, 18 and wanting to push my career so am starting university in September. I decided to work at my local fuel station on the nightshifts for some good paying money.

I'm starting to see things in the corners of my eyes, things running past the windows at work, normal objects as figures, hearing strange noises that I am DEFINTE are at my night pay window but no one is there, voices, knocking on the window or cars pulling up.

I'm not a delusional person, always level headed and relatively calm. Even this whole situation hasn't broken me down too much.

Most of these could usually be put off, but I live in a tiny village where I would usually get possibly 10 customers a night in an 8 hour shift. I can easily go 5 hours without seeing someone and having only Netflix and cleaning to keep me occupied.

This is doubled with college so while I am tired most of the time, I wouldnt say this is out of the norm. I am used to going without sleep most nights from my younger years.

Im just really confused and wondering if anyone has any ideas, any experiences in the matter or advice. I dont want this to be a regular occurrence, it's really freaking me out.",03Mar2020,1

48,"Closing up here on this account, it's been compromised.  There are more conventional ways of contacting and interacting with people than metaphysically and psychopathically.  This has happened on a few different accounts online.  I do not understand why someone just can't approach someone with beer, tea or coffee.  I'm not all about the metaphysics in trying to communicate with people.  I haven't got much left to go on about, this account is compromised.  I was going on about the meta and paranormal stuff.  I'm not trying to make to many assumptions on religious matters.  There are scholars and diplomats about it and I was constantly scorned for sharing my visions and people kept calling blasphemy on me.  SO it wasn't only cultists, fanatics and Daemons that wanted to crucify and torch me, it was the pagans, atheists and conglomerate organizations of Mankind.  

So I have decided to relent on all that for the time being, maybe 20 years or so of studying and I'll be on level, these people were trying to make me look like a cunt.   Not all the politics about religion is there though, like separation of Church and State, the Nobility, Aristocracy and former caste system.  These are things I rarely see mentioned when people talk about religion. 

I am not a degenerate or paranoid schizophrenic.  I wasn't a real by the book or complete doctrine person. I have seen things in my mind and I share them, sometimes they turn out to be true, sometimes immediately.  I do not know how to explain the phenomenon, some just consider it coincidence.  The more deep and open I tried to get the more compromising and alienated I became.  I was completely unaware of the overwhelming stigma's that had come regarding paranormal and religious things.  So I looked like a bit of a loony to some folks.  I had mentioned slavery and forgot to mention organized marriage as well is still going on.

  Amid people out there trying to compromise me, I would bug out on occasion, then go back into my shell.  I get psyched out and ready to exploit myself or I back out.  Back and forth, I was trying to re-enlist for a time, compromising my identity and all this wasn't the biggest issue.  It was just a pain in the ass and all, these people were trying to make me look like a cunt.  You got these kids in the military now running around with their camera's, filming little documentaries about their 4 year enlistment. 
 I don't have an ego like that, nor did I know anyone like that.  There was none of these soldiers documenting nothing in my day, I barely have any pictures.  Anytime I even mention the service we got some crazed E8 coming out of the bushes.  I even get on the forum telling these kids like, opsec, you should clear that with the mods before posting, they tell me to stop because they want to make asses of these people and the military.  I do not understand how the military hasn't gone back to privatizing the organization.  

I was becoming more exhausted with people animosity in personal experiences.  People wanted to fight, some assees had been whipped besides mine. They wanted me to fight, I'm not entertaining these god damn animals.  Then they thought I was having an identity crisis, I thought I was John Cena.  I was joking about having an identity crisis, I'm not John Cena or John Wick.  But, I need at least 6 months of training and would gladly make me wrestlin debut being put in a wheel chair by John Cena, why wouldn't I take it up?  Just kidding, I don't think paralyses and more TBI's is worth entertaining these god damn animals - should I be propositioned for the Kumite.  I shall train in the mean time.  People wanted John to fight me, we could never be best friends.  I do not even watch these films or wrestling by the way.  However, they're amazing peoples in this nightmare world and do a lot of charities, they're really good people.  

I was out of the gym for a few months now, stress, injuries, sick - something.  I usually fast, east about 2000 calories a day, fast regularly.  I just did a light work out, 20 mins cardio, light full body workout, in pain today.  I figured I would be but I also went into a feeding frenzy.  That's what happened last time, so I'de been feasting like a King the last two days.  I crashed and went into a feeding frenzy last time.  I enjoy exercise, it makes me happy, I suggest diet and exercise to you all as it is therapeutic and the best medicine.

Some things I had to realize were I'm a great and good morally compassed person.  I'm not to worried about compensating.  But, there were some people out there, some fucked up people, soilin my rep.  I would hate to get stole and some bullshit story  spoiling my legacy transpired, which has happened to a lot of people throughout history.  Not that I'm anyone in this world, it's just a crime and injustice.  Conspiracy which I had also mentioned, erasing people, evidence and history.



I'll work on re-collecting myself and think of what to do.

This addiction is worse than any shitty trailer park drug you could find, I'd honestly rather be hooked on black tar heroin rather than video games. The only thing that keeps me going is the hope that maybe one day I'll find something that fulfills me, like a good job or a family. However, growing up on video games has pretty obviously limited my charisma and social skills. Eventually, that hope is gonna run dry.

50,"I honestly shouldn't be. I am back living with my dad after having moved out in 2014, and he basically caters to my every need, but I think that pushes me further into this rut that I'm in.

Some background: I was diagnosed with PTSD and general depression in 2014 after being admitted for suicidal thoughts. The depression was from, as far as I can tell, losing my younger brother when I was 3 years old. Then it only got worse as I grew up, through nearly daily domestic violence between my mother and her husband. (parents never married, shared custody) 

The PTSD is a combination of two separate events, the first being a car accident when I was 10, was literal inches from being crushed by twisted metal. The accident lead my mother to become hooked on opioid pain killers, which lead to the second event: my mom's boyfriend in 2011 was physically abusing her, and I attempted to stop him, he nearly killed me that night. When I told my mom to get rid of the guy or lose me, she chose him for sex and drugs over me. 

I went on to do well in high school, but right before enrolling in college, she became sick from the drugs she kept taking after I left her to live with my dad (she made me constantly feel as though her decline was my fault) I tried to fight through the depression that sent me through, but it eventually lead to a suicide attempt.

I dropped out, and after a few months of nothing, I got help. From Summer 2014 - August 2015, I was making progress, got a job, counseling, and other support networks. But then I got the call, while I was at work, that my mom had died of an OD. I got sent into a spiral. By this time, I was living with a co-worker, my dad had moved 300 miles away. So I was alone.
 My cousin came in and had me live with him for the following 4 years, but we clashed a lot, too, due to my triggers. I had started thinking of ending it, because my job was screwing with my health, physically and mentally, and my cousin wasn't the best roommate, either. I quit my job, and then he and I got into another big fight. It became clear we could no longer live together.

My dad has allowed me to come back to him, and it's been a few months now, and I have kinda just stagnated. I guess, what I'm saying is, I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing now, and it becomes so daunting to even consider what I need to do.

51,"Obviously with a mental illness like depression, one's brain doesn't work properly so simple logical reasoning is extremely difficult to use unless one's analysis level is at the level of a World Debate champion or something. For instance, someone might say that ""done so much wrong already"" and that it's ""too late to change"" so they'll just continue doing bad things because they believe that they're a bad person. Obviously that's not true because people always change (be it physically through growth or mentally through hormones or even in what you want to do). That should be common sense for most people. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really just don't understand how to convince someone with depression that the assumptions they make about the world and the people around them aren't true. It's very frustrating for me and it leaves me feeling so damn powerless knowing that my words are cries on deaf ears. I can't understand them and they can't understand me.

56,"I'm copying this post from r/anxiety to here to get more responses.


I didn't really know which subreddit to post this in, I just need to open up about this a little bit.

Tommorow, I'm going to attend my first day at a partial hospitalization Program that is 7/8 hours a day. I'm doing this because my therapist believes it will really help me, and I trust her judgement. This will last at least two weeks, or until I feel like I can improve how I feel.

I am diagnosed with MDD (Major Depressive Disorder), GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder), and ADHD-C (Hyperactive and Inattentive).

I know deep down that this is the right thing to do, it's just I'm a college student and I have always had high standards for myself regarding academic achievement and not giving up. Doing this program means I am probably withdrawing and costing my parents money for financial aid even though I've only done about a month this semester.

I really suffered through my first semester with panic attacks, constantly feeling depressed, worthless, self hating etc, daily intrusive thoughts and feelings that would stop me from doing basic things ( like I wouldn't go to the bathroom if someone else was in it), and I could never focus on my work and it really got to me. I secluded myself because I lived on campus and it really took a toll on me.

I also had a few instances of self harm during high school, and had a breakup over a year and a half ago that destroyed me. I lost my best friend who was also my gf at the time, along with the group of friends I saw every day for years that still chill with her. 

I recently relapsed with self harm, and the trigger was news that I got that my ex is dating someone who I know is deep into drugs, a bad student and other things. I feel as though I've gotten over her as a gf, but I still haven't gotten over the loss of a person who I've had the upmost respect for and who I've connected with in every way. I've have not felt this connection (romantically or in a friendship) since.

I keep losing track of my thoughts as I am writing this, so it may sound unorganized and frantic.

I've been on countless medications to try and help me with my anxiety, depression and ADHD, but apparently I'm one of a very low percentage of people who react adversely to medication. These meds have all taken their tolls on my mental health and my hope that things will get better. 

This program that I am going in is stopping me from completing this semester, and school was my only ""job"" and only large responsibility. I feel as though I'm failing myself and my family, and I just want to be like the people who can function and push past their problems. I had no trouble completing high school, and it was very easy for me to pass without much effort and basically no studying. This caused me to have no study skills and I was not prepared for the college workload, especially when I got worse during and after my senior year of high school directly after my breakup.

I again lost my train of thought even though I feel I have so much to write about.

Basically, I'm seeing a therapist weekly, tried tons of different medications, and I'm really trying to be better but I keep letting myself and my family down. 

Also, I smoke weed regularly because it is the only medication that has had long-term beneficial effects on me. Recently, I was caught with product and a piece and charged with two misdemeanors, and this is going to cost my family hundreds of dollars in court fees and I probably will have to complete some program for my sentence. I have stopped smoking because I am afraid of a drug test from the law, and this has caused me to have vivid dreams every night. I used to dream about my ex and times that we used to have, but now the dreams feel like times that haven't happened and I don't feel anything towards her in these dreams. They're just innocent and friendly interactions like when we were just friends. These are taking a toll on me because I remember everything when I wake up. 

I've also had another really good friend move away last year, and my current best friend was kicked out of his house and lived with us for a while, and just moved out of state two days ago. My other friend just had a child with someone at a young age, so I haven't been able to see him. I have nobody else.

My thoughts are racing again and I cannot focus on what I want to write so I'm going to end this here, I'm basically looking for validation that this program is what I need, and that it's ok that I'm stopping school to focus on myself and my mental health.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you all have good fortune and happiness.",03Mar2020,1
57,"My father committed suicide when I was 8 years old and I found his body. Since then I have battled with PTSD and depression in varying levels of intensity. 

Things reached their worse when I broke up with my girlfriend around December 2018. I found myself in a downhill spiral where I was self harming, drinking, chain smoking and working 60 hours a week in a job that I hated and I attempted suicide around 6-7 times.

Eventually I was able to get my life in order a little bit, I got back with my girlfriend and moved 153 miles away from home with her and out of my family home for the first time. I have a job I love and me and my girlfriend almost never argue and I‚Äôve started regularly going to the gym and creating music as an outlet for any emotions I may have and all m symptoms of depression and anxiety were non-existent.

This had all been going super well until about 2-3 weeks ago when I suddenly found myself only able to get 3-4 hours of sleep a night if I was lucky, whilst some days I would be awake all through the night and miss a whole nights worth of sleep.

58,"I am 25 years old and ive been drifting in my life since I was about 16. I dropped out of HS after the first year and not due to bad grades or lack of knowledge, I was a solid 85 student.

60,"     I have always felt this constant dull feeling. It's been a feeling that's been with me since I was a kid. The best way to describe it is a grey feeling, not happy and not overly upset. It had been around for such a long time, and I'm sick of it. When I watch other people laugh around me it makes me jealous because I can't remember the last time I laughed and it was genuine. My emotions don't feel real and i sometimes don't think they are. I can't ever find interest in anything, and I've tried everything like drawing, running, 5 different sports, singing, jobs, TV shows, reading, video games, trying hard in academics, going to parties, and every kind of friend group. And yet nothing has ever been able to make me interested. When I date, I date hoping that the person will be able to make me interested in something, and it works for about a week, but that's about it.
 I don't know if there's something wrong with me, or if I'm just feeling something that everyone else feels.

62,"Every single day, after class, I would sit on the bed in my dorm room and

attempt to do my homework. It was hard to focus. I would start to get anxious

because I knew that being alone in my room meant one of two things; that he would

be coming over soon or that he was mad at me. I don‚Äôt know which one terrified me

more.¬†

It was my first semester of college, and I was supposed to be having the

adventure of a lifetime. I was studying abroad, as a first semester freshman: a

challenge only about four percent of American college students take on. While I had

my whole life and endless possibilities in front of me, sometimes I struggled because

it felt like I lost everything. I grew up on the same street as my entire family. I went to

a high school that fostered the growth of community. My nearly three-year-long

relationship ended days before I hopped on the transatlantic flight to Europe.

No matter where you go to college, in America or abroad, the first few weeks

are all about meeting people. I introduced myself to many people and I befriended

my roommates, a couple of girls from orientation, and my neighbors.¬†

He lived in the apartment next door: room 104. We had some mutual friends

who introduced us, and from the moment I met him, I found him ignorant and

insulting. He told me that studying abroad for your first semester was a waste of time.

He talked about how he got exceptionally high SAT scores. He went on and on about

how he got into Cornell, but in spite of all of his bragging and criticism, the fact was

that we had ended up in the same place.

At the end of our conversation I figured I would never have to see him again,

but before I left, he asked, ‚Äúhey, can I have your snapchat? You know, just in case

we never see each other again.‚Äù

Reluctantly I gave it to him. I mean, what was the harm in giving a neighbor

my snapchat? In fact, it made me feel wanted: a feeling I had been craving since my

break-up.¬†

He started snapchatting me constantly. I had never been one to keep up

snapchat streaks or even use snapchat as a primary method of communication, but

his messages were frequent.¬†

My first few weeks in Rome were filled with small adventures. I adjusted to the

culture, the food, my new surroundings, and my newfound freedoms.

On one particular alcohol-filled evening, I received a message from him saying

‚Äúare you drunk?‚Äù and I, oblivious, replied, ‚Äúyeah‚Äù. Within seconds he responded, ‚Äúcan

I come over?‚Äù¬†

This was my very first red flag, and while his comment definitely sobered me

up and spooked me, I ignored it and decided to move on. My closest friends told me

to stay away from him. They had valid points, but I didn‚Äôt listen. Looking back, I

should have done something then. There was a thought in the back of my head

saying that I should report him or at least confront him, but I did nothing.¬†

The second red flag was when he started sending me pornographic videos

and sexual memes. This sign was much more vibrant.

I walked into my apartment asking, ‚ÄúWhat is the actual definition of sexual

harassment?‚Äù and of course, with this kind of question, my roommates begged for a

reason as to why I was pondering on this. My roommates, being much more

outspoken, talked to him and when confronted, he chalked it all off to be some sort of

joke that I was too immature to understand. This was the first time he belittled me

and humiliated me in front of my peers. Still, I did nothing.

Every day after my classes I would wait. He would either be sitting in my bed,

waiting for me to get home, or would walk into my room. I never argued with him

about being there, but I never invited him over. I was scared to tell him to leave

because I did not want to face rejection again. I appreciated the attention, and

although I never asked for it or implied that I wanted it, I didn‚Äôt push him away.¬†

Things escalated quickly. I can remember exactly where the physical part of

the relationship started. It began on the night the Red Sox won the World Series. I

stayed awake to watch the game even though my time zone was six hours ahead,

and he stayed up with me. I fell asleep on the couch, and even though I had told him

countless times I did not want a relationship or hookup, once I fell asleep, he kissed

me.¬†

I can see how he may have seen this as a romantic gesture, but the next day,

the boys from the room next door started asking me about it.¬†

‚ÄúSo, we heard that you guys kissed.‚Äù

I explained the situation, and when I told my friends, they found it as creepy as

I did. I knew it was wrong, but I just wanted to pretend it didn\&amp;#39;t happen. I had

expressed plenty of times that I still did not want a relationship, and I thought he

understood that. He should have understood that.

After the unconscious kiss, he started to physically take advantage of me

more and more. Seeing how I did nothing when he targeted me emotionally, and not

confronting him when he was doing something physically, as small as it was, he

encroached more and more into my comfort zone.¬†

He started kissing me more frequently, but only when I was drunk. At this point

in the semester, I was in the guilt phase of grief, and as a coping mechanism, I was

going out to the bars several times a week. Whenever I would go out to drink, I would

come home and he would be waiting there, in the apartment, either talking to my

roommates or waiting on my bed. He started to put them under a spell, and they

began encouraging us to be together. I can still remember them winking at me and

leaving the room, leaving him and I together.¬†I remember trying to communicate the

dread with my eyes and hoping they would help me.

One time, I was lying in my bed, head spinning because I had pushed my

alcohol limits, and I remember him standing in my doorway. I slightly opened my

eyes and saw the shadow of the closing door. I didn‚Äôt realize he was actually in the

room until he started climbing on top of me. I was barely conscious, but he was

kissing me, grabbing me. He whispered in my ear, ‚Äúwe should do this again when

you‚Äôre sober.‚Äù¬†

Many times, I told him I wasn‚Äôt interested, and then when I was drunk, we

would make out again and things would get confusing. I tried giving the excuse that I

had not moved on from my last boyfriend, which was true, but he never seemed to

care. Multiple times I tried to end it, whatever IT was, but he would always come

back, sitting in my room, refusing to take no for an answer.

This should have been my warning sign, foreshadowing the things that were to

come if I didn‚Äôt put an end to it. This should have put me over the edge. I should have

seen how the word ‚Äúno‚Äù did not register in his mind. If I could go back in time, I would

shake myself and scream, ‚ÄúSnap out of it!‚Äù¬†

Even though I knew that everything happening was wrong, and he was awful

for me, I still did not want to have those lonely feelings that come in the period of time

after a break-up, so I did nothing. In that moment, I figured that being loved by a

selfish, hateful, pathological liar was better than not being loved at all. I gave him that

consent: the consent to love me.¬†

I think that is the true danger of being in love. Once you fall in love once, you

are addicted. You crave the feeling of being held, sought, or wanted. You want

someone to want you. Even when you don‚Äôt want them back, it is hard to tell them

no, because you are grasping on to those old feelings of being in love and being

loved.¬†

Little did I know, that this feeling, the feeling of running from grief, was only

delaying my true pain for later.

Another big ‚Äúred flag moment‚Äù, as I am now going to call them, was the first

time he ever made me touch him. He was lying in my bed, even after I had

repeatedly asked him not to. The thing about him, if you had not picked up on it

already, is that he is a pathological liar. He ropes you in, sharing something personal

or making you feel like your opinion mattered and would be accepted. Then, he

would either be a hypocrite and do the opposite of what you asked, or he would

manipulate your words. As many times as I had asked him to get out of my bed, he

would make me feel guilty about it. In the end, I didn‚Äôt want to fight, so I would just

give in and let him stay. Anyways, as I was leaving, and he jumped up and held me

back.¬†

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt leave until you finish me.‚Äù¬†

At first, I thought he was joking, so I laughed and reached for the door handle,

but he pulled me back.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not joking.‚Äù

I have loads of stories, many similar to the previous one, that send shivers up

my spine every time I tell them or think about them. But the one story that will always

stand out to me is when we went to Paris.

Because of recent political turmoil in France, my parents didn‚Äôt want me going

to Paris by myself, so I started looking for someone, anyone, to go with me. The only

person available on such short notice was him. So, we booked our trip and even

though I had expressed that this was not a romantic trip at all, we flew into the City of

Love.¬†

Things were going great up until dinner. I have not mentioned this yet, but he

doesn‚Äôt drink. I‚Äôm not saying this in a critical way, I‚Äôm just saying this to highlight my

feelings of surprise when he ordered us a bottle of nice Chardonnay at dinner. We

each had a glass and after he had finished his, he announced to me that he did not

like wine, and since the bottle couldn‚Äôt be taken to-go, I should drink as much of it as

I could. I did not finish the entire bottle, but for a lightweight, I did drink a large portion

of it, and started feeling the effects on the drive back to the hostel.

In my woozy state, he guided me into the elevator. I was certain he was taking

me back to our room that we were sharing with two other strangers, but suddenly we

were on the abandoned rooftop floor, and I was being pushed against the wall. He

was kissing me, grabbing me, hurting me, and I was confused. The room was dizzy,

and my eyes searched to find one thing to focus on. My brain was not processing

what was happening. I started moving my arms, waving, hoping someone could see.¬†

I am a strong girl, physically, and I would like to say emotionally- though after

reading this story you may not believe I am the latter- but in my drunk state, I could

not find the strength to fight, so my body shut down.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, but he kept going. He had me pinned. This was the moment that

the whole semester had accumulated into. Everything that had happened between

him and I before this had led to this moment, here, on the rooftop of the

hostel in Paris, France. I had done nothing to stop him previously, and now it was too

late.¬†

I had done nothing before. We always here the phrase, fight or flight. In reality,

we either fight, flight, or freeze. My body knew I couldn‚Äôt fight him off, I couldn‚Äôt run,

so I froze. I couldn‚Äôt breathe, I couldn‚Äôt see, I lacked all control. I felt nothing as his

body pushed on mine.

It feels like you‚Äôre nothing.

The next morning, I wouldn‚Äôt, I couldn‚Äôt, make eye contact with him. He asked

me if I remembered anything from the previous night.

‚ÄúNo, I had too much wine and blacked out.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a shame; we had a really nice conversation.‚Äù

Months later, when we got back to Boston, we grew distant. There was one

final encounter where I yelled at him, but not for the reasons you might be thinking.

No, I did not yell at him for the sexual harassment messages and photos he had sent

me earlier last semester or taking advantage of my vulnerability when I was drunk. I

did not even yell at him for the incident in Paris.

I yelled at him because he had stopped being my friend. All along, this is what

I had wanted from him: to be someone to lean on. When he realized that this was all I

wanted, and that he couldn‚Äôt force his way onto me forever, he left.¬†

All of the fears I had been running from, the fear of rejection, of not being

loved, of being alone, were all rushing in on me. This was the moment I realized how

huge of a mistake I had made. I tried to dodge the grieving process by letting this

man take advantage of me in my vulnerable state, and now I was feeling all of the

natural emotions in an elevated platform.

Once we had separated, and I had actually distanced myself from him, that is

when the aftershock started to kick in. It began with the panic attacks. There were

always triggers. They would mostly happen while I was alone in my room, but

sometimes it would happen in the most inconvenient locations.

It happened in the silent section of the library, when I saw one of his friends

from home who also goes to our school. I had another episode when I was

refereeing a volleyball match and the player looked just like him. How embarrassing it

is to have a panic attack on my first day of my new refereeing job and have to lie to

my new coworkers, saying that my panic attack, which symptoms include sweating

and shortness of breath, was just an asthma attack.¬†

After the panic attacks started happening, I started getting nightmares. I kept

having dreams that I was back on that abandoned rooftop floor in Paris. In my

dreams, there was always a dizzy perspective and they always included me trying to

get eye contact with the video camera. In some dreams I was paralyzed, trying to

push back. Sometimes I would try to scream but have no voice. All of the dreams

varied, but one thing was always certain- I couldn‚Äôt break free.¬†

Another time I had a dream that I was lying on my old dorm room bed, and he

was on top of me. I would try to wrestle him off, but I was pinned. When I would wake

up, I always found myself in a sweat, tangled in my sheets.

I booked an appointment with the University Health and Counseling Services.

The closest appointment they had was in three weeks, so I scheduled it and waited

while my panic attacks and nightmares persisted. Hours before my appointment with

a counselor, they called me saying they would have to reschedule until next week, so

I waited again.¬†

When I finally did get to meet with a counselor, I was excited to finally be able

to have a full hour to talk with someone about everything. I was hopeful that I would

receive coping mechanisms to try on my own. I sat down in the comfy chair in the

counselor‚Äôs office and she handed me a clipboard.¬†

‚ÄúSign this please, to prove you were here.‚Äù¬†

I signed the paper, and then I began my story. As I told the woman about

everything that had been happening to me, the events, the panic attacks, the restless

nights, the terrifying dreams, she interrupted me.¬†

‚ÄúBut wouldn‚Äôt you say that all of this happened because you chose it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I mean, I guess, but-‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre looking at things from your point of view. You chose to engage

with him. You chose to go to Paris. You chose to let him into your life. You can‚Äôt

blame him.‚Äù

I was confused. I hadn‚Äôt even been in the room for ten minutes and I already

felt belittled. I was being put back into the box that he had put me in. I was being

blamed. In this counselor‚Äôs eyes, I was the villain of my own story. To her, I allowed

all of this to happen. To her, I was overreacting, and this was all my fault. To her, and

to the rest of the world, this all happened because I did nothing.¬†

Growing up, I always thought of myself as a strong woman, and even now,

after all of this, I still believe that. We are always told that sexual assaults happen to

girls who walk down dark alleys or wear revealing clothing. We are always taught that

sexual assaults are violent and are done by people we don‚Äôt know.¬†

The truth is, for a time I did care about him. After the breakup I went through

before I left for Italy, I actually thought that if I ever wanted to have someone love me

again, this was the price I was going to have to pay.",03Mar2020,1
64,"Ok so normally I'd just work out my issues by myself by letting my thoughts process things and devise a solution. But lately that hasn't worked for my current situation and despite a lot of things happening that should make it better I still can't seem to be my usual self again.   


I don't find much success in talking about my problems cause someone either doesn't have the answers I want or they say the things I want to hear but I dismiss them as kind words said just to make me feel better.

67,"What is Mine

I internalize my stress.
Lonely is the name of my enemy.
Myself I try to oppress.
This hole might be the end of me.
I must set out to encounter,
people likeminded so passionatley.
When i'm not around her,
the space between brings anxiety.


/*Just a vent post. Im no poet but this helped me derive some deeper emotions. Even though I am around my friends of many years, some from childhood, at college I still feel an empty loneliness at the end of the day. It might be the looming stress of getting into the real world. I don't understand why some aspects of my future are so unsettling. Im definitely not the best Electrical Engineering student and sometimes that weighs on me that I could/should be doing more. I fear the chance that I won't be able to fully send the relationship with my girlfriend after college because ill be limited in options as far as location us concerned. Its a long distance one at the moment but it had its roots planted well before college so thats not my worry. I don't think I could tell anyone these secret pains but her but i feel as though it is wrong to bring these to her and have her worry about affairs that she cannot help me in. I Love Her, it would be wrong to emotionally burden her with these as she has her own stresses to content with, we all do.

Tldr; Sometimes the people who shine the brightest or appear as though they are always enjoying life secretly internalize their problems to protect those they care about.",03Mar2020,1
68,"Okay this might be a long shot here, but an interesting thought just popped into my head. 

I went through the onset of schizophrenia almost ten years ago. Since then I have been struggling with symptoms varying in intensity. 
Here comes the interesting part. 

So my body is wrecked. I'm fat, I drink, I eat like shit, I don't exercise. I have had my fair share of health scares before, but I usually don't bother to really get things checked out. Like, pain in the chest for example. I don't bother to get that checked even though I have two cases in my family of known heart problems. One uncle even died of it. I bleed from my anus occasionally. You know, lots of different shit, that might mean something, or perhaps don't. 

What I just now thought about is that maybe I am passively killing myself by letting my physical condition go to shit? 

I don't think I have a death wish and I don't want to actively kill myself. 

What if instead I just let my body go down the drain, so the choice is taken off my hands? 

This is pretty spooky stuff to think about. I am not even sure if that's the case here, but it might be something subconscious at play here. 

What are your thoughts?",03Mar2020,1
69,"I‚Äôm not sure what to do anymore. I thought I had life sorted out, but for the last five years or so my mental health has been on a decline. My situation seems to be most of the problem. Every time I start to feel like things are going well or I‚Äôm finally poking my head above water, something usually comes out of nowhere to ruin things.

For example: I spent this winter working hard to make sure I had money to cover bills and still get out to do something once in a long while. Nothing extravagant, just something, anything other than sitting in the house watching YouTube because I‚Äôm too scared to spend money on a subscription service. I finally caught up and paid rent on time this month! That was a huge thing for me. Then I found out that I actually owe money on my taxes for the first time in my life and it‚Äôs like $500 between state and federal. Then, out of nowhere, I get a court summons today - likely for one of the bills I‚Äôve been putting off because I haven‚Äôt had money to pay it.

All of it is more money than I could dream of having. If I worked all the hours I possibly could, ate a cup of ramen a day, and spent the rest of the time sleeping, I still wouldn‚Äôt have enough money to pay all of these people who want to bleed me dry. Yes I‚Äôve made mistakes, yes I‚Äôm trying to fix them, but I need the basics under control before I can pay debts.

I‚Äôve been under so much stress that my doctors (paid thankfully by Medicaid) have me on a cocktail of meds just to make it through the day. I took a look at my life today and was so ashamed at what I‚Äôve become that I wanted to take my own life. I wanted it more than I‚Äôve ever wanted it before. I just wanted everything to end so I could have those few seconds of relief before it would all be over. 

I didn‚Äôt do it, obviously, but I crave that feeling of not having to worry about anything anymore. I guess I‚Äôm just writing to get people‚Äôs opinions and see how other people are doing. Have you gotten out of a hole you dug for yourself? How did you do it? How much support did you need? Things like that.

And thanks for reading. It‚Äôs my first time on this sub, so I‚Äôm not sure what to expect.",03Mar2020,1
70,"I was talking to people I know who have moderate anxiety and depression and they went through the whole process in 1-2 visits to a professional  and were diagnosed,prescribed meds and given the help they need

I have daily auditory hallucinations(occasional visual),paranoia, prior self harm, prior severe depression and severe anxiety,depersonalisation and derealisation but every single doctor/psychologist/psychiatrist just referred me to another one who does the same, this has been going on for 3-4 months and I‚Äôve seen between 6-7 professionals over multiple visits with no progress being made while my symptoms are getting progressively worse 

Every appointment is the same, and I‚Äôve not received any help and I‚Äôm at the point of the closest to suicide I‚Äôve been since my last attempt

It feels as if I‚Äôm in a fucking pyramid scheme 
And Ive had to create my own coping mechanisms to be able to function, but even they have a limit

I just got referred from a psychiatrist today back to my GP who was told by the psychiatrist to refer me to another different psychiatrist.

This was my tipping point today after just going in fucking circles, it is just so draining and exhausting and is making me question if I should just give up trying to get help and just try and deal with it, even though inevitably its just going to keep getting worse like it has been and will lead to my eventual suicide

So my question is why were the people I know so easily and quickly able to go through the process is 1 doctor visit and 1 psychiatrist visit, but I‚Äôm just going back and forth for months?",03Mar2020,1

73,"I've been depressed for a few years now, and I have an appointment with an on base(army) mental health specialist on Wednesday. I'm terrified of being honest with them, because at times I suffer from suicidal ideation. But I know while I'm thinking it that it's not the answer, I have been on leave for the last two weeks and have been alone around loaded firearms every day, and it has been particularly bad lately and I didnt do anything, it's just that the thought was there. The best way I can explain the severity of the suicidal thoughts would be to relate it to cheating. If you're in a relationship, and you see an attractive person and they are coming on to you, part of you would want to go home with them, but you know the consequences of who would be affected, and arent willing to do that, but if you could do it without hiding it, and you were single or nobody would be hurt by it, you would do it in a heartbeat. I know that I'm loved by my adopted parents and my friends, so I dont do it. But the urge is still there. I'm terrified that if I'm open about this I will be sent to a psych ward, which would cause me to lose my firearm rights, I would likely be separated from the army, etc, and I'm afraid that it would just make things worse for me, because those are the only things that I can find fulfillment from when I'm not down.

76,"Hey guys, I'm in need of some direction.

As a 23 y/o American female with a college degree, there are 3 major categories that I attempt to spend most of my time on: my boyfriend &amp; loved ones, my job (web developer), and myself. 

*For context: I've been struggling with depression since adolescence. I am able to put on a facade that could be described as 'normal,' consequently, my mental illness has always been unbeknownst to most.* 

*Although I have never found it difficult to make friends in order to 'fit in,' making mutual, meaningful connections with others has only seemingly happened a handful of times in my life. The depression I experience has always been isolating regardless of my situation.*

Let's start with my boyfriend. Contrary to many love stories around me (as well as those in my past), I was the one who was interested first. As a matter of fact, I can tell you all about the first time I even looked at him -- employee orientation at new local bar. That's right...we were co-workers.

Our relationship started with me dating another and him not really noticing me. Then after a year or so, our acquaintance moved into a friendship. After awhile, that friendship transformed into our relationship today. I don't have to tell you the story...bartending can be a flirty profession.

Overall, my boyfriend and I have an awesome relationship. The best part is I actually feel something instead of the default numbness. I don't want to say he's my first love, but he's the first significant other that I'm undeniably attracted to, shares my beliefs and values, and works to make me feel loved. This dude checks all the boxes. Sometimes I can't even believe we're together and I've known this guy for years.

That being said, I can't imagine what I'd do if our relationship dissolved. However, I'm sick of being in fear of losing him. 

I am conventionally attractive, athletic, young, free-spirited, and smart; however, jealousy is now a plague that overcomes me. Everything now seems to be a competition in my head. I know I'll never be the most attractive, talented, or intellectual person in this world - but this relationship has put me at odds with my own mental peace. I now always feel like I have to be the best at everything. I feel like my boyfriend only took interest in me because I was the cool, down-to-earth, attractive blonde at our workplace; I feel like he is a privilege that could be taken away at any second. 

Despite the fact that my boyfriend has NEVER EVER made me feel inadequate, the people that surround us (past co-workers/friends?) seemingly never fail to tell me in/directly about how great of a guy my boyfriend is, how many 'options' are available to him, and/or that I don't deserve him.

I had self-confidence before dating this guy, but now I just feel like crap. On paper, I'm the much more desirable candidate: I have an 'outwardly pleasing' career (not-bartending, which he still does), a long-term plan, wellness goals, a retirement fund, and more...but he still just nonchalantly takes the cake. I don't understand. Sometimes I feel like I would be better off without him, but he is the person I want to spend the rest of my life with.

And if we're going down the list, my loved ones are always there for me but also never fail to make me feel as if I'm not meeting my goals or doing a good job.

Next, let's move to my job. It's rewarding during small intervals but most of the time my job makes me frequently consider suicide. Since starting my job at the beginning of 2018, I've started heavily abusing prescription medication and alcohol. I enjoy and am talented at my position, however, I feel as if the dynamics of the agency where I am employed will actually kill me. I don‚Äôt know why I hate it so much and, in case this matters, the hate I have for my current job has only gotten worse since I began my relationship.

I have had a job with a non-familial employer since I was 13 and have never experienced this caliber of despair towards a employment. I don't understand what's wrong with me. In theory, I've landed exactly what I've been working towards, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be enough. This is the heaviest contributor to my depression.

Finally, myself. I know that I‚Äôm normal enough and, for the most part, can meet the goals I set. I don‚Äôt understand why self-hatred seems to follow me everywhere I go. Nothing I do is ever enough.

Can I ask, what am I doing wrong?

Are my negative feelings toward my relationships, my job, and myself all at the fault of my mental illness? Am I too insecure to be in a successful relationship? Do all ‚Äòadult‚Äô jobs make you want to die (and not in the comical way that everyone jokes about when I try to ask for advice)? Would talking to a therapist put me on a path to self-acceptance?

Basically, as the title states, I really need some direction or advice from from someone who can be objective. I know this is a lot of info but I‚Äôm desperate for a fresh perspective. Thanks to anyone who is able to provide some insight.",03Mar2020,1
77,"As I'm typing this out im supposed to be writing an essay for my AP english class. It's due in 3 days and the SAT is in 2 days. I feel like I have no hope of passing this class, let alone the SAT or AP test connected to this class.

I have this problem every time I have to write an essay, I can think of maybe one or two times ever that this wasn't the case for whatever reason. It doesn't matter if I understand the prompt, have plenty to write about and KNOW what I'm supposed to be doing, I just... can't write. 

I started this essay an hour ago, have an essay's worth of notes to refer to, yet I've written maybe 4 sentences total. It doesn't matter that I know the information and have it in my head, I just can't communicate the ideas to written words. I'll just sit there and stare at the paper or screen, or get distracted by some other thing. 

Communicating ideas verbally is even worse so I cant even explain what I know to anyone to describe what I WOULD write. I'm just sort of trapped in my head.

78,"I smoke weed a lot and all the time i hear people who smoke talking about derealization and how everything seems fake.

However I have no fucking clue whether or not it‚Äôs something i‚Äôm experiencing or not because what does ‚Äúeverything seems fake‚Äù even mean. like i don‚Äôt literally think the world we live in isn‚Äôt real. I don‚Äôt touch a rock and doubt what i‚Äôm feeling actually exists. however, i do feel like the foundation for people‚Äôs relationships, and just the reasons for why people do what they definitely seem incredibly fake and arbitrarily chosen. the world often seems like a place where people are just kind of prancing around and pretending like they know shit when in reality most 80 year olds have made the same amount of progress to realizing what‚Äôs really important and that nobody has an ‚Äúaccurate‚Äù culture or an ‚Äúaccurate‚Äù world view as a 6 year old. There is no right and wrong and everything we do is based on the assumption that there is and that‚Äôs why everything we do is just kind of pointless. It‚Äôs not like that i look at everything as fake, It‚Äôs that i just think all of our morals and values were so arbitrarily chosen that it really makes no point to follow them, so i follow my own values that i made based on nothing other than my personal experience. And they feel 100% real because there was an actual process to making them that i understand.

This got unnecessarily philosophical, but i think you understand what i‚Äôm asking. Am i going through derealization or do i just have a different world view?",03Mar2020,1

82,"This is a long rant, sorry! 

I was at a party last weekend that was BYOB (partially, there was some alcohol but not a lot). I got an extra bottle of vodka but didn't end up drinking it because not many people at the party were drinking the booze our host had brought so she poured most of it in my glass. Eventually I took the small bottle home with me after everything ended.

My friend was with me the whole time, we bought our own booze together and stuff. Since my parents were gone I didn't have a problem with keeping an extra bottle at home, but yesterday I said I should throw it out because they're coming home. She said ""How will you throw out so much alcohol? You can give it to *other friend which is planning a party*"" and since we were talking back and forth very fast I immediately blurted out ""It's empty!""

She gasped and said ""You're an alcoholic in the making! It's only been a week!""

It's true, I do have problems with substance abuse but I think I handle them pretty well usually. The last two weeks have been pretty rough so I felt really embarrassed when she said that, because I knew I wasn't handling myself as well as I do on other days. I constantly crave alcohol but as I know stuff like these can get out of hand due to my mental state I try my best to keep away from it, however having that one, small bottle of alcohol right there in my house was something I could easily reach for and I didn't recognise that until it was too late. 

Not to say I drank the whole thing immediately but every time something bad came across my mind the bottle was suddenly in my hands. And thought by thought, mouthful after mouthful it was empty.

When my friend said that I was taken aback and answered ""*Name*! You shouldn't say stuff like that!"" 
We didn't fight over it or anything, but right now I'm really embarrassed and can't stop thinking about it. I feel so stupid.",03Mar2020,1

84,"so basically whats been happening to me for the last months of therapy it that i often loose progress because i run out of power to keep up with myself. I also want to say that I dont know how strong my anexiety is because I do loose all train of thought in an attack and feel like I want to cry, but I dont, which im not sure about is either it not being that strong or just me being used to this feeling. I get constantly scared of anything that includes doing something I either have not done before or had any problems with before. I also cant leave my bubble for more then some hours at a time otherwise i shut down and get an anexiety attack. I honestly dont know where to go since im a 16yo student that really cant continue with school after this summer break ( i just suck, missed to much school and am not very bright when it comes to maths and stuff, theres luckily no monitary reason or something). as I said at the start I sometimes loose progress because I get an attack seemingly randomly and I just cant function after those and therefore it reinforces my anexiety and causes me to fall back. I cant really dodge situations that scare me tho cuz everything scares me, and i felt i can deal with some triggers. This is where the running out of energy part comes in. It takes a lot off of me to control a single Trigger but as i said, normally i can cope. I just run out of juice sometimes and then everything thats just the smallest trigger just completely shuts me down, and I feel like that alone is getting to me. I dealt with a depressive phase in 6-7 grade, and i feel like thats showing its ugly mug again. I get rather randomly sad and just dont really find enjoyment in much but drowning out the real world with shows and video games. Its escapeism and not good for me but sometimes I feel so cornered for days at a time that I feel like i need to run somewhere. All in all I feel like not being able to keep up even with the slightest bit of life and it makes me pretty sad most of the time, not uncommonly ending in me just crying at home because I was to scared to walk though my entrance today and leave for school. Its not fun and I really dont know what im suppost to do anymore since I feel like my fear is completely irrational and other then trying to make it shut up I cant touch it. I cant argue with it and it overwrites my thoughts. I just feel stuck.

She was diagnosed with cancer and some kind of neological issue. Both would have required more tests, medications, likely surgery and chemo. My husband didn't want to pay for endless treatments and I felt like with our travel schedules for work and our upcoming move, I didn't have a choice. But I'm so lost without her. And I hate myself for not giving her more time. And I hate my husband for not wanting her. And I just keep crying and crying and can't stop. 

I don't know how to function without her. Which sounds insane, talking about a cat like that. But she was my constant, my home. She was always there, always cuddled me when I was sad or sick, always greeted me when I came home, always followed me around the house regardless of mealtimes. She made me feel loved. And I killed her. I don't know how to move past it. I don't know how to forgive myself. I keep thinking I could have done something different to keep her here. And I can't tell if it was the right thing for her or not. My husband keeps saying there was no right choice but I can't stop feeling like this was the wrong one.

I'm seeing my therapist tomorrow. I'm just so alone without her. My husband is tired of me crying all the time and I feel like I can't rely on him (bigger issues there).

88,"Hello everyone, I'm not really sure if this is the most appropriate sub to pose this question in but I wasn't sure where else to go. I have a friend whom I have had as one of my closest if not my closest friend for nearly 5 years now. He's been there through my ups and downs and he's always been a good friend but something has changed within the past few weeks. He lives many states away at his university but me and him play games and stay in daily close contact and within the past few weeks he's cut himself for the first time on his bicep, began drinking in extreme excess almost daily and acting in a very erratic way. The issue is his self harming doesn't seem to be coming from a suicidal standpoint he has repeatedly stated that he enjoys the pain and he is talking about how many people he's wronged and that he needs to suffer for what he's done. (He grew up in wealth and has to my knowledge not really done anything terrible in his life) I a week and a half ago thought that I managed to bring him back to reality, got him to tell me he wasn't going to cut himself anymore and that I'm always gonna be here if he needs someone to talk to it seemed all ok. He promised to stop self harming but 2 days ago he called me drunk as all hell crying and talking to me about how everyone in the world is sheep and how he's fucked over so many good people in his life and how he needs me to cut him. He has since then over the past few days reiterated over and over again how I'm the only person in the world that he trusts and that I need to make him suffer. He's been drinking and driving and just the way that he talks he sounds like he's having a severe mental break. But during the day he acts normal, no tears just talks about everything very passively and goes about a normal day to day routine. I don't understand it, I've witnessed someone go through a psychosis but this seems different to that. I don't know how to handle this situation. I've told him I would do the whole cut thing on his back for him because I'm afraid if I didn't agree he would hurt himself further. He's seeming extremely detached from reality and I don't think his family is aware. I don't have any way of contacting his family, he has no social media and I'm not sure how to track down his parents. He lives in a different state, I don't have his address, I don't have much.

I don't know what to do and I don't know how to handle this situation. I know this is a shit ton of information to unpack but I need any kind of recommendations that I can here. If there are any resources specifically in the Texas/Lubbock area that someone could point me in so I can try to get my friend help please do.

89,"Hi, it‚Äôs 2am here and although my eyes are tired I can‚Äôt sleep. 

I‚Äôm thinking about how, for the past 3 years since I entered university, I‚Äôve been feeling depressed or have frequent panic attacks during exam weeks, presentations, deadlines, or when I am under pressure. 

And they would go away after that. Everytime. So I would always hesitate when I want to seek help. I‚Äôm not sure if this is valid mental health issue or not. 

But to give more context. I also get suicidal (I recently bought a utility knife)  and depressed sometimes even before university. I‚Äôm not sure why exams and deadlines give me so much anxiety, it seems like everyone has them. Presentations tho, I understand since I have no self confidence and always think of the worst things that would lead me to failing the class or my future being doomed because of an ugly grade. I‚Äôm afraid of socializing with people especially men so the thoughts of participating in class, giving reports, or even a simple job interview is very hard task to do. Most of the time, I feel stupid like I‚Äôm the least intelligent human. I also care about how people think of me like if I do or say something ‚Äústupid‚Äù, I would assume everyone thinks I‚Äôm stupid or everyone hates me.


Anyway, my thoughts are all over the place and I can‚Äôt even explain everything properly. 

Is this normal? I don‚Äôt know anymore... I just don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt trust myself.",03Mar2020,1

93,"Hello all, for the past 3 years I have been struggling with my mental stability and health. 4 weeks ago one of my friends told me she didn't want to be friends anymore, at first it did not bother me until now. Everytime I hear her voice it makes me angry and I feel like leaving the classroom. Instead of letting it go I just obsess about it and become sad, she has moved on and is having fun seemingly. Randomly she will pop into my head and I will just sit their and think about things I cannot change. I wish to stop and move on in life !

Secondly, I cannot go a day without thinking about death and pain. I could be having a fun time and then I will think about death, mass extinction , disease, etc. I think abut death too much and it is making me sad.  I wish to stop !

Futhermore, I have two friends they are okay people, every 2 weeks I question my friendship with them and I dont wanna be friends with them. It is annoying to me because I can never follow through with a decision. I come home from school barely being able to function it took my about 5 hours to do a simple homework assignment. I ignore my friends online for long periods of time, I ignore thier phone calls I feel so guilty but at the same time is somehow better that being with them. It makes me angry that I cannot function outside if school, that makes me a slave to school were all I do is school. I live in ""South central"" los angles so their is not much to do outside, on the weekends I sit inside for two days and then I go to school repeating the same mundane tasks over and over. I feel as I am not alibe but just absently moving across the metaphorical game board and watch as the years go by. I think about suicide often, I don't want to die but I dont feel like i'm living anyway. I feel like crying but no tears come out. 

I just want to live life and vibe and have fun with people while achieving my goal to attend college.
Right now I can barely do the bate minimum and I feel that I am breaking down slowly and ever so slightly as the days go by 

What should I do ?",03Mar2020,1
94,hi so i‚Äôm seeing a psychiatrist tomorrow for the first time and i‚Äôm not sure what to expect. i have suicidal ideation and my school found out my plan and is sending me to get help. i have already been to the hospital and spoken to people from the crisis team as well as i had a appointment with someone to take a risk assessment/general wtf is going so i‚Äôm comfortable with what sort of questions i‚Äôll be asked. during the assessment we talked a lot about my mood swings and my few symptoms of psychosis but i‚Äôm doubtful that they‚Äôll have spent enough time with me to have a diagnosis yet but i‚Äôm unsure if i‚Äôll be immediately put on medication? like what kind? whether it‚Äôs a mood stabilizer or a anti depressant or anti anxiety or if they‚Äôre the same thing? because i think medication will be really helpful for me but i also don‚Äôt want to ask for it if they don‚Äôt mention anything about because when i‚Äôm nervous i get really polite and don‚Äôt argue anything. if anyone can offer their experience or what i can expect all help will be appreciated!,03Mar2020,1
95,"I feel like I was destined to have a shitty life since the day I was born.  Idk maybe that‚Äôs a dumb thing to say, but that‚Äôs just
how it feels.  I‚Äôve never really ever felt loved in my life. Ever. I think about being told the words I love you no one has ever meant it because if they did why does everyone hurt me? 

My mom should have never had me. It‚Äôs clear she always wanted a son and that she doesn‚Äôt really love me. There‚Äôs a part of her that tries I guess, but I feel like she just wishes I wasn‚Äôt a girl. Especially hearing the fact she had a name picked out for me.... and it was a boy name :/. I‚Äôve always shown the uppermost love for my mom. When I was younger I‚Äôd cry and cry all night while she was at work because I didn‚Äôt feel safe without my ‚Äúmommy‚Äù. But that‚Äôs just how it was as a kid. You see your parents and you just feel protection and then you start seeing things how they really are when you‚Äôre older. Like how sleeping on a couch while your male cousins sleep in their nice beds and who are also in their 30s and want their own bedrooms refuse to move out so your mom thinks their well-being is better than yours. I sleep on a couch in the living room. Since I was 11. I put my clothes in a little bin in some corner in the house. I have 0 privacy, I can never make a phone call without someone in my family purposely trying to humiliate me or listening in. I‚Äôve never really got to explore things sexually since... I sleep in the living room? I don‚Äôt know.  I‚Äôve been ‚Äúgroomed‚Äù (is that the right word) into thinking this was normal until I turned 17 years old. 6 years I thought it was normal, but I wasn‚Äôt allowed to tell anyone. 


The emotional abuse I‚Äôve endured for saying I get back pain from sleeping on a couch.  My cousin once called me a spoiled brat and a little princess for crying when I was told that I won‚Äôt be getting a bed or a room. He and my mom actually sat around joking about me reporting them for abuse. Said they‚Äôd let the officer strip me down and check if I had bruises and if I did, they could take me. Like that‚Äôs my fucking mom? Need I add how I have always had problems with my self esteem, but I was good at always telling myself positive things about myself until I became a teenager my mom never missed a moment to insult my appearance. Every time I‚Äôm upset she calls me ugly, fat, and countless of other things. Never the same with my cousins yet (this isn‚Äôt me being a stuck up bitch i‚Äôm not pretty at allll but it‚Äôs just bizarre to me) they‚Äôre 10x the size of me and nowhere near good looking, she wouldn‚Äôt dare call them a name.  My mom ruined my confidence (if i could ever have any) and every single time I look at myself I see a pathetic fat ugly girl. I cant go anywhere without having to sit in a way where I can spare people to look at my face. I cant even fucking do normal things anymore because I‚Äôm scared that people are calling me ugly or fat or just any insult. 


I have no friends other than online friends. The 2 girls I‚Äôve befriended irl were 2 of the fakest people who never even cared for me at all. The guys I‚Äôve dated both cheated on me. (one actually used me to take my virginity) So what is it thats wrong with me that no one actually loves me? Is it my personality? I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me! I‚Äôm an afterthought in people‚Äôs life. My feelings don‚Äôt matter ever. I was always try to tone down how I am, but I feel as if I am unfixable, unlovable, and just an ugly worthless piece of shit. Everyday is more miserable than the next. I don‚Äôt know why I bother trying anymore. 


TL;DR: my mothers abuse has pushed me too far and I‚Äôm seeing my quality of life diminish and seeing more reason to end it all.",03Mar2020,1

I hate people because I don't know how to communicate with them. I have a low humming anxiety most of the time and I can't shake it. I hate the fact that my family and I can't do fun stuff because we don't have any money to. I obsess and obsess and it never stops. When I am not at school I am at home it makes me depressed. I don't have a destist so my tooth has been hurting me since 9th grade and I can't do anything about it. My parents got divorce 10 years ago, since then my father has started a new life with 3 new children. My mom is having trouble finding a job and if she can't it will be bad news.

102,"A few short months ago, my life seemed like it was going to be perfect. I was happy, and emotionally supported. I had very few invasive thoughts, and when I did, it was the easiest thing in the world to ignore them and look forward to the future. You could even go as far as to say I was depression free.

Obviously, things have gone downhill, and there doesn‚Äôt really seem to be an end in sight for my situation at the moment. Every day I am progressively having more severe and an increase in volume of these thoughts.

What if I really am useless? What do I have left to live for? Does anybody care about me anymore? I should just kill myself. I don‚Äôt think I can handle this anymore.

Those and many variations are among the most common to pass my mind. I‚Äôm not even putting an effort to fight them at this point. My mind is starting to align with this way of thinking, leading to brainstorming of suicide methods, or idealizing a painless end to existence. I‚Äôve never felt this one before, but I am definitely sympathizing with anyone who as ever felt like going to sleep and never coming back. 

Safe to say, I‚Äôve come at least full circle from last year at exactly this time. I‚Äôm at an all time low, but this time with not nearly as much hope left to save me. I have no motivation whatsoever, and I‚Äôm honestly over it already. To this very day, I am only held here by the smallest sliver of hope that things will be better soon, that I will be happy again.

127," 

I haven't really talked about this with anyone. I've been single for a little over 6 years now. My ex was a long distance relationship and the distance thing just didn't work out. About a year ago, I saw on facebook that she was in another relationship. I didn't think it would bother me at first but it did and I became angry.

I ended up blowing up her phone with texts asking why, asking if we could try again even though I didn't really want to...She's the only gf I've had pretty much my last relationship before her was 10 years prior. Anyway she wasn't having it.

I became more angry with the situation and started saying hurtful things to her. Told her I would beat her up had she been here. I think I told her I wanted to kill her new boyfriend. The more upset I got the more hurtful stuff I would say. I told her I would ""go find a dumber fatter bitch somewhere else"" things like that.

She blocked my number, understandably. I didn't mean any of the hurtful things. I thought at the time that if I made her feel bad, it would make me feel good. It did not. I felt extremely upset and guilty. I ended up sending her a fb message apologizing and never heard anything back which I did not expect to.

A few months later I started talking to another girl at a bar that I frequented. I thought things were going pretty well after hanging out for drinks a few times a week. When I made a move and asked her out she gave me the whole ""I like you but just not like that"" which I did not handle very well and basically told her ""Well then what good are you to me?!"" I made a bit of a scene about it. The bartender (a buddy of mine) called me over and told me that I had been cut off and needed to leave. I was pretty embarrassed and this girl stopped talking to me. Understandably.

These events happened a little over two years ago and I haven't talked to a woman since. I have NEVER acted like this before. I've recently stopped drinking but I don't really feel any better.

I'm worried that I'm going to become an abusive person and hurt somebody. I'm also starting to get really lonely and I don't know what to do. I'm worried I will become one of those incel guys. I've been keeping pretty much to myself and I feel like if I start drinking again I can be happy alone but I know I shouldn't.

Now before I continue I find the mind fascinating and live knowing as much as I can about mental disorders, I enjoy helping people and letting them know that just because they think differently to others doesn't make them strange or weird, no one thinks the same, it also comforts me because then I feel ""normal"" too, knowing that everyone is different not just in looks.

Anyway recently I took a lot of interest in a YouTuber channel called DissociaDID, they have Disociative Identity Disorder/DID (just putting that there in case someone doesn't know what it is), anyway I really enjoy watching this channel and getting to understand more but recently I've been comparing myself to it and noticed similarities, now before I noticed I had a voice in my head I couldn't distinguish the voice from my own until it named itself, then later on it showed itself to me in a dream/nightmare.

The more I think about it the more I see connections but as I said I don't like self diagnosing myself and I don't know where would be best for me to go to get a professional diagnosis and it's freaking me out, not because I might have it, whether I have DID or not I'm still the same me, what's freaking me out is not knowing, if I know I can learn to deal with my own emotions better but by not knowing I don't know what's best for myself so if anyone knows where is the best place for me to find out whether I have DID or not please let me know.

I live in the UK just so no one tells me any places that aren't in the UK which I can't use.

129,"TL;DR: When someone is upset/depressed/anxious/etc., is it enough/appropriate for the main response to that being ""how can I support you"" without attempting solutions or pressing if they say ""no""?


For context, I am someone that wants to help and be a friend to others but has genuine difficulty with determining the most appropriate social behavior, especially when it comes to emotional interactions. I can pick up easily enough when someone is upset or off, but I am at a loss for how to address that and how to help, to the point where this is honestly a big source of distress and self-doubt/self-loathing for me.


I try telling myself that the best I can do is explicitly ask how I can support the other person when something is going wrong, since I really don't think fast enough or have enough social-emotional skills to determine what else is best whenever these moments happen. 


But it still feels wrong. Part of this is definitely self-loathing, being this aware of lacking the knowledge/skills necessary for daily healthy interactions. But another part is knowing that people may still reject help or not know how they can be helped, when they could still definitely use something. 

For example, I have a friend that suffers from depressive and anxious tendencies but rarely admits to it, instead normally saying that they are fine and there is nothing I can do. I don't want to push, especially since I can't tell what is helpful and what isn't. But with that, during those rare times in which they do say they spent the day in bed feeling awful despite saying before they were fine, I don't know how to respond to that aside from again asking if there is anything I can do to support. They reply that there is nothing, I don't think fast enough or am not sure/confident enough to do anything despite their distress, and the conversation stops. I've now even gotten paranoid that they purposefully do not share anything with me because they know how inept I am at this kind of thing. But I want to be normal and try to be a normal friend; I just don't know how.


So am I just hyper-fixating on this, that asking how I can support is all I should do and is aligned with normal healthy interactions? Or is there more I should be doing to try to help others when they are not doing well? And if so, what?",03Mar2020,1

Hi, 

So I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for many years but have only recently plucked up the courage to try and get some help.

I was reluctant to turn to medication straight away as the thought of taking medication made me anxious. However, I have been seeing a psychologist for counseling (mixed results so far). I have made an appointment with my doctor to discuss medication options further 8 but still not 100% sure it's the course i want to take)

I guess my main problem is the persistent self-doubt and fear that I am not good enough. I worry about not being good enough and I am depressed when I think I am not good enough.

Following an emotional chat with my wife last night, I am currently feeling really guilt and ashamed of myself as it was made clear to me how difficult I am to live with and how horrible it is living with someone who ' never smiles anymore'.

One of the worst behaviors I exhibit is getting irritated and angry with people. This behavior is at its most extreme toward my wife's sister and family. .... I act like such a d@#k head to them most of the time. Being hostile, withdrawn, aloof and uninterested to them and their kids.... They are very rich and everything seems to go well for them all the time... It looks like I am jealous of them but I am not usually a jealous person ( it seems reserved just for them) Within the wider family it's as if the world revolves around them ""they have such good high paid jobs"","" they have such big house.."".blah blah 

I guess my feeling of hostility /anger towards them come from fear of not being good enough and feeling bad because when I compare myself to them it looks like I actually am not good enough....

I need to stop being like this... I REALLY want to stop being like this but it seems impossible....

I am finding it hard to attribute this simply to anxiety/depression what if I am just a 'jerk' a horrible person? Such feelings make me even more anxious and depressed, as it is as if I am not even good enough at being a normal person...

Has anyone had a similar experience? Or is it just me?",03Mar2020,1
131,"Looking back now, I realize that I never felt safe growing up. Mom did a piss poor job of taking care of us. Sure, we had everything we needed, food shelter, that sort of thing. But we weren't protected by her. Until recently, I never even thought it affected me, seeing my father drunkenly beat the hell out of my mom and older brother. I now see that it did, how could it not? We weren't safe. He never hit me, but I was so little at the time, it would have started eventually. But she kept us there, maybe she felt like if she took most of the beatings, it would be easier for the kids. It wasn't. I had no idea what was going on with my sister. And what did mom do when she found out? Had a stern talk with my father where she told him not to do it again. We moved out to the country, maybe mom thought the country air would stifle his abusive behavior. It didn't. It all happened again. After the second time (or the second time she found out, who knows how many times it actually happened) , she finally got us out of there and away from him. But the damage was already done.

Fast forward to present me. If I were to describe myself in one word, Anxiety. I have social anxiety, trust issues, self esteem problems. I'm scared. All the time. And most of the time, I couldn't even tell you exactly why. Have been for as long as I can remember. I'm short, 5'3"" when wearing my big boy shoes lol. I graduated from high school weighing around 90 pounds. I've always been so anxious, my stomach literally hurts nonstop. Food has never been something I enjoy because I can never get enough to make myself feel not hungry. The pain was usually too much for me. I would eat just enough to make it another day. 


In spite of everything wrong with me, I found someone who was, I thought, perfect. She was broken in her own way, aren't we all? We fixed each others broken parts, and for the first time ever, I felt whole. Like everything would be ok. My anxiety symptoms, while they never truly went away, I felt were mostly under control. I felt like a person for probably the first time ever. She was amazing. Kind and caring, comforting when I needed a shoulder. And OMG such an amazing cook. Hell, last summer I hit my highest weight ever! I got up to 145! I looked good. I felt good. Married for a while now, kids, good job, house, dog. I was living the American dream. I thought everything was great. 

It all came crashing down last summer, though. She said she wasn't happy, hadn't been for a long time. She said that she had found someone else, and spent the night with him. World as I knew it destroyed, felt betrayed and unwanted. You know the drill. Turns out that she's been in a relationship with this other guy for a while, and it's not going away. Shows no signs of remorse. Unwilling to take steps to fix our marriage. I don't sleep much, and I haven't weighed myself in months, but I can clearly see that I'm losing a dangerous amount of weight. My anxiety symptoms have gotten worse. Obviously, it's time for me to move on. 


Why tell you all this? Because now, I find myself repeating a cycle that started with my mother. There is no physical or sexual abuse. But emotionally, the situation is not safe. I know this, but I'm so scared to take the steps necessary to get out of a bad situation. Financially, I'm not ready. Emotionally, I will likely never be ready. But I know that I need to go. If I don't, I'm going to end up... Well, I try not to think too much about where that would be.

I was in a physically/emotionally abusive relationship when I was 17. He pressured me into sex and I ended up getting pregnant. I was so devastated because I was only in high school. I told one of my closest friends about the pregnancy at the time and he told EVERYONE. The whole time was talking about me and my parents found out about it through the whole town knowing.

My sons dad still is not involved at all is quite abusive still to me. I am terrified to leave him but end up doing it anyways. I am going through terrible post partum depression. I manage through the whole first year of college whole at a community college. The following school year I transfer to IU while still taking care of my son. During this time, I have been sexually assaulted a couple times and was with someone for a year who was emotionally manipulative and very controlling. He would blame me and make me apologize for things I didn‚Äôt do and ignore me for days if he was mad at me. AND my grandparents died in a house fire on my birthday while in school. That was truly traumatic. We had to search through the house to find items afterwards. I never got to deal with and process any of these things that have happened. I have terribly suppressed all of these things. I am scared to trust anyone. I have dealt with such terrible stress and anxiety that I think my body and mind are finally giving out.

‚ÄúFeeling alone:

    - Have always felt disconnected from my parents
    - No matter how much time i spend with friends I feel like I‚Äôm drifting away from them

Feeling like the world isn‚Äôt real:

    - Derealisation?
    - Less emotion, worrying that even though i‚Äôm often more outgoing and energetic than i used to be, that i‚Äôm missing social cues and being mean or insensitive

Anxiety:
    - Struggle sleeping at night
    - Fluctuate from outgoing to very socially anxious
    - Have had another panic attack, not quite as bad
    - Felt quite awful the week after last therapy sesh
    - Feeling better about uni because of positive self talk, main worry is whether i can maintain this mental state or level of motivation
    - Health anxiety still in effect, worry about heart sometimes while working out

145,"Hello! I wanted to start this post off by saying that for the longest time ever I was always so sad, I couldn‚Äôt feel empathy or any other emotion except for anger and annoyance towards almost every little thing. It had been going on for so long that I even forgot if I could feel emotions at some point before it all started or not. Obviously I didn‚Äôt talk about it with anyone because no one around me cared enough to notice anything except for this one guy who sensed something was wrong and would ask me if I was really ok on multiple occasions.

Fast forward to about a month ago, I fell in love with him. He‚Äôs a straight male and I‚Äôm a straight male and I didn‚Äôt notice I was falling in love until I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about him. The thing about this love though is that it wasn‚Äôt like any other I‚Äôve experienced, it felt pure and genuine and it really brought light into my world. Starting from then on I started feeling again: happiness, sadness, everything really and I feel like I owe it all to him. (From this I concluded that I might‚Äôve been depressed but I can‚Äôt tell for sure as I‚Äôm no therapist). 

Anyway, here comes the core of the problem. In less than 3 months, we‚Äôre both going our separate ways and we‚Äôll be separated. Whenever I think about that I just get extremely sad because I‚Äôm not sure I could stay in the light without him. I‚Äôve only ever said I love you to two people in my life because I only say it when I truly mean it, and he‚Äôs one of the people I‚Äôve told. I know it‚Äôs going to be hard so I try and make the best of the time we have left by going out with him as much as I can but I feel like that‚Äôs just going to make it harder on me when the time comes.

146," I love my stepdad. I hate him. He made sure the family was well taken care of and loved so deeply. He was also an alcoholic with anger issues as well as a lot of internal problems he couldn't cope with and took it out on us. 

He always had to make a point. His final words were him making a point and we are almost certain it would have been murder suicide if my mom would have called 911. He said ""I bet you will call 911 for this"" and shot himself just moments after holding a gun to my mothers head, and did so right in front of her. 

She almost certainly has ptsd but while trying to recall memories of the good and the bad, i started to realize I cannot remember what is real. It is causing loads of anxiety. 

I know some of the bad is real. I remember my mother giving me a pistol at 10 years old and asking me to stay up late and watch over the family. I remember him abusing my brother and mother.

148,"Right, ok, stupid title, I know 99.9% of respondents will reply ‚Äúof course your life is worth living‚Äù but please, hear me out. 

I‚Äôve been struggling with my mental health for about 7 years now, and it‚Äôs been severe for about the last 4. I am on medications to help with the issues and I have undertook a course of counselling also, albeit that was about 3 years ago. 

The reason I ask whether life is worth living is because, despite actually having help, I find myself still sliding down the slope - even if the decline has been slowed. I feel like I am going to hit rock bottom regardless, no matter what treatments I am on, and I seriously see no end to the torment that is my life. 

I am gradually becoming unable to do things I once love - for example, attending college has become quite the task, and I am finding myself becoming more and more reluctant to go to work. Eventually, I can see myself ending up homeless as a result of an inability to do things that mean I am economically active and/or in some form of approved, funded education. 

I‚Äôm a pretty unsociable person - not by choice. If I could, I would surround myself with a million people, but my brain has always forced up barriers between myself and the rest of the world. I have a few friends, some of them were great friends at one point, but I fear the friendship has fizzled down. I do also have a tendency to push people away the minute a slight issue arises, rather than being able to resolve the issue via communication. 

Then we come onto my selfish, abusive family. The ones who are the root of my depression, heaven forbid I actually tell them that though, they‚Äôd never admit that it was the truth. They say my issues aren‚Äôt real, that everyone is depressed and fearful of things, that most people just continue to chug along. They berate me, bully me and degrade me for not being able to live a normal life. I have to conceal who I truly am to them (I‚Äôm bisexual) due to my father‚Äôs frequent casual homophobia. 

What‚Äôs triggered these wave of thoughts, you might ask? Well, today my dad told me that he will kick me out by the end of the week if I don‚Äôt start acting like a normal person and get over my issues. My family will stick by him out of fear, even if they disagree with his decision. I don‚Äôt have any *close* friends who can help me. Emergency housing in my city is an absolute shambles. 

So, yeah, by Saturday, I could be homeless. I‚Äôm crying right now. Things have never seemed so bleak and dark. I am really thinking about suicide. All this pain and all these issues could be over in an instant. Easy.

Sorry for my bad english, but hopefully you will understand everything what i am going to write over here. 
So,  I [19] am student on high school in Europe. I have a girlfriend of 3 years, I am pretty social type, going somewhere out like every 1 or 2 days. I used to smoke weed every day for about a year, but recently I just smoke on weekends. I don't like drinking heavily because I don't like the effects of alcohol.
So, my problem is not when I am in work, school or with my friends or girlfriend. The problem will come when I am alone, mostly at home, just me and my thoughts. Often when I am home I feel a feeling of emptiness and need to go out somewhere, or feeling the need to smoke some weed, but I got used to live with that and I don't take it as a major problem. 
But sometimes, prolly 1 time in a week when I am alone, me and my thoughts watching some tv series or something I start to have some really bad mood combined with feeling of emptiness. My thought are going back to the time, when my gf cheated on me, but mostly my thoughts are going 4 years back, to the time when my parents did something that I won't ever forgive them(but in front of them I am just trying to live a normal life). It is a feeling of hatred towards them, seeking of some kind of revenge combined with feeling of emptiness and desire to just get high(weed or xans), but I can control that desire because I know how harmful xans can get
 Yea, as i wrote it, it sounds like I have some major mental health problems, but for real, it only happens when I am alone with my thoughts, and that doesn't happen often so that's why I didn't go to some psychiatrist or something and decided to write it over here.

And for whatever context is worth, I‚Äôm a male high school senior.

Many thanks to anyone who will take the time to read the book that I realize I‚Äôve written lol. Pretty much my life story now that I think of it.

As far as I can tell, I don‚Äôt have any good reason to feel bad about my life. My parents and the rest of my family are kind people and have solid relationships with each other (and myself). I have a wonderful girlfriend who is currently a freshman in college. I have a few close friends at school. I‚Äôve always gotten A‚Äôs in my classes (with the exception of calculus this year) and have always been a somewhat above average athlete in school sports. I have a good job. I also have a few hobbies that I spend time on when I can. I‚Äôve always been sort of naturally determined to do well in life.

However, the past few months I‚Äôve started to get feelings that I can‚Äôt do anything. My grades have still been pretty good, but most of the time when I get home after practice I just don‚Äôt want to do anything but sit and veg out. I just feel exhausted, especially during the swim season. I just feel too mentally tired to do homework and, as a result, don‚Äôt do it until the last minute. And during this whole process I feel anxious about all the homework that I have but I feel dysfunctional because I don‚Äôt do it until last minute and can‚Äôt seem to figure it out. I also find myself becoming anxious over larger things like research papers and procrastinate until the absolute last minute. I also tend to shut down, even though I know that the amount of homework that I have is doable. As a result, I often find that I‚Äôm up later than I need to be and lose sleep because I don‚Äôt like the thought of just not doing my work. I guess this really boils down to me being disappointed with myself because I always procrastinate.
To add to this feeling, calculus has been extremely challenging for me. There‚Äôre only four students taking the course, and it‚Äôs very clear that I have the least understanding of the material. Math and science have always been the classes that I do the best in and enjoy the most, so this has been quite the blow for me. This has also caused me to pretty much rethink all of my future plans because I had always planned to go to a good college for mechanical engineering, which relies heavily on math and science (especially calc).
My girlfriend knows I‚Äôve been struggling a bit and I really appreciate her efforts to help me, but I feel like sometimes she puts me before herself and that just makes me feel like I‚Äôm being selfish. I hate taking away from the positivity that she almost always has.

I‚Äôm not struggling with suicide or self harm or anything else severe, like some of the things I‚Äôve read here. This combined with my otherwise perfectly fine life only further makes me question the validity of my feelings. Is this really a big deal? Is this just part of figuring out life? If I‚Äôm not having thoughts of self-harm, is it really that big of a deal? It seems like I‚Äôm pretty well off compared to a lot of the people on this thread.

Any thoughts are appreciated.",03Mar2020,1
153,"Hello, I have a question about something I tend to experience.

So I had a bit of a depressive bout a while back, and one of the symptoms that I had (and has been coming back) is this feeling that I can't breathe. Not like, hyperventilating, but I suddenly become very, very conscious of how hard it is to breathe, and that I have to think about breathing in order to breathe normally. It gets worse when I am with friends or with other people in general, and has been enough at times for me to refuse going out, or coming late to outings. 
I am able to cover it up generally well though; I pretty much had it a few times a week and no one noticed. 

Is there a name for this???? I would like to know, especially as it has been coming back. Thank you!",03Mar2020,1

156,"Hi everyone,


My best friend of many years has always had pretty severe mental issues, and has been in and out of mental hospitals, on various antimanic meds, antidepressant meds, antianxiety meds, you name it. He is Bipolar Depressive, and will have spurts of extreme sadness and despair, and spurts of extreme happiness and energy. 

Recently, he had been in a pretty good place mentally after moving states to live much closer to me. However, he has been experimenting with his sexuality because he felt like he was missing something by being straight, and has since decided he is bisexual.

Well, the other night he was raped (not full on restrained sex, but uncomfortable actions where ""no"" did not resonate) by a man (similar age) in his own apartment. Before this man left, after a physical struggle, he decided to drug my friend by placing DMT (or so my friend thinks) underneath a layer of marijuana, so that it looked like a normal bowl. He hit it when the guy left, and started tripping out, says everything looked like teeth and like an alternate dimension.

For those of you that dont know, DMT is the chemical released in your brain during death in humans. Not something you really want to experience until that time comes.

Anyways, he is extremely shaken up by the whole thing, and has only gotten worse since the incident. He hasnt been sleeping much and has been regularly hallucinating because of it, drinking too much, and having people over constantly for sex to i guess try to cope and regain his sexual empowerment. Im not sure. But i am having a very hard time getting through to him, hes just not very responsive to my words, and if he does seem to get a bit better, hes back at square 1 the next morning. This is getting exhausting for me, as he is also my business partner and i greatly rely on him to produce work. Our jobs are not interchangeable ao I cant just pick up slack when he struggles like this, but im depending on him to produce so we can make money.

I just dont know what to do in this situation, and need help navigating the options I have. 

I have reached out to his parents (in another state) to have them give him a call as I think talking to his loved ones might be able to help level him out, so he knows there are others besides me that care about him. Im his only real friend.

Thanks in advance for any help you may be able to provide",03Mar2020,1

162,"Just to preface this post, I'm not suicidal, nor have I experienced any suicidal ideations. I'm just down in the dumps a lot, which I'll explain.

I'm in the military. My wife was unable to move with me on my last PCS for reasons not relevant to the story. Our marriage is in tact, it's nothing along that line.

I have a son. He's 18 months. My first, and likely only child (she has kids from a previous marriage). I've seen him for a total of 27 days (I counted) since I moved (it's been 8 months since I moved). Visits are hard on us both, because it's a matter of who it's more convenient for to do the traveling. It's a long way from where I am to where my family is, the burden of travel is both in time in finances. It's a pain, but I can't not see my family. 

Anyway. Since I've been away, I find myself... well, just sad an awful lot. Sometimes I don't want to leave my house. I have some friends in the area, but I'm not interested in going anywhere. I just want to sit around, play video games, watch Netflix, stuff like that. I have a dog, but she only goes so far in keeping me company. I've tried picking up other hobbies to keep busy, but at the end of the day I find myself wanting to share my hobbies and experiences with my wife and son rather than doing it alone. That usually sends me right back into a funk.

The aspect of deteriorating mental health is new to me. I've never felt like this. We get all sorts of training in the military on how to deal with it, but it's new territory and I'm just scared for myself. 

To the point. The other night, my wife sent me a video of my son. God, I miss him so much. I was happy to see him walking around, but I was overwhelmed with sadness, like usual. I need to see these pictures and videos of my son, but at the same time it fucking hurts, you know? Watching him grow from afar is not how I imagined I'd be experiencing fatherhood. (My wife understands the pain, as she's been through something similar with her own kids before we got married.) I saved some screenshots of the video and sent a few to my friend, and we got to talking about when I'd be able to go home and visit again. We started chatting about some other random stuff, then after about a 10 minute break in the conversation, she tells me something to the effect of ""you're an incredible person and I wouldn't be where I am today without you."" I can't tell you how much that helped. I just sat there and cried for a few minutes. My self worth has never really been so fragile, and for someone to remind me of the impact I've had on their life was just what I needed. So I confessed to her that I've been struggling with my mental health lately and her message really lifted my spirits.

I've been feeling pretty good since then, and I'm going to see my family in a few weeks. Hopefully I can keep riding this wave of positivity until I get home.

Thanks for reading. It felt good to share.

TL;DR - been struggling with happiness lately, miss my son; my friend randomly praised me for being such a presence in her life, snapped out of funk and feel good for now.",03Mar2020,1

He's lost over 20 lbs and is borderline underweight. He claims he looks better with lean muscle instead of bulky muscle. To me, he looks like his body is eating itself. He's got no muscle mass. His hair is falling out because he's not getting any nutrients from his meals. His face looks hollow and he Never has energy for anything else other than this daily routine.

His mom isn't helping either. She is continously telling him to eat less if he wants to lose weight. She's a dance instructor for ballet and tap.

He was rude, would leave me on read for days if not weeks at a time, didn't reply if he didn't feel like it, was basically just using me for sex. I was naive and inexperienced and went along with it until I couldn't handle it anymore and I ghosted him. But for *months* afterwards I missed him, and have only now been able to accept he wasn't a nice person to me. I thought it had to be something I'd done. 

Then I met another guy, and he was so sweet. He made me feel so safe and secure and I thought I was well on my way to falling in love. About 4 months in my insecurities started again, it's like my gut could tell something was coming. 3 weeks ago he told me he was in love with someone else and couldn't be with me anymore. I fell to pieces. I've self-harmed on and off for about a year, but after he told me this I cut myself more than I ever have before. I bruised my knuckles punching the walls. I couldn't eat, I drank all day, I was just a mess for about a week. I was miserable. 

I started to feel better, and I was glad of that. But I think I was just keeping myself busy so I didn't have to think about it all.

I've been feeling kind of disconnected from reality, only slightly but definitely noticeable and worrying, for about 2 days. It felt a bit like I was high, but without the fun part only the weird feeling (I don't do weed anymore). I also felt demotivated and also stressed cause I knew something is happening to me and I was scared.

Then I had some kind of paranoia attack or smth on the night of the third day of feeling weird, it was cause I read abt someone having a dream within a dream and for the rest of the night I felt like I have never felt before, I've never felt that much paranoia and fear like then, I just calmed down and tried to sleep after an hour.

The feeling of life being less real than before, the one from the first 2 days, became less over the next week, but still now I feel stressed and discomfort mixed with demotivation and a bit of sadness every evening about 3 hours before going to sleep. The stressed feeling is followed by slight stomach pain that feels just like that you get when you're really really nervous. But school is going well atm, family is drama free and loving, I'm healthy, nothing to be stressed about.

Now some days I wake up in the morning with absolutely no stomach pain and feeling normal, that lasts til like 7pm. Other days I wake up with stomach pain and completely demotivated and unhappy. 

I am writing this because until about two weeks ago I was happy, every day, I am generally a really happy person, avoid drama and live a great life. People said I was smiling every time they saw me, and thats probably cause I das purely happy. Now that I don't feel like that, I am worried because this has never happened to me before. 

I'll probably be feeling good again in a month max., I decided on posting this just so I had everything written once, and maybe somebody actually has this happen to himself/herself too. Rn I'm just worried but living, god still helps me daily and I'm thankful.

This is the knowingness that you are always loved and that there is nothing that you need to forgive cause you‚Äôre already free by nature.

Our perceptions will play tricks to us by making us believe that ‚Äúseparation‚Äù is real, this will create in the mind the need of love because we now believe that is missing

Other times we feel an inability to forgive, this happens because we‚Äôre attached to the past experiences, we don‚Äôt want to let go of them cause they ‚Äúdefine‚Äù us

The solution here is always Awareness, cause this is indeed the ultimate medicine

Try to bring Awareness in the bodily sensation of tension and dive deep in the emotional pain, here we‚Äôre simply exploring while resting more and more into Awareness, which is never affected by any emotions or thoughts

184,"I dont even know where to start. I just really need your responses. i have written this post so many times, and got few of them.

First of all, i just want to mention that this post is going to include questions about mental health, and if your response is going to be to see a therapist just dont even bother replying. Its not about money, there are some other reasons and also i dont think that this problem is to an extend where i need one. I would really appreciate each and every respond of yours, since it can help a lot.

Basically. I developed a thought that theres something wrong with me. I think that its on an unconscious level, like even if im not thinking about it, my actions still can be affected by this mindset. It doesnt make me depressed or anything like that, it could be just me being paranoid, or just a teen. But around couple of months ago, the thought came back. It used to come and go but didnt use to bother me that much, maybe for a day max.

But couple of months ago i started considering that i might be on the spectrum. The thing is that if being logical, it doesnt make sense at all, since i got no symptoms of it at all. But for example, hours ago i literally believed that it was true, regardless the logic.

Okay as i said it started months ago, i even remember the day. The next day i had uni, basically it bothered me for that day and after that it went away. Being around people definitely helps, because i dont feel any different, i even tend to think that im above others and even seperate myself from them.

Basically, yea it hasnt bothered me for probabily months, and then the one month break came. I, for particular reasons, ended up with no close friends (it happened probably 2 years ago, when i fell out with my school friends). Even tho at uni i literally got to know to everyone, became the most popular, cuz i definitely dont struggle socially, cuz of different factors i did not manage to make close friends. I mean we still talk to each other, but not outside uni, we only went out couple of times, thats it. But yea, the point is that i ended up alone.

Have Been alone the whole month, and obviously it doesn't help my paranoia. I havent felt completely peacful ever since. This thought kills me. Its not that im depressed, but i question myself a lot, and as i said i even sometimes believe that i have the condition.

I dont even know what to do anymore. My only hope now, is the break to end, tho it happens in 2 weeks. But what should i do till then? My mind keeps clinging on my negative memories, and tries to somehow connect it to the condition, and no matter how ridiculous it is i have moments as i said where i totally start believeing it. Well, its not that im at home all the time. I go to gym everyday, but obviously it doesnt help much.

I don't know what it is. Am i psychotic cuz of loneliness? I haven't felt like a part of group in a while as i said? Or is it just my age? I just turned 18. No matter how many times i tell myself that this thought doesnt make any sense, i just cant help but believe it sometimes.

Being around peope, hopefully will solve this problem, because it is making me insane. As i said the first time i considered it was months ago, and after being around people, feeling that im no different, the thought dissapeared.

Obviously, the fact that i even developed this thought is not healthy. I even used to think that there was something wrong with me and my parents and everyone were hiding it from me, tho obviously it doesnt make sense too, because of how im treated. Is it a part of being 18? Like i have not felt normal, in so long. Its like ""theres got to be something wrong with me."" What do i do? Im tired of going thru this cycle, i obviously dont have it. But i know that maybe even tomorrow i might feel otherwise. I really need your help.",03Mar2020,1
185,"So over the weekend my roommate went out with his friends and got hit by a car that got him sent to the ER with two skull fractures and a concussion. Naturally, after I found out, a couple of our mutual friends and I went to visit him at the hospital. If I'm going to be completely honest I was almost HOPING deep down in my mind that he was going to be in a much worse condition than he happened to be, and felt kind of let down when I saw him in a much better state than I expected. I was obviously aware of the fact that this thought was very wrong and malicious, but I just couldn't help to think it. In the past I have had apathetic reactions to the deaths and injuries of people who I've known personally. The only people I would really care about losing is my immediate family, and very close friends, no one else. Could this be indicative of underlying personally traits or conditions? I feel like these feelings that I get are almost sociopathic in nature.",03Mar2020,1

187,"I have crippling symptoms of social anxiety and major depression. 

A few times throughout my life I have worked up the strength to force myself to go a doctor or a specialist for help. 

The first couple visits are absolute torture to me and it‚Äôs always a situation where it‚Äôs going to be countless visits before any actual treatment will be discussed or the topic of medication can be broached. I seldom go back for even the second appointment. Is is absolute torture. 

I want to believe medication would help me balance out to something closer to neurotypical, and then maybe talk therapy or CBT might be an option, but from where I am now, it is nothing but psychological cruelty. 

My question here is, if I tell them up front that I am in a suicidal crisis, will they be forced to initiate pharmaceutical treatment without the months and months of psychological torture before they administer it?",03Mar2020,1

But my mental health has severely declined in the past 6 months. Im either calling off work, and crying in my bed, or walking around thinking Im hot-shit. Im either depressed, or overly confident. There is no in-between.
Trying to afford college (yet failing to do so) has been my biggest problem.

191,"Hello all! 

It‚Äôs my first time posting here so please let me know if I violate any rules!

I recently started as a temp for a tv show I really enjoy, and I‚Äôve been wanting this kind of job for the longest time! The only problem is it‚Äôs 60 hours per week, 12 hours per day Monday through Friday. It often goes past 12 hours as well, depending on the needs of the office. 

I‚Äôm only on my 3rd day and I feel so so drained mentally and physically. The work itself isn‚Äôt hard but the commute is over an hour every morning (LA traffic). Plus the 12 hours, I feel like it might be too much. 

I heard from another assistant they might offer me a full time position, which would have been my dream job had it not been for the hours. 

Additionally, I meet with my therapist once a week in the middle of the day (that‚Äôs the only time he‚Äôs available), and if I take the job I wouldn‚Äôt be able to meet with him and I have to stay in therapy in my current situation. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. This could jump start my career but it would mean 60 hours per week for 9 months. 

Any advice and help would be appreciated, if you need more information about my situation please ask! 

TLDR: job that could jumpstart my career requires 60 hour weeks and I don‚Äôt know if I can do that in my current mental health situation.",03Mar2020,1
192,"Ive had depression for most of my life or at least been at some state of it, it is not always bad,there really are days when I don't feel it.  I (25 F) realized that my emotions mostly depend on the emotions of other people I truly care about and how they feel and depend on the environment.

I have days when I feel okay,  not super happy, not depressed, just okay. Then I have days when I feel great for no specific reason, I feel ""high"" in energy, I sleep less, I feel motivated, active, have great confidence, high sex drive, I am social, I like to talk, I feel like I can do anything, be at the top of the world etc. I do not have delusions or something like that. These days kick in for no specific reason, at the same day I can feel pretty low and then all of the sudden I entry into that ""life is great  I am great,"" stare of mind. Also, I can fall out of it into the ""depressed"" state for some reason :
(pretty small one) or for no reason at all. 

I sleep longer, feel tired, i am less active,  have really low sex drive, I am unmotivated, lot of procrastinating, I am easily irritated, less social, I cry sometimes, stop doing hobbies that I usually love, feel pretty down etc. I want to say I do NOT have suicid thoughts in this state most of the time, I did before but It was while I was in a big depression, I am not anymore. 

What could it be? I am tired of feeling great for few days or weeks so that just a second after all of the sudden I just want to lay in my bad and sleep and be alone. I want to help myself but I cant. I like my ""happy"" period though, I wish it could be a constant one.

193,"Hi all!

My name is Gwen, and I'm 17! I have come to this sub to get all this off my chest. 

For the past year, I have been unusually bitter, angry, explosive, and often switch between emotions. I used to have a normal rate of getting upset and having it pass within a few hours, but this time? It's different. 

I became so explosive I began to abuse my boyfriend. While talking to him, I would be absolutely the most pleasant and lovable person, flooding him with sweet compliments and telling him I loved him... and then I'd just start screaming and crying and accusing him of horrible things, I'd threaten both him and myself, and I'd even throw things. This was a matter of *minutes* now, not even hours. Some days he wasn't even doing anything. I'd insult him and verbally degrade him, and then a wave of pity and remorse would flood my system and I'd become so soft again. And then it started to follow me to school and work. I used to be so friendly, and now I get so irritated for the tiniest things. I blurted out ""bitch!"" to a girl who was in my way when I was walking. I talk back to my coworkers now. I am more prone to punching/cutting/kicking/breaking whatever I can find in my room, valuable or not. I have been known to forget after intense arguments or high pressure situations, as told my my boyfriend, which is worrying. 

Some days I feel like there is nothing in life that could possibly help me. I am tired, I am lost, and I don't want to keep waking up every day. I don't know what to do.",03Mar2020,1

i have been feeling like a waste a space. sometimes i can't cope well and I honestly feel like im failing the 2 subjects im taking in school. i cant do the presentations needed for some of the units or even practise presentations. It's given me so much anxiety that I don't turn up to lesson anymore that i know will be involving presentations for that lesson in fear of getting upset. my teachers hate my guts over it. 

i have this one support teacher but she is also busy with other students. ive emailed her quite a few times just to ask when i can speak to her (over another issue) but she hadn't had time to get back to me and i honestly feel ignored and alone. she sees everyone else within a day or two but with me i never see her and can't have the chance to talk to her. it makes me feel like shit and that she hates me. i havent got anyone else to talk to either. 

if i dare say that i feel like shit she says she might have to call my parents cus shes worried about me and its my worst fear as my parents don't support my mental health. they think i shouldnt have mental health issues as my sisters are fine. 

i don't want to exist anymore but i don't want to die. i just want to be normal like everyone else in my class. everyone else can do presentations without missing lessons or being sick. everyone else can talk in group activities. 

my friend hates how i get upset over the things I cant change. tho most of my mental health i could change, theres something i cant unfortunately and it was about that. i think that the thing has rocked me over and that's why im like this. i was having an alright day up until that moment and then i felt sick after it happened.

205,"The odds of any of us ever being born are 1 to 400 trillion. 

The odds that I missed 25-30 basketball shots in a row, on May 18, 2010. at the age of 14, it's probably about the same misfortune. 

Just Imagine rolling Snake Eyes with a pair of dice 25 to 30 times in a row (consecutively). 

After this mentally deteriorating event, I began practicing and playing basketball more than I normally would have cared to do to the negative criticism I had received circa the fall 2011 in Grade 11. 

I did not know how to even shoot a ball properly, nor with properly taught how to dribble. 

I was a terrible basketball player in September of 2011.I would often get into fights and arguments with people when they were just trying to tell me the truth. 

Now, fast forward to Grade 12 in the 2012-2013 season. 

I was never a real good dribbler and never will be. 

But I sure as hell could fucking shoot, when I practice every single fucking day in the fall of 2011 winner of 2012 and spring of 2012. 

They don't say practice makes perfect for fucking nothing.

I love scoring threes, my favourite spot to shoot from would be the three-point line. 

I practiced very frequently. 

I wasn't quite Kobe (RIP), but my performance had improved exponentially where I was exceptionally better than what it would have been just 14 to 16 months prior.

So all of this was triggered by a teacher (bear in mind I‚Äôm an 18 year old straight A student, not some 12 year old troublemaker)  who admitted afterwards to me that she felt like she was having a breakdown and that she has a lot of things in her personal life at the moment like her child has the flu etc. But basically I asked the teacher a question in class, something I already had some tension towards doing and she completely flipped on me. Called me out in front of the whole class, made me cry, then when that wasn‚Äôt enough she took me outside the door and proceeded to shout at me for a solid ten minutes. After this point I could not breathe she was still in my personal space giving out to me for crying basically diminishing my problems and she had to go back into the class to get a friend to help me as I genuinely felt the walls were closing in on me.

Overwhelmed and burnt out from work, I quit and thankfully was able to live off savings for a few months, since employment insurance wasn't really an option for me. I hoped some time off would be enough to get me back on my feet and back into the work force, but I realize I really need to see a professional and finally get a much overdue diagnosis.

About six months ago (two months before I had to quit) I also started renting a house with one of my friends, and to celebrate the house he got some cats. Our initial lease was only six months and now we're on month to month payments, thankfully, but I've ran out of money and don't have any other option than to move back with my parents for a few months, who live hours away from here. They want to see me get better and will help me get a diagnosis, so I have that going for me at least.

The problem is, I haven't told my roommate yet and will have to tell him tonight that I'll most likely be moving out by the end of the month. He also suffers from poor mental health which in his case can lead to angry violent outbursts. Part of it for sure is on me for not being super up front with him about my finances and mental health, but he knows I've been running out of money too.

I'm just worried when I tell him he may take it really poorly, either hitting me or destroying my property in a rage. He'll wake up in 3-4 hours and that's when I have to break the bad news to him. I'm worried for him too, that he might not be able to find another roommate to fill my shoes, and he might not be able to find a pet friendly apartment in that time. And it's a few days less than a months notice too, which I know isn't kosher at all. As much as I wanted to help him out when I moved here initially, it just didn't work out on my end and I feel really bad for adding this much more stress to his already full plate.

Wish both of us luck, I want to get healthy as soon as possible, I want to be able to move safely with all of my stuff in tact, and I really don't want him to hurt himself as a result. I hope I'm just overthinking this, but I know it's also a pretty big deal.",03Mar2020,1
