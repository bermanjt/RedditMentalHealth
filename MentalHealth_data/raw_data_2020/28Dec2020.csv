0,"I have depression, anxiety, and I’m a introvert. We had a Christmas party on the eve and I am now drained. I have been drained the past 3 days and all I do is sit in my room. I don’t want to do anything except sleep. 

Each day is getting worse  and I don’t know what to do. I am scared for going back to school because i typically don’t have a good time going back after breaks. I talk to minimal people and I don’t want to bother them during holiday (and they’re teachers so it’s not just my friend).",28Dec2020,1
1,"So I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety but I’m still having some trouble actually believing that diagnosis. I think one of the hardest things for me is that I sometimes think that maybe I actually do have some sort of depression or maybe that’s just how growing up is and i’m just not as good with coping with it as other people. 

Honestly this unsureness is one of the biggest things contributing to my anxiety and I think about it a lot but since I think that depression isn’t real then I think that my anxiety can’t be real either. I’m always worried that maybe I don’t actually have anxiety or depression and I’m just faking it. This kept me from seeking out help for a long time but I finally realized that the way I was doing things wasn’t making me any better so I decided to try and get help. 

Ive been thinking about starting medication but i’m scared to take it because i’m like what if I take this medication but i’m not actually depressed enough to be taking it. I’m kinda scared to tell my therapist this because I feel like they’ll think i’m a total idiot, which I know they probably won’t think that but I just can’t make myself believe that. 

I’m also scared because even if my psychiatrist says I have depression and anxiety, do I really? How could they know for sure, they barely even know me. I can never be 100% sure that I do or do not have these things and I don’t like that uncertainty. 

Also, as weird as it sounds, I think that maybe I almost want to be diagnosed with something because then I can tell myself that I’m not crazy or strange fo what I think, but that other people think it too. 

This is straight up just a rant but I felt like I just had to get it out there ya know? Thanks for reading and for any advice if you’ve got any!",28Dec2020,1
2,"So I usually always either bite the skin of my lips or fingers and I've been doing it for many years now. It's not only when I'm in public but also when I'm just laying in bed doing nothing.
So I was just biting my fingers again while watching anime when I noticed that my hands were all sticky. I turned on the lights to discover that I was bleeding a lot. It usually doesn't bleed this much, so I was pretty shocked. It took a while to get the bleeding to stop.
I usually have wounds around my fingers and lips that hurt a lot, especially in the cold winter temperatures.
I never thought that there was anything wrong with this, but I think it is getting kind of out of hand.
The reason I'm posting this here is because I want to find out whether this is related to my anxiety or if it's something else. Maybe it's not that serious.
And yes, I have tried to stop this habit many times before. It does help whenever I wear nail polish. I don't bite my nails as much as my skin, but even having something on my nails interferes with the skin picking. But it's too much of a hassle to keep applying nail polish. For the lip biting however I don't know how to stop it.",28Dec2020,1

5,"Hello everyone. 


In September last year I ended a marriage which I would describe as being the culmination of 10 years of 'nice Guy' resentment. Thankfully my ex wife (30F) and I are best friends now and hang out often, but there really isn't anything romantic there.

The motivation to end the marriage was the realisation of years of sustained suppressed thoughts of wanting it to end, as well as meeting a girl that set my world on fire like no one I had ever met before. At this point I hit my 'affair or divorce' moment, and thought the most moral choice to be to divorce and live in reality albeit a painful and chaotic reality, rather than continue a marriage based on lies and unwillingness to recognise the truth - although the divorce may have fucked up many elements of my life, at least now I could say in all honestly that I was living the truth, even if that truth makes my flaws more evident.

After the marriage ended I almost immediately started a relationship with said girl (21F). It didn't last more than a few months as my world was still spinning from the marriage breakup and she quite rightly didn't want to be a part of that. She and I are still friends and message most days, although strictly platonic (her enforcement), she lives away at uni, so we can't see each other anyway. I fully suspect she has moved on and put it behind her and she has even said things to this effect. I go through periods of convincing myself that I've moved on that vary in authenticity depending on seemingly random factors. Every interaction we have is riddled with overthink on my part in order to try and appear cool and 'moved on' when in reality all I actually want to do is profess my undying love, something that she would not appreciate - how pathetic. 

If I were to come clean about the way I feel I know it would end our friendship as it currently is, and would almost certainly shut down all potential for us to get back together. I know she is moving back to my area after uni, and I am holding out on seeing if we strike things up again when she returns... I haven't fully admitted this to myself until writing it now - this is the value of speaking publicly about your thoughts! It's only now that I vocalise those shadows of thought that I see how deceitful it is - I should probably act on this in a responsible way - thoughts?

I know that logically that the relationship with miss 21F was never going to work, even though we both exclaimed at how rapidly we developed feelings for each other and how intense it was compared to anything else we'd experienced. Logically we were very incompatible, we're both very stubborn and have different political views (she's very woke, I'm libertarian). Her parents are quite young and thus would probably freak out if they met me (because of how similar my age is to theirs). We have completely different levels of life experience, she's very independent and so I think would rather make mistakes than have someone spoil all of the surprises. I always seemed to wind her up by challenging her views, and she would wind me up by holding contradictory opinions etc. Basically, we weren't a good match and I know this to be true, but my emotions are completely steamrolling any logic.

Although the Tinder gods have been kind to me, I've struggled to develop any connection, sometimes any arousal at all with the girls I've spent time with. It's usually a bit of sex, often done out of routine/not wanting to give up on trying to move on, until they realise I'm emotionally unavailable and it ends; often to my unexpected relief.
Every girl I meet is immediately, involuntarily compared to my ex, and comes up short. Not realistically I might add, many of the women I meet are far more amicable, considerate, caring and compatible, but none of them have the same 'it' that, in all honesty, gets my heart going just thinking about- I don't know what this 'it' is by the way. This comparison is not a logical one, but done on feelings, they never make me feel the same way my ex did when we met.
The best analogy I can think of is fire, when my ex and I met, it was like a match landed on some dried out kindling, there probably weren't enough logs underneath for it to burn for long, but the chaos in my life, being like the wind, extinguished the fire before it burned out. Whereas everyone else I seem to meet is like a match landing on wet logs - you can throw a bit of kindling on there to get it going, but ultimately there is rarely enough for the logs to catch, even now that the wind has died down.

I'm very much aware that I am projecting my unreality onto my interpretation of me ex. The persona of her that I have in my head is what I am in love with and what I associate with all the excitement etc, however it does not necessarily reflect who she is in the real world. According to Jung this really is the essence of all human familiarity, however in my case it's causing an attachment to a person that is not reciprocated, due to the innacuracies between my model of who she is, and her model of who she is.

In my head if she let me love her we would be happy, in her head if I stopped trying to love her we would be happy, in reality, we aren't actually compatible and I'm the one refusing to let go of an old model.
When attempting to analyse this I think that this outdated mental model of her, is providing me a desirable solution for something that I need (and if I could just reignite the relationship then I'd be able to get that thing), and my subconscious is unwilling to let it go without an alternative. In short, I am missing something that my brain thinks I will get if I reignite this relationship and I need to work out what it is.

I think therefore that in order to move on, really I must work out what emotional impulse that the memory of this previous relationship was providing for me, and formulate a different way to achieve that. I know, through the many failed attempts at developing attachment to other girls, that it was not simply sex or companionship, most of my interim 'flings' have been very sexually active, and most often with a woman who seems genuinely interested in forming a relationship with me. It wouldn't strike me that 'being wanted', in its simplest form at least, is what I am craving, nor sexual gratification. I find myself easily frustrated by the frequent attempts of new partners to provide companionship (frequent messaging etc) and so I do not think it is driven my loneliness or need for companionship.

To audit my fears:

- I'm certainly afraid that I will not find someone that excites me like my ex did. I've been fortunate enough to have many relationships (despite being overweight and unatractive) and can say with certainty that these feelings of excitement were unique.

- I am afraid of losing the opportunity to reignite things with my ex. I recognise that this is probably something I should force (gracefully) as part of moving on. Delving a little deeper, I think I'm afraid of the feelings of rejection that would be caused by her underlining things with me. And I should say that she has indeed said that we're just pals now. I don't seem fatally dismissed by this underline - I think perhaps because of my personal experience of these sort of underlines being fairly context specific and likely to change in a few years/new life situation. I've had a few situations in my life where 'No way' has turned into the complete opposite after some time apart and new jobs/friend groups. Compatibility is fluid, however it's much harder to regain the ability to generate sexual interest once one has demonstrated undesirable sexual traits, such as begging, neediness etc.

- I'm afraid of appearing needy, and I think added to this fear is the uncomfortable knowledge that I am doing just that by continuing to message her etc. I try therefore not to let on too much about how I actually feel - writing this makes me feel uncomfortable as I know it is behaviour I typically think poorly of in other people.

I'll stop writing now, this is even boring me, but I welcome thoughts and comments.

I shan't be critical of anyone wishing to insult me, it's your right to do so. Though I would encourage you to think a few questions deeper into why you dislike what I have said/expressed and share that too, such that I may learn from your valid reaction.

I write all of the above as a self audit to the world, in order to help me think clearly about my reality, as well as invite others to comment and share advice and thoughts.

Love you all, Merry Christmas and a happy new year.

Tldr; I have an ex that is no longer interested in me romantically, but I can't let go of our relationship as it excited me in ways that I've never experienced before. I've been fortunate enough to have had many relationships in my life and this one was very unique. I've found moving on almost I possible and am trying to work out why. We are friends and talk often, but Im having to actively suppress a desire to go romantic - something I know she would not appreciate. Please help.me work out what is preventing me from moving on.

P.S. I know how toxic Reddit can be, so if you're looking for great zinger ammo:
- I wore nappies to bed until I was 7 because I was afraid of wetting the bed
- I'm a little overweight and self-conscious about it
- I have an annoyingly pointed and long nose that I dislike
- I have a bit of a lisp and often blur my words
- The only humour I'm remotely good at is the anchorman type fake bravado, but most people think I'm being serious and think I'm a jerk.

I'd reccomend calling me a ""Fat narcissistic man-child"" - I would find that particularly demeaning. :-)",28Dec2020,1

8,"It started with her getting upset because COVID has delayed her plans of getting plastic surgery procedures due to the new regulations and travel bans. I think she is really pretty and doesn’t need any of those procedures, but for some reason she strongly believes she does. I won’t go into detail about her life but let’s just say that compared to a lot of other 20 year olds, she truly is lucky and blessed. But she won’t stop complaining and obsessing over her appearance. She thinks she is ugly even though a lot of people say she is good looking. She doesn’t believe us. I don’t know what’s wrong with her. She gets plenty of male attention. She is very easy on the eyes and multiple of people have confirmed this.  

I told her, “You have multiple men chasing you. Everyone says you are attractive. Some people say it to your face, but a lot of people say it behind your back too! So why don’t you believe them?”
And she said to me, “I don’t know. I just don’t see what they see.”

Last night I went over to her house. Her mother was getting increasingly frustrated. Apparently my friend’s been sitting still all day, doing nothing. She was quiet all day, withdrew from her family and church. Her mother got angry when she found out what was causing her change of attitude. She got out her phone, took a picture of my friend and showed her the picture and said, “You think you’re ugly? Seriously?? I think you have a mental illness. I’m going to book you in for therapy.” 
My friend insisted that she doesn’t have a mental illness and how dare her mom accuse her of being mentally ill. They got into a huge fight which dragged on for hours (also super awkward for me being in the room lol). 

Ever since making physical attractiveness and “perfection” (her words, not mine) a goal of hers, she refuses to go out anymore. It sucks for me because I enjoy hanging out with her and had to spend the last couple of days indoors. But that night I stayed over and she seemed really off.. She confessed to me that she has been getting suicidal thoughts. She says she’s not sure how to go on with life because she wants to live with a “perfect face”. She is honestly gorgeous so hearing her say these things and act this way is so fricken weird. I genuinely think she needs therapy but I’m scared to tell her because she might get angry at me like how she got angry at her mom for suggesting it. What do I do?! I’m actually really worried about her",28Dec2020,1
9,"Hello, my name is Dominick, i’m 16 and i’ve been struggling with feelings of unworthiness my whole entire life. I was raised in a household with an emotionally manipulative mother who was an alcoholic, and a dad who had to work as a cop and as an advance auto parts mechanic to support my mom’s drinking habits and my brother and I. I was bullied from Pre-K - 6th grade, and it got so bad to the point where I got rocks thrown at my head in 3rd grade. I moved away after my parents divorced and met my step mom to my surprise was also an alcoholic, i only stayed from 6th grade till my first month of 8th grade after my dad and my step mom got into a huge argument.My mom disowned me back in my freshmen year of high school because I had a panic attack over her drinking habits and called me a “manipulative lying son of a b****” and to “never see or talk to her ever again”. I remember that fateful day ever so clearly, it was thanksgiving break and I waited outside the dollar general right across the street from my moms apartment complex. Previous to that, in 8th grade I came out as gay, my father didn’t take any liking to that and said it was “just a phase and i’ll grow out of it”. That’s when my moms manipulation got worse, it was a catalyst for her manipulation until I had enough and that’s when she disowned me. I mentioning all of this because I feel like it contributes to my overall feeling of unworthiness, I feel unworthy of love, not only love of let’s say a significant other, but in general. I don’t feel worthy of self-love, love of friends, family, love from animals, spiritually, just everything. I feel like i’m not worthy of anything good in my life to the point where I self-sabotage (I just realized that as i’m typing this out) why do I feel this way? Honestly, I feel like it’s a combination of multiple things, 1. Always being criticized when I was in my youth “be more like your brother” “start working out LIKE your brother” “your getting fat” “your not smart” “your not funny” “your ugly” “your unattractive”, and a combination of things I tell myself “no one loves you” “it’s all fake” “your disgusting” “your unworthy of taking care of yourself” “your stupid”. 2. Not getting the love i so desperately craved in my youth from my mom and dad. I honestly don’t know where it stems from and it SUCKS. I don’t know how to cope with this feeling to say the least, or how to begin to understand where it’s coming from, and how do I tackle this. Thanks!",28Dec2020,1

16,"The Defenceman: Holding Fast Through Echoes of the Past

By Cory MacLeod

I can vividly recall my first soccer team. I see the faces of my former teammates in my head and can still feel the joy of the game when I replay the mental clips I still retain. When I began, I was old enough that we were actually assigned positions, rather than that traditional chaotic swarm of children one might envision when thinking of a child’s soccer game. Over the course of roughly twelve years, I was on defence. I dabbled in the other positions here and there at the request of various coaches, but I always ended up back on defence. My specialty was disarming the forwards; taking away their power. My problem was that once I took it away, I got rid of it as quickly as I could. A wiser player would keep the ball and play it strategically by say, passing it to the nearest team member who might have the best chance of shifting the momentum of the game and ultimately, scoring. I however, would disarm the attacker and get the ball out of my zone. What happened to it after that was out of my hands. As long as I successfully defended my net, I had fulfilled my duty.

The mind is a fickle thing. It is an organ that can fall ill just as any other can, but the attention given to its wellbeing falls flat in comparison to that given to any other. Poisonous thoughts cannot be extracted by a scalpel. Experiences in our memory that pass through the mind’s eye like a venom, cannot be fought off by antibiotics. Trauma is not a virus that must simply run its course, and simply awaiting the passage of time does not guarantee a recovery without some form of intervention. Yes, there is a biological component in the form of an imbalance of chemicals, but even once the scales have equalized there is much that needs done to move on and accept the echoes of the past. Our mental health is just as important as our physical health and it is time to acknowledge that taking steps to heal the mind is not weak, nor should the topic carry stigmatization any longer. We are emotional creatures, and the wrong experience can pierce our thoughts like a bullet through flesh, and we are covering that mental wound with a band aide.

The household I was raised in could be described accurately as a veiled pandemonium. Our family had a manufactured curb appeal to outsiders. Everything was a front. My behavior with guests could only go one way, and any detours from the acceptable would be addressed with rage the moment the door closed upon their departure. Exposure to anger in all its forms was a daily event. I was verbally and emotionally abused by both parents, and physically abused by one of them. Over the years I was told short, undetailed anecdotes about my mother’s exposure to different forms of abuse at the hands of her father. My father was an identical twin, whose yin committed suicide after he experience an event that would echo in my own life, years later. The raging yang became unbalanced, having lost its opposite in the light. The seemingly perpetual cycle of unattended mental health came full circle from my grandparents to my parents, and it would become painfully obvious that I failed at putting an end to the pattern.

I was an easy target of ridicule at school as a lad; looking backwards I can understand why. I was plagued with an undiagnosed anxiety disorder, and fell apart upon receiving any criticism, constructive or otherwise. I met praise of any kind with joy, and reacted to judgment with sorrow. My older brother has Down’s Syndrome and was constantly teased and mocked by a generation of students who had no education on the subject. Teasing him felt like I was being teased myself, and I was always fending off the verbal strikes of ignorant peers. Lacking a developed prefrontal cortex, I could not manage my emotions and became extremely defensive when my faults were called out by anyone. I’d find the easiest, quickest way to disarm the attack, and kick the ball as far away as I could.

Throughout 2013 and half of 2014, I was using alcohol as a drug. The responsible use of the substance was long gone, and I made the choice to frequently escape my situation into a numb, drug-induced stupor that became a freedom from all bonds. While it was in part a learned behaviour, in that I watched my mother drink her emotions for years, I put the blame for my actions solely upon myself. I had found what I thought at the time was a perfect balance; a recipe that would allow me to solider on as I was. I worked two jobs, quite literally around the clock. I had a half-hour window between jobs to speed home and offer my very real affection to my family. My wife, her daughter who I raised as my blood for ten years, and my biological son, Kai. I took the brief moment in my day to catch their updates and offer my own, and continue on to the next job. By the time I arrived home at 11:10 pm most evenings, my family was asleep. I took the time to delve into the world of online gaming, an addiction itself, and pair that with the consumption of the most abused drug in the world.

I ignored my wife. They call that neglect. Sure, I spent my one day off a week with her, but that wasn’t enough. I had fallen into an unhealthy routine. I parented my kids and I paid the bills, but I wasn’t a proper partner. And one day, June 9th 2014, I drove home and pulled into the driveway. Stepping into the house, I saw empty dresser drawers pulled out of a dresser frame, sitting in a pile in the living room. I thought nothing of this initially. I stepped into the kitchen, and noticed that the oven was gone. This was the first real sign that furrowed my brow. I needed only take a few more steps to the doorway of the master bedroom to realize what I was facing. Four more steps down the hall, and a glance into the bedrooms of my children, and I knew what had happened. She was gone.

I would find out later that she had been having an affair with a man that lived quite literally around the corner. She moved in with him and refused all my attempts at reconciliation. I begged her to come home one day, on this man’s front lawn while he draped his arm over her, and she responded to my tear-wrenched pleas by passionately kissing him in a sick display of blatant mockery. I retreated in my car.

I remember the way that I planned to do it. I do not care to share the details regarding said method, but at that moment, it seemed to be the easiest way to end the suffering for good. The pain was unbearable. It would be appropriate to mention at this point, that I was raised a church-going catholic, and was an adult who ascribed to the idea of intelligent design and the existence of angels. This is only worth mentioning, because I was planning the necessary steps in my head, when I suddenly began to speak, out loud, to myself. I had tears in my eyes and had been sobbing in emotional agony, when my own voice box seemed to have been hijacked. I verbalized something along the lines of, “It’s okay, Cory. You will get through this, and everything will work out in time. You need only be patient.” The words were clear and concise, articulated in a manner that couldn’t have been uttered by me, I thought. I probed my mind for an explanation, and decided unrefutably that it was my father’s deceased twin Ian, speaking to me directly. Ian knew, that I knew, that he had not been strong enough in life to weather his own storm, but this was a chance for him to do some good, by returning as some sort of mental apparition. Where he failed, I would hold fast. To this day, I firmly believe that it was this very moment that steadied my hand, so to speak, and why these words are able to be gathered here now. Incidentally, I have since lost my faith, and label myself an agnostic atheist. I now believe that my experience that day was some sort of mental defence mechanism; my own brain took over the controls of my consciousness for but a moment, in a desperate attempt at self-preservation. Therefore, it did seem to me that my own brain was on defence, and took the ball away from the attacker and cleared it from the zone, far away from my goal. The attacker was trauma, but my brain was an exceptionally skilled defenceman.

As I had feared from the day of my son’s birth, there is no denying that the pattern of mental health concerns in my family has claimed another mind. My son’s biological mother fell into hard drugs and prostitution. She went through man after man, and allowed my son to roam unsupervised around the low-income housing complex where she resided, while he was in her care. I worked a full-time job and had my son with me my two days off per week, until she uprooted and moved five hours away to allegedly escape drug debts and the like. He still came to me on weekends. I would soon learn that she had not been parenting Kai at all, and that it was in fact, his older half-sister who had assumed a makeshift parental role, and she decided enough was enough, and disclosed to me what had been going on. I gained custody of my son, and his mother retreated to the other side of the country, effectively abandoning him.

The decline of my son’s mental health was swift and merciless, and his young undeveloped brain responded to trauma through acts of violence and aggression. Asking him why he felt the need to be violent and aggressive was met with confusion. He did not yet possess the mental capacity to verbalize his feelings or make changes to his line of thought. It will take time, medication, and intensive therapy to heal these symbolic wounds. Additionally, it will take a system of unyielding support from my wife and I, our friends, and our teetering mental health system. It is the latter that worries me.

The realization that it is time to switch positions occurs to me now. The forward position is too aggressive for my liking. Oppositely, there is far too much pressure on the keeper, and my shoulders have the mental weight of generations on them; a burden that only becomes heavier the more I discuss and explore the topic. I have chosen the center midfield as my desired position. A balance of both worlds; a medium, but far from neutral, player in the game. An attacker as much as a defender, and contributing much more than I ever have before. Push and pull.

I seek to live to see the day that the stigma surrounding mental health is no more, and that participating in discussions about said topic is no longer regarded as taboo or weak. I believe the phenomenon is cultural, and that knocking down the barricaded door to mental health discussions has already begun in my country, but that there is a very long way to go. I whole-heartedly believe that there is no such thing as normal, and that western media exposes us to far too many unachievable ideals that people can spend a lifetime struggling to obtain, very much in vain. I frequently hum a therapeutic lyric to myself when I require immediate reassurance. Sung by an animated nomad in my favourite television show of all time, accompanied by the rhythmic strums of what sounds like a pipa, he sings: “Even if you’re lost you can’t / lose the love because it’s in your heart.” Unyielding love has been my antidote, and I patiently wait for the echoes of the past to become far enough away that I can no longer hear them; and it will be my tool to hold fast in the face of all of my future challenges. I will never surrender.",28Dec2020,1

I'm not motivated to do anything, I'm having a hard time sleeping, I'm anxious almost daily, overthinking everything, I'm not taking care of myself, I'm not even working. I feel how my mental health is deteriorating slowly, and this is not the first time.

A few weeks ago I started to feel this way again, but to the point I literally couldn't work at all, my therapist told me I was just mentally exhausted which I agree but I was in college as well, right now, I'm not taking classes, I'm barely working and I still feel terrible. I'm constantly numb and bored of myself and I don't know how to tell people exactly how I feel, I kinda joke about it because that's how I cope but I've been in bed for longer than i should and I'm constantly feeling guilty for not being productive.

19,"I started my mental health ""Journey "" about two years ago. I'm way better off than where I was, but depression still pops in every now and then to say hello.  I'm so ignorant and I just don't know what to do.

People describe me as such a loveable and fun person, but I get incredibly angry and develop a short fuse. Suicidal thoughts have never gone away, but they get stronger every now and then. 

Therapy has been going pretty smooth since we've been talking about my anger, but this last session has gone a bit different.  I couldn't focus on anything he was saying and he started looking irritated.  I started crying and then he asked me what's wrong.
I told him that I'm getting tired of fighting and I hate constantly keeping tabs on my health. Then, he asked me how I felt about medication. 

After explaining to me the whole session that medication will help my chemical imbalance, he led me to the doctor's office where his office is connected to. He told me to reach out to him after I made an appointment to see the doctor and we'll reschedule.  He told the woman at the front desk that I am depressed and I have suicidal ideation.

After an embarrassing time scheduling an appointment while filled with tears, I texted my therapist when I got home that I made the appointment. He never messaged me after that. Did I do something wrong? 

I saw him two years ago for cognitive behavior therapy and he said that if I developed the tools, I wouldn't need medication. Did I not develop my tools enough or am just not capable to?

I guess I didn't realize how upset I was about it, but I started crying when I was typing this.. then again I am pretty emotional right now and think I'm having a session of depression.",28Dec2020,1

What I want to talk about is something I've never really discussed, but I feel like the core of my issues may lie somewhere within. 

I make myself depressed seemingly on purpose, with the intention of weaponising it to get attention. Now this hurts all the people I know and is super toxic, however I can't seem to stop doing it. I'm not sure if its Narcissism, some strange victim complex or perhaps at the heart of it all I'm well...evil?

Motivation has never been a thing for me I just don’t have things that make me want to work or do things. Like laundry or dishes. I have a Bipolar II diagnosis and I take medicine for that and hyperthyroidism. Lately (the past few weeks I’d say) I have had no motivation at all. I can’t make myself do anything and it’s been extremely frustrating. I’m mad at myself and I feel hopeless, then I get mad at myself for throwing a pity party. I’m just at a loss about what to do. I don’t know how to get my motivation back, I don’t know how to unslump myself and I guess I just need help. How have you gotten out of a slump? How do you make yourself keep going when there’s nothing worth going for? I’ve tried starting a new class (coding), but now I can’t bring myself to keep going with that.

23,"    I feel worthless. Over the summer it seemed I had everything together. I could animate, play games, exercise and spend time with family. I guess it started when school came around. 
     Throughout August and September everthing was fine but October, November snd December were different. In Oct My dad's friend moved in for a week. Dad's friend abuses his 2 pit bulls. I've never been more pissed but I couldn't speak my mind, I would go mute when ever it happened. Around this time I started listening to Tyler the creator's goblin and got addicted to Golden, Goblin and Fish instrumental. Back then was better than now, I would still animate. 
     During November I started having sexual feelings. Ever since I was 12 that was my number 1 taboo. But in time I caved and masturbated. I take it seriously, way more than necessary, I find it gross and dishonorable but I kept doing it I'd set challenges but all  attempts failed. Today I shame myself for it(Why can'tI be normal and move on?).
     On December I even masturbated on my Mom's death anniversary. I've been beating myself up over this. Staying in my room more than joining Dad and Ms. Because of this I've been torturing myself on a cycle. Masturbate, turn violent, blind myself to the ""shore"", sulk, enjoy life at the ""shore"", Repeat. It's sad, the way I want it. I am a monster. I have it coming.
      Everytime I get mad I feel a kin to Eva beast mode. A reign of a terrifying inferno. This is illogical. I don't know where I'm gonna go. I just want to keep myself here. I'm sorry Mom, Dad, Ms. I should be put down. Yesterday I tried to make myself cry. It didn't work. My body can't keep up with my drive. I am a heathen who needs to be shamed.

25,"For everyone..

This year has been quite shit for everyone. 

To the people who have lost loved ones: hold on to those memories, use those emotions to keep going, we have to face the hard truth that they are not going to come back but trust me over time you will learn to except this. I’m not saying the pain will every fully go away but at some point you have to let go 

To the people with friends struggling: check in with them, if you know what people are going through and they trust you enough to tell you, use that information to try and change that. You can be that one person that can make them reconsider something in there life, sometimes all they need is someone who cares, someone who can just listen. 

To the people that know no one struggling: look around, at your friends, family, co workers. The people you least expect always have something going on. Ask the friend that seems to have it all together, ask the friend who doesn’t talk to much, ask the friend who is often home alone, ask the friend who looks like they have pain in there eyes. 

To the people that are struggling themselves: reach out, there’s always someone who will listen and genuinely care about you and if you can’t think of any I’m sure that someone in this sub would be more then happy to listen, you’re not alone. So many people are silently drowning, to scared to spill there emotions to other people, to scared of what would happen if they did, your brain won’t let you see how bad something is getting. If you can’t figure out how to help yourself, help others, be there for someone just like you want there to be someone for you 

To the people who are suicidal: even if you feel like you don’t have a reason to live, use those emotions and feelings to push other people that need it then eventually u might learn to help yourself to. 


As someone who covers most of these, I want to exist for other people, I don’t really care abt myself (idk if that’s a good thing 😐)  but if you read this it means nothing without doing something and Ik not many will see this but if I can change one persons outlook that’s all that matters",28Dec2020,1

I figure sitting around and being happy (just in the moment) is better than sitting around and being crippled by suicidal thoughts without the energy to do anything about it. I’m asking if it’s ok because I feel guilty that I’m not being super productive.

This of course applies outside of my little example at this current time.",28Dec2020,1
28,"I feel so drained and discouraged working full time (40 hours a week) and sometimes being scheduled 6 days in a row between days off. I'm beginning to feel even more anxious at work when it comes to interacting with people in the pharmacy and customers at the drop off and pick up sections. I just feel like I don't have a proper personality and I don't know who to be or I even want to be. I feel uncomfortable and insecure and it's hard to handle unless I'm alone these days. 

My thinning hair that I plan to shave when it gets too thin I think is a contributing factor to my low self esteem along with a general lack of confidence, anxiety, and social awkwardness. There's also a past mistake that brings me great shame that has been replaying in my head for months now and I just can't let go of it even though I should. I feel insecure even with long time friends and I just don't know who I am anymore. 

If I could pin point when this all started I would have to say it was sometime around the start of 2019. Around this time I began my habit of smoking a lot of pot. When I first started getting high I felt as if the high me was the best me I could be. I felt socially at ease and just felt like I was having more fun in general smoking all day every day. Unfortunately, I discovered after some months that this feeling wasn't something that I could maintain forever.

Soon, whenever I didn't smoke I felt really uncomfortable in my skin and when I did smoke I was just so forgetful and aloof. As my habit of smoking became more frequent I began to fixate on my looks and my social skills and felt as if those two aspects of my life were the REAL problems that I need to fix in order to be happy. Unfortunately I felt as if my world was over with my thinning hair at just 18 years old as there as not much one can do about it without risking adverse health affects. As time went on I also realized after a sexual experience that I don't get fully aroused and I'm unable to have penetrative sex easily and I think this is due to improper masturbation technique at a younger age.

So, on top of feeling ugly and socially and mentally incompetent, I also began to fixate on my sexual issues. As months went by, I've distanced myself from friends and began spending days just working overnights at a gas station and browsing reddit and the internet in general. Eventually somewhere during this time a past mistake popped into my head which has contributed to me having an even more incredibly low self esteem since I think of myself as an ugly, incompetent, loser. 

All this time passed and I fell further into my weed habit  and depression as I smoked all day every day. I eventually quit weed for about 110 days but picked up again and have been smoking for the past 45 days. During my time off the drug, I've found a full time job which I am grateful for and I am trying to save and move out of my parent's house. Despite this I just feel so miserable and don't have any real desire to make anything of my life and I just feel so dull, depressed, and sluggish when I think of waking up tomorrow morning to a 40 hour work week. When making plans with friends which I do occasionally, I just feel so insecure about the social interaction despite knowing them for a long time, I just don't know who I really am and I have suicidal thoughts since I have no desire to keep going and I don't feel comfortable in my skin whether or not I smoke weed at this point. 

# TL;DR... 

I don't see how I can make anything of myself as a balding, unattractive, depressed, socially anxious, 19 year old who is probably going to get replaced by new hires at his job. I need help feeling better about life, I think I need a new perspective but I just don't know how to really put that into action in order to full a real difference in my life. I currently see life as pointless especially with my insecurities about my past which include thoughts like, ""what if every one knew ? Every one would hate me then"" as well as insecurities in my looks involving balding and insecurities with my personality involving not knowing how to navigate social interaction. I don't find anything appealing and I have no passion to do anything or make new friends. I'm not enjoying life at all as I work full time and I learn slowly at work compared to my colleagues. I feel like shit about myself...although I'm trying to be sober again, get over the past, and try to find a reason to keep going despite balding at a young age along with having erectile dysfunction at such a young age as well.

29,"Using an alternate account.

I asked my husband for a divorce or dissolution. Whatever. I am not receiving what I've been putting into our relationship, and it has been burdensome to me emotionally, physically and mentally. We tried out polyamory, it worked. Until our girlfriend got pregnant, unplanned. Looking back, that was the point of no return. I felt betrayed. 
I have a tendency to overthink and overanalyze every facet of my life. I even did many hours of research into polyamory. We set boundaries. It was working. This was after, of course, me asking for us to seek couples counseling, much to his ire, he declined. Repeatedly. Even to this day. 
I look back now, and see all of the signs. Resentment, anger, betrayal. I've been convincing myself that we could make this work, that we could fix it. However we both have to want to make it work.

I read this quote a little while ago and it was: **when feeling like giving up, give yourself rest.** Its that in itself. We must give ourselves time and have patience to continue what we believe, to keep it pushing, especially during these times that have been challenging but have allowed us for solitude for our mental health, our well being and what we truly want for ourselves.

I knew the pain I was feeling with my last partner was still there, unexpected ties cut and as well as my identity really starting to come up to the surface, with slowly being released from the day to day self inducing alcohol and marijuana numbing. I was happy with it all, **we must be.** We must act on how we feel and release the need for dwelling, especially when we are hurt. Follow what you feel but remember, to continue to pray and speak to God, The Universe, Divine, Higher Power, Source etc., through it all. We will be guided and pulled through the hole in the ceiling into blooming into our true authentic divine selves. It takes time but life is as well.

37,"A few days ago, my partner's very close friend from high school committed suicide. He found out because she had scheduled an Instagram post that essentially said ""if you're reading this, I'm gone."" He called her, called around, and eventually found out that she'd died. Of course he suspected she had killed herself since that's what the Instagram post implied. 

He's been grieving and I've been doing my best not to fuss at him but provide quiet loving supply. 

Today it hit the tabloids. as of this afternoon, graphic news regarding her death was on the FRONT PAGES of NY Post and the Daily Mail. I warned my partner to stay away from social media as to not encounter the coverage. I just don't have anyone to turn to at the moment. It's so horrible. 

She jumped off this weird building a few miles from us that my partner and I nicknamed the shawarma. The horrible folks at the daily mail decided to make this a public story. The details of her death were her family's to conceal or reveal, and as Chabad Lubavichers I know they wouldn't have provided this info to the media. 

I also am having trouble because I have depression and experience suicidal ideation now and then. I have therapy, meds, all the support. But I can't stop thinking of Jo climbing to the top of that stupid shawarma and jumping, giving in to the call of the void. And then the horror of her body at the bottom of the structure. The mess. The identification process. It makes me feel deeply nauseous and I don't know how I can ever confide in my partner about my suicidal thoughts ever again. Not when it's become so real. I've been dissociating all day, and strategizing re how to keep my partner from seeing the actual news. It was even on my Snapchat discover. 

In high school she tried to kill herself in... Milder ways. Cutting veins and starving herself. And I'm stuck in this tiny apartment crying to myself about his loved one smashed all over the pavement. And I can't talk to anyone about it, because I suppose he needs the milder illusion. I'm worried about him, I'm worried about me, and I'm so so tired.

Tell me how u feel down below!

Sometimes I feel lonely. Well, majority of the time and im pretty scared I'll get back into the dark hole I just got out a few years ago. I looked at my old pictures 5 months before and I couldn't even recognize myself at all. I look at my pictures now 5 months later and I miss my old self. The one that was not afraid to show who she was and show her crazy side even on the internet. Not afraid to look like a fool. I miss that I took pictures for art purposes , photography inspired and now it's to have cute pictures that i look good in. I feel different... i'm growing up and I feel Im being thrown into adulthood which didn't scare me but what scares me the most is being alone by myself. 

I hide it way too well this past few months but I feel the loneliest ive ever felt. and its sad I need to write on my phone notes because i feel i have nobody to talk to. My so called ""friends"" are so self absorbed and living in their own bubble their so unaware of the things around them... things happening to their friend. They're so busy just breathing that they can't even take a moment to support their friend on their goals. And i know what youre thinking... you should talk to them. I DID... many times till the point im tired of begging for affection, explaining myself and giving ppl excuses... invalidating my own emotions. 

I feel surrounded by people that loved me yet so empty inside... i think im broken. Ive been broken for a long time and when i thought I fixed myself turns out thats just my coping mechanism. Lying to myself from the truth. Im not happy. I fantasize everyday about my future and things that I want it to happen yet so detached and disconnected from my own reality. When can i feel that human connection again for once? Would I ever find people too nice to be true that give their all just like I do? Is my lesson to end all my friendships and be alone? With my thoughts? With my hardest critic? with my bully? 

I dont feel myself anymore. I know i need to fix myself but i dont know where to start. As you can see this ""blog"" is all over the place. I feel so many things at the same time, i bottle up my emotions and the only way I express my feelings is through writing. I wished i could talk about how I feel but thats the problem... I know what's wrong yet at the same time i dont know what's the problem nor why I feel like this. Guess christmas eve gets me on my feelings.

Ok so I feel completely invalidated, whenever I try to open up about my mental health to my parents I just get them talking about there backstory and them twisting it back to them and saying I’m attacking them! So this is the last time I try to open up. Ok so I had to quit my job bc of severe mental abuse causing one of the worst panic attacks I’ve ever had (seriously felt like a stroke), I already have CPTSD from past trauma I’ve never had the chance to work through and have panic attacks almost every day (don’t feel like elaborating on that trauma). And I’ve had this weird thing happening that makes all me nerves burn and my muscles cramp up, my heart starts pounding  and my head feels like it’s on fire, it hurts so bad! I absolutely hate that feeling but it happened if I’m to physically active in a day (usually happens at night). I feel a disconnect between My brain, body and myself, like I’m fragmented because my brain wants to kill my body and my body won’t stop hurting me (makes no sense when I try and explain it..). I’m incredibly traumatized by sleep and whenever I feel tired my brain panics and hurts me and sends me into a panic attack, so yeah I’m living off 3 hours or less of sleep every day. Another of my struggles is that I don’t feel anything, I never have tbh, I seriously have to copy what I see on shows I watch or videos and copy how they show emotion just to pass as “normal”, at least I’ve learned how to be a good actor bc nobody questions me and my friend was surprised to hear that I don’t feel empathy like a normal person. I’ve pretty much secluded myself, my family isn’t a family anymore and hasn’t been for years. Nobody has any interest in talking to or hanging out with anyone in the house, so it gets boring here (maybe lonely?), I’m always bored and I have no escape from that. I have no friends ether so that’s fun, but I’m kinda an asshole and very strange so I understand. Nobody understands how I work, I’m trying to manage as best as I can and be functional but all I’m called is weak and laughed at for struggling,  I’m not trying to get pity for my situation, I’m just typing out what I’m going through because I have no other outlet. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, or why I’m like this tbh, I’ve just been dealt a bad deck of cards in life And I feel like that’s not even scratch the surface of how fucked up I am lol

TLDR: my useless vent about how fucked up I am",28Dec2020,1
40,"so my fridge is full of food and for some reason i couldn't pinpoint, it bothers me.  i just realized why: i'm not actually hating that there's a lot of food, i'm hating that i'm allowing myself to take food from my parents.  even though i live with my parents, i pay my own way in regards to food and all other personal expenses.  usually all the food in the fridge is automatically hands off for me and i prefer it that way.  i'm a single person and i'm trying to lose weight so i don't really eat all that much and prefer to just have three or four things going at once. 

my mom has a loong history of using food to control me or reward me or punish me.  i hate giving her that power even for like four days because it took literal years to pry that kind of control away from her.  eating on her terms just naturally necessitates eating at a certain meal time, eating whatever she's cooked and a lot more details that would be benign if it weren't for our relationship.  i know immediately i need to stop accepting food because i don't want her involved in my life at all.  i don't want our lives to line up in any way because she *will* use that to take over.",28Dec2020,1

But recently, i dont know whether its the feeling of being strong for the first time or just a big ego that im stronger than everyone else, i felt like fighting everyone who disrespected me. I would readily challenge people who trashtalked me to a fight. Recently, i slapped a 14 year old kid who disrespected me constantly and used up my all patience and told him next time i will beat him up and i wont stop and i know its fucked up. Till this day, no one dared to accept my fight invitation and im feeling very powerful. Now im easily triggered by even the smallest trash talk and would resort to violence and im not sure why is this happening. Im not trying to brag that i can fight. I just want to know if this has to do with my past of being bullied and just wanted revenge.  And what can i do to control my temper/ego.",28Dec2020,1
42,"Everything about me, everything I feel, believe, think, say, my identity, my sense of self, is due to a fucked up brain. Anxiety. Depression. Dissociation. PTSD. Gender dysphoria. ADHD. Probably ASD. 

I don't even actually love. Apparently people with ADHD hyperfixate on crushes. I thought I loved someone but I don't. I probably don't even care about them as a friend because that sort of fixation is also a thing people with ADHD apparently do. So it isn't love, platonic or romantic, it's a pathetic, unreciprocated obsession. All my close relationships must have been. And thank fucking GOD the object of this one doesn't return my feelings because they end up hurt. Just ask my ex, who I didn't love either, but in a different way, a different failure of humanity. 

Even if I could love, I'm still asexual. Sure I wear a pride ring and pretend it's fine, but it's not. This isn't normal.

I'm trans because my brain got fucked up in the womb so I'll never be normal or happy or accepted. Even if I was capable of love, I'd never find it. I'll never stop dissociating enough to actually exist because my fucking brain insists everything is wrong. I'll always be a freak.

45,"I don’t know why I’m like this and it probably means there is something wrong with me but I have been doing so much better in school since classes went online and everyone’s been in quarantine. I’m not necessarily happy but I’m so much more functional in lockdown conditions/remote learning. 

For context, I am a junior. Just before the pandemic, I was struggling a lot in my classes. For the first time in my life, I had found a close group of friends and my social life was flourishing at the same rate as my grades were declining. I was having fun but totally distracted and overwhelmed by different social obligations (and temptations). Maybe I’m just immature, or need way more alone time and/or time to study and complete assignments than most people. Part of it was that while some of my friends seemed to be able to complete their assignments as they were hanging out with each other and playing music and talking/joking I would be there for three hours and not get a sentence written.

All that’s to say, when the pandemic and lockdown came round and we were all sent home I suddenly had SO MUCH MORE TIME. I now have new obligations and distractions — like a lot of housework and familial obligations —  and I also work part time as a waitress to contribute to rent/groceries. But they aren’t as compelling or consuming. It’s surely a “me” problem but I can’t seem to balance a social life and work and alone time (I love a lot of alone time). Suddenly being relieved of all the social and sexual temptations and obligations of campus life (while probably very lonely and distressing for some) was a huge relief to me. Moreover, as much as I absolutely hated losing all the freedom I had in college, my mother’s strictness made it so that I didn’t even have the option to fuck around or make bad choices. She doesn’t even allow me to drink. In fact, the social isolation and boredom made school all the more appealing and an escape from my stifling home environment. 

Of course, I recognize my privilege in being in being able to say this. Had I been forced to work from home while also having to care for young children, or had I been homeless or living with a physically abusive family again, or had I lost my job or had to work full time while a still a full time student to support my family because my parent lost their jobs or any one of a number of unfortunately common scenarios, things would be completely different.",28Dec2020,1

47,"i’m 16 (female) which is mainly why i’m asking this question because i don’t know if these are just normal teenage feelings and i’m just overreacting. 

[side note: i have epilepsy and my seizures have come back (kind of) and i’ve recently had surgery.]

so basically, for quite a while now, but especially over the past 3 ish months i’ve just felt completely demotivated to do anything. even when i know i have to, for example with big music and school exams instead of working i just lie in bed all day.  ive found myself not being able to sleep as well as i used to but just feel and look tired all day. 

i have three older brothers and the age gap is quite big so i’ve felt over the past few years like a bit of a burden, especially with my epilepsy. i feel like made my parents lives much more stressful and hard and i just feel so guilty. i have been feeling like my friends don’t really need me for anything if that makes sense like there’s always someone else who could take my place and that when i’m entering a conversation i’m like intruding on them and they don’t really want me there. 

reading what i’ve written i hope for my future that this isn’t normal otherwise life is going to be a bit shit. but then i also feel guilty for feeling like this and telling anyone would just be another thing to add to the reasons of why i could be a nuisance or burden. i feel like it makes me sound ungrateful for everything my parents have done for me and am too scared to tell anyone i know any of this for that reason. 

i’ve never really thought of ever killing myself i just feel like it would be easier for other people if i just disappeared but like dying scares me. it’s the idea that if i wasn’t ever born then life would be much easier for my parents and they would have saved so much money and be living a much less stressful life. 

sorry if that didn’t make any sense it doesn’t have much structure to it.  i just really want to make sure that before i talk to someone about this (which i want to but i’m too scared to atm) that this isn’t just normal and i’m just overreacting and overthinking.",28Dec2020,1

50,"I'm in the thick of it. I just received my first college rejection letter and it fucking crushed me. Not because the school was a dream school, but because of the thought that someone looked through my application and decided that all the work I put in over the past few years was not good enough. Just for some context, I have been facing a lot of rejection recently. I was seeing someone who I genuinely hit it off with and for some unknown reason, they have stopped reciprocating the same feelings. My friend group basically collapsed due to passive aggression and COVID concerns, and I feel more isolated than ever. What frustrates me about this whole thing is I know I'm a bad bitch. I am a hard worker and I have really good work ethic. And this is in no way supposed to come across as narcissism, I just never give myself credit for the things I do. But recently, with all the rejections and all, I feel numb at this point and super unmotivated. I don't feel like I should put in work, to try or to do things with passion if 99% of the time they won't work out. So can someone please let me know what to do.

51,"It's my first job, I'm 31 years old, I've only worked for 3 months and I basically missed the last 3 weeks strait. Let me explain, this is gonna sound all over the place because my head won't work right. I currently weigh 370 pounds, I'm actually down from 500 a couple years ago but I'm still dangerously overweight for my job. I work a physical labor job chipping trees, it's the sort of stuff they normally use a prison crew for I found out later. I hate that so much. Knowing they only hired me at my job because the states slave labor got sick, it's disgusting, I don't blame my bosses (especially if they are reading this) it's how the system works but I can't fucking help hating myself for that too.

&amp;#x200B;

I forgot where you put paragraphs and commas, jesus christ. I was trying to be a writer before all this, I'm pretty sure I could write better then, my brain isn't working right. Where was I? My weight, I'm so heavy for my job it makes my footing precarious and its difficult to get out of the way of things. I got a bunch of branches dropped on my shoulder and head by accident (I had a hardhat) and I got a big ass branch to the eye socket. That part of my head still hurts occasionally, I didn't think I had a concussion but maybe that's why I can't fucking type or remember anything, I stand up to do something and immediately forget it. I've gotten up to use the bathroom and forgotten immediately to the point where I don't go to the bathroom till it's a 'sprint or I'm gonna piss my pants race' a race I have fucking lost before, in front of my roommate, humiliating. I went to the ER last Tuesday, I was vomiting and I couldn't hold down any water, they didn't find covid or anything on the tests they took and they eventually sent me home, I didn't mention that I had been hit in the head twice hard the week before and that might have had something to do with it.

Every day I go into work I think ""I'm gonna die"" over and over again, for 8 hours strait, even when I'm talking or joking around, performers push down the voice and just sort of let it vibe for 50 years until it makes them kill themselves. Maybe? Fuck do I know.

The voice is horrible but it used to just be at work, I was afraid of covid (still am), widowmakers (still am), or even just tripping over a stub and falling neckfirst into a dry creek (yep). Now I hear it all the time, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die. I started typing this just to hear some other words in my head but I really really can't. I can't lose this job, I'm up to my eyeballs in debt (I did mention I had no job till 31 yeah?) and to top it off I didn't tell my family I got a job because I didn't want them asking me for money, we're all poverty, but I told myself I can't help them until I help myself, pull myself out of a hole.

&amp;#x200B;

My grandpa died 3 weeks ago, heart attack I guess, now I'm gonna die too, my mom lost her father and now her son is gonna die working on a job that he wouldn't even tell her about because he thinks you're a leech lol? (I don't but c'mon if I was her I wouldn't believe anything else, but maybe that's part of my sickness?) I don't want to hurt my family but what the fuck else can I do? I have no education, no work experience, it's a fucking miracle (of our horrible unjust system plus a global pandemic, plus some very kind people giving me a chance that I didn't deserve) that I even got this job in the first place and it's gonna kill me.

Lately, I’ve been thinking g of starting a blog about animals because I have a bunch and really like animals. So far, I’ve written two articles, but I haven’t created my blog yet, I just wrote. And recently, I’ve been reading a lot of PETA posts, I just don’t know how to feel.

Y’know? I feel bad for the animals, but I eat meat, dairy, everything. I love food, it’s been a comfort for me with my other mental health issues! I haven’t talked to my B yet, because I always forget, or we lose time talking about something else. 

I watched a video on YouTube a while ago and made a comment like “aw! Poor things!” It was a video about this guy putting some comet goldfish in a ‘roller coaster’ he put them through a tube into his bath rub. It didn’t sit right with me, and somebody else replied to me “unless y’all be vegan, y’all don’t have a right to fight for fish because y’all eat animals that are pushed around all their life and don’t get appreciated. They just get turned into food. It’s not fair that you eat them and then all you care about are these invasive fish. So before you come criticize people, change your diet.” 

Now, my family may be kinda wealthy, we aren’t so poor off that we have to save food or anything, we have leftovers from dinner all the time, we get a lot of presents at Christmas, yeah, it may take us a while to pay off our vet bill, because we are not TOO rich. But my family doesn’t have the money to get me special food that is vegan or vegetarian, because I assure you, a lot of food I eat probably has animal products in it. 

I just feel so empty all the time, most of it because of this. You know? Like, I can’t change the world, people will always be divided! People will always fight! Somehow, people think, that one day, someone will just drop it and join their side, like “omg! You pulled my heart strings! I’m going to stop working at the slaughter house! I’m going to protest with you! ‘Cause you’re soooooo great! These poor innocent animals deserve to be free! Maybe I should just let you guys take all the animals since I’m the boss and what I say goes!” Honestly, I do feel bad for the animals, but I still eat them. Is it not ok to do that? Sometimes I feel that way. 

I also read an article on how it’s not ok to buy a dog. One of those articles I wrote was about how I think buying and adopting are both great! I just haven’t asked my mom to let me start a blog yet! 

I have my opinions and I know some people will always oppose my opinions! But it makes me feel terrible, sometimes I just think about the animals that I eat, but I also know that I would miss eating meat, and my family can’t pay for extra food for me! 

I’m so torn! I don’t know what to think! About anything!! Ugh! 

I know PETA isn’t as good as it seems, but reading their articles makes me feel bad! I’m really looking forward to when I finally get the courage to ask my mom to let me start a blog so I can get my opinion out there, so hopefully that will help me! 

Thanks for reading if you read this far, I know it’s stupid and long, but thanks!",28Dec2020,1

59,"So, I am in a tough position right now. Not as much as some, especially with the on going crisis, but still something I am struggling with. Let me start from the beginning.

I have PTSD. I am seeing a therapist, but they are on hiatus as they just had a child. I work in a high stress environment and am currently on a 4 on, 2 off schedule of 12 hour days. Starting next week, we are going on a team based Panama schedule, still 12 hours. But they rotation I got put on means I can no longer participate in my 2 D&amp;D games, which are currently my only true outlet for creativity. I like my group. I am enjoying playing. I have asked my supervisor if I can swap to the other team and they basically told me to get bent. This is after I have been willing to be put on the shift I did not request, twice and bypassed for the option to move to the shift I requested by less senior staff. But, if i request a transfer, I will be working much heavier hours, going to up to 72 hours a week, with no guarantee I will get to maintain my group time.

At this point, I feel like my supervisor doesn't respect me. I work hard for them, I bend over backwards to help and be accommodating, and every time I ask for something in return, I essentially get told to get fucked. Is it worth leaving the stability of schedule for a chance at my group time and maybe a sense of respect, or should I stick it out?",28Dec2020,1

He also scratched his arms frantically, so we held his hands to stop him from hurting himself. I suspect he’s got depression among other things, but I just don’t know how to help him.

1. I’ve sucked at saying sorry. Like one time I got in trouble in class and had to apologize to them. I said it in a very dead tone and insincere way. I apologized again to that same friend today cause they got offended over me saying their bio was cringe and claimed I was attacking them. I know they’re probably gonna say “no you don’t, you don’t mean it” but idc. They can take it or leave it
2. Becoming bad/disrespectful (?). Like, another time at school I got in trouble for drawing a picture with a gun and I’m holding the gun. I was talking about it and a teacher overheard and was disturbed. I also remember one time I attacked my sibling and broke some vases and other stuff all because they were crying. Yup, I did that all because they were crying and my dad lectured me and wanted to know what was wrong. ANY TIME I TOLD HIM HE WOULD COMPARE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE, UGH.
3. (TW: mentions of wanting to die) Wanting to die when something goes wrong. This was a while ago but I guess I can include it. I used to want to die or end myself because I was sad over something or something went wrong. Luckily that has stopped so.
4. More insensitive with feelings? made insensitive jokes (only two tho) about someone’s dad having covid while talking to them. messed up I know.

I'm 35yrs old. I'm a 3x convicted felon (about to be four)... All due to DWIs.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't explain the pains that this shit brings me. Every night I pray to God that these things skip my son (he turned 7yrs old today (Dec. 27th)).

&amp;#x200B;

The only reason I am not dead, yet, is because God MUST want me to be here for a reason... But, I don't know what that reason is. I think/hope it's my son.

&amp;#x200B;

The shady nights in shady places when I've been 100% blacked out starting shit/doing shit. The insane amount of unprotected sex I've had that I remember and don't remember. The number of guns that have been pulled on me. The number of people that have wanted to break my face... I don't understand it. I'm still here?!

&amp;#x200B;

(My cousin was a travelling COVID nurse (4yrs younger than I) and now she has liver, intestinal, and lung cancer (she's not a smoker) WTF God?!)

&amp;#x200B;

I have come to terms with the fact that I am going to be the one who ends it. Obviously, something is keeping others from ending it for me. Ya'll have no idea.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not the teenager or millenial weeping behind a computer screen blah blah fucking blah. I'm not a gamer and could give two shits less about that stuff. I'm that dude in the bar that will buy everyone a drink and have a great time but will break your jaw if you cross me or my people.

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is I can't kill myself right now... I literally can't do it for a couple of years. I have to magically hold on somehow. Disability should be getting approved soon, then I'll have some cash to make it make it.

&amp;#x200B;

When disability does go through I'm backdued NOW at least 12mos and I was making 90k+ per year so that's not bad. Yeah, I'm really fucking smart that's why this is so hard.

&amp;#x200B;

Would I intentionally throw away that type of annual income for disability?! I just want specific meds that are not generic that no one can pay for out of pocket and to talk to some therapists... Then I'll happily do my upcoming prison time (2 to 5yrs? But my lawyer is the ISH, but also the warrant was issued 3wks ago...).

71,"Hi! So I’ve been having some weird stuff happen lately, and I was wondering if anyone knows what’s going on.
First off, in March-ish, I started developing these people who lived in my head. There are currently 6 of them. I got a new one the other day, and today I was kinda out of it. They somehow managed to convince me that I should let them take over, which resulted in about a half hour of me feeling extremely blurry and dissociated. They didn’t fully “take over,” but it kinda felt like they were with me, more than usual.
Now, to clarify, these people aren’t generally harmful. In fact, they help me out of panic attacks and bad situations. However, this new one is a character from something and they’re the “bad guy,” and this is the first time any of them have tried to “take over.”
I have therapy on Wednesday and I’ll try to explain what happened there, but I’m the mean time, is there any word for this or any possible explanation for these people in my head? Also, what should I say to my therapist?",28Dec2020,1

Then my household all driving up to my school and weird ass confrontations.. To be very honest, I feel like I have borderline personality disorder. But like I said, I don’t self diagnose... I just wish I had the guts to ask because I’m still suicidal and need guidance. I can’t do this on my own and I think I need medication or just some type of actual treatment or else I won’t make it to graduation. I can sense it.",28Dec2020,1

74,"I have noticed my 'symptoms' get worse whenever my therapists want to focus on them. For example, when my psychologist suggested we talk about my eating issues, my restriction ramped up and I didn't eat anything for a fortnight. When my new doctor found out about my cutting, my self injury escalated to the point of repeatedly needing stitches.

Sometimes I worry that I enjoy (???) the attention from mental health professionals. Or I believe that my symptoms need to be worse to warrant needing psychological help? It's almost like I'm scared of being well and not needing treatment? I know I look forward to sessions but I also feel *\*better\** after sessions, so I don't know if I look forward to the attention, or look forward to feeling better and relief from my depression.

As a side note, I am not open with my mental health struggles with anyone else in my life except my mum, and even then I don't tell her very much. My very close friends know about my past, but we don't, and never did, talk about my issues. I wear long sleeves at work even in the hot Australian summers, so no one knows that I self harm or struggle with mental health.

* a +10 year history of self harm (cutting), often needing stitches
* a few suicide attempts, one landing me in a week long coma
* some periods of fasting (eating nothing) for weeks at a time

86,"CW: death/dying

I have had anxiety my entire life, for as long as I can remember. As a toddler, I had night terrors. As a child, I was terrified of going to sleep because I was worried I wouldn’t wake up. I’m now 20 years old, and every so often, I find myself plagued by thoughts like “you’re going to have to die one day,” “your days are numbered,” and things like that. If I’m doing something simple like brushing my teeth, I’ll think “how much time of your life will you waste just brushing your teeth.” 

Personally, I am an atheist and I believe that death is like what it was like before you were born, just... nothing. Unaware, like dreamless sleep or anesthesia. A lot of people who “died” and were brought back to life say that. I’m not looking to discuss this or anything like that so please don’t bring up afterlife or heaven/hell, etc. 

When these intrusive thoughts occur, my heart pounds and I can’t breathe. I am usually really good at managing my anxiety with grounding and I rarely have panic attacks anymore, but this is the most gut wrenching existential dread and it just overwhelms me for no reason at random times. 

I always carry this fear with me and it’s not always this bad but sometimes it really kicks me in the teeth. I don’t know how to deal with it and I really want to get past it but I don’t know how to face my fear without, you know... dying.

He stated that I have said that multiple times before and it caused him to think about my commitment to him. I explained to him that I constantly think of multiple outcomes and events to situations. I think about how things can work out and how things can go wrong. Not just with him but everything in my life like driving a car and what would happen if I were in an accident to what all could happen if I were to talk to anyone. I am constantly thinking about good things that could happen to all the potential bad things also.

89,"To not throw away what I've gained in the last two years I am writing this. Other reasons are to share this with other people who can give me other perspectives other then the people who helped me thus far and are already concerned with me.

It took me two years with my last psychotic episode last summer to feel finally somewhat recovered. Treatment was hard on me and my loved ones. But mostly on me, because I feel I had permanent changes in the way I experienced life itself.

What isn't unimportant to know is the main cause of my psychotic episodes were drug use. In my teens I started drinking, smoking cigarettes and marijuana. After turning 18 until the age of 25 I increasingly abused different types of stimulants, cathinones, amphetamines, but not cocaine. Also MDMA and other research chemicals. Several types of dissociatives, benzodiazepines and a few psychedelics.

It caused me several experiences which were traumatic, but I brushed them off and kept using. Several times I came close to death or so it felt because of tachycardia and overheating.

I smoked marijuana almost every day, but I kept drinking at a minimum since I thought of it as an inferior drug.

At 26 I went psychotic and got committed to a psych ward for several weeks. I never felt so frightened in my life. Not even close to the times I went overboard, although it was comparable to the times I got bad trips from psilocybin mushrooms.

They forced me to take haloperidol and I recovered, not that it healed me, it just got me out of my psychosis. The next day, I went back to smoking marijuana and it caused something I never felt before as in my senses were completely overwhelmed and it felt wrong.
I kept taking the medication for a week and wanted to get off later. After talking to a family member about it, I stayed on.

The haloperidol made me so miserable, I had no emotions on it and felt like a faded image of my old self. I do not even want to remember it felt, it caused me extreme aversion with everything that has to do with psychiatry.
It was just horrible.

To mitigate the depressive feelings I started smoking marijuana again. Until... I became psychotic again, got committed again and put on haloperidol again. This time as a long lasting injection. Again, I couldn't function as a human being. I felt mentally handicapped.

My parent who emigrated told me to go to their country a year and try to recover there, to be away from marijuana.
My loved one with who I am with since a few years also lives there. I went to live with her and her parents.

It was a great decision, but after two months being there I went into psychosis again. This time without consuming anything. The psychiatrist, who had other views as the ones that helped me in my country, told me it was of abstinence. Or withdrawal.

I got committed to a hospital, which was better for me. I absolutely hate psych wards and can't stand the people there as I have my own problems to deal with. They put my on Clorpromazine and antihistamines, which dulled my psychosis and made me able to go home.

Later they added alprazolam to manage my anxiety. I later suspended with guidance of the psychiatrist the antipsychotics but kept taking alprazolam. I found the alprazolam also enjoyable. I knew it was extremely addictive, but since it was part of the treatment I kept taking it. I vaped enormous amounts of nicotine during treatment to not be drowsy all day.

When I found it was time to quit the alprazolam it took me a few months to quit, by decreasing the dose each time. I went from 2mg by decreasing 0.25 each week. It was torture, because loud sounds made me completely stressed out. I couldn't handle hearing any music. My sleeping pattern was very regular.

After quitting, I improved but something was still off. For months I didn't have any issues until may where I became psychotic again and got committed to the same hospital. Same treatment, but without alprazolam, instead they gave me carbamazepine. An antiepileptic drug which acts as a moodstabilizer. The argument was it would control the erratic activity in my brain they saw in the EEG scan the first time (third psychosis).

After finishing that treatment, I had to keep taking carbamazepine, but I didn't like how it made me feel. My greatest wish since day 1 which was four years ago is to feel normal and carefree.

Things are going great now, I am recovering at a very fast pace, noticing changes in my way of thinking. No longer feeling like a debilitated victim of my own mind. The traumas are slowly disappearing and I am accepting my past as it was. Trying to not blame myself.

This I am grateful for, but it was not thanks to a psychologist since I never got one. The strange thing is, since I am trying to become normal again and undertake activities that benefit me I have started to drink alcohol.

This is what bothers me and is a dilemma. I am trying to get myself back on my feet economically and also trying to feel like I can be outgoing again and enjoy things I felt deprived of for the last few years.

I do not want to live trying to be too strict which I know which will cause me to feel guilty when I do slip up.
Or when I do try to go out and have a drink get myself in situations which are dangerous.

However, there have already occured several things which are bothersome, which confirm my thoughts written above. 

The lack of experience drinking all those years while thinking I can handle the same amount of alcohol as I could before has caused me the following;

I took several alprazolam over the course of a day. Lost control of myself and I went out to get a beer, the first drink in years. After that one beer my memory was gone, I got home, went in coma for two days and severely scared my loved ones. I also insulted them verbally while under the influence. Something that is not natural to me.

After talking with them they told me it was better to just have a drink in moderation, instead of doing it like this.
I felt ashamed for several days and thought about what they said.

I drank a few times after that. One time it was raining and asked my loved one to help me get my moped to a dry spot, which triggered the alarm and got me yelling. My loved one thought I was yelling at her. I apologised, told her it was not directed at her and understood it made her look and feel bad.

The third time it went wrong I went to a party, after that went drunkenly on my moped with a friend to a bar to keep drinking beer. Even though it was in the countryside with no cars it was extremely irresponsible. My loved one kept calling me, but I didn't pick up. She went there at 5 am and I got angry at her, yelled at her and we went home.

The next day I apologised to her and after to her parents, which they accepted. I've lived with hem the last two years and they know how I normally am. I told my loved one the amount of trauma and anger I was carrying, because of what happened to me the last few years.

At Christmas Eve, I got drunk again. This time nothing happened, I had fun, I danced with my loved one, we laughed. She wanted to go to bed early, but I wanted to stay up some more. Eventually we went to bed at 11pm.

The next day we barely celebrated Christmas, because that isn't such a tradition here. In the evening I drank something with her father, got inebriated but not drunk. She asked me not to keep drinking, but I did.

At night, she did not like that I did not listen to her and I promised to stop whenever she says she thinks I had enough.

Typing this out, it sounds like I am either a horrible abusive person, somebody staving off to be an alcoholic, or any other negative thing you can imagine especially since my history with drug abuse.

I am very aware of that, I am also aware of the sensitive state I am in. I have found out I have anger issues which I do not express when sober, but I do feel.

However, I feel like I am finding a balance in trying to not deprive myself and not overdoing it. And I keep messing up. Now I am in a somewhat protected environment with people caring about me, but what if it goes wrong when I am by myself?

Or what if I am too harsh on myself and have to accept that I can make mistakes and people can forgive me, as long as I don't keep breaking their trust. Just like I had broken the trust of so many people by being always drugged-out.

This not meaning I take advantage of the trust my loved ones have in me. Since they were by my side the last two years. They are not telling me to not drink at all, but do it in moderation. I need advice on this, but I don't want to be asking them this either.

Honestly, I want to keep drinking but not at the expense of others. I want to be able to trust myself with a few drinks.",28Dec2020,1

92,"Nothing is going bad in my life right now. I’d say I have it pretty well. I have a significant other, very nice new things because of the holidays, a nice house and food in the house. I have good grades in all but one of my classes and I just got my permit a few months ago. I should be happy. But I’m not. 

My brain is finding every little flaw in every good thing. My significant other lives on the other side of the country. The house is really loud and my family is really annoying. The food is either ordered out or I have to cook it (cooking REALLY stresses me out) or it’s really dry and I don’t like dry food. I have good grades in all but my java programming class which is over in a month and my teacher won’t get back to me quick enough to tell me how to properly turn things in. I’m not picking up ASL or Spanish as quickly as I’d like to. I started volleyball but I’m the worst girl on the team and when I tried practicing on my own today the volleyball cracked and I got yelled at because of it. 

Everything hurts so much and I don’t understand why. As the day progresses my brain gets worse and worse. My brain is either trying to come up with ways to die or hurt myself. It’s taking almost everything I have not to grab the closest knife and mutilate my wrist chest and genitals (I’m trans and get pretty severe gender dysphoria over the fact I have the wrong genitals) 

I decided I should try to change something and get help. So I tried a help line when I was feeling particularly shitty. I wanted to hurt myself but not die. I messaged the Trevor hotline and talked with someone for about 30 minutes. They only asked questions saying am I going to kill myself. No. How would you do it? I haven’t made a plan. When would you do it? I haven’t made a plan. They said they sympathize with me after every sentence and it started frustrating me. Anyways we actually started talking about things I needed to talk about and it disconnected. The second we start talking about things that would actually help. It’s like life wants me to die and the scary thing is I think the only reason I haven’t made a plan is because there is no easy way to die. The point of dying in my head would be to end pain not to cause more pain. There are no tall building near me and I wouldn’t want someone to have to live with the guilt of them hitting me with their car. The only solution I can think of is either over dosing or shooting myself. However, there aren’t any pills that would kill me in a quick painless fashion. And I wouldn’t want to shoot myself because I don’t want to have to have my family clean my blood. (We don’t have any handguns just rifles and shotguns) 

I cut myself for the first time in about a year and a half 8 days ago. I did have the power later on to throw away my knife so I can’t anymore but my mind really wishes I didn’t. I need help but I don’t know how to get it. I don’t know if I deserve it and I don’t feel like anyone cares enough to help except for a very small amount of people. 

I wish it were over. I wish I could die in a way that wouldn’t hurt or cause anyone too much pain. But I feel like living is causing me more pain than me dying would cause other people pain. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. Everything is setting me off. The house is always messy and I hate messes. God, even writing this is starting to set me off. I don’t know what to do and I’m trying to fill my head with the words that I’m writing instead of letting it dwell on other things. That’s why this is so long.

100,"In July 2019 - after months of exhaustion, lack of sleep, improper diet - I finally broke down and decided to get help. Several factors related to work and personal life put my mental state off balance and leaving me numb to things I really used to love. 

The medication did work although I wasn't in a position to avail good therapy. They put me in a state where I felt I could take care of myself again. 

But sometime in February 2020 I started regressing without realising it. I thought I was fine and even the doctor decided to reduce the dosage based on my positive feedback. I think I was afraid to fail again. To fall again. 

Fast forward to July 2020 - I was called back home urgently with the news that my mother was unwell. I arrived to see her in a state of restless frenzy and very suspicious about everybody around her. She was diagnosed with Paranoid Schizophrenia. After months of medication she's at the moment in a much more stable state. However the months I spent taking care of her left me sleepless/restless/anxious and now in a state where I feel constantly exhausted and just wish to avoid life. It's not that I don't want to go forward. It's just that I feel fucking tired. Absolutely no strength at all.
I've been here before and yet although I'm able to keep myself afloat better than last time there's no relief in sight.  

The catch here is that I haven't been able to take my own medication since August 2020 because with everything happening at home and the whole Covid situation I wasn't able to travel back to meet my doctor.

106,"For the past 5 years or so I have experienced an all-consuming sadness that tends to come and go. In between those periods (which usually last months or years) I tend to feel like I’m on top of the world, as if it’s either/or and nothing in between.

I have done hours and hours of research to see if what I’ve been experiencing normal human emotion, as after all even people without mental illnesses can experience terrible periods and great periods in their life. I found myself reading symptom after symptom and thinking to myself “I experience every single one of those on almost a daily basis and have the majority of the time the past 5-10 years of my life.”

This is something I could keep hidden from my friends and family for a while. Recently though I feel I have experienced these symptoms to an even greater degree than I ever have and they have noticed. I have brought up my feelings a few times to some of my close friends and immediately family members but rarely ever. After talking to my parents, they want me to talk to a counselor and I am open to it as I hate feeling this way so much, so often. I haven’t told them yet but I’ve also had thoughts of death and suicide recently, as I have in the past.

I really want to just ask the question for people who have been there before and have wanted to see if they are dealing with real, clinical depression: what is the best way approaching this? Should I talk to a physician first? A psychiatrist? A counselor? How different is each one? I was also wondering what a cost-effective way to do this was. My parents are helping me to pay for it (bless them, I love them so much) but I also know how pricey these things can be. I have no health insurance or anything of the sort so this will be out of pocket. I don’t know if I’d ever try anti-depressants, but if I did I don’t even know how I would afford them.

I have something I want to share with you. On the 25th of December 2020, I felt the worst I think I have in my life. I have two past traumas. My current situation is no awful but could be a lot better. That evening it felt like my past, present and future hit me in the head really hard. I was a bit hungover from Christmas, however, it's strange that I all of a sudden felt so bad after a happy Christmas the day before.

This happened right after I remembered that I had to sell some of my finer leather-bound books. I have 6 of these, too many for guy like me. Like 1-2 is affordable but not 6. I have attempted this before, however, I did not market them correctly. My first attempt they were in a bundle of all six of them. Of course this did not work very well since they are all different genres. Genres horror, fantasy, fairy tales and mysteries.

I have quite a sentimental connection to them even the Sherlock Holmes book I have barely even touched. So when I remembered that I had to sell them and the fact that I've been doing it wrong, cause me for some reason remember so much more, think about what my life currently is and what might happen in the future. I think this might change my life. How much? or how little? I have no idea.

Like when I'm taking a shower or using the toilet whenever I'm sure that no one is there to watch me. As an only child with no peers around my neighbourhood to play or talk to while i was growing up , i had developed this habit of speaking to myself - aloud. Later in my early twenties life turned topsy turvy and I think this is a coping mechanism my brain had developed to escape from my reality. I'm super introverted, have no friends and am staying with parents. My life is between this rented house where we are staying and my office ..all day.. everyday..Weekends means Netflix and chill. I don't even exercise. So I skip food whenever I can to keep my body fit. Everything is a chore to me. My life has no meaning and I don't even know what will be my future after my parents. In those "" imaginary realities"" I may be talking with my long lost school friends or my favorite celebrities or accomplishing many things my real self can't even think about. I'm very much good at acting I believe because none of my colleagues think I'm crying to sleep every night or they know something is wrong and simply don't care. I don't know. What should I do?

My only dog of 15 years died next to me some time I was sleeping. I knew he was dying, he laid down a lot and didn't have any sort of energy. I would either be on my computer or laying next to him, playing on my Switch or taking naps. There wasn't a lot to do, especially during the early stages of COVID. My dog would go to the bathroom in my room, it was hard for him. He was a black and white, Jackchi mix. He was very small, very silly. He licked a lot and he was awkward around other dogs. He had personality I don't think any other dog will ever have. 

When I got up that night, it was around 1am. I got up, went to get water, went back to lay down, then I saw him. He was laying in a position that I knew he was dead, I didn't see his face, I didn't want to. I couldn't even take him out of my bed. I asked for help, my mom and her friend helped me put him in a box, and in a bin. They handled him with so much care and I could never be so grateful. We held a ceremony for him at 4am, then in the morning we called cremation services in the morning. I cried nonstop for weeks, not a lot of proper consolation. My family aren't pet people, but pet people are like "" oh u can get another dog when u r ready"" or "" he was old and it's bound to happen"". Shit, you don't think I don't know that? It's not like I'm a child, I had that dog since I was a child, he was my only dog. Eventually, I started using my computer again in May, I cleaned out my room in October, then I got a new bed earlier this month. 

My grandma has a puppy now who resembles my dog. I love him, but for some reason I'm allergic. I'm hoping this is my time to move on and after this pandemic shit, move closer to my life goals.

124,"So this might be a little long but I'll try to make it short. 

I have anxiety. It mostly originated from me doing stuff I'm not supposed to do. This lead to me telling my mom about it all and its fine. It wasnt a big deal but it evolved into me telling her every little thing I did that was ""wrong"" or ""bad"" and it got tiring. Shes told me before that I dont have to tell her all of that. 

It got way better but recently (more like 30 minutes ago) I saw a picture that just made me feel uneasy. Like it was one of those pictures that you would see in those ""deep web"" videos. Im not gonna explain it cause I dont want to freak anyone out but yea. The fear that it is real is giving me a lot of anxiety right now. 

I dont want to tell my mom about it. I dont want to go back to that again but its always helped before. I would tell her, and then I would feel way better and forget about it. The problem is, Its literally 3am and my mom is asleep. I dont want to wake her up just to show her my phone with a text of what I want to tell her (this is how i talk to her about this kind of stuff as i cant say it out loud) as ive done it before and i just dont want to do it again. I dont want to tell her about it at all. I should be able to deal with this myself. 

I knew that there was a possibility that I might see something that would give me anxiety while I am on the internet. I always know that. I need to suck it up and honestly I know im going to forget about it very soon. I have a coping mechanism of some sorts where I just push away whatever it was and think happy things. I think about my interests and I make lists in my head and stuff. This really helps especially at night when I dont want to wake my mom up to tell her everything. (This is also what my old therapist told me to do. She told me to ""remove myself from the situation."")

I have really intrusive thoughts that I have no control over. It can vary from wishing people dead to all sort of messed up things that can be very graphic and just pure evil thoughts. I don’t like that it happens and the thoughts are NOT how I feel, it could be about someone I like/love, a stranger, someone I dislike, myself, literally anyone. 

I found that the best thing to do is acknowledge it when it happens and say in my head it’s ok because I don’t feel this and I didn’t choose to have that pop into my mind. Some of the shit is really dark though and it brings me down. I don’t think it’s schizophrenia because I hear it like you hear your own thoughts and it doesn’t talk to me (it kinda does but not how I imagine when people say hearing voices, like I know it’s just an intrusive thought) and once I acknowledge it and accept I don’t feel whatever it’s saying I gain power over it.

I also have a lot of trauma and mental health problems such as severe depression and anxiety and also ptsd and very likely ocd. 

I told my GP that I thought I had bipolar and he said the symptoms sound like it but because I’m not engaging in dangerous behaviour and I’m (mostly) not impulsive I wouldn’t qualify for a diagnosis.

129,"My father is not a good man, and I’ll never be able to forgive him for what he’s done.

My biological father was physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to my mother when I was a small child. My first memory, when I was around 4, was of him physically assaulting my mother. He threw a heavy duffel bag of home tapes at her from the second floor stairs, and it hit her in the head. She fell down, while me and my older brother watched.

I had suppressed this memory until I was around 14 years old, at which point I recalled it, and my psyche started to split open. I didn’t know if what I remembered was real, I was having nightmares of people throwing things from above, of a tall person with no face who lingered angrily. 

When I was 5 we moved to a different country to escape my father. My mother, my little sister, my older brother and me. This was a complete surprise to us, my mother told us pack our bags and go. When we arrived in this country, we were met with a strange man, who would become my stepfather.

I was always a miserable child. I remember my grandmother nicknaming me ‘Misery’ after the character from the TV show Ruby Gloom. I hardly ever spoke, and had no friends. Moving to a different country made me scared. I knew no one and nothing.

I was made fun of on my first day of kindergarten, where another little girl threw sand in my eyes because I had an accent. I didn’t really talk after that.

I began having suicidal thoughts when I was around 8. I hung out at the back of my school alone, and I remember thinking that no one would notice if I was gone, that no one would care if I just ceased to exist.

Depression truly set in at 12. I’d cry for no reason some days, and wouldn’t emote at all on others. My mood swings were intense. I’d become incredibly angry at nothing. I caused my mother a lot of grief, and I regret that immensely. I dyed my hair black and stopped eating.

To this day, I am 5’10 and weigh 48 kilos. I have a BMI that says I’m severely underweight.

Me and my step father would fight constantly. I had behavioural issues, accompanied by undiagnosed mental illness, and PTSD surrounding men being around my mother. I did anything I could to get in trouble, and we were having shouting matches every other day. I was walking on eggshells in my own house, and at the same time, I enjoyed the chaos. The only time I felt calm was when I was screaming at my step father about something mundane. 

I had a small group of friends at high school, but was terrified of the place. I hated people, I didn’t want anyone to look at me, to notice me. My daddy issues caused me to become involved with a boy 4 years older than me, and when that ended badly I spiralled further downwards. 

I was suicidal a few times a month. I never cut myself or anything like that, but I would regularly, and still do, pull and chew my fingernails almost completely off. My hands hurt constantly, but I no longer really recognise the pain as painful.

In my late high school years I really looked up to one of my teachers. He was a kind man, who always made jokes in class and was really invested in teaching history. Those classes with him were the only time at school I enjoyed, and sometimes the thought of seeing him in class was my only reason to get out of bed. My grades soared in that class as I put effort in, hoping to impress him.

I took his classes until I finished year 12. I didn’t even enjoy history, I just wanted to spend time with him. He was one of the only father figures I’ve ever known, and I will cherish his kindness towards me for the rest of my life. 

I finished year 12 this year. In the end, I buckled under the pressure. I didn’t do my year 12 exams, and ducked out early. Covid lockdowns turned me into a hermit. I no longer even messaged my friends, and sat on the floor in the same spot every day, not doing my schoolwork, and watching YouTube videos on my TV till I turned into a zombie. I lived on a diet of sugary foods with around one solid meal a day.

I’ve been medicated for my depression since I was 16, but every time I forget to take my medication the thoughts come back, of a desperate need to kill myself. I went to a work Christmas party this year, and when I had to leave early because I couldn’t handle the amount of people, I was overwhelmed by such a hatred for myself that I felt like crashing my car.

This is why I can’t ever forgive you, dad.",28Dec2020,1

My mother has always struggled with her health (physical and mental). She has been seeing a therapist and is on so many pills. 

This month in particular has been the very worst I've ever seen her. At least once a week, she'll tell me that she wants to kill herself. Then she'll ask 'do you love me?' After, she'll complain about a new thing that's hurting her. (Tonight, it was her tongue. Yesterday was her foot).

A little background about my mom: 

She comes from an abusive home where she never got a lot of attention. She had cancer. She had her gallbladder and appendix removed. She recently had a hysterectomy. She also struggles with an eating disorder.

Lately, she's been acting like a child and it's taking a toll on my entire family. We all want her to get better and be happy. But I just don't know the proper way to act or what to say around her. 

If there isn't any attention on her, she immediately complains of a new pain or pretends to fall over. She also recently went on an online shopping spree and spent $2000. She was diagnosed with ADHD last month. 

Her therapist hasn't been that much of a help with giving us advice.

Sorry for my english, I am not a native speaker.

I want to know if there is a MCQ (multiple-choice questions) that can tell you if you're having some psychological disorders or not.

The reason why I'm asking this, is that my sister (medecine student) told me that her teacher (psychology) had an ADHD and he did not know until he's early 40.",28Dec2020,1

The only conversations we can have at this point is what I've done that day.  I don't really do anything most days, but when I do, and they know about, they ask about it, but I hate talking about it and I don't know why.  I feel like getting over that is very important since it dominates so many conversations, not only in my family, but also in real life.  I already have alot of problems communicating, but I think this one might be the most important one, at least right now.",28Dec2020,2

140,"I have been having extremely vivid pictures of things happening to or around me. I know it isn't happening for real, but I experience all of the same emotions as if it is. It is worse when it'sdark out, if I'm the only one awake, or if I'm home alone. For instance, I'll be laying in bed and can ""hear"" someone messing with the door knob, then getting in, I can ""see"" them standing in the doorway, and envision the struggle that occurs afterwards, down to the smallest details. The same thing happens when I'm driving, I can ""see"" the crash happening. As soon as I get done playing out one scenario another follows. It feels extremely silly, but I have to check the closets and shower and as I'm doing so it feels like there is a real threat. Even after checking everything and installing extra locks and alarms, I still don't feel safe, and jump at every noise. It has gotten so bad, I'm no longer sleeping. When I pull away from my house I feel like someone is going to stand in front of the window (from inside the house) and watch me. At times, I almost want to pull out my phone and take a picture. I say it's to prove to myself that there is nothing there, but I also feel like it's to show other people that something is there.
I also envision bad things happening to those I care about; dog getting hit by a car or poisoned, parents getting sick, nieces getting hurt, etc. Again, I know none of it is real, and that I'm not really seeing it, but I still get the same feeling as if it were, almost like a dream that you know is a dream. Could this just be extreme anxiety, a form of PTSD, or are these delusions? Has anyone experienced anything like this? Who should I talk to about this professionally and how do I do so without getting sent away? (Sorry if that's not how it works, but the one person I tried reaching out to said they would send me to a hospital.) 

Some background information that may be helpful: I'm 23, and came from a family that kind of just ignored mental health and never really had the money to go to any sort of doctor. My family has a history of anxiety and bipolar disorders (grandpa, mom, brother have all been diagnosed but can't afford treatment), and I was diagnosed with panic anxiety disorder about 6 years ago, but didn't have the opportunity to follow through on treatment. Now, I have my own job and insurance, but feel embarrassed to seek help and thinking about the financial aspect causes panic attacks (although I have the money, spending any money at all makes me anxious). I live with my fiance in a safe neighborhood. Prior to moving out, my family did experience a home invasion. I am high functioning otherwise (graduated college two years early, do well in my job and have earned a good reputation in my profession, love my life and all who are in it).",28Dec2020,1

I was desperately needing a lie in and some adult time, which I am not getting. Today I was due to have an afternoon with my new partner just playing games and chilling. We were both kid free which never happens, hence why I very rarely get adult time.

I get a phone call at 7.30. The exs new gf has covid symptoms. They have to get a test. It sounds highly likely it'll be positive. So he has to cancel seeing our son. I know that he's gutted.

Hi, I have posted a couple of times on here about my behaviour and how I want to change.  But now I have a few follow-up questions. 

Context:

I am in my early 20s, I am gay and was raised very Christian. I was bullied in high school because of being gay. I have a good group of supportive friends. I suffer from OCD symptoms and have been diagnosed with anxiety. I am also a catfish.

Basically, on and off for about 18 months I used a fake profile and face photos from the internet to talk to men on Grindr. The nudes I sent were my real ones. The chats were often sexual, but I never shared any photos or chats with anyone else. I blocked everyone very quickly - often after a few hours, the longest was probably around a week. 

I used the fake profiles because I didn’t want to be found out as gay or have my face connected to my nudes. I wanted to be invisible but I also wanted to talk to men (it’s pathetic, I know).

My Realisation:

I stopped using this fake profile and deleted all accounts/chats/photos in September. But the guilt and realisation of what I was doing really hit in late October and has been severe since then.

I deeply regret that I’ve violated people like this - lying to them and deceiving them, especially because of the sexual nature of the chats. Even though I didn’t blackmail or share the nudes/chats anywhere, I feel disgusting and deeply regret that I’ve lied to people to even have those conversations in the first place. The idea that someone has been hurt by my actions is very troubling to me and I wish I could back and stop myself from behaving in this way. I never intended to cause harm or violate anyone - but I now know that’s exactly what I’ve done since the harm was in my lying and deceiving. There’s still wrong been caused by actions even if the people didn’t realise they were being catfished. 

Where I need advice: 

Since I stopped using the fake profile I’ve been seeing a therapist (for CBT and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, to help with my OCD/Anxiety and to help me act on my values not my fears) and a counsellor too. I’m trying to stop watching porn and have been reconnecting with my Christian faith. However, I unsure how to atone and make up for what I did. I know I can’t change the past, but I want to be better in the future and not behave like this again. What does accountability look like for someone in my shoes - what is the right thing to do. 

In previous posts I’ve made about this situation, people have advised me to not seek out the people I talked to on the fake profile to apologise to them. I believe this is because the people I was talking to likely weren’t forming romantic feelings nor were they likely aware I wasn’t who I said I was. This has left me with a few questions however:

1. Is it really okay to just move on and leave this in the past? To me it feels like something I deserve punishment for and like I owe many people an apology. But I also don’t want any apology I give to re-victimise or victimise anyone, especially if they didn’t know they were being catfished. I also don’t know if any apology would even help the situation here?

2. Do I need to tell my close friends/flatmates now about my behaviour? If your friend had been doing what I’ve done, what you want them to do to atone/make up for it.

3. Do I need to tell future lovers/boyfriends? I hate the idea that if at some point in the future people find out I was catfishing, that my boyfriend/husband/future kids would get dragged into the situation too. How would I go about telling a future partner? Or even if it was not my catfishing but my nudes that got found out (since the nudes were my real ones).

4. Is it okay to wait for someone I talked to find out it was me who catfished them or should I find the people I talked to and tell them it was me. I know what I’ve done was wrong and so should I seek out the people I’ve wrong to right the situation or will that cause them more harm? Like I don’t want to be projecting my own guilt onto them. 

5. This connects to the first question. I feel like predator and a monster, but I also have anxiety and OCD. This makes it hard for me to judge this situation objectively. I feel so disgusting and guilty - but people on other posts have said that my guilt is making me view this situation as worse than it is. Please tell me what your first reaction to my situation is. 

Basically, I just want to know what steps I can take to be better in the future, now that I’ve stopped Catfishing. I don’t want to be that person anymore - I want to contribute to the world and I want to make people happy and have a family - I just don’t know how to get there or if I even deserve that.  

Tl;dr - I was a catfish (used fake profile on Grindr) and often had sexual chats with people. I’ve now stopped but what steps can I take to be better in the future. I want to change.",28Dec2020,1

Hello,

For a while now I have had problems with irrational thoughts. This has been very frustrating for many reasons. The first reason is that when I search for this online all the examples are of thoughts related to negative self image (“everyone is looking at me”, “I’m so ugly”) My thoughts are completely random and not about myself. I will get to specifics on that later. 2. When I have these thoughts they go in a loop of “ok so this fact proves it, wait but this could mean it’s not proven” and so on. For an example: A while back I started having a compulsive/irrational thought about my dad being a pedophile. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE AT ALL TO PROVE THIS. I would find myself analyzing every action he would make. I would wait to see if he would look up at the tv when a kid was on the screen and if he did I would get really worried that that proves it but then I would tell myself it’s irrational but then the cycle would continue. I just don’t really know what to do anymore as thoughts like these that I will spend weeks on trying to prove/disprove 100% have taken over my life. I don’t really want to go see a counselor. I’m hoping there is some kind of routine to change the way I think that I can practice or a breathing technique or something. Currently the only thing I do when I catch a thought is tell myself it’s irrational and that will make it stop for a while until another “wait but!” moment happens.

Thanks",28Dec2020,1
146,"So, i’ve had a lot of different feelings that one wouldn’t consider normal. Can you maybe try to recognize some of them and point me somewhere because, right now i’m just lost.

-When i was young, i always felt like i was being watched by camera’s that everyone in the world was looking it and that i was some grand experiment. I don’t feel like this anymore

-Feelings of Gender Dysphoria and Transvestic Disorder (These sometimes come together). Don’t worry, i’m working on this one and you probably can’t tell me something i don’t already know

-Feelings of restlessness, irritability and problems with concentration. These have only started when i was 12.

-Feelings of Depression. This is ,i think caused by my Gender Dysphoria.

-When i was young, i had a lot of fake worlds i created and had all kinds of different story’s in them. I still do this but not as much any more. I think like way to big of things that other people don’t care about it. It’s like i attach a lot of meaning to unimportant things. I still don’t know what the hell this is about, and nobody has ever told me about THEIR fake created world where they’re a cool female assassin. 

-I’m AMAB and i don’t like watching normal porn. Normal porn is boring, even the porn i like i don’t like because i think i don’t like my dick(?). It may be fetishistic disorder or gender dysphoria, we don’t know. What i do know is that i have only finished once in my entire life.

-A lot of my behavior and humor is just abnormal, to a point where it’s not funny but just weird.",28Dec2020,1

149,"i been diagnosed w clinical depression but i haven't been depressed for most of my childhood. i was wrong, like something was off but i don't remember (i kinda have a memory gap) being sad. i did have a bit of a depression in middle school and 9th grade mostly because of grades and my parents, but i wasn't... depressed depressed. 

something is still fuckjng off though i get crazy upset and i have impulses to hurt myself. i have self harmed but i don't feel as if it's because i'm depressed, but more of anger and impulsive decision like a minor inconvenience can set it off or sudden hatred of myself. now i know better than to self harm so i resorted to piercings and i would love to dye and cut my hair but my parents would hate me so i started sex was my solution. i have a bf now and when i had impulses i had dangerous sex instead, or immoral sex, and now i resorted to psychdelics to feel calmer. 

my relationship with my bf feels obsessive. i feel like i'm too in love and i self sabotage our relationship and i don't know why and i feel guilty for him having to deal with me. he's my favorite person ever and i don't feel true happiness with my friends. of course i love them but it's not the same. 

at the same time i feel like i have some sort of god complex and it keeps going back and forth and i don't like. i have an identity crisis where if i don't know myself, i'm not a person.

150,"You know how some guy might shoulder check you at the bar on some macho bullshit? Or somebody cuts you off horribly and almost makes you crash in the highway? Or you're having an internet debate with someone, they say something insulting about you, and then block you? You got 2 options: you can walk away and forget about it or you can swing back (either physically, verbally, figuratively).

Why does it feel like both options are terrible for your emotional health? If you walk away, that shit just sits on your mind bothering you that you didn't do anything about it, people are stepping all over you, somebody got the best of you, you're bottling up your anger instead of letting out. But if you start swinging, you become a vengeful, violent person that fully believes in the idea of revenge &amp; retaliation. 

If you walk away from the bar guy, you feel like other men can just bully you at will and you won't do nothing about it and you just think about it for the next few days. But if you confront/fight the bar guy, you officially become a meathead that likes looking for fights. 

If you don't honk or yell at the highway person, the emotions don't have a way to vent and you just sit there simmering for the next few hours on the highway. But if you do, you become one of those angry road rager people and ultimately an uglier person for it.

If you don't get to say anything back to the internet person, you feel like someone was able to take a bite out of your emotional wellbeing and they get to get off scotfree with no consequences and it's just okay for them to take potshots anytime they want in otherwise neutral internet debates. But if you make a burner account to keep messaging that internet person to try to get your own shots in, you become a psycho willing to dox and stalk people to get revenge.

It honestly feels like both options are shitty for your emotional health. Like no matter what you do, your emotional health will take a hit. How do you guys deal with stuff like that?",28Dec2020,1

155,"I can’t cry. I don’t know if it’s cuz of the medication I started last month or if it’s just me. I don’t even know how to describe what I’m feeling, it’s like I can still feel this constant empty feeling deep inside but It won’t come to the surface for me to actually express anything I’m feeling. If that makes sense? 

I don’t know if it’s the medication or not but I feel like I go through cycles of feeling like this even before I started medication soooo I don’t knowww. 

It’s always been difficult to notice if medication is working for me cuz I think I am constantly going through different mood cycles or whatever. 

Like I’ll be really depressed for a couple weeks and depression completely takes over my life for those weeks. And it’s either like a numb kinda depression or I’m crying all the time cuz I’m so sad for no reason. 

Then I’ll be passively depressed/suicidal(idk if that’s the right word), I’ll seem fine on the outside but really all I can think about is killing myself. Well I guess suicide is a regular thought in my mind, always there and I find it quite comforting now. 

I go through phases of hyper sexuality, during this time I think unusually highly of myself and I tend to have more energy than normal which is usually no energy. I do things that I normally wouldn’t do, usually with strangers online. 

And then there’s like an autopilot phase. Horrible memory. Kinda numbs my emotions but sometimes I don’t mind but other times I would rather feel the crippling depression and anxiety than nothing. 

I feel like there’s more to it/ more phases I go through but I have a really bad memory and It’s just really difficult to finish a thought. Also, there’s no specific order it happens, my mood is just all over the place all the time. Sorry, I know this is kinda all over the place and probably doesn’t make sense.

So a little about my past. Im 22 year old male and I was previously on medication for depression and anxiety. But however i apruptly stopped the medications about 2 years ago.

So what ever is happening in my mind is really freaking me out because im enjoying life rn and i love who i am but as the days go on i feel as if im losing a bit of myself by the day and sometimes feel as if suicide is the only option to get out of this.

160,"I don’t know why I’m writing this, I think I just want someone else’s perspective. another opinion. 

I can be really reckless and erratic; jumping into situations without properly planning things first. Sometimes thoughts pour into my mind, spinning so fast I can’t keep up but somehow they make sense. I’m unbelievably stubborn, too obstinate for my own good. When I set my mind to something I will do whatever it takes to make it happen, regardless of how dangerous or damaging or destructive it may be.

I was 20 years old, a legal adult. Although people comment constantly I look far younger than my actual age. With make up about 16/17. Without, I’ve had 12/13. I don’t want to reveal too much about my identity, I’m conscious someone I know will find me, which honestly is highly unlikely but still. Idk

In the space of a few days I bought a one way ticket to a country in Europe and through a volunteer programme planned to stay with an artist To help him in his studio. Or so I thought. I was taking a break from university (in case anyone is interested, I have since dropped out of medical school). I’d always been a creative kid and art has been a part of my life since I was little. I wanted to explore that part of me. I wanted a change.

I don’t know how old this guy was, I’m guessing mid to late 50s. We drove to his house, an old barn he bought and refurbished. This place was in the middle of nowhere. You needed a car to drive to the nearest village. I can’t drive. There was a cluster of houses within walking distance from his place but everything else was wide open countryside. I thought there would be other volunteers or his kids he mentioned in emails but no, it was just him. And me.

This guy was eccentric. Erratic to the extreme. He’d randomly run around the house doing exercises. Have baths at 2am. Start singing in the middle of the night. Some mornings he didnt appear downstairs until midday. Others he’d be awake well before dawn. There was little structure to his life. He drank wine most nights. Almost every night. Sometimes a few glasses, occasionally a whole bottle. He’d always offer me alcohol. I always refused. Told him I didn’t drink. He offered it anyway. In those moments I felt sorry for him, someone so stuck in their loneliness. Claiming not to be dependent on alcohol when one night, he realised he had no more wine, he raked through his desk, scraping the corners of the drawer for loose change to run out and buy some drink.  


This guy didn’t physically do anything to me. He didn’t abuse me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I felt watched, under the endless observation of his gaze. This focal point with a spotlight aimed at my face, eyes following me wherever I went. I would ask him what he was looking at and he’d make some ambiguous reply, saying “nothing”. Or give me this strange unsettling smile, tender but condescending at the same time, like he knew something I didn’t, like he was in on a joke I wasn’t a part of.   


He told me that he’d had a difficult childhood, shattered by the divorce of his parents. He was sent to a boys boarding school where he was an outsider, alienated from the others. We sat in his dining room as he told me this, seriousness plastered over his face as he stared directly at me, eyes boring into my brain. “It was a tough time... I had no friends... I was weird and antisocial.. I did some things I wasn’t proud of... hurting and Killing animals.” I sat rigid, terrified, my mind twisting in my head. Turning itself inside out. I should have left but i didn’t. All his volunteers were girls. The one before was a year younger. He said she was a precious soul. Rare. That he loved her.

I felt this burning humiliation, the echo of I told you so’s playing on repeat within me, frightened by the feeling this was my fault for getting into this situation and I had only myself to blame. My parents warned me of this and I was too stupid to listen. Mind numbingly naive it’s laughable. That I was still a child, too weak to last in the real world. Besides this guy didn’t even do anything to me. Just said some questionable things that made me uncomfortable and I guess afraid.

It turns out the volunteering work he was offering was a place to stay and food in return for modelling for his art. Nude. I struggle with low self esteem. It’s this perpetual shadow which hangs over my life. My chest is constantly crawling with worries that worm their way into everything I do, insecurities about who I am. It‘s more deep rooted than a hang up over my appearance. I don’t know how to explain it, this blackness that bleeds into my brain and darkens every aspect of me to the point I don’t feel like a person. This disgust that’s so draining I feel weightless, like I’m here but not, like I’m floating above myself questioning if the world is real but at the same time it weighs me down. This unbearably powerful force which pulls me to the ground. And every move I make feels sluggish and slow. It’s been a lot worse since going to this guys house.

Standing for hours a day, cold clawing my flesh, naked and exposed. Him sitting, staring, painting me. Commenting about my body, how beautiful it was, how I should be more confident, how much I had to offer. I was uncomfortable doing it. I know it’s mad but I didn’t want to disappoint him, displease him. To make him angered or annoyed. A painfully pathetic part of me was desperate to hear his praise, his approval. To believe I was worthy of his attention. Maybe I wanted it. I remember my mind hanging over me like a balloon, drifting through memories, counting tiles, lines marked on wood. My flesh freezing, fingers numb and purple. Thighs hot, burning from the heater aimed at them. The only part of me that was raw and red from warmth. Hot and cold. Swaying, nausea in my stomach, almost fainting.

But he was nice most of the time. Weird but didn’t over step any boundaries. Not really.

One time, he randomly blurted out, asking if he could touch my jaw. My voice shrivelled up in my Throat, caught like some caged animal. His hands were on my Jaw, huge and imposing, holding my face. I don’t know for how long. Not long I think. He let go and carried on as if it hadn’t happened. He noticed I was jumpy around him, nervous. Occasionally, especially after drinking, he’d touch my shoulder. Or pull my hair.

He questioned my past relationships, or lack of. Why I didn’t have more boyfriends when I was so pretty. He asked about sexual things to which I didn’t reply. When painting, he once asked why I Always shave down there. I was Lost for a reply, a response limp on my tongue. He said he was just curious, that it was good. And never mentioned it again.

The other weird things I can think of he asked if he could lift me up, just to judge my weight. That i was so flexible he was astonished. He once said I could be really immature and he felt like a babysitter, like he was my father who had to look after me and care for me. He said my ass looked really good in leggings. They’re at the back of my cupboard, untouched since he said that. I haven’t worn leggings since.

&amp;#x200B;

i think, in some ways, he hated me. He’d complain about my clothes. They were too loose. Too baggy and unattractive. I once wore Dutch braids and he said they made me look too young. He couldn’t look at me. He despised when I wore make up. I didn’t wear make up around him after that. His presence felt controlling. Domineering.  


My room was small, simple. A double bed. A chest of drawers. And one lonely chair in the corner. I remember wondering why there was a chair, there was no desk to accompany it. If you wanted to read why didn’t you just lie down. One night he asked if he could read me a bedtime story as I fell asleep. I laughed, astounded, thinking this was some sort of joke. He stared at me, dead serious, jaw clenched, closed tightly shut. He wasn’t kidding. I said no. He never asked again. 

The weirdest thing he did happened when he was painting me. He was frustrated and upset with his work, unsatisfied with everything he did that day. He said we should go for a drive, maybe he’d feel better after. In the car, he looked fidgety, unfocused. I asked if I could do Anything to help and was startled by his response. This uncomfortable choking sound escaped him before he violently shook his head and said no. Back at the studio he was still agitated. To fill this uncomfortable awkward silence I asked what he normally did to overcome artblock and he looked at me, this rock hard stare and  bluntly Replied “I have sex”. I told him I couldn’t help him with that and he sent me to my room. I stumbled down the stairs and cried into a pillow. A few hours passed And he was fine again. I didn’t sleep much when I was there. And when I did, I was curled up in the corner of this massive bed, falling asleep clutching a rosary so hard I had tiny bruises on my palm the next morning, praying he wouldn’t open the door which had no lock and appear in my room.  


He didn’t do anything to me. He never touched me inappropriately. He wasn’t abusive, verbally Or sexually. Why do I feel violated? Emotionally exposed? People have loved through experiences so traumatising, heart wrenchingly horrifying soul crushing events. Why am I so affected by this? Why does my mind flail like a dying fish whenever I think about this. Why does my chest feel like it’s cracking whenever I remember something, ribs breaking backwards and stabbing my heart, piercing my lungs so that I can’t breathe. I think I want someone to tell me I’m making a big deal of something thats not worth it. Idk, I don’t even know if this makes sense, or if anyone will read it. Or if it’ll be lost in a sea of stories, sinking to the bottom.",28Dec2020,1

162," I live in a third world country disguised as a first world country. I tried getting help and was put in a psyche ward for depression, getting help was the worst thing possible that anyone can ever do. The only people who can say it otherwise are people who were never in a position to get help. Nothing about a mental health facility helps people. The nurses never made me feel safe and the absolute psychopathic people in there really doesn't help. I experienced worse ptsd while I was in there and people threaten to kill me for minding my own business and having nurses laugh at it like its nothing. Then they place me in the same room with the person that ended up threatening my life as my roommate. All I heard all night was banging on the walls beds flipped upside down and the roommate ended up saying repeatedly he was going to kill me and everyone there. I had to witness people breaking glass and disrupting everyone's sleep constantly. during the day time we were only aloud to walk in a circle until we ended up being to tired and go to sleep or we ended up sleeping all day. A person that was in there said prison was more enjoyable than this as you actually had stuff to do in prison. It was a huge waste of time and the nurses just didnt care they just said the people will either be back or they will end up hurting themselves and others. They didnt seem to care that most people that left the facility ended up the same as when they got there or they ended up worse. Mental health care in the third world USA is non existent and to make things worse after suffering 4 days of sleepless nights with food that tastes worse than elementary school lunches i was billed with 1,200$ without insurance but when I got my insurance to cover it the bill went from 1,200$ to 15,000$ and the insurance paid 14,000$ to which I'm only a college student without income. this country is a joke and everyone running it is As well. My advice is to never get help if you cant afford it and if you can afford it see a physiatrist or a physician Never go to a mental health facility and never tell anyone if you are suicidal as it breaks you more mentally and especially financially. It'd be cheaper if I was dead. This country failed me and every ingle person in my position.",28Dec2020,1

164,"I grew up in a very toxic household - emotional, verbal and physical abuse, my parents hate each other so all I saw (and still see) is screaming arguments, insults, swearing. Mom is a narcissist who has used me as her emotional dumper for years to complain about all her problems and bitch about my dad. Grew up constantly compared to other kids. My sister is 30 and still lives at home with no sign of moving out ever-she’s lazy, unambitious, in debt.

165,"After a recent OD, which I very luckily managed to walk away from due to the severity of it, I have been left with anterograde amnesia (losing memory since the incident).

Does anyone have any advice on what I can do to help either make sure I can keep track of things or a way to improve my memory? I’m open to all suggestions as it is beginning to seriously effect my life to the point where I can only recall the past 20-30 minutes with reasonable accuracy. The hospital says that it will last another 2~ months but if there is any thoughts people have about what I could do in that time I would be very grateful. 

Another issues is that the OD has left me in a state of being high continuously. That on its own is kind of ok even though after the 5 weeks it’s been it’s beginning to wear thin, with the conjunction of that and the memory loss I’m finding it very difficult to keep track of anything

167,"I'm a guy in my mid-20's, and I don't think I ever learned how to handle my own emotions internally. There are also very few people that I trust enough to share enough about my life to actually talk about what I'm going through. Because of this, I know that I put way too much weight on the few people that I truly care about, and - without realizing it - rely on them for processing all of my depression and anxiety. I still live with my parents, and - because of reasons - I'm never going to be comfortable talking with them about what's actually going on in my life.

In the past, I've been medicated for anxiety and depression, but one med turned me into a zombie and the other gave me the worst panic attacks / heart arrhythmias of my life. I have a horrible experience with doctors and medications (always feels like they're just trying to give me pills so I can get out), and I can't afford to pay for a professional psychologist right now, as I'm about to be between jobs. I used to self-medicate with alcohol / weed, but I don't / can't use either anymore because of health conditions that emerged after a couple years of drinking way too much.

I really need to learn to handle my own emotions and manage this so that I don't put unreasonable or unfair weight on the people that I care about. Whenever I can't talk to the people that I ""need"" to talk to, my anxiety takes hold and it's hard to not act manipulative. I don't *want* to manipulate anyone. I don't want to hurt anyone. But, it feels like everything I think of doing to process these things with others is manipulative and toxic without me realizing it at first.

Then I get into this loop where I realize that everything that I *want* to do is, in reality, selfish and harmful to the people that I care about the most. And that is the *single thing that I absolutely never, ever, want to do*. It's like I've become the one thing that I swore to never be. And I don't think that I actually *am* that, but I still don't want people to think that's me, or that I'm doing it on purpose. I don't want to do it at all. Ever.

It's been years since I was truly depressed / suicidal, and I'm honestly scared shitless of falling down that rabbit hole again.

So, if anyone has some support, techniques, tools, or advice for how a grown-ass man can finally learn to process his own emotions without inadvertently hurting other people, it would be much appreciated.",28Dec2020,1

I've been on probably 20 or more things that typically worked for a month or so and then stopped.

I'm still tapering off venlafaxine and on the smallest dose I can be on but since the last taper I haven't had many issues.

Which is when I f'n rage with hate and discontent at everyone and everything. I've been feeling more anxious, nervous and my ""old self"" off of medication.

I've been on the same dose of gabapentin for o think a month or two now and I've had a phone appointment since and the lady wants to keep me on the same dose. But I feel like it's not working. Shitty part is, I don't have insurance and no one else I can go that cheap. I mean, this place isn't cheap because I recently got the bill and they are really trying to bend me over.

I'm on the lower end of my mood swing and wanted to vent a bit, even though it might seem pointless

I feel extremely unlovable and pointless, and mute as well. I have a few people to talk to, but i feel like i cant speak, its not only about having the energy to speak, there are just no words leaving my mouth. I hate my mood swings, I hate how random and fast they are. I hate how I miss my ex girlfriend, even though we were soulmates, I read posts on r/bpd about people missing their exes who mostly tend to be abusive, and the relationship was toxic, while in my case its the opposite, we were two soulmates who have finally found each other and were endlessly happy together, I know you shouldnt miss an abusive relationship, but mine wasnt so whats the problem? I dont feel lonely, but at the same time i really do, I do have friends, I do talk to them but it doesnt fill the gap for me. I miss having someone who loved me as much as she did, i miss having someone who cared for me as much as she did, i miss spending entire days with her, not feeling bored once, having so much fun together, i miss having someone that i trust so much, someone i can talk to about anything, someone i can make happy, someone that means so so much to me, i miss having my soulmate in my life, and its so hard for me to believe she doesnt miss me at all, she told me how we were always meant for each other, and how we are true soulmates, I just cant believe she doesnt miss me, I feel so thrown away, so empty, i just wish she would message me one day, sometimes i go to sleep hoping i wake up to a message from her. I wonder why shes lost feelings for me, i wonder why im not enough, i wonder why i wasnt enough for her to keep to keep this relationship, i wish i asked her, i wish i knew what i did wrong, and i wish i wouldve done more, like asked for some time, i wish i wasnt immature during the relationship with the mood swings and other stuff, and i wish i had a reason to hate her, but i dont have any, because she was the best thing i ever had happen to me in my life, and was a true blessing.

173,"I have severe anxiety, a phobia of vomit and some serious OCD-like avoidance behavior.

I couldn't eat the beef my dad spent hours cooking yesterday because I was afraid it would give me food poisoning. It was old, slightly browned meat, yes, but logically it had 1% chance of actually making me ill. For me though, the fear that grips my heart when I think about vomiting is completely and utterly equal to the fear that I and any other person would feel when they think about having a near-fatal car accident.  So, however small the chance, I was just too terrified to eat the beef. The sadness of disappointing my dad wouldn't overpower my fear of a car accident so it didn't outweigh my fear of this beef. I felt so bad and sorry that I couldn't eat his beef, but my mental health illness just didn't let me.

My dad got angry and told me to shut my mouth and stop criticizing. My brother laughed. My mum sighed in exasperation. 

Now replace my mental health illness with a physical issue, like a broken leg. Say my dad had lovingly organised a trip to Venice without realising that I wouldn't be able to attend due to my broken leg. No sane people would then proceed to tell me to shut my mouth, laugh at me or sigh in exasperation if I then said I couldn't go.     

Why aren't mental health issues treated with the same respect? Why is it allowed in our current society to make people with serious mental health issues feel so small and guilty in this way?

177,"Hello, I hope this is ok to post here.  
**I'm looking for advice on how to help a friend with depression.**

She's (F25) been going through a rough time these past two years, trying to get a job and move out of her parents' house, but she's not finding anything. She says she wants to work in her field and have a steady income (pretty ok standards), but with covid everything has gotten even harder and she's very frustrated.

She was diagnosed with depression and anxiety a few years back, and has been medicating and going to a psychologist on and off ever since. But she seems to be in a very dark place right now. Whenever we talk she can't seem to stop herself from crying, telling me she doesn't know what to do anymore, that she's tired of nothing working out. She tells me she cries almost everyday, that she's exhausted of feeling this way. Even her parents have made a few commments on how they are getting a bit tired of her being this sad all the time. They love her, and her mom supports her a lot. But I guess it's very draining to have someone in her state around all day.

Lately I don't know what to say to her. At the beggining I tried reassuring her that covid was a bad time to be looking for work, that something would come up when everything came back to normal. That she needed to hold on for a bit. But she doesn't believe me. She says she's already tried for so long and has gotten her nowhere, she doesn't believe it's ever gonna happen. I tried telling her that she can't be putting all this pressure on herself, that she should do other things other than looking for work (hobbies and other stuff to keep her mind off things). But she says she doesn't feel like doing anything, nothing brings her joy anymore. So she just does nothing all day.

I'm so worried. When she calls me crying asking me what she should do, I don't know what to say. I try telling her stuff about my day, distracting her a little, but she gets even sadder when she hears about my life and my job. So I'm asking here for advice.

If you or someone you know has ever been in her place, what helped you move forward? What motivated you? What could a friend say to help?

But there is another aspect to consider: the science of happiness. Neurological chemicals like dopamine and serotonin vary from person to person, causing them to feel more or less happy in life.

No one feels happy 100% of the time, but the science of what causes happiness shows us that there are things we can do to boost our mood.

There are Brain Chemicals that can actually boost your mood and keep you happy. Hormones like Serotonin, Oxytocin, Endorphin and Dopamine can help you elevate your state of Happiness.

181,"I have had (unofficially diagnosed) social anxiety since the age of 11. I have never gone through CBT nor taken any pills or anything similar. In other words, my social anxiety is untreated. I was diagnosed by a psychiatrist but not in an official setting (it was my father, who cannot treat me).

Today I am 25. My social anxiety slowly improved over time until the age of 20 or so, only to take a sharp turn around that age. Afterwards, it became so bad that I sometimes wondered if it was still social anxiety or whether it was accompanied by other problems and/or is getting worse. I think I at least developed major depression in addition to social anxiety. My father thinks that I have no avoidant personality disorder but is not sure.

My situation is a bit complicated because my father is a mental health professional and he is not good at diagnosing his own son, plus he is no expert of social anxiety. He, who claims that he overcame his own social anxiety, is against me seeking treatment from other professionals because he thinks that it is embarrassing for him for me to be handled by his colleagues. So I am stuck in this situation where my own father is my only point of reference for diagnosis and treatment and he does not know how to treat me. I do not live with my father since the age of 18 when I moved out and I talk to him 2-3 times per week, which is not enough for him to see what is going on with me. Plus I hide many of the symptoms because I do not want my parents to worry about me.

I have now reached this age in which most adulthood mental disorders begin to appear. My father is afraid that I will develop borderline PD, because somebody in his family has it, but so far I have not. Some brothers and sisters of my direct ancestors (from both parents) have committed the s word thing but they were never diagnosed or treated for anything, so nobody knows what they had, so I do not know exactly what runs in my genes. I am really worried that my social anxiety is getting worse, or that I am developing accompanying disorders, but I don't know what they could be and I am looking for leads to follow. I suspect that at the moment I have social anxiety + depression because of my behavior that is dictated by social anxiety (isolation, not doing things I would want to do etc). Anyone got any other ideas or suggestions of how to get out of this situation?

&amp;#x200B;

My symptoms are the following:

1. **I dislike going out of my home without having any ""good"" reason.** I go out to work, I go out to buy groceries, I go out to meet my friends when they invite me (1-2 times per month). If I have to do something minor, such as sending a letter that is not urgent, I do that when I go shopping for example. I never go out for ""no purpose,"" such as or running or a walk. I never leave my home for ""fun"" activities. My only ""fun"" consists of reading, playing computer games or watching stuff. I really wanna hike, but I have no friends who do it. I really wanna visit places, but I cannot do it alone. I really wanna join groups that do outdoor activities, but part of me tells me that they already know each-other and that I should not try to force myself in and that if I do, I will come out as desperate and they will make fun of me. I have had this since the age of 11.
2. **I do not make friends outside my close circles and my friendships do not last after I move to a new circle.** I used to have a ""best"" friend in primary school, another in middle school, another in high school. I even had a ""best"" friend in university and even later during my masters'. I have ""best"" friends at my workplace too, where I have been working for 4 years now. The problem is that none of these friendships last. I have not talked to my high school best friend since I finished high school. I have not talked to my uni best friends since I graduated. And so on. My only friends at the moment are those that work with me. So I am not completely lonely, but I have no long-term friendship neither. I have been like this since kindergarten.
3. **I have never dated.** I just dread dating. I find it inappropriate. But I am desperate too and I want it. I once had a female colleague whom I liked and I think she liked me too. I never made any move, even after she made some suggestions. When she started flirting with me, I got so stressed out that I switched topic immediately. I didn't want to flirt, I found it embarrassing and a disaster. My parents are so worried about my lack of dating that they are going around and looking for girls to set me up with. I find that embarrassing. I cannot go to a girl and say ""hi, my mother gave me your number."" That is the worst! But I still meet too few girls and I can say I do not see any of my current acquittances as dating partners (I have like 2 in my entire circle, both older than me. I work at a tiny company).
4. **I am beginning to feel lonely and inferior.** Weekends are the worst, as I do not go to work then. I think that my social skills are very poor. That I have missed out. That I did not go partying (I dread them), that I did not drink, I did not smoke, I did not date, I did not do anything that normal kids do in their teenage years. The consequence of this missing out is that a kid that first dated when he was 15, potentially has 10 years of experience now that he is 25. I am 25 and I have zero experience. I cannot compete with them. If I behave like a 15 year old in my first date, I am going to be ridiculed by the girl, who probably has experience too. These feelings started around the age of 22, when that girl flirted with me and I could not flirt back. That is where I realized that I had a problem. A problem that I cannot overcome.
5. **I do not have social media and I will never use dating apps.** I just think of all the people that will see me there and think ""ah look at the desperate loser using a dating app."" I quit facebook and instagram because I did not know what profile picture to use. I do not like my photographs. I think I look much better in reality than I do in pictures. I find many of my poses cringy. I have always had this, but it became so bad around the age of 20 that I just left all social media, and with them, any point of contact with my old friends.
6. **I have a very negative outlook about my future.** This is the opposite of the outlook I had as a teenager. I used to be very optimistic. I was detached from reality. I saw myself graduating Harvard with honors and inventing something so great that all my peers would envy me (I was so silly). Later I realized that I just wanted to feel accepted. While my peers were having fun, I was sitting at home and thinking of how to amaze them. I was just coping. As I grew up, I realized that I was just going to be another normal person, with less than normal social skills. I think of my future very negatively. I see myself leaving my current job and being unemployed afterwards. Then I will have no friends. No girlfriend. Nothing. I will become like Ted Kaczynski if I will even be alive (in terms of living like a hermit, not hurting others).
7. **I am beginning to develop ""the s word"" thoughts.** No serious ideas, but I still think about specific ways of doing it multiple times per day, more after 10PM. They all involve severe trauma to the head. They are intrusive thoughts at this point, but I do see this as an exit strategy in case I get stuck in life, like an alternative to being Ted Kaczynski. It started around the age of 20.
8. **I am beginning to hate my parents.** I know that they want the best for me, but I do think that they forced me to be in this world without my consent. I do feel for them, their own parents did the same to them, but that does not justify their behavior. Not to mention that they divorced just before I moved out and tried to involve me in their drama. They themselves got married when they were 37 and only did it not to die alone. They are both loners and have no friends. I somehow feel like they failed themselves and got lucky at the last moment, only to set me up for failure. I have two older brothers, they is in a worse state than me, single forever and one started taking drugs. There is only one common denominator here, the parents.

tl;dr I started with social anxiety and I ended up developing s word thoughts and hating my parents. I am not sure if this is just social anxiety + depression or whether it could be something else.",28Dec2020,1
182,"I was just hired at a newer, better paying job. I've been there for about a month. I am terrified that I am not doing my best. 

I feel like I am starting to trip up already, and I know that I am distracting myself from doing the things to make me better. I don't want to mess this up, but I just feel like my focus isn't there like it should be. 

I am not the most social person in a work setting, and with back to back to back meetings I feel like I need to prepare for them, so instead of spending my free time working on the things I should to make me better, I am spending that time preparing myself mentally for the meetings. My time management has really gone to crap (mostly my own fault, but partially a result of my previous work environment).

I'm wasting time and in my after work free time, I melt my brain with youtube and mindless phone or switch games. I feel sick and disappointed in myself because I struggle to find the self control to put the games down and struggle to find focus and motivation within myself. I constantly feel like I need others to guide and motivate me, but that is not how any adult will do well in life or be happy. I want to be better and I know what will make me better, but I choose to take the easy route too often.

If someone tells me to do something, I do it and can sometimes even do it well, but I don't listen to myself. I just feel a lot hopeless right now (not major call for help hopeless... no worries there... but I'm a bit of a failure hopeless).",28Dec2020,1

Hi, throwaway account since i am fairly well known in my country in some circles where drama and gossip is really bad, and i need some advice but don't want this to be traced to me or my ex, as it is very personal, also english is my second language so i apologise for any misspelling.

This is a long story, so buckle up, we all have that person that “got away” may it be our first love when we were teenagers or some really good relationship we messed up, in my case it was a girl I meet about 20 years ago when i was 15 and she was 14, she and I fought all the time but you could tell we were just in denial about liking each other (stupid teenage drama), when we were about 20 she asked me out, we went into a couple of dates were she seemed really interested, we had about 5 dates in 1 and a half months, the last one at that time was a long trip we did to visit a botanical garden and take pictures, it was all going well but suddenly she became realy cold and stopped talking to me, she stayed silent all the way back (it was a 2:30 hours trip in bus), after that date she told me it wasnt working for her and proceeded to block me all over social media (we mainly used Hi5 and msn messenger at that time) and asked me not to contact her, I respected her wishes and moved on, and got on a relationship with another girl a few months later.

About 2 years later she contacted me back in the recently launched Facebook, saying she didn't wanted to lose my friendship, apologizing for what she had done and asking if we could remain friends, I agreed and we remained in inconsistent contact through like 5 years, I was in a committed relationship at the time and did not paid much attention to her other than a few “likes” here and there.

I never married, but my relationship at the time was really stable and we even moved together to an apartment when we had around 6 years together, immediately my relationship with my girlfriend at the time started having issues, we used to only see each other weekends before, and she was a very loving partner in every occasion, but she was a single child that only grew up with her mother, so she was used to be alone and wasn't used to show much affection on a daily basis, I tried to reach out several times to her and tell her that i needed more emotional affection and attention, she would “try” for a few weeks but we will always come back to the same “status quo” some time later, also, her single mother is a devoted catholic who made her grew with really negative ideas about sex and she never really enjoyed it (we were both virgins when we got together, and we didnt had sex until after 3 years of being together), I always had a high libido so it became really akward for me to have to ask her always for sex, and i got rejected 9 out of 10 times, the situation became worst when she got a promotion at her office and she started just coming home and didnt wanted to spend any time with me, she will order takeout (some of the times only for her) and will shut in her room to eat and watch netflix, at this point i had stopped asking her for attention or sex (in our last year together we only had sex about 3 times), but still loved her very much and just blamed the new issues on her new job, as well as the famous “lows” most long relationships go through.  
Around two and a half years ago i received some comments from a fake profile in an old instagram picture, they stated something like “i am a girl you dated for a while a long time ago, and I have always regretted not taking the chance of having an relationship with you, and how i behaved on that trip we took together”, the moment she mentioned the trip i knew exactly who it was, so i contacted her directly and to tell her i was still in a committed relationship and to ask her what had made her send me that message, she broke down and cried and confessed to always have been in love with me, at that point i rejected her but didn't blocked her or anyway, but since we had started talking again we “reconnected” over our relationship issues and frustrations, she was in a relationship with a guy who used to be her best friend, (she implied the guy was emotionally and psychologically abusive and really bad in the bed), eventually after a few months conversations became romantic in nature and we decided to leave our current partners to give us a chance together, so we did and started a new relationship a few weeks after I broke things off with my then almost 10 year girlfriend (there was no cheating, we only saw each other once before we started dating and it was in an social event).

The relationship was great, the only issue we had was about 4 months after we started dating, she was angry i didn't updated my facebook status to be in a relationship with her (i had only hidden my marital state) and told she felt like i had her “hidden” from the world, as if i was ashamed of her, i explained to her i just wanted to give some time before i gave the social world the impression i had jumped in another relationship, as i wanted as little drama as possible around us, she seem to understood at the time, and we were great together, we had great emotional and physical chemistry, would gush constantly about each other, and couldn't keep out hands off the other’s body, to the point where i can say these last two years i have been happier and felt more well taken care off than on all those 10 years with my previous girlfriend, we didn't lived together, but she would spend between 3-4 days a week in my apartment, i vene gave her a room for herself to use as an office.

Once we were talking about our mental health and she mentioned she “used to be” a hypochondriac but isn't anymore, but when the pandemic started she started behaving a little extreme in regards of the cleaning and the prevention protocols, we talking about drenching everything we received from outside sources in rubbing alcohol, meeting anyone “not in our bubble” using an industrial-level mask and plastic face cover, and changing her shoes and most clothes at the entrance of our home, I am a diabetic, so i stayed mostly indoors, i only went outside the apartment about 3 times from the start of the pandemic, i even gave up on visiting my mom and my nieces (something i loved to do), i wasn't as extreme with protocols as her, but still followed most of the recommendations, i wore a mask when i went out, and kept social distancing with outside people, however i made a few mishaps through the months, i didn't wore a mask when picking up ubereats packages, once i stored some frozen goods she had bought without sterilizing them first, and “talked too close to my landlord”, my gf did mentioned these issues once and i tried to adapt to her requests, but she did only as a “passing comment” so i didn't took them that seriously.

Around the end of october she got a really bad ear infection, she tried to “hang on” by taking some medicine but after a week it came to the point where she could not even eat well because her infected ear made half her face hurt, i had to really fight to convince her to go to the doctor, but she finally agreed, i decided to accompany her, the day of the appointment she told me she had took all the masks from the apartment the her house to wash them, and told me i could request one with uber eats, when i was about to ask for it, i started thinking “i don't know if the uber eats guy is going to throw the mask in his backpack, were god’s know how many packages have been also, and if he picks up the mask from a store i don't know how many people have manipulated the mask, or even if its seal is broken”, there is a drugstore two blocks outside my home, so i decided it was safer over all to just walk there and buy the mask directly, if i happen to run across someone on my sidewalk, i just crossed the street, before we got any close (i only had to do this once before i got to the drugstore and got my mask).

When i got to the hospital everything was fine, she was a champ with the shots, but when we were getting close to her car (i took an uber there) she mentioned her sister had accompanied her but decided to stay in the car, I thought - well that's kinda weird - but did not mentioned anything, we got in the car but i noticed her sister was angry, we went to their house (they still live with their parents) to drop her sister off and we came back together to my apartment. Two days later i saw my GF lock herself in the bathroom to cry, when i asked her what happened  she said her sister had yelled at her because “Her boyfriend is a an irresponsible idiot that went inside a hospital with a mask but without a plastic face cover, that if i had gotten the virus i would spread it to her and her family and that if their parents died it was the same as if i had murdered them”, i tried to comfort her and explain to her her sister was being unreasonable (she is supposed to be an active hypochondriac, to the point my girlfriend had to take her several times to the hospital in the past and pay really expensive test just because her sister “felt she was getting x disease”), she calmed down and everything was supposed to be ok at the time.

My girlfriend had asked me for a photoset for halloween, since the ear infection situation it had gotten postponed, but i wanted to look good (not seeing your barber in 8 months would really mess you hair and beard), so i contacted my usual barber and asked her what protocols she had implemented since the start of the pandemic, she told me only one client got serviced at a time, temperature was taking to everyone that came into the beauty parlor, and instruments were disinfected before and after each session, i found all of these reasonable and scheduled a visit the first saturday of november, i let my GF know what i was going to do and she didn't made any comment about it so i proceeded to go to the site that day, i sent her a few pics while i was getting my hair and beard done and she didn't replied, when I was done i stopped at a coffee place to get some food, a few hours later my mom called me to tell me my girlfriend had told her - “That she couldn't trust me anymore, that i was irresponsible, had broken the bubble by removing my mask at the barber shop and by eating out of the house, and that i “had dropped my guard against the virus” - , i tried to call her to talk stuff over and she yelled at my while crying that she couldn't see me for at least a month before she was completely sure if i had got infected or not, also she told me she needed some time to think things about us.  
I went into a panic mode, but i stayed put for a few days, the next thursday she decided to finally talk with me and then she started telling me about all the “mistakes i had made and how i was putting her and her family in danger, that i didn't respected her or her efforts to keep me safe, and that if i didn't felt the same fear she felt about all this situation she couldn't be with me anymore” i tried to explain to her the precautions i had took when i went outside but she didn't even acknowledge my comments, in the end she told me she was going to need time for herself and to please not contact her back, to which i agreed, she contacted thursday next week to let me know she had contracted a moving company to come here and take all her stuff back from her room, to which i made no objection.  
The tuesday before thanksgiving she contacted me letting me know she was very worried about me, that she “thinks” i am not taking care of my diabetes issue (which is not completely false, while i did keep a regular eye over my blood sugar levels to be sure they don't raised too much, i haven't been that carefully at the time and it fluctuate a lot), and that if “i went blind i could go crazy”, i promised to her that i would be more careful from now on and asked her directly is she wanted to follow up with the relationship or if she wanted to just leave it there, she confirmed she wanted to continue, even if it required a lot of effort, we talked just fine for a few days until thanksgiving, that day she only replied to a morning text and didn't replied anymore, the next day (friday) i noticed we were no longer friends in facebook, but she kept all our photos together public, and we were still best friends on instagram, i sent her an email telling her it was fine if she needed some space without me (i accept i had become full stalker mode on her social media accounts and kept reacting to all her posts), and that i wouldn't interact with her in social media anymore, she then told me she had “turned off facebook messenger but she hadn't blocked me”, to which i replied with an screen of her facebook main page that showed that we were no longer friends, she didn't replied back.  
The next tuesday i asked a friend in common if she was ok, as i was really worried about her, a few hours back she sent me a whatsapp voice message saying “you need to get over this, the relationship is done, i am not receiving as a woman what i need, what you did is as bad as cheating, you are loving me wrong, and i hope someday you realize why i am leaving, don't send any of my friends any more messages, you didn't appreciate all the effort i made to keep you safe and healthy, and it really hurts you never put me as your girlfriend in facebook” which is true, but all our social media life was about us, 95% or our posts were stuff we were doing together, so it wasn't like i was “hiding” the relationship anymore, she then proceeded to block me on all social media platforms, just leaving open her email address so i can send her receipts of deposits i made to her account for a loan she had lend me to buy a new PC i still haven't finished paying back (it has about $1000 left).

This all happened on december 02, I started to see two therapist that have helped me a lot (i had really bad anxiety attacks all through november), and with a lot of introspeccion i finally was able to get out of my “emotional panic state” a few days ago, and finally think clearly, i realize now that i made a lot of mistakes on how i handled the whole situation, i should have never contacted her friends to ask her to help her, i also shouldn't have told her i was planning on asking for her to marry me, and i did some really stupid mistakes, a friend told me when he separated from his wife he opened a tinder account as an “ego boost” and it had helped him a lot, i did the same and talked to a few girls (with absolutely no intention of meeting over, just with the intention of feeling the attention of other women), but i felt so shitty i closed it 3 days later, also, by this point i have been completely alone for almost 2 months, as i right now only live with my cat.

I closed all my social media accounts after she sent me the last message, but a friend is still unblocked and it seems she is constantly posting stuff about “not staying in relationships with people that dont appreciate it as you need or give as much as you give them”, but she also sometimes post stuff like “deleting pictures of my past relationships, i loved as much as i could because that's how i am happy” just to delete the posts a few hours later, i also discovered about a two weeks ago i still have access to a dropbox folder where she shared nudes and lewds with me, i sent her an email letting her know and asking her to remove my access, but she still hasn't done so.  
At this point I am working on myself and on moving on from all this mess, therapy has helped a lot but i still miss her very very much, and want to be with her, my question is: How much time should i wait before trying to contact her back, should i even try to contact her back, is it normal for a person who “used to be a hypochondriac” to just relapsed into this unstable behavior, and are her actions consistent with a panic attack? Both therapists state she most likely will try to get back together once her “panicked state” is over, but should I even consider taking her back, and if i do, what rules and safeguards should i put up so this doesn't happen again in the future? Is it wrong for me to still lover terribly and wanting to go back to her?",28Dec2020,1

199,"Hi r/mentalhealth,

I [24M] have broken up with my SO [24F] 9 months ago for a number of reasons that entangled together and crippled our relationship. Today, I'm willing to get back with her, and taking a few steps, I see that many defects of our relationship was linked to her severe pre-menstrual syndrom (PMS), that may be pre-menstrual dysphoria disorder (PMDD) but have never been formally diagnosed.

I have been seeing a therapist for myself these days, to try and be a better partner. I took responsibility for my own mental health, for the sake of a relationship with my SO. Now, I realize that huge efforts need to be done also on her side. Her PMS could last up to 3/4 of the month, induce her to be awfully close-minded, not want to get out, completely slob out, be depressed, overdrink, overeat, etc. I'm not willing to live this life again.

I'm trying to think of ways to deal a ""deal"" with her, by which she would, concerning her mental health :
- Switch contraception method to non-hormonal. We already tried to get her a copper IUD, but it failed and we stopped there. I want her to try again, with another gynecologist. We're pretty sure hormonal birth-control messes up horribly with her mood.
- See a therapist in any case.
- See a psychiatrist and check if some form of medication is necessary.

At this point, it feels like I'd want to reform her whole life, and maybe even some parts of her personnality. Can such a change come from me ? Do you have any experience in taking your lover on the path to mental health ?

Also, it's absolutely necessary that she does those things for us to get back together. How do you approach these necessities, without being manipulative ? Where's the line between legitimate demands for the better good of the person and the relationship, versus manipulative, toxic or self-deception focus on ""the potential"" of your partner ?",28Dec2020,1

Back story:
Earlier this year, I had, among other things, a partial face paralysis because I was so stressed and anxious my body just... stopped functioning right.

201,"I’m trying to set up a meeting with my doctor and I want to explain more about my spiral episodes. To me, I always described them as anxiety attacks but as I do more research, it doesn’t seem to fit? 

When I spiral, I notice my mood drops by the minute, and within like 10 minutes I’m in a really bad headspace where my only thoughts are offing myself to solve whatever the problem is at hand and what usually triggers it. Often times, I feel and think that I KNOW how to properly respond, react, I KNOW I am in a spiral, but cannot pull my thoughts out of reacting calmly. Instead, I make matters worse by thinking catastrophic thoughts and feel so much guilty and self loathing that it’s just really difficult for myself and loved ones to figure out.

203,"Ok, I know reddit isnt where you get you're mental health diagnosis but I just want to know if I'm crazy or not.

I (F18) have been having mental health issues(?) since about 14? I cant remember exactly when it started but I know how. 
I'm still incredibly embarrassed by this and have only shared this with my therapist, but it originally all started on tumblr. I was naive and impressionable and what I took away from a lot of tumblr posts was if you're sad sometimes you're depressed and if you're depressed you self harm. So I started writing depressing stuff, drawing fake cut marks on myself, all the attention seeking stuff. I feel awful and so incredibly embarrassed about it. Idk if something was wrong with me to start acting like this, but it did eventually lead to me actually self harming and having suicidal thoughts, although I never shared this with anyone until my mum noticed and sent me to councilling. 

Councilling was.. interesting. I've always had issues with my self image and self confidence, been introverted and struggled with social settings. I actually had a panick attack when my mum forced me to go to a birthday party of a friend where I knew no one and she left me to chat with her friends, but she said that I was being dramatic and a friend of mine (who has been officially diagnosed with anxiety disorder and depression) was influencing me to act like this. In councilling we kinda talked about how I struggled with my self esteem and social side, but I never felt comfortable enough to tell her why I actually came. This year I actually reached out to her again cause of covid and actually writing a suicide note as I felt that bad but she kinda laughed and told me it was a phase that is normal and would pass in about two years? 

So I stopped councilling after I didnt feel like it was helping anymore and I convinced myself I was ok. I still had bad phases where I would restrict myself from eating or sleeping and felt shit, but everyone has those right? 

This past year however has been awful. My grades fell, I often left school early as I was so overwhelmed and crying. I felt terrible, but I've never in my life had a reason too. Even when this all started, I have a family who loves me, dont have to worry about my education or money. I had recently got into a relationship with a guy I love so much and who loves me back. Yet I was self harming again, throughout the past few years it had just been small things but now I full on cut my body again as it felt therapeutic. I felt awful, not helped by the fact I was sexually assaulted twice over about 6 months, once at work from a colleague after which I had a panick attack. I had also considered suicide more seriously the past year and had a very strange experience where I didnt feel in control of my body and sat on my grandparents balcony, a fall I'm if it would kill me or not, but decided they didnt deserve that. 

This might be where it's important to note that not all of my family knows, but almost all of my immediate family has mental health issues. This includes alcoholism, hoarding, depression, anxiety and my grandma has what we think is a personality disorder as she is incredibly emotionally manipulative bordering on emotionally abusive. I also moved from germany to england with only my mother, meaning my father, sisters and grandparents are all in germany still and I still breakdown everytime I have to leave them after a holiday there. Me and my mother also had a very difficult relationship recently, especially in regards to my mental health as she didnt believe me often and told me I was just doing it for attention and didnt want to get better, which may have been true in the past but hurt me and made me question myself now.

I got into therapy with a new therapist in the summer and she was very helpful and also suggested I talk to my doctor, who put me on sertraline. This is really where my question comes from. Having gone to university now and being with the university health service, everytime since when I've had to renew my prescription I've had to tell them why I'm on the sertraline again and why I need it, with the most recent call asking me for what diagnosis I'm taking it. I've never been officially diagnosed with anything, nor do I know how I would get one or if i deserve one. Also I dont know how I'm meant to feel on the sertraline, if I'm actually feeling better or not. Especially when I have my period I feel awful again and I just feel so lost and clueless. I had to stop talking to my therapist as money is a tight now with me being a student and my mum not being able to give me financial aid due to covid. My dad does, but it cant cover all my living expenses and therapy.

I just feel so lost and I have no clue what I'm going through or if it's even anything and I'm just being over dramatic. So reddit, am I crazy or what? Idk even know anymore, I dont even know why I want so desperately to know if I am depressed or anxious or what. So yeh",28Dec2020,1

207,"I’ve been in and out of therapy for years. Out at the moment. I’ve struggled with depression, anxiety (especially social anxiety), ptsd and had some problems with drugs and alcohol.

I have had comprehensive trauma therapy and I don’t struggle so much with it anymore. 
I’ve got a decent toolkit to deal with my problems. I don’t have many friends but a few good ones.

What I’m wondering is how I can motivate myself  to do the things I know will help. For example, right now I’m so anxious about a lot of things, and I know that meditating would probably help, but I can’t bring myself to do it. I just can’t seem to get out of my own way and stop having a pity party, which I’m aware sounds pathetic and it just makes me feel even worse. 

I don’t know if I’m just paralysed by the fear that it won’t work and I’ll do everything right but still feel awful. Why can’t I just help myself?",28Dec2020,1
208,"but I don’t think I’m right in my mind. I’ve had depression before, survived two attempts and was on meds about three years ago. I’ve been off antidepressants since 2017 and I’ve been much better for a while. I lost four of my cats and dealt with it better than I thought I would, and lived a reasonably happy life. But since last year I think? I’ve realised something. I’m unable to love people. I have seven cats and I love them over my life. I would do everything for them, give them the best life, keep them happy but i don’t and I never had felt the same way towards human beings. In fact, I despise them. I don’t feel grief or fear for them. I don’t get upset by the possibility of losing the humans in my life the way I’m scared of losing my cats (I’ve already lost four and I’d thought I’d “attempt” again if I lose them but I held on for the remaining seven) I just hate human companions. I hate my family to bits because all they’ve been is toxic for me. As a child I remember being told that I had anger issues and jealousy and that I was just really heartless and mean. My parents aren’t the appreciative kind. I used to be the problem solver in the family before I had depression and after I got better until recently when I decided to give up on them altogether. I have too many siblings and except for my youngest sister who is actually really sweet (and I might care a bit about her) I abhor the rest of them. I’m scared of my brothers and my father as well because they have really big voices and yell at me all the time. I’m the weird one at home. The one with mental problems and the one that hates everyone. I don’t talk to them very often and they don’t really know much about me. My parents also has this habit of telling bad about me to my aunts and everyone else; my job is stupid (I’m a math tutor) I get paid little, I’m mean, I’m cruel, I’m not a normal child like everyone else. They say that my parents should just marry me off to someone and chase me out of the house and I’m pretty sure they would do that. I’m an unhappy person anyway and they know that I won’t find happiness in anyone either way so it doesn’t matter who I go with as long as they toss me out. I’m in a south Asian family by the way; here it’s really tough to move out. We don’t have individual apartments, it’s not safe for girls to live on their own. There are lots of horror stories. But I think at some point I’ll just marry whoever they ask me to marry and leave. I don’t trust their judgement at all because they hate me and want me out of the house right? And as they hate my job they hate it that I use family internet to work from home. They’d rather if I stopped working because it’s annoying to stay quiet while I work. I’ve been working on getting my own internet, a new computer, pay my phone bills and loans and feed my cats with the little salary I get. It’s really tough right now. I don’t have anyone except for my cats and I have nowhere to go. It’s really suffocating here and I feel like living in this house will k*ll me before I even k*|| myself. Am I really not normal? I know that I’m mean and cruel not to love people. But what if I can’t make myself love people? What if I am only physically capable of loving my cats?
Anyway I’m going to stay alive as long as my oldest cat (11yo) does. When she’s not there I’m going to give my other cats for adoption and really do what I couldn’t do 3 years ago so I can be born into a better life again.",28Dec2020,1

210,"**warning the Kings Speech spoilers**

The Kings Speech is probably one of my favorite movies. I feel like it teaches one of the most important lessons regarding dealing with mental health: your road to treatment may look different to everybody else’s, but it is valid if it helps you in the long run. Bertie scoffed at the treatments and was terrified of his public image. Everyone on the outside looking in would probably laugh at all the crazy things he had to do to work with his stutter, but they were the things he needed. 

I relate this to a lot of things like addiction, anxiety, and other mental health issues. If you’ve been addicted, some may not understand why you so vehemently deny going or doing things that may lead you back to addiction, they don’t understand, but you do, and you are the one who knows what’s best for you. Some might not understand why you miss out on gatherings and events because of your intense anxiety or depression: but you understand and you know what’s best. 

I know this is kind of a loose fit but it really inspires me to think: others might not know why I’m doing this, but it’s in my best interest for my mental health and it’ll lead me down a good road.",28Dec2020,1

215,"The last few years have been rough. My best friend killed himself two days before my birthday. The following July my dog passed away very unexpectedly. The next month, my grandmother died from liver cancer. Immediately after that, my mother in law was diagnosed with a rare form of lung cancer in her colon. She fought for a year and passed away. The day after my MIL passed, my dad called me to tell me he had prostate cancer. He went through radiation and it went into remission. It was a success. We needed that bit of hope that there was some positivity still left in the world. The next month, my mother had a full hysterectomy to remove cancer. She's doing well and seems to have beaten it. Everything that had hurt so much seemed to be over.

Then, two weeks ago, my father had blood in his sinuses and urine. He went to the ER Immediately. Out of nowhere, my father was diagnosed with Accute Myeloid Leukemia. He was told he may have to stay in the ER for a month until it was in remission. 90 percent chance of success to be in remission for at least 5 years. They kept commending him on his great shape at 74, and that was great news. They gave him medicine to start keeping white cell counts low, and it worked great. They discussed a couple different treatment options. He could start traditional chemo to get in remission, or possible a trial that could kill it entirely. I convinced him to take the trial. I think he would have anyways. The trial required a white cell counts of 25k or less. My dads was near 55k at that time. They began a procedure to filter out the white blood cells, promising by the end that he would be in a state of remission. During the procedure, he began to panic. There was no pain, but his anxiety caused him to suffer a heart attack during the 3 hour procedure. The next day he would go into AFIB. Or irregular heart beats until they could bring it down with medicine. At this point, the doctors told us things were bad, but there was a plan. Optimize his heart and get him ready for chemo the following day. The doctors stopped talking to us at that point. Everything went downhill so fast. They couldn't fix his heart because of the leukemia, and would not administer chemo because of his heart. I was there in the morning, waiting to be told the chemo would start. No one came. Chemo was off the table. Within 3 hours we were happy and joking, to crying and telling each other everything we needed to say before the end. It was that fast before the nurse came in to give him fentanyl. That was the last time I saw my dad, and he saw me. 

He passed at 4am the following morning. Surrounded by loved ones. 

If you took the time to read this, I need help getting over these losses and heartbreaks. I'm trying to be okay, but I'm just not. I've been to traditional therapy before, and I don't want to sit with someone and talk about my day or how things are going. I need a professional to metaphorically Crack my brain open and tell me why I'm unable to process loss and change. And then what I need to do to fix it. I want to find the causes inside me, not make lists, or talk about the future.

216,"Yesterday, I was watching a YouTube video of a guy who made a video on why life could always be better. He shared his stories of some bad times he went through at age 12 and age 16. He was about to cry in the video but stopped himself saying “Hell nah man, I ain’t about to cry bro. That’s some bitch nigga shit, hell no.” Throughout my life, I’ve lived with family members who would mock me for showing tears. I never cry easily and am not easily offended but why is it that men or boys crying is looked down upon in society, yet when we don’t want to share our feelings with other people we’re insisted to share them? Come on man, I thought men were humans too. I don’t have depression or any mental problems but I’m scared of telling people my difficulties in life because they might roast me and call me a “bitch ass nigga!”or “pussy ass boy!” It’s happened before and I don’t want it to happen again.

Does anyone agree with me? Am I the only one who has been feeling this way? Please let me know your thoughts.

217,"I'm 27, out of work, and currently off health insurance since I quit my job. I tend to move around a lot in my house sometimes when I feel nervous, anxious, or insecure, and my mind sometimes feels ""fuzzy"" or like I can't think clearly. I get anxious in social situations sometimes and I also have a deep fear of crying when I talk to others.  


With my family, I have a history of sometimes ""overreacting"" or verbally lashing out and I feel bad about this.  


I think a lot about whether or not what is going on with me is ""physiological"" and not mental health related. I was hoping to speak with my doctor to see if maybe they can ""run tests"" or something of the like. I literally am too afraid to apply for jobs right now because of my ""symptoms"" and I feel scared to be around others sometimes as well because I worry about fear and judgment.

220,"4 Days Left of 2020. Wow. What a year it has been, a **rollercoaster.** **YOU** made it through, We made it through. **Together, Separately.** I am feeling tired, exhausted and I know you might be too, but THIS is not the time to stop or settle down, we **NEED** to keep pushing and pressing. With what we are focusing on, letting go, embracing, **KEEP PUSHING.**

Grey days. During Canada's winters it can be tough; spiritually, mentally &amp; physically. Seasonal Affective Disorder is prominent in all of us. If you are reading this from somewhere else in the world and you are asking me, Drey what is Seasonal Affective Disorder? Well Seasonal Affective Disorder affects us with the lack of sunshine and warmth we get it during the Winter Days usually from November all the way until March sometimes, wow.........I just realized how much of a battle it really is. **WE PRESS ON.** As I want you to **PUSH &amp; PRESS,** if you are from Canada or if you aren't, we are all exhausted and tired from this year. I believe in you to finish this year, in the strongest way **OF YOUR LIFE.** 

It takes time. Its day to day. We should realize that every single person on the journey, will never had it all figured out, will never say ""I'm healed"", its not possible. There are many things we can heal from but that only allows us to then take on the next level and layer needed to heal. We are all **one**, we are all **different**. We are all **connected**, we are all **unique**. We are all **passionate**, we all have **different passions**. We all act in **kindness**, we all show **love**, **empathy** and **compassion** to **ourselves** and others in different ways.

This is what makes me feel so grateful to be a human and to have interactions and experiences with people from many different walks of life. To experience, listen and gain a perspective that I would not have learned. We must listen to one another. We must be **present.** Present with ourselves and the ones that we are allowed to surround ourselves with in this very moment. Things change quickly, friendships come and go, relationships come and go, the only one that will **ALWAYS** stay is **YOU. BE** there for others but remember that **YOU** have to **BE** there for **YOURSELF** first.

How are you suppose to grab the marbles in the jar for yourself if they have been all used up for everyone else? We only have a certain limit everyday. Use them wisely but be kind and empathetic. Release Ego.

I love you.

221,"Alright so I'm new and this is my first post so not 100% I'm doing this right but I (20F) was wondering if most people have negative thoughts often throughout the week when they're working. I have a desk job uploading data working roughly 40 or a little more each week and I don't hate the job. Its a decent job that pays well but I have often moods and negative thoughts while I'm working that I can't always distract myself from. I do have anxiety but these don't seem to stem from anxiety most of the time. I'll have reoccurring thoughts saying to myself "" I hate myself"" or ""I want to kill myself"" or think of the action of harming myself or just dreading having to work and wait till the time I finally go home. I have to tell myself to stop watching the clock so time will feel like it goes by faster. I won't act on these thoughts regarding self-harm. But it still is bothersome for these thoughts and down feeling moods to loom over me. Maybe part of it is I dislike being away from my boyfriend who I live with but I don't feel like I feel a sort of separation anxiety. I'll feel these down moods and negative thoughts away from work but I notice it more when I am working. Maybe cause my brain isn't stimulated enough to distract me? Rarely I can make my mood go back to normal and sometimes its only temporary with thinking about short term goals or things I look forward to or that make me happy or listening to music. Now that I think about it, alot of the things that make my mood better are relating to my boyfriend like thinking about him or listening to music he likes or if he messages me while I'm working. Could it be I subconsciously just miss being around my boyfriend even though I live with him and see him every day? Sorry if there's a better subreddit to fit this post.

For years I thought it was just depression but although I'm not sure what it actually is because I have yet to been diagnosed I just have a gut feeling/ educated guess based on my symptoms it's more. I'm scared about actually getting diagnosed because I feel like that just makes everything more real. I'm stressed because I know I have to be very honest and open about what I experience probably even more so then I've been with my therapist which is also terrifying to me. I feel crazy a lot of the time. Also some of my symptoms I just have a difficult time putting into words or accurately describing which stresses me out. On the other hand it would be nice to be diagnosed with whatever it is that's going on because at least then an accurate treatment plan could be made.

This year was supposed to be my year to focus on myself, and to figure out MY life instead of having to support ours, but then covid hit. I had to hop back into my car and continue my delivery work, I was fine with that, in March.

I've been battling MS, manic depressive disorder, PTSD and a literal demon of a living situation (was abusive, made living so hostile that we secluded ourselves to our room only). Come August we were being threatened in our home, so we moved out immediately. My parents were willing to take us in while COVID is still happening, as it was mutually beneficial.

There were many terrible things that happened to me in the past that made me think of committing suicide many times: abused when I was a child, betrayed by my friends, failures in life... And the most frustrating thing is that I don't know whether I'm straight or gay. I used to love (or at least I think so) a girl when I was in high school (rejected when I told her that I loved her), but I've been having feelings for boys too. 

Also, I've been working online to earn money for a living since I was a high school student.

And this is the main part...

I'm a senior student in a top university in my country and I've just successfully defended my thesis a few days ago. Because I was recruited by a big Japan Company last year, I'll go to Japan and start my new life there after graduation. You may think that ""WTF? What does this guy want to say? "", please read until the end. Before the day that I defended my thesis, I was stressed terribly (Part of the reason is that if I can't graduate on time, I will not be qualified anymore and my contract will be canceled. And to be honest, it is really important to me and people in my family). I usually skip meals, especially breakfasts. I couldn't sleep at night, always go to bed at 2 - 4 AM. When I laid on the bed, there were millions of questions in my head: How could I get through it? Will I finish my thesis on time? What questions will all the professors ask when I defend my thesis? etc. My heartbeat was like a drum every time I think of that, it even made me wake up early in the morning when I dreamt of that day :(

I keep telling myself that everything will be normal again after I defended my thesis, but it just got worse. I don't know why but since then, I keep waking up at 2 - 4 AM and couldn't fall asleep again.  My mood has been very unstable, one minute I was excited about my future, the next minute I got angry or sad for no reason. And I also found out that I may have feelings for my two friends (1 male, 1 female) at the same time and I can't even think about it anymore. Despite hanging out, going to the movie theater, drinking beer,... with my friends continuously in the last few days, I couldn't find any joy s.  Enjoying something makes me feel nervous about my future, but not enjoy anything also makes me feel the same way...

 I really don't know who I am and what I want anymore, always feel disappointed in myself. So please give me some advice, I really appreciate that.

There's visible wounds on her arms too but not deep. I didn't say anything about those so she wouldn't feel embarrassed. I asked if she wanted to spend time going out a bit and go for walks and talk if she needs another set of ears. She plans on moving out in the next few days. I suggested a work program we have for counseling but she says she has some personal ones lined up. She's hesitant for a phone version instead of an in person therapy session which doesn't help cause if Covid. I'm hoping once she moves out, things will get better..her work-life is being affected really badly. To the point that managers are now keeping track.

Actually we had a bad falling out many years back but I always forget the negative traits about people and am quick to forgive. so we hung out a couple of times again in the last year. Anyways now she thinks we are best friends after hanging out literally 4 times in a year and is angry when I am not super responsive.  During covid I decided I made a mistake in reconnecting with her and really would like to have no contact at all forever. However I can’t bring myself to block her on all mediums- I know other people who have and it went terribly for both parties (black mail, etc). I don’t want that drama. So far I have blocked her from viewing things I post online because I am hoping that „out of sight means out of mind“. But she is able to contact me and hits me up sometimes to hang or catch up.  The pandemic is my excuse but that will only last me so long. I am really hoping she will just forget I exist eventually. I know I probably sound mean but I’m fastidious about my boundaries.

233,"tw / abuse? suicidal thoughts?

(this is just me venting because i have no one else to vent to, it probably doesn’t make sense so if you don’t like what i have to say then just scroll ahead)

i’d say from when i was 13 or 14 i’ve felt like this (now i’m 17.) like i have never got anyone to talk to or anything. my mum is horrible &amp; doesn’t like to hear me out or take in anything i have to say. my sister has never liked me or accepted me (she literally has said since she was 9 &amp; i was 7 that she disowned me &amp; never liked me.) my dad is violent &amp; doesn’t bother to spend anytime with me or try to be nice to me. because i’m black &amp; lgbt no one ever really liked me in my all white highschool so i would just tag along so i wouldn’t feel so lonely as i do right now. like i hate being lonely, i don’t know how to make meaningful friendships or actually get close to people i just don’t understand, i’m not bad at talking to new people (i do get a little nervous) but i never focus the conversation about myself, i never talk over anyone else &amp; i don’t make people uncomfortable so i don’t know what to do. like i feel so so lonely &amp; suffocated all the time i try and make friends now but they never last because we drift and i hate it i really hate it. i don’t know what to do bc i’m just so scared &amp; sad all the time and i feel so scared and anxious like i’m going to die &amp; then i feel so good about myself for a week and it all comes crashing down. i have two people i talk to but i don’t know how to get to know them. i feel so scared &amp; overwhelmed i don’t know what to do. and then everyone at my sixth form (british college) already has friends &amp; because of covid no one is allowed to stay in school apart from classes and in class there’s no time to talk, and in class we sit in single desks with no one to talk to so i hate going into college bc i just sit by myself. like this isn’t a pity post i’m not perfect i have been rude and i’m not the most controlled person ever by i don’t know why i cant make friends like i just find it so hard and i don’t know what i’m doing wrong. i know a lot of people probably haven’t had friends since they where 13 but i just don’t know what to do. what triggered this post is that my sister got into a physical fight then she started shouting at me and then i mum &amp; dad sided with her when she started it and then they where like you’re a terrible person you’re abusive when all i did was defend myself. i hate my sister she’s a sick cunt and she’s so horrible. she’s always treated me badly but now that i do the same things and say the same worse things she’s always said to me i’m the bad one. like my mum and dad really hate me there’s no love for and i hate it bc i don’t deserve this like we’re supposed to be a family but all my dad does is be violent and ignore us &amp; my mum doesn’t listen to me so what do i do. i just wish i could be normal and get out of this house and have friends and i really want is friends, to be good &amp; happy and i really try but i’m never good enough and i just thought about od’ing again but i didn’t for some reason and now i’m just in my room venting to you guys bc i have no one else. thanks if you read this.",28Dec2020,1

235,"It's almost as if I never want anything good that's happening to end. For a bit of context, I'm a fairly obsessive perfectionist (literally everything has to be perfect otherwise I get annoyed), online personality tests always tend to describe me as INFJ-T (the ""T"" being turbulent). I know being a perfectionist/having such traits isn't too uncommon. I wonder if the issue in the title is related to my turbulent traits.

So, say I get a video game for Christmas. When I want to play it, I obsessively stop myself from playing it because I ""don't want to complete it too soon, I want the experience of playing this game to last"" to the point where I actually don't play it that much. Or, if I get sweets or chocolate, I excessively stop myself from eating them because I want them to last a long time. It's good for my physical health, I suppose, but it's very annoying and is basically some kind of mental obsession. The only other times I delay things is over anxiety, but that's different and I probably don't need to explain that.

I never used to be like this as a child. Heck, I never used to have any of these turbulent/perfectionist traits or any of this obsessive behaviour at all. It all started developing in my teenage years and I'm not sure why. There's no stimuli that could've caused it that I know.",28Dec2020,1
236,"Well hello. I am a 23/m and I have a problem. I can't fit in the world. I bet you thought a lonely, introvert man sitting in dark, right? Well, no. On the contrary I am a very talkative and extrovertish person. It really depends on my mood but I am mostly the center of attention almost anywhere. I can use words effective and I have a pretty good sense of humor. So you thinking what the heck are you talking about? 

The problem starts here. Since I did not get much love from my family, I have always craved for people's attention. And by people I mean every people. Even the ones that I hate, I want them to love me, admire me and so. So in time I developed personality mirroring, and manipulative behavior. Also I became pretty good at reading people. I avoided conflict by all means and did not share my real perspective most of the time. I was sort of like a yes man. Most of the times I reduced or hid my intelligence and knowledge because I didn't wanna see intimidating. I let people go over me for a lot of times just for their love. 

And growing up I became a mask man. I put on a different mask for each and every person in my life. It got to the point that I started to ask myself, who are you really? Which mask is your character. At nights I believed that I simply don't have a character and masks were all that I have. Yeah this pretty much how my life went. 

Then came the outbursts. I didn't know why they happen or what triggers them but the hate started to grow in me. I started to get angry at anything even the simplest mistakes. I got angry with people I love for nothing most of the time. And in time I discovered that I hate everybody. I hate their life styles, I hate their talks, their faces, their unnecessary confidence, their empty words, their egos etc. That's when I discover that I can't fit in. I can't fit in this world unless I wear a mask. The problem is I don't wanna wear a mask anymore. I am so sick of the things way they are. The world's order.

Now I have a job opportunity. I am waiting them to inform me whether I got the job or not. And everybody around me thinks I am so excited about this job and I will be very happy if I got it and all but the truth is, I don't know if I want the job. I don't know if I want anything at all. I don't know where I'm going. And I assure you, I was an idealistic man with a real, possible and bright future plan. And now I'm starting to think that those plans were actually a mask too. I think that I am all those masks and nothing more. There is nothing real about me and I am just a mix of the reflection of people around me. 

So... what I'm saying, is there anyone here have this same experience. And what are your suggestions for me to fit in or find my path or discover the real me -if there is one behind all these masks.

237,"Been lifting weights all year. I’ve been eating clean and healthy, gaining and losing weight at healthy rates. I had a healthy sex drive and a lot of energy. 

Stopping eating was the first thing I noticed. My appetite has been nonexistent and I’ve lost 10lbs this month and a lot of it was muscle - very unhealthy. Then I lost my sex drive and stopped lifting weights. I can’t hold an erection for more than a minute, I have no interest in women. 

The reason I think it could be testosterone is these fucking hot flashes that I’ve been getting for 3 months or so now. My back and forehead just feel like they get really flush and hot but it’s more uncomfortable than anything, I assume these are what hot flashes are.",28Dec2020,1

I have had my parents and therapists alike who have tried to give me advice on how to change my attitude. Saying things such as looking at situations from a 360 degree view or reading self help books. Exercise, diet, etc etc. But after hearing this stuff for 10+ years and keeping on trying to change my outlook. I still find myself not being able to have a consistent positive attitude.

242,"This is a problem I’ve been dealing with for years. I feel like my dad doesn’t understand mental health and what positively/negatively impacts it. I’ve had many discussions with him about it and he doesn’t listen to me. My sad is too “corporate” to listen. It’s like he doesn’t make an effort anymore. 

I’m going to college in the fall and I have a girlfriend of over a year. She’s a grade younger than me so, we’ve been practicing alone time so when I go to college, it doesn’t hit as hard. 

Recently he told me that we need to hang out less. This is like the third time he’s done this. Every time he says it, we make a plan and “schedule” for hanging out less. Every time, there comes a point where we go back to hanging out more often. 

I’ve tried to explain to him that sometimes, we need to see each other for our mental health: like if we had a bad day/stressed out etc. I’ve also told him that we have separation anxiety (hers is worst then mine) and we both have on own mental health problems. He never listens and make stupid statements that make me feel small. 

I’m excited to go to college to get away from my family; I still feel like a puppet. I feel like I can’t make decisions on my own; and all the conversations I’ve had with my girlfriend (before he talked about it) just didn’t happen. I feel so controlled. 


I fucking hate it here.",28Dec2020,1
243,"Don't expect any help tbh. But it's the first step to change I guess. Anyway... This is what I am going through and how it affects everyone around me: 

I have terrible memory. 

I literally sometimes forget the topic of conversation I'm involved in. I forget to do simple errands that were given to me literally minutes or seconds ago. 

My mind won't shut off. I'm always ""involuntary thinking"" 

I have pretty much self diagnosed myself with maladaptive daydreams. I can't go a few minutes without me losing myself in my own world's I think up. It's a blessing as I'm in the begining stages of a creative industry career, but I can't put it to the side. It's like it's turned on without an off switch. 
Also a weird thing but if I try to shut my brain off as I sleep, I snore SUPER LOUD and twisty like a rabid anima, bit not if I continue thinking stuff up.
(Hypnic jerks?) 

I speak without thinking and can't take the reproductions after doing so. If I accidentally insult someone I'm in bits, I apologize and say everything I can to try make things better. But I always end up crying like a psycho baby and ""play the victim"" of my own actions. 
Basically I can't take criticism to my character and break down.

I suffered undiagnosed depression when I was a child. 

I tried killing myself twice, but never looked for help as I thought it was all me and everyone else was perfect. 
Today I realized I still have this mindset. I think I'm as low as a salted slug on a bed of smelly fresh dog shit. I know this can't be true, but my mind keeps telling me this regardless of common sense. 

I always have a meltdown moment when someone else is deserving the attention or its an important occasion. 

Such as a birthday, Christmas, an operation looming where I have to try and be on my best behaviour and calm the person going for the op. I always end up screwing things up. I say something I didn't mean, I do something unintentionally stupid or I make a mess of plans. 

When in a situation that I need to answer I find myself asking ""what would a normal person do?"" Or ""How would a normal person act?"" 
Usually whatever I do is wrong anyway. 

And last of all... I just hate myself. I feel like everyone around me would be better off if I was someone else. My mum, my cats who means the world to me... I find myself thinking I could have been a better person for them, but I'm just not. I have so many flaws that hurt them all I just feel like if I suddenly was someone else everything would be perfect. 

I hate myself for not being perfect for them. 

That's about it. Does any of this point me to a direction I can seek help for? Do I have signs of certain health issues?

Thanks. Please respond if you can, right now I'm sat alone in the dark crying my eyes out and want to change.",28Dec2020,1

248,"Hi, I have a serious problem.

Since  I was young I was raised up only by my mother since my father never lived with us. There were only my sister, my mother and me.

During my childhood I shared almost everything and every my thought or opinion with my mother, and I thought it was healthy, or rather, I didn't ask that myself, I was too young.

But yet, I started feeling an uncomfy feeling every time I thought my mother didn't understand my thoughts or had different thoughts on something, and then I even been getting upset about that, to my mother, trying to make her understand my thoughts.

When my mother did something wrong that I knew it was so, I really felt an uncomfy feeling inside me and I cannot explain this feeling very well, maybe I'm short on words, or there aren't.

I started literally feeling like my mind was connected to my mother's, but I didn't notice it, because still, I was too young. With that I mean that I couldn't consider my thoughts as ""actual thoughts"" as long as my mother didn't understand them, too. So I had my own opinions on things but if my mother didn't, I felt kind of uncomfy and felt my opinions really weak.

When I grew up I didn't get upset anymore to my mother for that, understanding the situation, but still, although I understood that, I still feel exactly the same feeling as when I was younger, it's like my mind is connected to her's and this is a very bad feeling, it gets toxic and I want to get rid of it.

My mother's mind is kind of, I think, - weak - on certain things, as well, and when that happens, I can just fall down with that despite my logical thinking tells me that it isn't the right direction to go.

She gets angry on light things pretty often and I should keep up with my own conscious that tells me not to get upset, but my mind does.

I'm male and I'm 20, I want to find a job, trying to stay away from all this, but I know that this is more likely useless if I haven't solved the problem in my own mind first. I want to understand that I have my own mind and my own thoughts. I cannot explain how does that feel like but it makes your mind really weak, It's like my deep myself doesn't see the world without my mother and this is not a good thing.",28Dec2020,1

I had a look online, and it seems there is a definite link between carbon monoxide poisoning and autism in kids, but I can't find anything about it causing autism to develop in adults.

253,"So we are still in quarantine (Greece) but since it's Christmas we are allowed to visit friends, family etc. 
We gather at my friends house Ally's (not real name for obvious reasons), around 8-9 people, no parents, just 17 year olds.
We get on getting some drinks, most of us were a little drunk or high, still having fun tho.
A little backstory: Ally, the girl whose house we went to, has been having several panic attacks and weird mood changes the past year, we don't know exactly why, neither does she, we just assumed it's the regular high school/exams whatever anxiety type of thing. Keep in mind that she has admitted to some of us about selfharming, getting tattoos ""to prevent her from cutting"" and things like that. 

Another girl in the group is Mary, she has depression, definitely not going well, she is seeing a psychiatrist and is on meds, is self harming too and suicidal for some months now, never has tried to go further tho (as far as we know)

So both of the girls were drunk, at some point they left us and went somewhere alone, we didnt really think anything about it, we are a big group and this happens a lot. 

After a while I entered the room they were in for some reason and Mary was crying, pretty regular, i stayed a little with them, trying to comfort her etc, but then left again.

Some time later, the girls still alone, Ally's boyfriend who went to check on them comes to us shocked, just tell us someone go stay with Mary. I go, find her in the bathroom sitting on the toilet, crying as if she was dying, she started hitting me, screaming, as if she went crazy. Later on she told she was in the bathroom with Ally, both crying, they found razors, and they were ready to cut their veins and then Ally's boyfriend found them and stopped it. 

I don't know how far true this is, but Ally's boyfriend DID find them in the bathroom with razors in their hands, and Mary is a really honest person, she would never lie about a situation this serious.

There isn't much more to the story, we just spent the rest of the night shocked, everyone is trying to calm down the girls and asking ourselves what we now have to do.

And that's what im asking, what are we supposed to do as their friends? Their parents are literally in their own worlds, and their mental health is going from bad to worse. We don't know how to handle situations like this and nobody teaches these things at school. How are we supposed to help our firends? They are in danger 
Also it seems as if they are having bad influence to each other, the have told us themselves that they relate on things others can't relate to, some time ago they were even working on some ""Anorexia Project"" type of shit and were congratulating themselves on not eating for days or i don't know what.
Do i have to tell our other friends that weren't there that night what happened, or is it just gonna make things worse?

I experienced with purging in high school but ended up going on extremely restrictive diets (eating only 1 bag of trail mix, a diet soda, and maybe one small entree a day and working on my feet every day after school for 5 hours). Very very unhealthy, I know. I got down to 113 lbs back then (I'm 5'2"") but when I joined the army I shot up to the 130s.

There really is a misconception about what people with eating disorders look like. It doesn't always make you skinny, and in my case I think it's the reason for my weight gain.

Compound that with being a female in the infantry. I feel an insane pressure to be perfect all the time, because it always feels like all the guys expect me to fail. Our training cycle is insane, we are always in the field, and I wear about 5 different hats via additional duties. I am constantly stressed and battle with really bad anxiety disorder. It's on my medical record but I try so hard to keep it hidden from people at work and stay deployable, so I got off my meds for it. I know this is no excuse, but it severely triggers a desire in me to binge and purge, and I've been trying so hard to quit. I get a craving to eat all this comfort food, feel guilty, and throw it up right after. And it's a fucked up way of dealing with stress but it feels like the most effective thing sometimes.

I just want to be able to meet my goal weight and overcome this eating disorder so bad. I know the 2 goals seem incompatible, but I really really need to overcome one to overcome the other, in either order. Any help? 

Also please do not recommend therapy because right now with my insurance that would be through the Army's Behavioral Health and go on my record (which they say is confidential but every time they have told my COs my embarrassing and private mental battles). Then it makes me non-deployable. Trust me, it's happened to me in the past. The COs view it as a weakness and it just makes life at work 5x worse than it was before.",28Dec2020,1

I have had bad anxiety with panic attacks ever since I was 14 and it has worsened throughout my life up until now. I was made redundant in March due to COVID-19 and my mental health has plummeted. I have only left the house five times since March due to developing extreme agoraphobia.


Since early November I have been experiencing hearing whispering voices around me, although their voices are indecipherable and I cannot make out what they are saying. It gets very bad and loud, like they're screeching at me when I get distressed or upset - particularly when I am not given a definite answer or plans change. I find it increasingly hard to focus on anything, even hobbies I used to enjoy or something simple like listening to a family member speak.


I have made my own fantasy world and have withdrawn there, to the point where other family members have accused me of ignoring them. I prefer to be in the world I create as I am happy there.

270,"So I have been suppressing stuff that has happened to me in the military so I dont know if I should post here or in r/Veterans but this past Monday, I opened the can just to finally come to terms with what happened. Now, I while I blame myself for allowing most of this to happen I know that I shouldn't blame myself because I am slightly different than I was back then. 

So I guess I should start here, I enlisted in 08 got the lovely career working on aircraft, which I did enjoy. Basic and Tech school(where we learn the job) were fine, the biggest issue was my duty station. Now at the time I was fresh out of high school, young, dumb but willing to learn, and lastly naive, which made me the perfect target.  At first it was simple hazing with the most extreme of it was convincing me to drink stagnant water from a duct we just took out of the jet, looking back on that I shouldn't have caved so easily for that. Then it got worse, I became the 'official' designated driver for my Sgt who went out almost every weekend, while some might argue I could refuse, shit rolls down hill in the military, it was known that he had asked me and I said maybe, never giving a yes or a no, so if my Sgt got drunk and drove, I could be punished as well. Not only that but my performance reports were used as leverage against me, so every weekend that he wanted to get shit faced, I was driving and had no say when we left.

This escalated when they found out that I had yet known the embrace of a woman, so it became his personal goal to see that happen whether I was wanting it to happen or not. I became his 'wing man', bait used so he could score and free entertainment as I was put in situations I did not like. I don't blame the women nor will I ever, I blame that scumbag who I feel is a disgrace to the uniform. It would get much worse as the bastard 'attempted' to hire Lady's of the evening, some being females he knew from work who were in on it. I went along with it, unwillingly just to shut them up about my virginity, nothing ever  happened through that. Looking back on it now, I should have gone to someone for help but I was afraid that I would become a target for much worse things, I was afraid that I would get told to man up and that it was normal and I should be thankful.

272,"Hello, this is my first time posting to this subreddit, so bear with me 

I have been to therapy before when I was still in high school, but I didn't like the therapist at the time and it was difficult to open up with my mother in the room, so I didn't go back and forgot to set up a new appointment. Now, I am an adult and finally set up my own psychiatric appointment (and yes, I know the two are different). This will be my first appointment and I am not sure what to expect/ say and I am really worried about the psychiatrist not meshing well with me. 

I know that I have anxiety as that is what I mostly discussed with my therapist and they also diagnosed me with mild depression (though I don't think that it was just mild, but it doesn't help that I am pretty sure that I didn't fully open up because of my mother's presence). However, I struggle a lot with reminding myself that I actually have anxiety because if I am doing okay for even a moment, I second guess myself. I hate it. I set this appointment up back in late October and have been wondering if it'll even be worth it. The rational side of me knows that it is, especially since my mental health has only gotten worse since the start of my first year of college, but the irrational side wonders if I am ""not ill enough"" (and yes I know that that sounds silly) to go to the psychiatrist at all. 

So, if anyone has any tips on what to do for your first-time psychiatrist appointment, it would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you so much in advance!",28Dec2020,1

Recently, my tics have been getting significantly worse, and I've been getting sadder. Everytime I my room gets messy, my mom goes down this rabbit hole of needing to clean my room, because she thinks that by controlling my room, she can control my emotions. She doesn't want to take me to a doctor, because she doesn't want me diagnosed with anything else. I feel like it's not even about caring about me anymore. I feel like her mental stability revolves around me pretending to be neuro-typical. She recently even found out about my eating disorder, and she hasn't been taking it well. I told her multiple times to leave my room alone, stop buying me things, let me be alone, and she never takes it well. It really affects me. It makes me feel like she didn't have a child keeping in mind that the human mind can be wired differently or malfunction.

Smiling, laughing, crying, being upset … We’re going through a lot of feelings in our daily life, but what if we couldn’t control them!? This is what we call “mental illness” or “mental disorder”.
To analyze this topic, we can spend the whole year or maybe all our life talking about it; mentioning its symptoms, reasons, consequences, and learning self-healing and how to deal with it. But to make it more specific and in brief; let us talk a little bit about the most common mental disease the majority of people suffer from through the world: Depression !!

279,"I made a post yesterday because of family problems but that was really the tip of the iceberg. This month my step-dad and step-uncle both got in a car crash on their way to the store and my uncle (not my step-uncle) got sent to jail and could be facing life in prison because he did some questionable things. 

Ive told my boyfriend of 2 years about all this and have attempted to vent to him or ask what he thinks of the situation and he flat out ignores me or changes the topic. The day my family got in a car crash he immediately made the convo about himself and was complaining about his mother because she got him the wrong Christmas gift. 

We just found out about my uncle getting sent to jail 2 days ago and right now I asked him why he hasn't said anything about it or tried to support me and he tells me that ""Well your uncle deserves it"" or ""You seem fine so whatever"" and I don't disagree that my uncle has done horrible things now and in the past but my boyfriend doesn't even try and comfort me at all. I don't like my uncle but I also am stressed out with the whole situation 

I had to leave my boyfriend today who is technically my ex now because he kept insulting me and saying that what happened this month didn't matter because he's older then me and has experienced more (he only 3 years older then me) and now after I've blocked him he's trying to message me on a different platform to piss me off. He's saying he's going to go have sex with his friend that he has had sexual experiences with before, and he's also going to go and do drugs and get ""high""

i know i should talk to someone about this, i know that’s the right thing to do but i can’t and i don’t know how. i feel as though if i were to tell my friends or family i would be a burden on them and i feel guilty for feeling like this anyway. i know it’s the right thing to do but whenever i almost tell my mum when she asks how i am i just reply i’m fine and the conversation moves on. what makes it worse is that i want to speak to someone so i don’t feel so alone (hence why i’m on here) but i don’t want to be a nuisance and add to the list of things that’s wrong with me.

283,"Not too long ago I got into an agreement with my sister-in-law and things just took a turn for the worst. Of course, being the anxious person that I am, I feel as though everyone in the family knows about it considering that no one’s reached out. Not that I blame them, my husband’s on deployment and I’ve just been stuck in such a rut to want to engage. We both were in the wrong in someway and it’s made me so uncomfortable to even want to get close to them now. 
I feel like she always tries to “play the hero” when I try to open up a little. I was told by hubby, i could trust her with anything. Instead, she makes me feel like I’m afraid of the world or that it’s my fault I cant be happy. Such as, “Do you want to be sad forever?”, “you need to have faith.”, “you need to face your demons.”, “what’s going to make you happy??”, “just because you feel sad, doesn’t mean you push family away. I have depression too and I don’t do that.”, “you pushed me away!”. 
Every single time we talk, I feel as if I’m being constantly guilt tripped by my own feelings and all this started because of an dumb invitation to go home for the holidays. I said no because of Covid. She tried to de-bunk it, I tried to decline politely. She tried to use the, “but your husband would love for you to come!” of course, I started to get angry, but in the back of my head i kept thinking, don’t fight. She’s your husband’s sister, he’ll be upset if you do. (Which surprisingly he didn’t.)
But she went on and on about how I’m afraid of the world and I how won’t live if I’m afraid of everything. I tried to explain how we’re just different. My mind works differently than hers. I get what she’s doing, (at this point I’m just trying to let her win but i still want to stand up for myself.) but it’s not helping. In the end, she ended it with, “i know what it’s like, I have depression, i had postpartum dep, i had cancer, i this, i that.” And it made me realize, “oh. I forgot, other people have it worse so I don’t deserve to feel this way.” In the end, I apologized and begged for her to stop. She combats with, “why are you so rude to me?” I emailed my husband and said, “please tell your sister to leave me alone. I’m shutting down for the night.” I ended up ruminating and trying not to fall into a “dark pit”. Now all i can think about it is “Am I rude?, Do I deserve to feel what I feel? Am i problematic? My mom is right, I can’t talk to anyone with out getting emotional.”
I was also informed by my husband that, “She feels terrible and she thinks she’s ruined the relationship you both have, but she was also being pushy about it all.” (Honestly, i know he was just trying to stay out of this. I don’t blame him. It’s sister vs wife.)  
I know right now, I just needed time away from everyone, I’m not sure how long but i just know it was going to be the best option, because i don’t know if what I’m feeling is valid.
About a few weeks ago, I received a gift from my mother-in-law. A religious book of “Letting go”. 
I’m not a firm believer, but i can’t say i don’t believe either because of how i was raised. I’m just somewhere in between i guess, but i found this somehow so offensive to me and its been bugging me. Was this my Christmas gift? Is my sister in law still upset that “I’m pushing her away” when I just want to be alone? Who else knows? 
The worst part that i can visualize it her words, “no matter how much you shove me away, I’m always going to be there for you.” I don’t want her to. Theres little things i think I’m missing but this is basically the context of it all. 
I don’t know, i guess i just needed to let it out or have another person’s opinion in all this. Maybe &amp; hopefully, the reoccurring thoughts will stop. Should I try to make amends even though i feel like they look at me differently now? Is what I’m feeling wrong? If she tries to play hero again, how can I just get her to stop with out being “rude” about it? 

I’ll probably chicken out and delete this later.

287,"
Before you start, this is quite a long read. You don’t have to read it all or read it at all, but I’d appreciate it if you did. I just needed to write this down. I wanted to see if people felt similarly to me. I’m 16M btw. Have a good day.

Every time I go to sleep, I feel bad. During the day, it’s not as bad, but it’s still bad. Of course, I have some good days, everyone does, but most of my days, I just go on with things, which used to mean either being alone watching online classes for six hours straight and then doing 3 hours of homework or being in school with my class, which really was the highlights of my weeks, but which was most of the time just two days per week, which isn’t enough.

Now it’s Christmas, hurray! Christmas vacation never felt so goddamn bad. Now I just spend my days in the house (in my room should I say), trying to kill as much time as I can, playing video games most of the time, waiting for I don’t fucking know what to happen.

So as I said, every single night, lying in bed, i feel really bad and I can’t properly fall asleep. I just lie there and I keep thinking about how my life could be instead of this lonely shit. How it would be if i could have spent my last year of high school (where I’m from there’s only five years to high school) with people. I was never really strong on the social side, but I was starting to get around, I was managing the social stuff better than I had managed it in a long time and I was starting to really enjoy it until the world brought it all to a halt. 

Since we are kids, we’re conditioned, in movies or in TV shows, to see high school as this magical place, a place where people live stuff, go wild, get girlfriends, and throw parties all the time. Nope. Not at all. At least not  for me and probably not for the majority of teens. If lockdown hadn’t been a thing, would I be living all that? Maybe, I don’t fuckin know, at least some of it, but right now I’m not living any of it. As my high school years went by, I kept saying to myself: “Oh, next year, next time, I’ll get it. My social life will get better, I’ll get a girlfriend and I’ll go to those parties they keep showing on TV with my friends! YEAH, FUCK YEAH, HIGH SCHOOL BABY!” Delusion. Now, there is no next year. High school will be over in about six months and this isolation is not going to end anytime soon.  I can’t stand the feeling of missing out, it’s awful. Oh, and you know what else they tell us? They keep saying: “These are the best years in your lives, enjoy it while it lasts.” and some more shit like that. I might not know on how much I’m really missing out on, but i know that I’m missing out, because anything would be better than right now and I just know that me and my friends would have done some stuff at least. I try not to show it, but I’m a little insecure socially, so this missing out feeling is killing me. That and the fact that I don’t know for how long this isolation will last and I have no idea how much of my teenage life I could have had will be thrown to waste. Not knowing all that is unbearable for me.

So there’s me, at two AM, lying in bed, trying to fall asleep or in my dreams, those are the times where I see or imagine myself, hanging out with friends, experiencing the high school life we were told about or just experiencing life, having a girlfriend who loves me, having people around me who appreciate me, you know, the good shit, what life is supposed to be about. From the stuff listed above, I’ve only really experienced the hanging with friends part. Last night, before falling asleep, I imagined myself on a couch, watching TV with a girl who loved me and that I loved. I a had my hand in her hair and we were just happy and in love. I imagined it to be the best thing ever. What else can a boy ask for? What else is there to want? I sometimes intentionally or unintentionally make such scenarios in my head. I don’t know if they really help me feel any better, but the way I see it, they can’t hurt. This loneliness man... it feels so painful. It’s the feeling of missing out, the feeling of powerlessness, of isolation, of sadness, you know, the bad shit I dread all day. I’m truly powerless, because there’s nothing I can really do to help this loneliness, I’m not in control of the amount of people I can see, a fucking virus is. What can I do then?

Every time I wake up from my dreams (which are almost always better than my actual life), I feel as bad as I did before falling asleep. That’s not to mention how I sometimes tell myself, late when I’m tired: “I got this. Tomorrow I’ll play less video games, I’ll get my sleep schedule in order, I’ll go back to practising guitar(I’ve been playing for 3 years btw, and my motivation to play has been going down lately)”, but the next morning, first thing I do is eat breakfast and play video games all fucking day. Then when night time comes, I feel even more powerless. How powerless am I if I can’t even control what I choose to do with my days of vacation? Am I not in control? Can I even chose what I want to do or is it my unconscious mind who will force me to play video games all day (I’m not making excuses it really feels like that)?

And right there, lying in bed, I wanna cry, but I don’t, I keep fighting it. My way of seeing things is that if I cry, then I’ll get really sad or depressed and it will only make things worse for everyone, and that, I can be certain of. I figured, just like that, that if I stay in a certain state similar to denial in front of these bad feelings I mentioned earlier, then they can’t and won’t hurt me. “So don’t think about them and they’ll just pass by and disappear eventually”, I recall telling myself something similar at the start of this pandemic, or at least when the lockdown started for me. This isolation I’ve been experiencing for what is soon to be a full year is lasting, and lasting longer than I could have thought. And this sort of denial strategy, I feel like, isn’t going to help me for much longer. Why fight the feelings? They are there, and it seems like they are here to stay, why ignore them or face them with some form of denial? Is it okay to give up and let them in? Depression (not depression, but maybe more like feeling really sad) is a problem, it’s curable, you can get help. Therefore I don’t want to get that kinda shit in me. Is it ok for me to feel sad and lonely? I don’t think so, cause I’ve felt like this and it’s bad. But on the other hand, is it ok for me to push most of my feelings and thoughts away and tuck them in corner and every night, when they come back, try for an hour or two to ignore them long enough to fall asleep without thinking about them in an effort to not feel. How does a person truly feel anyway? How the person wants to feel or how the person’s mind feels. If someone has such thoughts and feelings, can she even deny them or pretend that she doesn’t feel that way? This led to me sometimes feeling sort of dead inside, not all the time, but i sometimes feel like I’m just walking around, going on with my day, trying not to feel stuff. Ignoring most of my feelings sometimes leaves me feeling like I’m a zombie, walking around not mindlessly, but emotionlessly. Who am I even if I can’t be with friends? Who the fuck am I anyway? I’m just a 16 year old boy going on with his days, which his life, getting meaningless good grades and playing video games. That’s what my life has been like for a few months now. This summer it wasn’t as bad, but now it’s to being lonely all the time. Is this living? What defines who a person is? Who he’s with? What he does? What he thinks? I don’t like what I think or feel, I don’t like what i do with my days and I don’t hang out with friends anymore. I don’t dislike myself, far from that, but how can I even know anything if I can’ know who I am. I heard this song called “True Love Waits” which said: “I’m not living, I’m just killing time”. This hit hard. I’m wasting my time right now, and a lot of it, and there is NOTHING I can do except wait for life to go back to normal who ever the fuck knows when and push away the feelings I don’t like.

I am alone. That’s a fact (family doesn’t count and you know it) Can I give up to loneliness? Can i ignore my loneliness? I don’t fucking know anymore.

I could keep writing for another thousand words, but I think you get the idea. I’m not delusional, I can’t still think rationally. I can see that if I feel this way, some people, teenagers or not, must feel the same and some must feel way worse than me. And I can’t imagine the mental state of someone who’s more unstable than me right now. This isn’t a call for help. I’m not suicidal, not in a thousand years. I just felt like if I wrote stuff down and shared it, y’all could, I don’t know, read it? and I could see if other people felt like this, or had similar experiences with dealing with their thoughts,

I miss even going to school two days per week. I miss meeting up with friends in the summer. I miss the time where I could see people face and not a fucking mask with eyes above it. I miss everything. I miss life, because this isn’t living.",28Dec2020,1

289,"Hey all,

I don't know what to do or how to get through this so I'm just going to text bomb for a second. I've had depression since I was 13 (25 now) and anxiety since I was in elementary school. I've always had trouble going to school or work. My illnesses, even when medicated, keep me from functioning. I've been in trouble at every job for attendance due to how many breakdowns and panic attacks I have. I just cannot function in a 40 hour work week. Even part time is hard. I spend every moment I'm not at work being anxious about work. The only job I've ever been able to do and have been happy doing is one that I lost in August due to it being a temporary position. They had the chance to hire me on for longer but chose not to, and that sent me into a spiral that I still haven't begun to recover from.

 I spend every moment that I'm not anxious thinking about killing myself. I have no self esteem or confidence. I feel fat and disgusting and unlovable and like I'm a lunatic. I feel lazy. I feel like I'm just not trying hard enough. I don't think I deserve anything. I've never tried therapy but I think it'd be a good idea, but I'm about to lose my insurance and I'm scared of that change. I'm scared of being able to afford mental health services once I'm completely on my own. 

I'm just so lost. I want to be able to function and be happy. I want to be a normal adult.",28Dec2020,1
290,"Just as the title states. I'm pretty sure i fell in love with a girl who has Borderline Personality Disorder, on top of that she is documented Alcoholic which makes it even more problematic for both of us.

It's gonna be quite a long story and probably just as chaotic but I've finally decided i need at least second opinion how i can help her best.

She is 21 and I'm 26. She caught my eye long time ago but i was too shy to confront her about it. We're working together (or were in the case of global pandemic - we're all working from home now) and somehow we started talking to each other around start of November and connecting closer over Facebook messenger and such, it was lovely, she was quite the talker i was quite the listener and after sometime we decided to meet outside of work for a simple walk, i remember her being nervous about it - we talked about this and she claims she's always nervous when meeting new people, especially men - understandable, due to her illness i respect and understand that, all the more joyous I've been when we finally starting seeing each other on semi-regular basis outside of work. We've both been open to each other from the get go, really, really open. The stories of her abuse she told me, half of them are enough to be too much for a single person. She's been raped when not being able to lift a finger, she has been abused sexually by her past partners and i think the darkest story she told me is about coming back to her rapist house simply because he had a wine. She claims she never wants to be in the place she's been before and i do believe her. I believe her dark past is behind her but she cannot forget, how could she? I personally think it's better she remembers how scary and dark place that is, she will never want to go back to previous behaviors. She's never done drugs from what she told me and i haven't seen her doing any. Obviously she has her mood swing as people with Borderline Personality disorder tend to have, this i have accepted as well, i understand that she sometimes does snap and say things she doesn't truly mean, i could handle it. Back to the topic of us hanging outside of work and on weekends - when we started hanging out she told me about a promise she made to her friend that she will stay away from alcohol until at least Christmas, she snapped around start of December if i remember correctly, starting with just a single beer (i say just but i know whether it's alcohol for alcoholic the amount does not matter). I've been reading about Borderline Personality Disorder just so i can understand and be better at supporting her along the way and i know i shouldn't be judgmental about her behavior and decisions (whether it's bad or good, i know it's not a solution to anything and i told her just that). I told her that i'm there for her, whenever she wants to talk about literally anything, i'll listen, i told her that i might not have all the answers she needs but i will try me best to be supportive in the best way i know how and i mean that. She had and probably still has difficult time believing me and again, i can't blame her given her past stories, she's been abused, used against her will, probably lots and lots of broken promises by the people around her. She often says ""Whatever, people come and go all the time, you're no different do whatever you want"" and I've told her countless times that supporting her is what i **want** to do and what i will try to do. She hates promises which again, is understandable - probably so many broken promises made her aware not to let herself get hurt by another broken promise. After her first alcoholic drink we've been meeting each other as regular, she invited me over to her house where she lives with her (male) friend that supposedly cares for her (makes her food, reminds her about drinking water etc. simple things really). I invited her to mine, just for such a ""stupid"" activities as decorating the Christmas tree (she was so excited about it). We've got more intimate with our relationship - kissing, touching each other, snuggling, hugging etc. And i feel like she trust me a little bit more and actually wants me to be there for her, but the very next day when i invite her over she text me while supposedly being just by my house (for the 2nd time): ""I'm lost"" ""I think i'll go home"" to which i replied ""Wait, i'm coming outside for you"" to which i got ""Do whatever you wanna do"" and i was so confused not knowing what happened - i did walk outside but haven't seen her anywhere. I talked to her about it and she explained me she had extreme anxiety attack, that she felt like a trash. So i explained to her another time that she doesn't have to feel bad about it, i understand, i'm not there to hurt her in anyway, sometime passes and she claim she calmed down a bit and that she ""even had her makeup and hair done"" and i didn't know what to think about it. I asked her whether she wants me to go or stay with her because getting an answer would actually help us both, right? All i got was ""I don't know, i don't want you to go, i don't want to stay - i'm tried when keeping close contact with anyone"". I just don't know how to interpret this, what's the best course of action i should take right now so i can help us both?

&amp;#x200B;

That's for couple of odd situation with her, but i can see her fighting inside, not giving up, i can see the sparkle of light. She's very lovable person, she's passionate about multiple things - comic books for once, she's extremely passionate about Batman, she's great painter I've seen her works, they really are breathtaking, she's beautiful (i tell her that very often, but she tells me she feels ugly and doesn't believe my honest complements)

&amp;#x200B;

She attended therapy for a long time (4 years if i remember correctly) but now due to Covid pandemic she tells me face-to-face meetings with her trusted therapist aren't a thing and she cannot open herself through phone line like that.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what do i do with all this... I really, really fell for her and want to be as supportive as i can get but i simply need some advice how to proceed. What can i do to help her? Ask me anything if it will make more sense, i'm just really helpless right now with the whole situation. I feel like i did everything i could but it's still not enough.

I'm really sorry this post is very lengthy and chaotic, this is what's been on my mind for couple of weeks now, i know reddit is not the best place to seek advice but i wonder if any of you good souls can guide me in the right direction?",28Dec2020,1

294,"I have been told by multiple professionals, and mostly recently and annoyingly by my partner, that I should ""deal"" with my emotions instead of avoiding them. This comes, primarily, from me actively avoiding things that give me feels: from watching Homeward Bound *(I know Shadow will make it, but I cry every fucking time)* to looking at pretty much anything from my past *(which I recently boxed up and just shoved under the house, because who needs that stress?)* I had a happy childhood, followed by a turbulent adolescence, and a generally haunted adult life. I keep things so I remember, but I also box those things up and toss them under the house to only torment me if I end up down there.

I have no idea what it means to ""deal"" with an emotion. I've asked people... and I get weird responses like ""be aware of what you're feeling."" I am aware of what I'm feeling, which is why I made the choice to box the whole experience up and push it down into a little ball that probably give me cancer one day *(fun fact, already had that twice, so the little ball totally works)*.

So, what do they want me to do? What qualifies as dealing? Do I need to sit with all the shit that reminds me of everything and just cry? Cuz I've done that, and I still cry. Do they want me to harness the anger and sadness and try to use it as a motivator? Cuz it doesn't work, and that's why I now take a giant handful of pills for my sanity everyday. Do they just want me to get rid of my ""keep but never look at"" items? Cuz I feel like that's just avoidance on a grander scale.

295,"Hello everyone. I don't want to bore you with details, so i'll put a TL;DR version first, but i would be grateful if you read the whole thing and give me a proper answer or real advice.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TL;DR: I find this world we live in extremely boring, cruel and stupid; i want to live in a fantasy world. This sometimes causes me to be unable to function. I want to know if this is a mental illness or not.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm a 24 year old university student that had struggled with severe depression for years, but for the last couple years i've been better. I don't feel perfect, but i don't want to kill myself (most of the time). I think depression had an effect on my current situation, but i'm not sure. Also i'm an empath, i feel whatever emotions other people feel, usually almost as strong as them (even if that person is just a movie character).

I have loved reading books / watching movies about adventure and/or fantasy related topics since my childhood. I would get immersed in those worlds, and i would feel strong emotions. I don't really show emotions normally (probably because of the isolation caused by the past depression), but i could easily cry if i'm watching something emotional. I stopped reading books in high school after becoming disinterested in life in general because of the depression. But i kept watching movies / TV series and i still get extremely involved with the world those characters live in. 

Now that you know a little bit about me, let me try to describe my feelings. I'm not really good at describing things, but i will try to do my best.

I'm quite sure most people get immersed with high quality movies, but as i said i'm an empath and i feel the emotions those characters feel just like them, get extremely attached to that world and i have a hard time severing that connection after the movie/series ends.  I find this world we live in boring and stupid. I want to live in the world of that movie/series, even if it's a dangerous place. I just can't stand this world's pointlessness. I want to live in those weird worlds, be it a medieval war torn land or a magical realm. These feelings cause me to get disassociated from the world, and i stop being functional. I lose interest in everything, i can't get motivated to do the stuff i have to do (like homework), i feel like the depression i had in the past comes back and tries to pull me down. 

I hope i was able to describe it. The question is the title: ""Is this a mental illness?"". Is it an illness to get extremely attached to other worlds because you hate the one you live in, which causes you to further distance yourself from the real world?",28Dec2020,1
296,"Hi Reddit,

I don’t really know where to start with this. But for context, I have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and C-PTSD. Things have been bad my whole life but this latest depression arc began after my wedding in February.

I was lucky enough to have a wedding before things got bad in the US and it was a beautiful day. But there were so many things that happened that just burrowed into my mind and sucked pretty much every happy memory out of that day, replacing them with moments that, in my mind, confirmed every insecurity about myself and made me convinced that I am an ugly loser and everyone hates me.

In particular, I ostracized all of my college friends after my wedding. The main thing involved these folks leaving early. The wedding ended at 10pm and all of my college friends left in a group around 9. One of them had asked me a few weeks before my wedding if i was going to an “after party” at their Airbnb, on my own wedding night. So I assumed that’s where they went, and I was crushed. I paid for my wedding by myself and went through hell to make it happen. These actions made me think that all of my hard work was for nothing and everything was terrible and therefore I am a terrible person who can’t do anything right. There were a lot of other things too, but I won’t get into them.

So several months later, I thought it would be a good idea to send an email to my college friends explaining how I felt. I essentially accused them of leaving my wedding because they hated it and not being good friends to me. I also went on additional crazy tangents about how ugly and sad I felt on the day, how insecure I am, how I can’t make friends and how the friends I’ve made have always treated me bad, etc. I tried to be careful and not come across as mean or a bridezilla, but I’ve read and re-read it so many times that there are things I wish I did not say. 

One of my friends emailed me and told me she was here to talk when I needed. I emailed her back an even longer letter where I just laid all my shit out on the table. And in her response she told me that everyone left early because they were tired and basically crashed once they got back to their place. She also told me they loved the wedding and thought it was beautiful. I never responded. 


Now I feel so ashamed and like a complete idiot. I don’t know what to do, but I don’t think I could ever show my face to these people ever again. I feel so sad about it every day I can hardly get out of bed. I can’t talk about my wedding without feeling sad and horrible. I’ve been slowly deleting people from my socials because I just want people to forget I exist and not to perceive me anymore. I try not to think about how lonely I’m going to be at the end of my life because of how bad I’m fucking up now, but I can’t seem to stop and I also think I deserve it. I’m just a terrible person and I feel sorry for everyone who has to see me and has seen me and has had to deal with my bullshit. I don’t know what to do. 

Please don’t tell me what I could have done better, I’m well aware and don’t need to feel worse right now.",28Dec2020,1

A complete lack of empathy for others 
Purposely manipulating others 
Feeling much superior to others 
Persistent thoughts of killing( I will 100% not act on so don’t report or anything  but they’re  there if that makes sense )
I’ve always thought that ghosts / Satan have a particular interest in me and are always watching me but recently have had 1-way convos with them  in my head 
Periods of feeling like things are touching me like bugs and crawling all over me 
Social withdrawal

298,"Me, much like a lot of people here are probably here because times are tough or feeling down and online friends help! I just want you all to know things can and will turn around.

When Covid hit my city, I lost my job, lost my freedom and only left the house once a month to get groceries. Spent almost 90 days without any outside interaction.

This taught me a lot about myself; I found depression hit me hard, days felt like weeks and simple tasks became a burden. I honestly never thought I could be affected by a mental illness as I’m generally a happy guy. 

I knew mental illness was real but until I experienced it first hand I never knew just how tragic it can be.

299,"My BIL(21) has been showing signs of some type of mental health spiral for quite some time. It was getting worse though. My husband and I knew he should go to a mental hospital. Several years ago, BIL got diagnosed with like a borderline learning disability, depression, and I think bipolar as well. He has done some hard drugs, refuses to take his medication, stopped seeing his psychiatrist, refuses to get a job, etc. 

I didn't realize how bad it was till he freaked me out on Christmas Eve, just a few days ago. Told my husband and MIL. MIL had been thinking about calling the local facility for a few weeks now and made the call today.

He got picked up a few hours ago. He will be there for three days and then apparently has to be in front of a judge to determine the next step. 

My husband has been upset about this news. He knows it's the right thing but is worried about the future of it all. He said he just wants his little brother back, but I know there is a chance he may never be the same. 

I've kind of prepared myself for ""you can't help someone who doesn't want to help themselves"" and the possibility that BIL will cut everyone off. With the drug use and now hallucinations/voices in his head, I just don't have hope that he will be the same little brother that my husband once had. 

I just really want to know how can I support my husband through this. This kind of help needed for BIL is very new to all of us. Maybe I'm in the wrong subreddit.

300,"At times when I speak the information gets fractured as I'm speaking, so I tend to sound very stupid when I'm talking. My thoughts drift and I have trouble paying attention once I perceive a slight I just fixate intensely on it. It's more frequent when I feel anxious my expressions devolve I speak monosyllabiclly, I become withdrawn and my thoughts become vacant. I think I may have disorganized schizophrenia. My mother has told me that schizophrenia and bipolar syndrome does run in our family and she experienced similar issues when she was younger and put until her late thirties. My emotions are becoming uncontrollable as well. Like I said a perceived slight and the thought takes over my entire mind, I'm on auto pilot the rest of the time until the matter is settled in my mind, and that's good reaction for me. There are times where I get so enraged over nothing or become sick with anxiety, or even so depressed I have to go to the bathroom and cry for a moment. I feel like I'm just staring at the broken pieces of my relationships with people and life all the time. But at the same time the more I notice my flaws and work to improve on them I notice improvement. Which tells me I can't be stupid I see what's happening this can't be a question of intellect, I really think my neurons aren't firing correctly. my facial Expressions are all forced I almost never have a natural reaction anymore. I have feelings i swear I'm not apathetic and I understand what people say. I feel unable to access my subconscious on the spot I feel overcome with anxiety almost any time I speak to anyone even in my own home. And I'm aware that's insane which is the worse part because any time I go to address It everything I say sounds like idiotic rambling because I can't find the words all my thoughts are just a drifting disorganized mess. There are times where I can't even remember what I was saying or thinking just seconds prior. But if I start writing my focus becomes clear and alot of the times and I can fully Express what it is I think. depending on my mood swings which might be what this is. 
I have bouts  of depression which makes me behave in a distracted manner just lost in my head which makes me slow to respond because I'm completely withdrawn during this period and then this leads people too think I'm stupid. 

once my head clears up from being depressed I start to care about what the people around me think again and then I have to deal with the assumptions of stupidity that im unaware of what's around me since my spoken words are unordered thoughts about half the time I'm speaking and then assuming what I say is uninformed rambling from an impotent child. My impulses become hard to control I feel like I'm biting my tongue refraining from saying how I feel or being talked over before I can speak. which causes my thoughts to drift from me once I see that because i can't help but see the interruption as this person doesn't care about what i think or say because they think i have nothing too say. I lose my mental footing and my thoughts collapse and i restrain my anger and sadness. Then I fucking get crazy over the most insignificant things. Tripping over a stick or any unavoidable inconvenience, twisting people's words in my head convincing myself they mean something negative in subtext, and convincing myself that I know exactly how everyone around me thinks or feels.

Then this leads to a feeling of detachment from the world. I feel nothing and only see how empty everything is and I'm waiting for it too end. The image that comes to mind is watching myself in third person die and that's what I fixate on. I'm not sad or angry and I think my facial Expressions are mostly non existent and my energy at this time is gone I only feel tired during this period. During this my outbursts become most frequent but it's all reactionary no real feeling behind it just i guess instinctual rage. I couldn't tell you what's wrong even if I wanted too at his point. But finally after a couple days of that I feel in control. I'm still sad and anxious at times but I feel like myself I can speak clearly as long as I'm not anxious and my thoughts and priorities are clear I know who I am. 

I feel like I can see this clearly because it's just starting. For most males these symptoms occur in there mid 20's but I'm 19 I feel like my mind is burnt out from a traumatic child hood and everying from the time I was 10 and started questioning everything wondering why things are as fucked as they are. I need to know if my symptoms match so maybe I can stop it before I get too bad and completely lose myself.
But right now my sanity is a sliding looking glass and I can only see the world both clearly and healthily when I have a good view. If these symptoms match something other than schizophrenia  I would be relieved more than words could possibly express. But seeing this cycle I think I should see a therapist  but I'm afraid to know for sure that is schizophrenia. I need advice any at all if possible and I need someone to understand me before I die or go crazy because I realize no one does and I can't figure out how to change that.",28Dec2020,1

305,"Sorry if this is not that coherent, I just need to get it out I think 

I don’t know what’s wrong with me, i’ve been like this forever. Heck, maybe there’s not even anything wrong at all and i’m just trying to make something out of nothing. 

Does anyone else feel this? It’s like I want to suffer. Whenever I am down I search for reasons to stay down, I welcome all the negative thoughts with open arms. Even when I am feeling okay I do things to tear myself down deliberately. I don’t know why.

Whenever I do those “are you depressed tests”, I hope it’ll tell me I am. I don’t know why. Recently I did some dumb “are you happy” quizzes online because I was bored, and they mostly came up as slightly unhappy/ unhappy - and I was disappointed by that because I kind of wanted it to tell me I was super miserable. I frequent those depression meme subreddits and look for things to relate to even though they make me feel like shit, and I know they make me feel like shit. Whenever I think about trying to get my shit together and stop overeating/ be more productive, there’s a little voice in the back of my head going “If you improve then you can’t be sad anymore”, and that makes me want to not improve. 

I have a bit of health anxiety, and when it turns out that I actually don’t have the serious illnesses I thought I had, I feel dissapointed. Because I wanted to have something to be miserable about. I can’t help it. 

The only explanation I can think of is that i’m so unhappy but not unhappy enough to be depressed or need help - like, I’m not happy with life but i’m not miserable either. So it could maybe stem from me wanting to be miserable enough to get help without feeling like a fraud or like i’m overreacting? I feel bad complaining because there are people suffering way more than me, I am pretty ok compared to them. So maybe I want to suffer like them so I can feel like I deserve help. Even though that is super irrational. I don’t know. Even if that is the cause, I would have no idea how to resolve it. Idk

I have been wanting to get into therapy workbooks, and was wondering if anyone had any experience with workbooks that center self care, and self love. I am also looking for a goal setting workbook.  Recommendations are much appreciated.",28Dec2020,1
307,"So I’m 17 and when I was 14 I got raped. I just tried to push this to the side and not deal with it for a few years which ofc wasn’t healthy. Well recently I’ve been trying to sort through this trauma. I don’t have access to a therapist and won’t for around 6 months. Anytime I think about my rapist or see him out and about in public I get extreme anxiety. My chest gets tight, it’s hard to breath, and my heart rate skyrockets. Is this just normal anxiety or when this happens am I having a panic/anxiety attack?

I’ve dealt with anxiety before but nothing like this. I’m unsure what to call it.",28Dec2020,1
308,"recently my primary care doctor recommended that I see both a psychologist and a psychiatrist. my problem is, I’m a college student about to move to another state by the end of January, meaning I only have a few weeks left if I want to see someone locally. I’ve never been to either a psychologist or psychiatrist but I know you generally don’t see them only once, so I’m not sure how that would work when I move. should I hold off until I move, then find someone in the city I’m in? I’ll only be there for about 4 months. I’d definitely feel more comfortable finding local psychiatrists/psychologists but I don’t want to start seeing someone then have to leave so suddenly.",28Dec2020,1
309,"So I have been lurking quietly her for a few months, and have only just realised that certain quirks of my mental health are consistent. But could there be a meaning as this is the ONLY consistent thing with my mental health. 

I have BPD, which one of my main symptoms is intrusive thoughts. I have been accidentally off my meds for just over a week mainly due to anxiety and things like the weather and local restrictions that I unfortunately use to my advantage to not leave the house (I know, my bad lol). Well the intrusive thoughts came back this evening (I also have a very good imagination so things get internally visual) and noticed that when bordering a depressive spike i seem to get the same mental visualisation of me in an ICU bed hooked up to all manner of things. 

A note to help, I always see these visualisations from my perspective (1st person). I am also a great believer in everything happens for a reason. 

Oh and I’ve got someone getting my meds tomorrow.",28Dec2020,1
310,"I had a bad braid injury in 2014 and starting last year my mental health went on a decline and I hit rock bottom realizing how much time I’ve “lost” because I stay in my head so much. I can’t get out, I get sucked in and can’t stop thinking negative thoughts. I am constantly reinforcing myself with positive thoughts and I can tell that it’s helping and I’m getting better but then I have days where I’m back at square one and it takes me a good week to get back to a positive reality. My first therapy appointment is in 2 days but I was just wondering if anyone else has this problem or can relate?",28Dec2020,1
311,"Ok so let's go back in may 2018. A friend of mine killed herself,and I fell into a kind of self destructive spiral.

I forced myself to stay awake (by listening music,watching movies,playing video game until 2 or 3 am when I needed to wake up at 5h30am to go to school).

I kinda tried to stop any kind of relationship ,online and irl, by always having my earphone with music, don't really talk, isolating myself, etc...

and also mutilation. In 2 months,I cut myself more time and deeper than I did in the 4 years before , all the self harm way was nice:cut, burn(fire,electricity,acid), sleep deprivation, food deprivation, idk what else, honnestly everything is kinda blurr, never touched drug or alcohol in that period tho.

And there I am, 2years and a half later. I have a nice work, some friends, nothing to complain about , but I really miss that time when I was suffering alone,I even force myself to stay awake some night to try to having back the sensationsI had 2 years ago, but nothing work, neither sleep deprivation or sh, or listening the same songs I was listening then.

Idk why , but feeling better make me unsatisfied, like if pain was not as annoying as feel goo.Dae fell/felt the same?",28Dec2020,1
