But now with Covid-19 and this quarantine it has become worse than before, now i'm always like this, the only thing that i do during the day is online classes and studying otherwise i would be obsessing about the thoughts in my head, i cant enjoy anything, i cant read books (which was my favorite to do) i cant play music and, i cant watch movies and, even the simple things like scrolling through reddit get these thoughts started, before quarantine the way i used to deal with these obsessive thoughts is that i would make social interactions and because i'm an introvert those social interactions would take all my focus and energy so that would help divert my attention from these thoughts but now i cant do that anymore, also because i have commitment issues with people i don't really have friends, i have only acquaintances and it's really weird to text or call someone you barely know, i don't know really know what to do, i feel like i'm a prisoner to my own thoughts, i was planning to seek medical help for this but i'm scared to do that because of  my family's judgment on that they would say that i'm not the only who has  with mental issues i already know that",02May2020,1

I'm basically a stone, i have no preferences, opinions, personality, emotions. It's ridiculous, i feel no love, fear, anxiety, happiness, sadness etc etc. I've been basically like this since i woke up one morning sleep deprived when i was 14, and it never went away. I tried crying, getting angry, expressing emotion, and i couldn't find any emotions to be expressed. Now i can somehow turn my empathy on and off, and when it's on, it really is a default set of common reactions that are expected. I did well in school, my parents cared and loved me, i had and still have friends. I also don't have anything to be distressed about. I just 'know' that i'm not really experiencing life or at all.

It also extends to sensations, i can't really feel taste anymore, no pleasure from sexual things, it's 10C in here and i'm freezing but i don't care, forget to eat, online classes, exams, names, concepts. I don't dream anymore when asleep. I sometimes just sit in bed and then... there goes nothing for hours and hours, and i never feel bored. Every move i make is as agonizing physically/energetically speaking as the next, same goes with conscious thought. I failed uni and i didn't even notice, and when i did i didn't care... Even though it was my passion that i worked for 6 years. It looks like that sort of 'magic' or life has just dissapeared overnight. I can't say i'm desperate, i've been rolling with it for ages.

I don't have an interest in anything, i just play GTA 3 repeatedly with no aim, maybe go outside to walk for 20 minutes, do nothing, listen to music all day without preferences. I have a gaming computer, i can play whatever i want, but i don't. I have 'my own' home, which my parents pay for, i should probably feel guilt but i don't. I occasionaly try to revive my passion for math and physics, doesn't work. Sometimes i think other people are delusional with their emotions, but i guess i'm the problem. Coronavirus had no effect whatsoever on my mental health, i don't care if i get it and die. Sometimes i try to simulate normal emotions, like love for the world and compassion, i roll with it for a couple of hours and then forget about it and feel nothing. **Honestly sorry for repeating the same words over and over, but i just want to make it more dramatic or something. Should i just quit CIAing this stuff and go with psych drugs?** I can go on with buzz words like Apathy, anhedonia, DP/DR, depression but i'm not sure. **If you have any advice i'm happy to hear it.**

***If you're like me, then i'd like to talk to you...***

And there's not a single piece of advice that has ever helped me significantly. Keep in mind that i stuck with each strategy for up to 2-3 months.

‚Ä¢ I traveled, nothing

‚Ä¢ I tried forming meaningful friendships with uni classmates, nothing

‚Ä¢ I tried moving on with my 'dead for no reason passion', nothing

‚Ä¢ I try eating healthy, vitamins, exercise, nothing happens

‚Ä¢ Tried acting as if i'm normal, doesn't work

‚Ä¢ Coffee, no effect

‚Ä¢ Blood and urine samples, magnesium deficiency corrected and fatigue improved a bit

‚Ä¢ I've seen so many videos and read many books about emotional numbness, DP/DR, depression, anxiety, even psychosis, ocd. I don't really fit anywhere, and the clues don't match up.

‚Ä¢ Therapy doesn't work, i'm not a human anymore. Actually 1/5 even said i was antisocial, nope.

‚Ä¢ Had a cat once, didn't even bother to take care of it, felt nothing towards it, so i just let her go.

‚Ä¢ I'm on Wellbutrin XR 150mg, 3rd week, fatigue is gone tho.

i know there's therapists, psychologists, shrink, etc.

I don't wanna be a sap, but i just don't have a single person to talk to. (nobody that would ever understand or give me good advice, anyway)

i've seen on the movies and such: you go to a ""therapist's"" private office 
where you talk about everything and everybody in your life
and the ""therapist"" just takes all the deep info you told em about and basically analyzes you and figures you out. 
i need that right nowüòÇüòÇ answers! üëèüèª
i'm not comfortable in my own skin and i don't know why and I need to know why

but thank you, IA",02May2020,1

And there's not a single piece of advice that has ever helped me significantly. Keep in mind that i stuck with each strategy for up to 2-3 months.

I traveled, nothing 

I tried forming meaningful friendships with uni classmates, nothing 

I tried moving on with my 'dead for no reason passion', nothing 

I try eating healthy, vitamins, exercise, nothing happens

Tried acting as if i'm normal, doesn't work

Coffee, no effect

Blood and urine samples, magnesium deficiency corrected and fatigue improved a bit

I've seen so many videos and read many books about emotional numbness, DP/DR, depression, anxiety, even psychosis, ocd. I don't really fit anywhere, and the clues don't match up.

Therapy doesn't work, i'm not a human anymore. Actually 1/5 even said i was antisocial, nope.

Had a cat once, didn't even bother to take care of it, felt nothing towards it, so i just let her go.

I'm on Wellbutrin XR 150mg, 3rd week, fatigue is gone tho.

Thanks.",02May2020,1

But now with Covid-19 and this quarantine it has become worse than before, now i'm always like this, the only thing that i do during the day is online classes and studying otherwise i would be obsessing about the thoughts in my head, i cant enjoy anything, i cant read books (which was my favorite to do) i cant play music and, i cant watch movies and, even the simple things like scrolling through reddit get these thoughts started, before quarantine the way i used to deal with these obsessive thoughts is that i would make social interactions and because i'm an introvert those social interactions would take all my focus and energy so that would help divert my attention from these thoughts but now i cant do that anymore, also because i have commitment issues with people i don't really have friends, i have only acquaintances and it's really weird to text or call someone you barely know, i don't know really know what to do, i feel like i'm a prisoner to my own thoughts, i was planning to seek medical help for this but i'm scared to do that because of  my family's judgment on that they would say that i'm not the only who has  with mental issues i already know that",02May2020,1

33,"(So the first part of the post got a little long-- I swear I tried to trim it down and give the bare bones of context, but it didn't work the best. The actual advice request starts at 'So. Here I am.')

Okay. 

So a couple months ago [I made this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/eym53h/not_exactly_sure_what_to_do_ventadvice/) about a conflict with my DnD group of friends, and well. It's escalated in a way. This is all happening in the same group of 9 friends, just to mke sure. 

So, in mid February, I had a bit of a conflict with one of my friends while playing Minecraft, and in a panic I asked another friend in the group whether or not I should take a break. Both she and my DM agreed that I take a break from the game for a while, and I agreed to take a break from the game until the end of the semester. 

Then, when I went on our group's Minecraft server (we had switched worlds and I wanted to rebuild), my DM suggested I stay away from the server so my presence doesn't make people angry, which, you know, fair. And things carried on as normal. 

Until a couple weeks later, when in a fit of anxiety fueled paranoia, I asked my DM whether or not my friends secretly hated me and this was a convoluted method of getting me out of the group. He didn't reply no, and instead told me that it's probably better if I take a break from the discord and chill out. I didn't want to, but I figured it was better for the group and muted the discord, while still being in it. And I admit, every so often I would peek in, and see what everyone was talking about, and getting hurt that it seemed like no one seemed to miss me. 

Then I fucked up, and got a big letter telling me that \*until further notice\* I wasn't allowed in the Discord because of it. That was three weeks ago. I haven't been in a good place, mental health wise, since (compounded by the quarantine, struggling with schoolwork while at home, my family falling apart, etc etc), and I keep flipping back and forth between ""these people don't care about me and never had and never will, and I'm hurt and I should hurt them back and/or leave the group because they haven't kept me in mind"" and ""I'm a terrible person to have let it get this far, the only person I can blame is myself, and I should never speak in the group again and/or leave the group so I don't run the risk of hurting them ever again"". 

So. Here I am. 

I want to get better, and get back to my friends, and get back to being normal, cuz a lot of this has happened in the last few months. I don't want to keep talking over my friends and hurting them. I don't want to get in trouble again. I want to keep playing and having fun. In my friend's letter, they pointed out how I constantly complained in the discord, interrupted people, and constantly pivoted the attention to myself. And they're right, I'm very self absorbed and a straight up attention whore. But I don't know how to work on any of that, and I don't want to keep going back to the same person I've been talking to about this to ask for advice because they're not my therapist and they don't deserve to be treated like that. 

I've already tried to cut back on complaining about stuff in my other discords, but how do I work on not pivoting a conversation to be about myself all the time??? How do I relate a story I want to share without coming off as dominating the conversation??? How do I work on not interrupting people??? How do I work on being a better team player in general??? How do I fix myself???",02May2020,1

36,"I know the title makes it sound like I‚Äôve lost it, but I promise that I know how ridiculous it sounds. I know it‚Äôs completely irrational to think these things, and I don‚Äôt think I completely believe them to be true. It‚Äôs like one side of my brain knows I‚Äôm being irrational and the other half takes it very seriously. 

I‚Äôve been having these ideas for a while, like probably 6 months or so, but the lockdown has seemed to make the thoughts so much mire intense, and they‚Äôve started to seriously affect my behaviour. One of my ideas is that people can say a certain word or phrase and if I read or listen to/ process that phrase then they‚Äôll be able to hijack my thoughts, kind of like it‚Äôs a trap to manipulate me. As a result if I‚Äôm talking to someone online or in real life and they say something that I think is an attempt to manipulate my thoughts, I just blank my mind so that I don‚Äôt think about it and as a result I completely ignore them. This used to only happen like every 2 weeks or so, but now it‚Äôs pretty much every day.

Another thing I believe is that adverts like those on YouTube are also trying to hijack and manipulate my thoughts. So whenever an advert comes on on YouTube I immediately take my earbuds out and look away from the screen until it‚Äôs over. I also avoid mainstream media because I feel like it‚Äôs trying to achieve the same thing. It‚Äôs like I feel like everyone else has already been brainwashed and I don‚Äôt want to be brainwashed too.

Finally the more recent thing has been that whenever I do something I enjoy like listen to music or watch YouTube or play video games, I imagine a person telling me that what I like is stupid and bad and that I have bad taste and then it ruins the fun I was getting out of the activity. This has been the worst thing because now I feel like I can‚Äôt do anything I enjoy because he‚Äôll be there taunting me and he‚Äôll ruin it.


I know this all sounds really weird and crazy, but I promise that I know it‚Äôs crazy. I just can‚Äôt convince myself to stop thinking it‚Äôs real and it‚Äôs making me really agitated and upset. What can I do to stop thinking like this? I just want to be able to put my guard down and relax...",02May2020,1

41,"There's a lot of weird stuff happening to me lately (hallucinations, voices, trippy thoughts) but my main problem is the fear. I'm afraid of what other people think of me. I feel like everyone in my life is just pretending to be kind to me to earn my trust and use it against me. At least that's what the whispers in my head say. I try to ignore them but in the quiet of the night it's hard to. I wish I could get help from a therapist or a hospital but it looks like I'm going to have to tackle this on my own this time.

I guess my main question would be how do deal with these thoughts? Please, I really need help.",02May2020,1
42,"I know the title makes it sound like I‚Äôve lost it, but I promise that I know how ridiculous it sounds. I know it‚Äôs completely irrational to think these things, and I don‚Äôt think I completely believe them to be true. It‚Äôs like one side of my brain knows I‚Äôm being irrational and the other half takes it very seriously. 

I‚Äôve been having these ideas for a while, like probably 6 months or so, but the lockdown has seemed to make the thoughts so much more intense, and they‚Äôve started to seriously affect my behaviour. One of my ideas is that people can say a certain word or phrase and if I read or listen to/ process that phrase then they‚Äôll be able to hijack my thoughts, kind of like it‚Äôs a trap to manipulate me. As a result if I‚Äôm talking to someone and they say something that I think is an attempt to manipulate my thoughts, I just blank my mind so that I don‚Äôt think about it and as a result I completely ignore them. If it happens online then I don‚Äôt open the message and don‚Äôt reply to them. This used to only happen like every 2 weeks or so, but now it‚Äôs pretty much every day.

Another thing I believe is that adverts like those on YouTube are also trying to hijack and manipulate my thoughts. So whenever an advert comes on on YouTube I immediately take my earbuds out and look away from the screen until it‚Äôs over. I also avoid mainstream media because I feel like it‚Äôs trying to achieve the same thing. It‚Äôs like everyone else has already been brainwashed and I don‚Äôt want to be brainwashed too.

Finally the more recent thing has been that whenever I do something I enjoy like listen to music or watch YouTube or play video games, I imagine a person telling me that what I like is stupid and bad and that I have bad taste and then it ruins the fun I was getting out of the activity. This has been the worst thing because now I feel like I can‚Äôt do anything I enjoy because he‚Äôll be there taunting me and he‚Äôll ruin it.


I know this all sounds really weird and crazy, but I promise that I know it‚Äôs crazy. I just can‚Äôt convince myself to stop thinking it‚Äôs real and it‚Äôs making me really agitated and upset. What can I do to stop thinking like this? I just want to be able to put my guard down and relax...",02May2020,1

*Context:*
It's a very long story, but to cut to the chase, two years ago I had an artist friend who essentially jumped to the conclusion about some small things as well as fabricate lies. 

They ended up accusing me of a bunch of things I didn't do, but the scary part was that she seemed to insist to others it was true? Her and her friends shared a Discord group, and I never got a chance to reconcile because I was blocked everywhere. It didn't help that another friend who was also got involved, basically was a white knight about the whole situation and heavily defended her. It seemed unfair that I couldn't even get the word out there despite having reasonable points.

However, since reconcile is not an option, where would I go from here? It would be a lot easier for me to deal with anonymous hate than hater turned friends :/",02May2020,1
47,"I had a consultation with a psychiatrist last week for the first time. All my life i've suspected Ive had adult adhd along with anxiety. I wanted to finally try medication out now that we're in quarantine and I am in a safe, constant, environment at home with not much social interaction. To my disappointment, my consultation with this psychiatrist  lasted barely 25 minutes. The doctor made offhand remarks about my race ""did you grow up with a tiger mom? (because I am Chinese)"" and didn't seem to really listen to me saying ""uh uh"" and cutting me off when I talked. She proceeded to diagnose me with  depression and gave me a prescription for anti-depressants (lexapro). I left feeling like I wasn't  seen or heard in that appointment and  feeling worse about myself. I picked up the prescription from the pharmacy but haven't touched the meds.

I wasn't satisfied with that at all so I proceeded to go to a new psychiatrist for a second opinion. This one was much better with our session lasting a full 70 minutes and  i left feeling like someone had finally listened to me. She asked me questions and just let me talk. At the end of it, she said I showed signs of ADHD and prescribed to strattera. During this, she  asked me if I had taken prior meds or had seen a psychiatrist before aand I said no not thinking clearly b/c in my head I didn't feel like I did with that 25 min appt and having not taken any of the meds. 

&amp;#x200B;

After reviewing the appointment in my head, I'm worried that this new doctor can see my prescription history and might think i'm some kind of drug seeker. I am not and I truly just felt so shitty after the last psychiatrist appointment I wanted a second opinion. I know i fucked up by not telling her about the first psychiatrist consultation but now i'm stuck. What do I do? What do I do with my lexapro prescription which I'm not going to use? Can i return it to the pharmacy and prove I didn't take it? Will my new doctor not go through with my ADHD meds and further testing because of this?",02May2020,1
48,"Hi, I‚Äôm 22, I live in the UK. I just need to vent, I‚Äôm sorry if this seems a little self pity-ing 

In my childhood, I never had access to anything other than very basic healthcare, so as I‚Äôve progressed into adulthood, I feel as if I don‚Äôt deserve to get help, or as if I‚Äôd be dismissed because I‚Äôd be asking about all these things I know I have, but was never able to get a diagnosis when I was younger. I feel like a dr would just say ‚Äúif these issues were bad enough, they would have been looked at sooner‚Äù

I know I have extreme Anxiety, to the point that I can‚Äôt function without another person helping me with things like phone calls, leaving home, talking to people etc. I‚Äôve never had help with it, and for a long time I though I was just weak, or a coward. I have overwhelming paranoia and a debilitating fear of death. 
This in turn has come with depression, as I get frustrated with my reaction to the world around me, and My idea of my own self worth takes a downfall. I‚Äôve been suicidal for over 6-7 years (never attempted anything because I‚Äôm too scared) and it really breaks your spirit to feel as if you‚Äôre just taking up space from more ‚Äòdeserving‚Äô people. 
I‚Äôm 90% certain I have C-PTSD but since it‚Äôs such a new term, I wouldn‚Äôt know how to approach that. My childhood was full of mental and physical abusive, ranging from emotional manipulation to domestic violence and assault, both with and without weapons. I know it‚Äôs affected me, but thanks to the aforementioned idea of self worth, I have no clue where I could even begin.
I believe myself to be autistic, my parent even agrees here, but since I was neglected as a child, I never got that looked at. It‚Äôs hard to find someone who‚Äôll even look at an adult for diagnosis, I might be stuck forever at ‚ÄòSuspected Autistic‚Äô

I don‚Äôt know how to live my life because I deal with situations so differently to anyone I‚Äôve met- I feel like an Alien. I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve help for any of it, that I‚Äôd be wasting everyone‚Äôs time. I have no friends to speak of, I have no hobbies, I can‚Äôt even go to education (my one biggest want) because of a mix of mental health and money issues.

I‚Äôm not sure where I wanted to go with this, but it‚Äôs nice to write everything down.",02May2020,1

I‚Äôll be halfway thru completing it and I‚Äôll drop it and start something else that is completely random from the current thing I‚Äôve wanted to do previously.

51,"I dont know how to explain it, but im going to try.
So i turned 19 this year and i feel Like life isnt worth it anymore (not Like it was before).
Ive always been a shy kind of person and never really had real friends. I also might have adhd (i was diagnosed with hyperactivity disorder but i suspect an inattention disorder too because ive always struggle to focus and no one understands me when talk and i also feel Like im not mature enough for my age) . Im also parano√Ød (self diagnosed), i always feel Like people are tricking me /using me or want to harm me and it happens with everyone, in other words i see danger everywhere (litteraly). 
Im a very anxious person, to the point were i would avoid certain activities thinking that i might someday lose a limb and lose the ability to perform that activity (e.g learning to play the guitar). 
And there are probably other things i forgot to say. 
Anyways if had to sum up all i said, I'd say that i simply dont know how to cope with all of that.

52,"It's been some tough weeks, I have been talking to my crush (who has a boyfriend) and I just told her all of my feelings towards her. She told me some time ago that she was having difficulties with her relationship and she doesn't know what will happen but she told me she have felt something for me as well. I just recently told her again my feelings and I just want to know if she wants me to wait or there is no chance for me and for her. I know it's a lot of pressure for her, but I'm just holding on to my love, every day we talk my feelings get even deeper for her. I'm sorry, I've never experienced this type of feeling, this is the first time I've ever been in love at 21 years old.
I imagined love different, I guess this is what happens when you try to give it all knowing there is no certainty.
Because all of this, I've been in my room, tired, trying to do whatever to distract my mind but I can't, I'm stressed because I have a lot of school projects I need to do for the next week but I can't focus. I have a lot of anxiety and all I wish is to go to the gym, it always helped me relieve my mind, even if it is for a few hours, but I can't because of this fucking quarantine. I'm alone in my room, wishing to tell someone all of this, hence why I'm posting this, I don't want to tell my family, and I wish I could act as if nothing is happening but I'm not a person that can cover up feelings. Being alone here is really stressing, if I go out my family will know that I have something and will be asking ""what is wrong with you?"" And I don't want to tell them.

It feels heavy, it's really painful, sometimes to the point where I feel I can't tolerate it. I wish sometimes I would have the guts to just kill myself to stop feeling but I know it's not the solution, I have dreams, goals, I want to experience more aspects of life before parting away. I wish that sometimes I was a different person, a wiser person that would know what to do in this situations.

What must I do? How can I relieve this anxiety? I will try to play videogames for a while to relieve this feeling a little bit, but I know that once I get in bed I will start feeling the same way. Fuck my life, I wish I would experience love like a normal person would, where two persons would just fall in love like that, without any problems, just like all of my friends do :(",02May2020,1
53,"Hello,

I have written a book about half a month ago about my story with mental illness and another story mixed in from someone I knew online who was heavily involved with a dark web mafia organization. He told me several stories of him in the crime family and also told me his trials with mental health. He felt like the only one who was really honest with him was me. I later found out he was arrested and I decided that his story was not to be wasted. I spent months writing, and editing the book about his life interlocked with my own to replicate a fictional setting. I have spent a very long time on the book and it's been very hard to get the book out there. I don't really even care about the fact that I have to sell it, but rather I care more about his life being wasted by his own organization. I was very angry about the fact but I knew it was hopeless to just give in. So I wrote the book to show his life, and my own to hopefully let him not go to waste as just another kid who got locked up. I would appreciate some feedback on the book aswell in this thread if you want to critique. If it seems like some errors are in I will take notice of them. The artistic style of the book was supposed to emulate a blog post because that was my friends other outlet. He had hosted it on the tor browser and it was called ""Padrino's Domain."" Unfortuantly it was shut down but it did really demonstrate how stressed he really was. I thank you for your time and hopefully you can give the book a good read.

60,"Alright I'm about to make myself vulnerable as hell. I'm 17, and I went to the pediatrician several months ago before all of this coronavirus craze. I took the paper surveys they give you to make sure you're ""okay,"" and I scored high for having anxiety, depression, and ADD or ADHD. 

The problem is that when I went to the doctor a year before, I was told I was fine and especially didn't have ADD/ADHD because my grades ""were too good."" My parents are making me take contacting a therapist/psychiatrist into my own hands, but I'm too anxious to do it because I feel like they'll tell me I'm neuro typical and laugh in my face. 

I suppose I do shit that would clearly give away my issues (loss of interest, self harm, the whole nine yards...), but I've had friends in much worse situations than mine so I feel like I should be ok. I guess I'm thinking this: if I've made it 17 years without killing myself, I'm fine...but I constantly feel like an underachieving dumbass.

Every day is an uphill battle for me (in the current situation), but there are so many people worse off than me. So am I just looking for attention? I would think that I could tell, but clearly not. My parents now walk on eggshells around me sometimes because I've a couple of outbursts, so that's definitely not helping. It makes me feel like a temperamental toddler if I'm being honest. I'm not 100% sure where I'm going with this, but has anyone else experienced the same thing? If so, how do I fix this? I'm not one to show much emotion on a daily basis or give way to how I feeling besides the ""happy mask"" I put on, so idk if therapy would even help me. Meds seem to make it all go away, so maybe I should just aim for finding a psychiatrist (if I'm correct on that one).  

I'm just not sure what to do. Each day is like dragging a ball and chain, but I've made it this far, you know? Anyways, let me know if I'm just being an overreactive teenager that thinks they're depressed when they're not lol.

It all started sometime last week I'm not sure what exactly has triggered this all but I'll try my best to explain and I will answer any questions. So sometime in the last week my boyfriend who I'll refer to as L, started taking caffeine pills in secret. He stopped sleeping for a few days and had begun saying very strange things, things like demons were coming to kill us, or a certain famous person was talking to him in his head and was going to bring him guns so he could make sure he could defend himself. This and so many other strange things were happening but all of us in the house were very confused and didn't know exactly what to do. By Tuesday he had gotten pretty bad and was rambling to himself while chain-smoking cigarettes, we had found out on this day that he had been taking the caffeine pills and knew we had to try to settle him in for some good sleep that night. I kissed him and rolled over and let him know that I wasn't going to sleep until I knew he was sleeping (obviously because he's been up for days and I knew if I fell asleep first he would get up and be up all night again) while I was laying there relaxing waiting for him to sleep he began saying off the wall things like, I know what you're doing, you're not going to win, and more that I honestly can't remember. I began crying because I was pretty frightened and that's when he jumped out of bed and grabbed his knife. In that moment I didn't recognize the man I have woken up to everyday for 3 years, he looked at me and said if you don't stop crying I'm going to stab you. I freaked out and ran into his mother's room, I didn't sleep that night..  his mother and sister managed to get him to go to sleep(tho he should've gone to the hospital right then) the next morning he woke up and was still losing it, he kept screaming at me to get out, go to sleep or die.

I tried to get through my project but in my heart, I gave up a while ago and the pandemic has made it so hard for me to get face to face help. I'm going to fail. My family tells me that after losing my dad and my brother, that they are proud but I feel like I just end up spitting all over that when I decide to just escape into my mindless routines and hobbies.

I don't care about how I look, or what state I live in as long as I'm not going to get fined for letting food rot in my place. My sleep schedule is terrible and I've been waking up feeling awful. Wanting to sleep more so I won't be awake to worry, but too worried to fall back asleep.

I feel like my emotions are broken and my attention is terrible. All I can do is nod and smile, offering vapid responses like ""oh yeah"" and ""that's nice"". I find it hard to feel genuine happiness or excitement. Even in places where is I am genuinely happy for someone.

69,"I had this online friend who was underaged. She drank vodka a lot. I told her to stop every time she said she waa doing it and she told me that I couldn't do anything to stop her. That struck me deep. Deeper than it should have. I just saw a suicide post. I was about to comment but then I just thought whatever not like I can do anything. I let people impact me so much and I'm a hypocrite.

I told someone that they needed to think for themselves. I don't. All I do is let people i want to like me make choices for me. I refuse to see how toxic they are until they are gone. I refuse to say no in fear of them hating me. Heck my ex boyfriend was mentally, physically, and sexually abusive. I refused to see it because I thought it was normal to 'play right's even though it hurt a lot sometimes. And if I ever beat him in said fights he'd keep going until he had me pinned in a painful position. 

I let him touch me because he was so desperate and I thought hed think i was a wimp for saying no or not wanting to. Then when I started saying no he was so used to it that he got mad and physically hurt me just to try and get me to cave. He threatened to hurt his animals that i cared for if I didn't do what he wanted. He'd get mad if I spent more time cuddling his dog. He put a FLAME to his dogs fur. He treated his ex better than me. He got mad when I didn't defend him but yet he didn't defend me when he was sitting next to me.

I could go on. But I won't. I care so little about other people that I can't help but wonder if I'm the biggest jerk alive. I care so much about the closest online friend I have and the odds are she's toxic. I put my happiness, mental stability, and how much I self harm in her hands and she doesn't even know it. I'm so scared of making her mad or upset that I try my absolute hardest to keep my mental state to myself. I blame myself for my drunk friend leaving us because I don't want to have a reason to not take her back if she comes back. She knows my reddit account so I don't know if she sees these.

If someone gave me a pencil and paper and told me to write how I feel id be sent to a hospital. But i can't go to a hospital because then my friend will be upset. And it doesn't matter how I feel or what I need or if I need to vent because she wants to play games instead so I have to keep her happy. I know this won't get upvotes. I never do. I don't care at this point. No one will reach out. No one actually cares to try because I'm so messed up that people don't feel like trying to fix me. It's easier to toss me aside or ignore me. Anyone that has reached out in the past is now gone or ignores me. I don't expect much from people on reddit but it's not like I can get help from anywhere else.",02May2020,1

72,"Hello, 
I am not the type to seek help from others about personal problems, I‚Äôm the type to bury them inside and hope they go away or that I stumble across a remedy by chance somehow. 

I want to ask for help from people who may be going through similar issues what they think I should look into in terms of identifying my possible behaviors and personality types so that I can read up on those topics and see how they might fit in my life so that I can start to repair them and fix this deep pain I constantly carry with me from years of unacknowledged traumas and Unhealed wounds.
I want to do this so that I can make sense of my story and find a light in this darkness that I‚Äôve been lost in for so long. The key to ‚Äúmaking sense‚Äù of your life experiences is to write a coherent narrative, which helps you understand how your childhood experiences are still affecting you in your life today. 
This is what I know I need to do if I want to escape this darkness and be able to have meaningful relationships.

One thing I‚Äôve already identified:

Doing some random reading and I have realized I have ‚Äúdismissive-avoidant attachment personality‚Äù likely from my primary caregiver (father) being emotionally distant and not meeting my emotional needs. My parents were split and my mother was largely not in my life due to her own problems mainly being drug addiction. 


My hope is that maybe someone who is familiar with this personality trait could point me in the direction of some other possible or common problems people deal with who are experiencing this. 
No answer will offend me, I simply need help identifying psychological terms so that I can research them and try to make sense of my story.

I'm making a bit of spare change selling things on ebay. I finally fixed my broken nocturnal sleep Shedule. I finally stopped gambling on csgo cases, I've stopped seeing hookers. But suddenly I came across a radio head song I forgot about (glass house) and its beautifully depressing lyrics brought me back to a place Ive spent years and still frequent multiple times per week. (spiral in to drugs, mental illness, rehab and complete agony). I then jumped into a game with the lads and I asked myself midgame ""dude wtf is wrong right now"" ""what's making me feel this way?"" , I should be elated and having a great time... There were short bursts of euphoria, but Now I'm laying in bed with the squad pinging me on discord to come back and play another game of r6. But I just want to sulk. Scary thing is. I think I enjoy it. Part of me enjoys sulking and wallowing in self pity. I've done it for years. But today it's clear as day. Today should be an amazing day for me in quarentine,(I like being alone, but can  be social). School doesn't start for another week and all I care to do in life is sleep fap and game. And ofc this.

I feel like im dreaming all the time. Like everything around me is off somehow and it just feels like im dreaming. I normally feel this way and i feel like my body is foreign and not rlly mine. I dont recognize my hands or my face in the mirror. Its like this constantly and im always disconnected from the world and spacing out all the time.

Time liss is a hige issue, almost everyday i have periods where i will blink and hours have oassed and ive done things i cant remember.

My memory is so scrambled and blurred. I cant remember any of my childhood and even yesterday is just a scrambled blur. The things i can remember arent consistant with what actually happened and apparently dont make sense and my memory is in ‚Äúthird person‚Äù

Im just stuck in my head ig. Spacing out into the void.

Sometimes its like im walking away from myself.

Ive lost grip of time and i dont think i ever had a grip on it in the first place.

Sometimes, a lot more recently, i have these memories that feel real and i dont like them. I normally forget them though so ig its not that big of a deal. The panick attacks and nightmares suck though.

Im just so confused all the time. Its like i have no control. I dont think i ever did.

I thought this was normal for awhile but im coming to find that it isnt.

The anxiety sucks. Trust issues. Its difficult to open up to people unless ik they cant hurt me. The only reason why im making this post is so i can gather my thoughts. Are they even my thoughts? Some of them dont sound or feel like my thoughts. I argue with them a lot.

Why cant i just remember yesterday? Ugh. Weeks gone in what feels like a couple days.

85,"Hey all. About a year and a half ago, I moved to a new city for my husband's work. I now live a 3-4 hour drive away from my family. I'm a homebody and doing the housewife thing right now, and I've dealt with depression long enough to know that if I don't have a job, or some regular activity outside of the apartment, it gets way worse. I go from dealing with mostly just the physical effects (exhaustion) to dealing with all the more traditional symptoms, primarily a loss of enjoyment in hobbies and such. Since the move, I've mainly kept going by taking a local weekly painting class, and going to see my family every few months, even just for a day or two, just to catch up and hug them a lot, as I slowly, slooooowly search for friends in my new city.

Here's my current situation: my husband is deployed overseas, my weekly class has been cancelled, and obviously I can't go see my family. Even if I could, my normal pet boarding place is not currently boarding, until restrictions loosen. In some ways, it's made social distancing very easy. I only have one friend up here, who I hadn't even known that long, I don't have to worry about losing a job, or my husband bringing anything home. I don't go see my family, because they're out of state, etc. Mostly I've been hanging in there really well. I play D&amp;D online, and my closest friend and I primarily communicate online anyway, so that hasn't really changed, but these things really are not substitutes for seeing people in person. For hugging people, and being hugged. For even just having someone sit nearby, watching the same movie you are. Phonecalls, and online games prop me up for a day or so, before I just kind of feel how I did before. Over the last few months, I've gone from coping very well, to the last couple of weeks, where I either want to cry, feel numb, or feel frustrated, because I can't get invested in or excited about things I like. With the restrictions, I really have no idea how to fix this. I'm not a danger to myself, but god, I just feel that terrible hollowness, and I don't know what to do.

Has anyone found any good coping strategies during this time? Any replacements for human contact, at least?",02May2020,1
86,"I am in my mid 30s (m) At some point I started to have anxiety and depression issues.  I don't like antidepressants and I tend to abuse anti anxiety meds like zanax so I stopped taking them (wish I didnt, cant sleep).  So I've let my mental health issues go untreated for some time.  I never really thought anyone liked me, never thought very high of myself.  Definitely low confidence.  Over the past few years I've had a tough time with my career which has made things a lot worse.  As of late probably over the past 6 months I've been steadily declining.  My depression/ anxiety issues have turned into something worse.  I constantly think,  I have delusions of grandeur and persecution.  I have taken a lot of hits to the head over the years and I took a nasty fall out of an attic a few months before things took a turn for the worse.  I started taking testosterone (low t) to help me with life and I did get better.  I figured more is better so I changed doctors and the new one increased the dose and prescribed several other hormone/energy related things.  At first when the gym was open life was good.  Now my mental health has gone to shit.  I'm literally delusional, depressed, lonely and I'm doing stupid stuff.  I don't have much social interaction at all.  I've lost intelligence.  I've started drinking heavily for the first time and I enjoy it.  I have an appointment Monday with a doctor to try to get this thing figured out.  I'll never have a life if I don't.  Already reduced the testosterone and related stuff on my own because it isn't helping.  I'm going to stop drinking and smoking ciggs.  I'm worried I could have a brain tumor or brain injury.  Things have just steadily worsened and this coronavirus crap has made it almost unbearable.

I don‚Äôt know much about DID, I don‚Äôt even know where to begin to help him through this, but I want to be as helpful and supportive as possible. I‚Äôve been online researching a lot on it, trying to familiarize myself with it and normalize it in my mind the best I can.

However, these past few months I've been experiencing some issues, but they have really gotten worse while staying at home all the time...

Basically, during the day I'm totally fine but when I go to bed I have really bad irrational episodes that prevent me from sleeping. The majority of the time I'm terrified that someone may break into my home, or that there is paranormal activity in my house that will hurt or kill me (... and I'm an atheist lol). I sleep with my boyfriend and one night I heard him breathing a little differently, so I had thoughts that he was actually a robot lol. Just really ridiculous intrusive thoughts and obsessions that lead me to have to leave the light on or close the door. Yesterday my boyfriend put a hammer on our door knob and nails at the foot of the door, so that if it was opened I would be able to hear someone come in. I know that the chances are really low, but I can't help obsess about it, and every noise I hear at night scares me. 

I've tried countless things, like listening to Headspace before bed, deep breathing techniques, listening to music on Spotify, using a nightlight, etc. They work temporarily but the next night it doesn't matter. I should also mention that a couple nights ago I saw a dark figure (basically a person) in my bedroom doorway, and even when I stared at them they didn't go away, but I know it's just my mind seeing things in the dark. I know it's all in my head. But my heart starts racing after my boyfriend falls asleep, and then it's just me and the darkness. I sometimes stay up till 6AM, even though I'm exhausted, cause I just have to watch the door. 

Please help. I'm almost 21 and I'm afraid of the dark again. It's so embarrassing. I'm posting here because I'm afraid of talking to a friend about it. My boyfriend doesn't quite understand. And I don't want to see a therapist because I'm embarrassed and honestly don't want them to know it's me or see my face. Is this some kind of sleep anxiety or insomnia?

So on Thursday I went and worked helping my friend at his greenhouse. It was him me and his mom and his little step sister. I saw his little step sister who is I think in the eighth grade and I am a senior in high school. My mind instantly sexualizes things most of the time but I did not in this situation. I was like yeah whatever they do not look bad and are not ugly or anything and tried to shake the thought. I sent the rest of the day and Friday not telling anyone how I felt and how I saw that situation.

Tonight I was talking to my girlfriend and told her about it and as you would have guessed she was not happy. I told her I would not act in these thoughts and I do not enjoy having them and I do not feel like that is me. Out of anger my girlfriend hung up and I messaged her about it but that is not what I am worried about. 

What I am worried about is that after talking about that and stuff I got the thought to go masturbate. I went and looked at some drawn porn (hentai) and then went to normal porn and back to hentai. I watched the video and got off to it and I can not help but to think that me talking about my friends step sister might have gave me the thought to go do things to myself and I feel guilty and shaky and I am not happy about it. I do not want tot elk my girlfriend about it in fear she will be upset and leave or anything. I do not like feeling this way and it makes me feel bad. 

I do not know if that is what gave me the thought to do it or if I just thought to go do it but I am thinking it was the thought or something of his little step sister and I feel bad and guilty.

Not even a month before that, I had lost my job due to smoking pot and pissing dirty after getting hurt. I have sadly been unemployed since then. The ‚Äúcovid‚Äù bullshit has not helped in job hunting either. My wife has been killin‚Äô it and holding things down whilst I get myself straightened out. 

That said, it‚Äôs time I paid her back one thousand fold. I am beginning that process by acquiring a job. If all goes well during the onboarding process, I will be working at Amazon. I‚Äôve yet to determine whether it will be long term or not. I do, however, plan on trying my absolute best to climb the ladder and try landing a higher up position there. 

I feel like things are finally starting to come together for me and I could not be more elated. Being consistent with my medication and putting my mental health first has given me a brand new outlook on just about every aspect of my life.

What others think about me 
Immature, weak, stupid, not qualified, doubters, defensive, inexperienced and Overthinking .. I agree I sometimes I never act like tough guy which 90%of the people naturally do  I will be just be goofing around and funnier that's it. 

Personally : I'm serious guy, from childhood mostly don't  watch movies , spend everyday watching useful things till now, always try to be nice to everyone still hated for no reason..  These questions and other things make my mood elvated and dropped sooner without no reasons. 


my mental struggles have always been related with my family financial status which has shaped me in and out personally during my elementary stages I used to hate my father for his worst attitude at the time being abusive to my mom and  during in my early teen every thing was going good even we were struggling we were living a life without problems then suddenly with some financial rise we literally become talk of the town for sudden rise in the status that was 14-16 at that time I was so confident happiest days of my life everywhere people started to respect me and then I started to proceed abroad to study  by 18 these were the beginning of toughest days in my life literally I had  no money for room rents I didn't pay for months no money for food (my friends helped me a lot for food) during that time gaming was the only emotional relief for me and the I started to play games everyday at one point it lead me into sleeplessness if I'm not sleepy then it was leading me to stress, depression and suicidal thoughts..then porn was helping me better but it was the beginning of yet another worst things to happen By 20 I started to realize and it took me more than a year to figure and to have a perfect chart to fix then when I turn 21 everything started to get a little bit better financially, emotionally from July 2019 I started to do workouts consistently, started practicing had better sleep at nights for many months until this quarantine shit which started make me feel worse emotionally no idea how to overcome sleeplessness, depressed and personally I've problems with my another group of friends..

105,"I don‚Äôt hate animals. I just don‚Äôt care about them. It might be because of childhood, but I also feel like it makes more sense than caring about one group and killing another. 

Dogs for example.

I don‚Äôt understand why people value dogs so much. They‚Äôre just another animal. Were okay with killing some animals, but go crazy about the death of dogs. Is it because people think they‚Äôre cute? Is their love of dogs just superficial? Pigs are as intelligent if not more intelligent than dogs, and we kill and eat them everyday.

I have the same reaction to seeing a cow and a dog die. Is there something wrong with my view? Let me know.

(Some backstory)

My dad lived in a reservation out in the middle of nowhere , and I would go there in the summers to visit him. There were a lot of dogs and he‚Äôd kill them and throw them on a dog pile in the woods. They were a bit of a pest and could be dangerous. Also, I‚Äôve seen him kick a puppy like 10 feet. It was wild. 

These things made me realize that dogs aren‚Äôt anything special. I used to like them and had one when I was a kid, but those feelings are foreign to me now. I don‚Äôt hate them, just like I don‚Äôt hate any other animal. I just don‚Äôt care about them. 

Should I care about animals? I feel like you have to care about all animals or none. 

I see these hypocrites who happily slaughter an animal they don‚Äôt find ‚Äúcute‚Äù and then abhor other cultures killing dogs. 

Is this not wrong? Am I wrong?

I find it hard enough to care about other humans let alone caring about the well being of less intelligent animals. 

How do I care about animals while also eating meat and turning a blind eye to the cruelty? 

Does it not make more sense to just stop pretending and admit that I don‚Äôt really care? 

Things live and die everyday. I‚Äôll eventually cease to exist too. Does it matter? I don‚Äôt think so, but when I tell people I don‚Äôt care about dogs or animals they give me looks like I‚Äôm a crazy person. Are they not hypocrites? Am I wrong?",02May2020,1

I've literally fallen asleep on video calls multiple times. And sleep isn't coming to me since I've had those weird hallucinations/dreams. To the next problem, I can't cry anymore. It's been, like months and I haven't been able to fucking cry. I can make myself get choked up, and feel tears in my eyes like you do when you cry, but tears never fall. Even when they do it's for two seconds then it stops. I have no way to release pent up emotions besides writing and drawing and even then it doesn't help that much. I've been trying to cry for the longest time but I just, can't. Every day I'm just this emotionless being but as soon as I'm alone all of it just comes out. Not the tears, but all the negative emotions. I don't know if I'm emotionally strong or a heartless sociopath. Next problem. I want to kill someone, then myself. I want to slide a knife through someone's chest and watch the pained look on their face as they realize that they're not going to live. Stab them over and over and over again until that pained look becomes empty and dead. I want to break every bone in their body, cut off every limb. Cut out their tongues, their eyes, their ears. Behead them. Slice through their stomach and rip out their heart, their intestines, gut them like a fish. Soak the remains in gasoline and burn it. Leave nothing but a pile of ashes and blood on the ground. Then use that same knife and cut every inch of skin on my arms, until there's blood dripping off my arms. I want to punch the walls until my knuckles are bleeding.  Last fucked up thing. I would have new cuts every minute if I didn't want my mom to find out. Every time I cut she would give me the same lecture, "" You know I'm here for you right? Do we need to go to therapy more often? You're just distracting yourself from the REAL pain. ' 1) The whole point IS to distract myself from the emotional pain. And  2) Going to therapy makes me feel worse. I haven't cut for longer than I want it to be. Every time I feel any sort of emotions my arm starts to itch where my scars are and sometimes they start to get like, waves of pain. It's like my body WANTS me to cut.

I find that I am unable to feel empathy. Just not too long ago a long-time friend of mine told me he had broken up with his girlfriend, and I didn't feel anything! And while this was not the first time I've noticed it, it was the latest one. I find it very weird because I can understand the feelings, and as a writer, I have gotten a lot of praise for representing feelings in a realistic way in my works.

In the end, I don't really care of other people? While I do follow social ideologies like humanism and feminism, I believe it is mostly just me trying to look better for others. I have some friends, and I am capable of loving, though only certain people, but I find it very difficult to be interested in others for an extended period of time.

I feel like I am superior to others. I put others' needs ahead of my own, but again, it is likely just me trying to look better. I feel like my goals are above all else, and I'd go to great lengths to achieve them, even if it meant manipulating others.

Thus I have come to a conclusion, am I a sociopath?

When I left my abusive household 2 years ago I had the idea that I came out pretty okay, at least not with major mental health problems. I did however drink lots of alcohol which numbed my feelings, something I realized in hindsight. The drinking numbed my anxiety and how sad and betrayed I felt after my mother choose the side of my abusive stepfather. Last year I decided I had enough of this numbness and started tackling life head on. I quit smoking &amp; drinking and started exercising, meditating and focusing on my mental health. I had a planned appointment for a psychologist in march, but it was cancelled because of Covid-19. Now the biggest problem I face is now that I‚Äôm completely sober, I notice how anxious I am and I also have tons of nightmares. Every night I dream of being back in my household or encountering my stepfather. I never wake up refreshed and always like I‚Äôve just been on a rollercoaster of misery.

I‚Äôm not able to talk to anybody, I just lock up. And being around people who are talking gives me anxiety attacks. I‚Äôm not even able to be around my fianc√© as of lately. And he‚Äôs getting worried about me because I have never done this before. Usually when I‚Äôm not doing okay I run to him for security, not run away. I can‚Äôt even talk to my coworkers. I haven‚Äôt been eating. I had to leave work a few weeks back because I was absolutely freaking out, I ended up calling in ‚Äúsick‚Äù the next two days Just because I was so scared of going back. 

The anxiety issue is definitely causing some pretty bad depression, which I haven‚Äôt had depression this bad in .. years maybe? My anxiety has never been this bad before. I feel like I‚Äôm going batshit, and It‚Äôs ruining my life. Even driving, which is usually one of my favorite and most calming things is freaking me out. I‚Äôm used to my anxiety being existent, but not nearly anything this bad. 

I‚Äôve tried to get in with my psychiatrist and they scheduled me for the 20th. I‚Äôm gonna call Monday and see if there‚Äôs any way I could get in earlier because of the severity. That‚Äôs a long damn time though, I‚Äôm feeling hopeless honestly. I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

I got a weighted blanket, which helps me sleep longer and better, but doesn‚Äôt help me much when I‚Äôm awake. I‚Äôve been sleeping a lot more. I bought some valerian root, but I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôll interact with my lamictal and make me insanely dizzy. I‚Äôve tried coloring books, music, nothing really helps. I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

I feel hopeless. I‚Äôm not going to hurt myself, but I hella don‚Äôt feel like existing at the moment lol.

I started watching porn when I was 9 and in my teens I wanted to burn my moms house down because of what happened in there. I feel like I‚Äôm on the better side of it now, but I feel like I could possibly relapse. I‚Äôve been doing better only for a few months now.
I‚Äôve ruined my relationships by being too clingy. I can‚Äôt be friends with females because they intimidate me. I only talk to guys and sometimes I do sexual favours for them. I go to therapy but I don‚Äôt want to talk about the sex aspect so much yet. My therapist knows I used to be a sex addict when I was younger because it took my mind away from the bad things.

I've really come to notice lately that when becoming close with someone romantically, I tend to take on this mindset that's like ""why are we doing this, I'm not special, no one's special. There's always other people that give you validation, why do I matter?""
And things of that nature. 

I've always had a few issues with relationships and vulnerability nothing that's ever really been major. But this has been a rather recent development and I can't seem to shake that feeling. It's like I get close to someone and BAM. I'm suddenly depressed and cynical and nihilistic. 


I thought potentially I've some trust issues. Or perhaps issues with allowing myself to be vulnerable. But I've met someone recently who I clicked with like you wouldn't believe, she made note of the fact that we were like the same person, and I find myself letting my guard down more than I've ever been able to, but in that same regard, as much as we click, I don't feel compelled to date her.

This feeling only goes when im asleep and I just want it to stay like that.

im so confused with this life. some days im really happy and so confident and other days it feels like a heavy load of bricks I have to carry just to get out of bed. i hate that me being like this makes my mum sad too. i feel selfish for bringing her down with me.  

people at my school think im one of the happiest people they know. Ive been told this a few times and im always so shocked to hear it because I know how sad my own thoughts are. are all happy people as sad as this inside? I tell myself that sadness is apart of life and when I do have happy moments, those moments are so good because they're rare. I'm 18 years old and it already feels like I've fought so hard. i am so scared of the future when I will have real problems on top of this. Im so scared. I find it really hard to be excited about the future. Sure, I say im excited and sometimes I feel a bit of excitement, but I have just low expectations of myself im worried I will live up to these shitty expectations. 

I have this image of life being filled with only the sad parts. If I get into a relationship, I never live in the moment, I have such little faith in life that I assume it will break before anything even starts. I assume the worst before it happens. 

Sorry, I don't expect any advice here because I don't think that made a lot of sense. It was refreshing to write it out at least. Im kind of scared to think about how I feel too much. Im scared of a diagnosis because then I cant even change this and its not just a phase of my life. and im scared of me being fine aswell because then why am i like this?

142,"yesterday at the lunch my father was commenting on the foods i eat. my diet at the time consisted mostly of pasta and some other things which i, personally, wouldnt consider to be too unhealthy since in my country most of the things we eat are home-made.

its important to note that my father was always an asshole. he'd abuse me mentally, verbally and i do recall times where it got physical, although physically it's not as common, so i don't see a point in asking for help. i believe other people need the help i'd get more. 

my best chance as of now, for my grand escape, is to marry an american and get a green card that way. 

my father is also obese, i'd say, although most of the males over 50 are that way here. 

anyhow, i had always had problems with myself and ive gone true many episodes in which i'd go without food or water for a long time. he's aware of that.
i've also done harm to myself, other than not eating, he knows that too.

my body shape makes it so i always look 'skinny-thick'. i have gained weight since this school year began due stress but most of it went to either my butt or my breasts, i wouldnt say i look much different from the time i used to watch out on what im consuming. its just the health and the state that gives a change at times like those.

so he says i should watch what i eat, and of course its triggering so i ask him to stop, and then he starts shitting about stuff unrelated to what we're talking about, he also tells me i'll regret it one day and so on.
he often has episodes like these, so it's no surprise to me.
however, i finish eating and go to my room.

now i sleep with my corset and i haven't eaten in about 18 hours.

It's also pigmented. My whole body has all ranges of skin colors. My mom is very very attractive. One of the most attractive women I know. Tall fair petite. My father is also very handsome though he has higher melanin. Me,on the other hand turned out to be a dark baby. Much darker than anyone in my family has expected. I didn't really care about it while I was younger but now that I'm grown it has messed my mental health. Even my brother has clearer better skin. On some days my skin looks clear and I'm feeling like baddest b ever. Days like these are once in a blue moon. Since the quarantine the insecurity has only worsened. I look at the mirror more than I regularly would and it just kills my whole vibe. My family wonders why I am so rude. They don't know this anger is insecurity and pain in disguise. Whenever I meet my parent's relatives, I can see in their eyes how they're kinda disapprove with how I turned out. I'm asian so being dark is a no no. No matter how hard I try to live my skin, it just doesn't work. All my friends are beautiful. Further,my boyfriend is extremely good looking.

Honestly idk why I'm bothering to update this post; nobody asked me to and I doubt anyone will even read it. Maybe putting my story into words will help me process what's happening and give me a point of reference as I move forward into the unknown.

What a week. I spent the first few days back home visiting select friends and family (yes proper social distancing and precautions) and exploring/discussing options for housing. 

I went and visited ""the island"" and spent a couple days drinking, doing coke and working my ass off cleaning out one of the old cabins and making some improvements. It was fun and took my mind off of life for a bit, but it didnt take long for me to realize that the lifestyle there was simply unsustainable for me. The easy access to booze and drugs with zero accountability make for a really tempting but really awful combination. On my last day there I ran out of my meds and knew I needed to get outta there before I started to slide. 

I ended up back at my mom's place. I think that was on monday, and I spend the next four days curled up in a sleeping bag on a bed in a room in my moms workshop. I am nothing without my adderall, I'm a shell of a person. All it took to put me there was my mom asking if I could tackle a certain project for her. I'm not sure how to explain it but something about the realization that I *couldn't* do the thing she asked when I was in the state I was in made everything crash in and around me overwhelming me and sending me into a deep depression. 

Yesterday I finally was able to talk to my doctor and she made some adjustments to my meds, she actually increased my script for adderall so I wouldn't run out early. I'm gonna try SO HARD to only take it how I'm supposed to. I can't keep doing this fucking insane rollercoaster. 

She is also hooking me up with a case manager through mental health and addiction services and says she can get me into a group home for temporary housing so that's an option I guess. 

I filled my prescription and within 30 minutes of taking my addy I was back to normal. No, *better* than normal - I felt great!

I had a couple phone calls to make.

First, I talked to my now ex-gf. The conversation was more of a monologue (thanks addy) but she agreed with every point. All the things I had been agonizing over in my mind and crying myself to sleep thinking about were now crystal clear, concise and organized in my mind. They made their way out of my mouth in an easy, empathetic and logical manner and I found myself setting her free from the bonds of my mental illness. 

That's a really poetic way of saying we agreed to break up so she wouldn't have to put up with my shit anymore. I wasn't bringing anything to the table and I could feel myself becoming more of a burden and less stable the longer I was there. 

Bipolar fucking sucks for everyone. 

Next conversation was with my mom. Her and I have never been able to communicate well about these kinds of things, but I needed to address the fact that I just completely and utterly shut down and isolated myself for 4 days in her shop because she asked me to do a thing. 

It went really well. 

Again I was able to just clearly and easily explain why I had reacted the way I did, what was going on with my meds and my situation in general. She admitted she has no idea what to do with me or how to handle the situation when I'm not well. 

We discussed it. 

I asked if I could stay for another week while I got my living situation figured out, but clearly living there with her isnt an option either. I'm simply too unstable right now and it isnt fair to her to put her through my shit either. 

So with my options for living dwindling I find myself having to choose between living in my car (which *reeks* like gasoline now due to a spilled Jerry can in the trunk), or living in a group home. 

I've never lived in a group home before. 

My doctor says its staffed 247 and they provide a meal or two per day. That's literally all I know about it. I'm not worried about the other tenants at all, I'm worried about the restrictions. I highly value my freedom, but living in a stinky car in the midst of a pandemic might not be the wisest choice for now. 

Now for some good news.

I got the call yesterday from my disability case manager letting me know that my claim is all but approved. There's one more hurdle to go - my application, recommended for approval by my CM, is reviewed by a board for accountability purposes. Should get the final word early next week. I havent had an income (been off work due to my mental health) since before christmas so this is big... I fucking made it through the 4 month elimination period. Used up all my EI, my savings (RRSPS), gave up my house and filed for bankruptcy, but I fucking MADE IT. Now that I am assured a steady reliable income for the next two years I can actually start to focus on my recovery! 

It feels good to end this on somewhat of a positive note.

I don't know where else to ask for help, so I'll try getting hints or ideas here. I have been feeling really weird since january. There are episodes where this weird feeling is more intense, and there are other times when I feel nearly normal. But the 'less intense version' of the feeling is present more or less most of the time.
When I get the 'intense version' of this feeling, I kinda get a bit dizzy, feel really weird and shitty and can't read or talk or understand anyone or anything, no matter how hard I try, for a few minutes. It's so hard to describe this feeling, but I've got the suspicion that it's a feeling I knew since childhood, something my mind digs up from the deepest depths. It differs a bit from time to time.

I knew this feeling beforehand, I had it maybe one, two or three times a year since I was a kid and only the 'intense' version - now it's been with me since january which is really unusual. I also didn't know the 'less intense' version. 
Another thing: I've been smoking weed a few times since last year in october. Now I'm assuming this triggered the feeling and everything else related to it. I stopped smoking weed in february and won‚Äôt do it again. Will this feeling go away after a few months? What is it called? I tried researching it but didn't find anything helpful.

In the past year I gained quite some weight, my relationship has been rocky and I've had quite some issues at work. I started feeling worthless and unlovable and my self-esteem is the worst it's ever been.

The thing that bothers me is that I've been kind of having problems with connecting to the people I love and who were always good to me.

One example is my mother... she's so loving, supportive... my best friend. And she never held a grudge to me even when she maybe should have. I've been a problematic teen.. not extremely, but enough for it to weigh on me... but she never took it as something to make me feel bad about.

Lately I've been even feeling like she doesn't love me, like she's suddenly hating me for all my mistakes, like she thinks that I didn't grow up and started being a responsible person. I've started nitpicking some things she says and feeling like she's 'indirectly' trying to question me because she thinks I'm still misbehaving or that I'm bad, worthless...

stop asking me about my fucking grades every chance you get. do you know how I sob and slice my arms everytime their below my expectations? and for fucks sake stop telling me that you admire how skinny I am.

I know I dont jump like I used to. i dont even get why my school accepted me for track. theres so much pressure and I cut myself every time I dont reach a good distance.

I‚Äôve hated hugging for as long as I can remember, I can‚Äôt remember my childhood very clearly but I don‚Äôt think I hugged my parents very often - I wasn‚Äôt neglected or anything, they‚Äôre just not very physical people. I do remember that every time my brothers and I fought - psychically or verbally, my mum would tell us to hug to make up. I‚Äôm not sure if because of this, hugging has underlying negative connotations for me? While not at its worst now, hugging makes me extremely uncomfortable to the point I feel sick. When people touch me, even just lightly on the arm, I often feel it for the rest of the day and it makes me feel really uncomfortable and sick as well. 

The strangest part of it to me is that the closer I am to someone, the more uncomfortable I am with touching them. A lot of my friends/ people close to me make a big deal out of or make fun of me for hating hugs which makes me feel guilty and that I‚Äôm not normal. While everyone in my family gets on really well, we never hug each other - not even my parents. I can remember the last 2 times I hugged my mother - one was last year, and the other probably 3-4 years ago. I don‚Äôt remember the last time I hugged my brothers or father, but the closest I got to it was consoling my older brother as he was extremely upset (and drunk) last year. 

The thought of hugging my family makes me feel sick, as well as the thought of hugging most other people. I avoid situations where I am expected to hug people as much as I can and I previously couldn‚Äôt stop myself from telling people I hate hugging if they tried, or while they hugged me despite how uncomfortable it made the situation. 

Basically, the things that confuse me the most are the fact that when people touch me I can feel it for hours afterwards, which makes me feel sick, and that I‚Äôm more comfortable hugging people I barely know than people I love. There are also certain people who I can‚Äôt stand being touched by, and physically flinch away from - this upsets them a lot which makes me feel terrible. 

I know this didn‚Äôt stem from something serious like abuse, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs normal. Again I have a pretty good relationship with my parents and I‚Äôm really close with my brothers- especially my older brother. While I used to have pretty bad social anxiety, l‚Äôve always had really strong friendships and I‚Äôm now really social and make friends easily and I have lots of really close friends. I also don‚Äôt have much of a problem with intimacy. 

I have a fear of people touching/squeezing my sides which puts me on edge pretty often and I‚Äôll get uncontrollably angry and upset if someone does it. It also makes my back hurt heaps. I‚Äôm not sure how much this relates to hating hugging though. 

If anyone has any suggestions as to what this could be or can relate, please let me know!!",02May2020,1

‚ÄîTw‚Äî: Suicide, Anxiety, Depression

Hello good friends and the like.  I hope you‚Äôre doing fine, but I‚Äôd like to cut to the chase.

What do y‚Äôall cats think about content creators and their approach to mental health?

[I believe context will be important here. These people are playing horror maps, with intent to find a map that is truly scary. Their play style is very giggly and non serious at all]
I was watching a YTer on my recommended who was playing some MC maps; one of that had a blatant disclaimer about the map containing themes such as suicide and depression.  
Upon wandering into these situations where the theme is most climactic, the commentators simply kept to their aloof selves and just kinda slid away from talking about the issues in general.

(TW) &gt; the one only big examples of this is they came across a ‚Äúnoose‚Äù and a sign next to it saying ‚Äúdo it :)‚Äù
Which I assume is alluding to a voice in one‚Äôs mind as they experience it.  They simply brushed it off and said ‚Äúhey guys look it‚Äôs just a switch!‚Äù Followed shortly after with one of the commentators just jumping in and saying ‚ÄúALLEEE OOOP‚Äù

(TW) &gt; after that they were in a (for lack of better words) small room, where a ‚Äúvoice‚Äù spoke, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre nothing. You dont matter‚Äù and other things like that.
One commentator just said, ‚Äúdude this is like the edgy stuff my little sister writes in her diary.‚Äù

This whole experience really stood out to me, because now-a-days most creators are careful about these issues and make sure there is a clear message on how they view the current conflict(s). The creators I spoke of did not do so in any way, shape, or form.

Yes, I understand that some people just have a style of things, 
And yes, maybe its because it‚Äôs been pounded into my head that people give some sort of small serious talk about these things before and after they finish the supposed action,
But it really struck me off with how they approached it.  Sure its not their style at all, they have no need to touch upon it, but I‚Äôm just awestricken.  Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm huge into the mental illnesses stuff, and if thats so, i can find a way out of it.

I simply want to hear all of your opinions.  What do you think about content creators who cover things that allude (either directly or indirectly) to mental illnesses/health?  Should they have some sort of message on what they think about it?  Any other thoughts? 

Sorry for long post; Whoever you are, I love you and care about you.  You‚Äôre doing amazing and your progress is noticeable.  Have an awesome night! &lt;3",02May2020,1

167,"CW depression, suicidal ideation, COVID

im a doctor working in NYC right now. I'm not in the ICU or the ER but I am seeing COVID patients daily. Last year when I was depressed and suicidal, on meds, in therapy. In intern year I saw some terrible stuff that gave me PTSD.  I  recently started to feel like I was getting better, healing, feeling supported and then this hit. 

In March I restarted medications anticipating I'd struggle with what is happening, and upped the frequency of therapy. I am not quite back to the level of depression I'd previously had, and my schedule at work is much more humane than it was at my last training location but I am still really suffering. I feel moral injury over the fact that so many people in power are just OK with me dying if it means the economy recovers - and there is no real expectation for support other than bullshit jet flyovers, cheering and pizza parties. I hate it when people call me a ""hero"" - I feel very small, insignificant, and pathetic right now. Even more I hate the people protesting lockdown, clamoring for ""natural immunity"" to take it s course and our politicians urging reopening while we still are this under-resourced. And I feel hopeless about things being okay again. I am already planning to take leave from work over the summer.  I dont feel like I can yet. I don't know. I worry I may not be able to actually practice medicine at all after this, and having spent so many years of my life and so much money trying to pursue it. 

Ive started to think about how I wish I'd actually killed myself last year, so I wouldn't have to suffer through this. Im not sure that Ive had enough good in the last 2 years to outweigh the bad and I am adding to my trauma and now having body pain that I am afraid will become chronic pain like I see in many of my patients. last night, I started trying to calculate if I had enough of certain medications in my home to kill myself.  I took some pills to just help me sleep and then went to bed, and I dont want to kill myself right now but.. it's so hard. 

I just need to say this somewhere so I dont lose my shit. Im too scared to tell my therapist about it yet or my husband or my other close friends because it's scaring me. I know I need to.

169,"Most people are self-limiting. We can do way more than we believe. Even worse, most of us underrate ourselves, and sell ourselves short. The result is that most of us suffer from feelings of inferiority.

I was one of them. Suffering from axiety, depression, and a general sense of misery.

In the past four months, I studied the subconsious mind. Not only theoretically, but putting what I learned into practice.

I learned that 95% of our behavior, feeling, and response is habitual and automatic. These automatic habits are not set in stone. They can be changed.

While I believe that I have only scrached the surface, here are some of my results:

* I feel better than ever
* I feel young, full of energy
* I look forward to the future, ‚Äúthe best is yet to come‚Äù
* I am calmer and more relaxed
* I sleep better
* I feel ‚Äúone‚Äù with the Universe, I am ‚Äúin flow‚Äù

Here is the summary of what I have learned, including my ""personal workbook"" of exercises and habits: [https://remo.org/2020/04/30/subconscious-mind/](https://remo.org/2020/04/30/subconscious-mind/)

172,"Hi all,

Looking for some advice. I will do my best to put everything in a concise readable page but bear with me, it covers a lot lol. I may crosspost to r/selfimprovement as this post rubs up on both subs but I am curious what the different groups would say.

While not going in extreme long winded detail, I find myself struggling with a few different aspects of my life. I struggle with making new connections with both friends or meeting potential dates. My self confidence is extremely low when it comes to this. This contrasts with my work. I work in the hotel industry as a manager. As a good manager (i think lol), you meet and engage with all kinds of people, guests and employees, so when it comes to whats needed I feel ok speaking and networking on a 'work' basis, even presentations.

But when I am not at work, all my confidence goes out the window, I do not feel comfortable at all trying to meet different people. This actively prohibits me from doing the things I want to do (in this case meet new friends and dates). I should note I just moved to a new city, no family or established friends here.

Im going to pause here and move to a different point and bring it back together....

Another area I am concerned about is my career trajectory. In general I think the hotel biz offers a lot of opportunity to move up into corporate or anywhere. Even bring your experience out of the biz with the business, sales, maintenance experience, etc you get into something else. When I started about 7 years ago, it was a front desk agent, but quickly went to supervisor and Assistant GM in about 18 months. But since then I have been in the same position (across different properties and some pay raise but same position itself) ...

Now going back to the first point, something I realized about why I am so hesitant and shy to meet new people is I feel like I don't have much to offer.

When people become good friends or dating partners, its usually because each person gets something out of it right? I don't mean selfishly, but beneficially. You could be friends with someone because you guys do the same fun stuff together or work out buddies or theyre nice to talk to, etc. You date someone because they make you laugh, theyre attractive, they do volunteer work, etc. It could be any reason but you get the idea.

I don't try engaging with people because I really doubt what I bring to the table and worry i do not have a good personality beyond my work. Both guys and girls, I am sure you can think of someone, who you thought was boring  or 1 dimensional.  I thought about some of things that you all may suggest. I tried getting into some new hobbies but didn't stick with them because I wasn't enjoying it. I can try again and maybe it will stick but I am not optimistic.

In my career, the natural next step would be general manager (or a few different pathways), but I have been hesitant to move up. One reason being I am not sure if I am responsible or ready to do it even though I have been told I am very qualified. Second reason being I am not sure that I *want* to.

After some thoughts, I think I THINK I came to a conclusion to why I struggle with both of these items. With socializing and why I can't stick with trying new things AND my career and why I am hesitant to move into another spot.

I think it is because in all honesty **I am not passionate about anything**. And when I use the word passionate, I mean more as a concept, not necessarily as say like a hobby although that is true too. But you get what I mean. And correct me if I should use a different word here. But back to my point. On paper I think I am doing ok but I feel like I am living as a robot. In my early 30s, I have a nice apartment, new furniture. I have a new car, I have a job that pays decent. No kids. Not saying this to gloat or something but to make my point. I think I am doing everything I am 'supposed' to be doing but I am definitely not getting any joy out of my day to day life. I wake up, get ready for work, drive, work, will say this the best part of my day (not extraordinarily but more because there is no other peak in my day) as I get out of the house and get to socialize with my coworkers and guests, go home, hangout at the house, go to sleep, and repeat. &lt;---That seriously is my day everyday besides maybe a grocery run or something.

Back to an earlier point I made: some people say get hobbies for example. That's great idea seriously, but I have never been able to stick with anything new or had a willingness to try. Again because I am not **passionate** enough to try. In this case passionate to be outgoing (not necessarily passionate about the hobby itself) and I don't think that is healthy. I keep using that word because I think most healthy people are passionate about *something.* Could be sports, working out, science, charity, whatever. So that even if they don't like a single hobby, they'll replace it with something else. That hasn't happened with me.

The same with my work, I feel like I have lost a passion in my work. I still do it, it pays the bills and the people are nice. I know some will argue that this happens to a lot of people and thats true, except I can not think of anything I would be passionate about to switch careers and pursue.

Concisely, I find myself not excited about 'anything'. Sounds pretty overdramatic but in a day to day sense, thats a true statement. I am wondering about the thoughts of strangers and what advice, if any, you may have.

176,"Hello everyone,

Im   writing out of curiosity and to get some clarification, I would like  to  ask some of you who have recovered from depression, about cognitive   impairement, I am a 20 year old male currently going through an anti   depressant therapy for the first time in my life , I believe I am in   depression since i was 17 since I moved out my parents house at 16 and   had to study / work and I initially only could afford to pay rent and   would have nothing to spend on myself and have any fun at all, my whole   existance was just paying for my existance and not doing anything but   that , now its different but the depression is still here, I did have   periods of recovery but they were short and I would go into remission   within a week.

for the first year   of my depression I wasn't affected all that much and didnt have any   major cognitive impairement but for the last 2 years , I feel like I have   dementia , I was an A\* grade mathematics and physics student and   enjoyed anything to do with maths, however now I can barley process   anything and I have extremely slow thinking to the point where I find it   difficult to comprehend with speech in movies and therefore even when I   try to find joy in something I get knocked of it because my thinking  is  just so slow, therefore I cant watch a movie without switching it  off  in 5 minutes and going into a state of doing nothing and just  feeling  hopeless. I have friends But I dont see them all that much  anymore due  to the covid-19 situation, and to be honest I wasnt seeing  them all that  much before it either for the year before it but before  was really  social went out to parties, did drugs. Not in a relationship  for 2 years  now broke up a year into my depression. I pretty much have  no one at  this point in time.

I  would like  to know preferably from someone who recovered , did the  cognitive  impairement go away or is it a life long burden, logically i  would like  to think that if there is no depression there should be no  symptoms of  cognitive impairement. however even when I felt better for  some periods  of time , I still saw no major change and improvement in  my cognition.  Will this ever end and will I ever be sharp as  I once  was , I would  like to hear honest answers and not just some dilusive  help of giving  hope. thanks everyone I would really appriciate this.

My passion is to help people, I have made this my life goal, my career goal, and it is what truly makes me happy and get me through bad times. 

Thats why after graduated from the best engineer school in the country, I joined the army as an engineer officer instead of choosing the corporate world. I truly enjoyed being an junior rank leader, where I get to mentor a lot of younger kids and did a lot of domestic deployment like flood and fire mitigation etc.

I also volunteer at red cross, distress call centre, hospital, and help my friend run a weekly soup kitchen.

Even my email enquiries regarding general recruiting questions, written politely, only resulted ""we will contact you if we are interested"" replies.

I get it, it's a job application, they have every right to reject me and I was mentally prepared for it.

What is setting me off is that how well I know them, how bureaucratic and superficial they are.

A year ago, one of my new privates had operation stress syndrome during an exercise, he later decided to quit, absolutely believe that he is not good enough for the job. I couldn't convince him alone so I send a memo to my chain of command asking for some help. Two month there is nothing back, mean while the CoC is sending out mental health materials, feel good posters and even a little green ""soldier's card"" to put inside your wallet.

And I think police is just the same as my CoC, all talk but no shit getting done.

For the past five month, the recruiting department is doing women-in-police seminars, new badges for mental health, zoom Q&amp;A. Their chief is on the news saying things about need for more recruitment etc, yet can't even bother to reply an email.

This morning they posted a new ""future of policing, join us"" poster on their twitter, which makes me want to scream at them.

However, coronavirus showed up and everything went to absolute shit (it gets even worse because my country is not taking the pandemic serious). I still do therapy online and now things have come to a point where both my therapist and I understood I can't deal with this on my own anymore.

I think a few months ago I realized there was something wrong, and I‚Äôm pretty sure I have OCD, I exhibit many of the symptoms to strong levels. But I‚Äôve always had this constant, nagging fear that there‚Äôs no problem at all and I‚Äôm just doing this for attention. (Probably because of my parents) Because of this, I want to get a diagnosis more valid than a self-diagnosis, and see a therapist to help me get better. But my parents have always adamantly denied that there was ever something wrong with me. They always invalidate my feelings.

 When I was twelve, I wrote a story for a contest about two immortals who wanted to commit suicide, and showed it to my parents so they could give me feedback. But as my mom was driving me home from a piano lesson, she started lecturing me about how I shouldn‚Äôt write about those things because they‚Äôre adult things, and I have no idea what they‚Äôre like. But I do, I just have never been able to tell her because she wouldn‚Äôt have taken me seriously. This year it‚Äôs worse, I wanted to submit a poetry collection to another contest but I just stopped because i thought to myself that no contest would ever accept something as dark and awful as my poetry and I can‚Äôt bear to show it to my parents. It‚Äôs about depression and suicide and all my insecurities. I‚Äôm still young, and I think that‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt believe me.

But that was depression, and now there‚Äôs something more debilitating and permanent, and I don‚Äôt know how to get help. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to ask my parents for a therapist. The conversation would just be awkward. How do I do this?",02May2020,1

191,"(So the first part of the post got a little long-- I swear I tried to trim it down and give the bare bones of context, but it didn't work the best. The actual advice request starts at 'So. Here I am.')

Okay. 

So a couple months ago [I made this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/eym53h/not_exactly_sure_what_to_do_ventadvice/) about a conflict with my DnD group of friends, and well. It's escalated in a way. This is all happening in the same group of 9 friends, just to mke sure. 

So, in mid February, I had a bit of a conflict with one of my friends while playing Minecraft, and in a panic I asked another friend in the group whether or not I should take a break. Both she and my DM agreed that I take a break from the game for a while, and I agreed to take a break from the game until the end of the semester. 

Then, when I went on our group's Minecraft server (we had switched worlds and I wanted to rebuild), my DM suggested I stay away from the server so my presence doesn't make people angry, which, you know, fair. And things carried on as normal. 

Until a couple weeks later, when in a fit of anxiety fueled paranoia, I asked my DM whether or not my friends secretly hated me and this was a convoluted method of getting me out of the group. He didn't reply no, and instead told me that it's probably better if I take a break from the discord and chill out. I didn't want to, but I figured it was better for the group and muted the discord, while still being in it. And I admit, every so often I would peek in, and see what everyone was talking about, and getting hurt that it seemed like no one seemed to miss me. 

Then I fucked up, and got a big letter telling me that \*until further notice\* I wasn't allowed in the Discord because of it. That was three weeks ago. I haven't been in a good place, mental health wise, since (compounded by the quarantine, struggling with schoolwork while at home, my family falling apart, etc etc), and I keep flipping back and forth between ""these people don't care about me and never had and never will, and I'm hurt and I should hurt them back and/or leave the group because they haven't kept me in mind"" and ""I'm a terrible person to have let it get this far, the only person I can blame is myself, and I should never speak in the group again and/or leave the group so I don't run the risk of hurting them ever again"". 

So. Here I am. 

I want to get better, and get back to my friends, and get back to being normal, cuz a lot of this has happened in the last few months. I don't want to keep talking over my friends and hurting them. I don't want to get in trouble again. I want to keep playing and having fun. In my friend's letter, they pointed out how I constantly complained in the discord, interrupted people, and constantly pivoted the attention to myself. And they're right, I'm very self absorbed and a straight up attention whore. But I don't know how to work on any of that, and I don't want to keep going back to the same person I've been talking to about this to ask for advice because they're not my therapist and they don't deserve to be treated like that. 

I've already tried to cut back on complaining about stuff in my other discords, but how do I work on not pivoting a conversation to be about myself all the time??? How do I relate a story I want to share without coming off as dominating the conversation??? How do I work on not interrupting people??? How do I work on being a better team player in general??? How do I fix myself???",02May2020,1
192,"Over the last few months, I have increasingly felt like my life is governed and controlled by some unseen entity/force. Things that should feel arbitrary and random, somehow feel orchestrated or staged. Sometimes too convenient. Like something or someone is very knowingly messing with me.

What brought this feeling on, is the experience of very inexplicable coincidences. Some call them synchroncities. They feel very uncanny and deliberate. I feel like sometimes people just say the right things, like very specific to what I've already been thinking. Which feels odd. I sometimes feel like I don't really get a perspective different to mine, when I reach out to other people.

199,"hello all. a little about me - i‚Äôve been wanting to become a nurse since i was 15. Since then I‚Äôve been working my way towards that goal since then. There have been lots of tears and passion going towards that goal.

I have years worth of relevant volunteer/work experience (hospital, suicide hotline voluneer, i work at our school‚Äôs nursing faculty).
I‚Äôm in my final year of university and these are the grades that they‚Äôll be looking at when I apply for nursing school. I worked really hard and achieved a 3.6 GPA. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the strongest candidate to apply but I would say I have a chance.

For some reason I just feel like a ‚Äúfraud‚Äù. I feel like due to the pandemic all my classes were online so my finals were easier (?) they were open-book, we had more time to complete them, we had shorter final exams.

I‚Äôm trying to tell myself that I deserve these grades because I took all of my midterms pre-quarantine in normal exam conditions and I scored high, so thats why my final grades were higher. My finals were only weighted 5% or 30% and my midterms were weighed higher. I guess I feel like because I didn‚Äôt get examined on the full course material in normal settings I feel a bit like a fraud.

I guess the reason why I feel like a fraud is because I‚Äôve always been a little below average in like 60% of my classes. Even if I scored an 81, the class average would be 85. This includes pre-reqs i took for nursing. These have all been me studying to the best of my abilities at that time.

Because of this, I‚Äôm questioning my own ability to be able to pass nursing school. One of my worst fears is failing nursing school and wasting thousands of dollars. Sometimes I feel like no matter how hard I try, I can‚Äôt achieve the grade I wanted/was expecting. It‚Äôs making me consider social work instead and diminishing the passion I had for nursing. I remember crying when I scored low on a respiratory exam earlier this year and I felt so inadequate even though I studied 2 weeks in advance + devoted hours on it. I just don‚Äôt want to give up on something I haven‚Äôt even tried yet but I‚Äôm really struggling with imposter syndrome/self-doubt.

205,"Hey guys, 

So recently I think I‚Äôve been experiencing a lot of depersonalization at varying levels. Some days it‚Äôs pretty mild, and others it‚Äôs more intense. 

My symptoms include feeling like I‚Äôm living within or behind my eyes, trouble remembering things or recalling memories vividly, and a general feeling of anxiety due to said symptoms. Almost like life isn‚Äôt real or I‚Äôm in a dream/simulation. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going crazy, though it does feel that way sometimes. But my awareness and ability to sum things up as, ‚Äújust feeling off,‚Äù is what helps ground me back to reality. 

I‚Äôm not sure what is causing these feelings. I‚Äôve definitely experienced depersonalization in the past‚Äîsometimes it‚Äôs the environment I‚Äôm in, high levels of stress, etc‚Äîbut this round seems to be messing with me more than other times in the past.

Because of the ongoing pandemic and stress/changes it‚Äôs presented to all of our lives, it‚Äôs hard to say if these feelings are largely because of that, or because of other factors. 

I‚Äôm just seeking some advice from those who have also experienced this kind of depersonalization and how you coped/worked through it?

218,"So this is yet another person obviously affected by the pandemic. Boo hoo you can ignore this.

So in my situation, I was in my final year of sixth form, and I had it so very thoroughly planned out, working hard on my exams and also high restricting on my body due to disordered eating to make sure I had the best summer ever and I felt my best. 

So for a while, I allowed myself to eat to I guess, make sure I had a working immune system. But because of all the stress, I had in the house, with a bratty sibling and too much noise (I‚Äôm also autistic) it turned into this depressive binging of ‚ÄúEh no one‚Äôs gonna see me who cares might as well self destruct‚Äù because I felt hopeless about the future and saw no point in coming out in good shape.

Then for a bit, I thought ‚ÄúOh wait this not healthy‚Äù because I was also massively stressing myself over the weight I inevitably gained (Which as of now is 10 lbs, remained in the healthy weight BMI).

So I tried to start planning out a semi-spontaneous routine and a healthy diet where I didn‚Äôt overeat, still indulged every once in a while but most importantly, tried finding better coping mechanisms.

I started browsing clothing stores to cope with stress, I guess entering an escapist fantasy of the cute things I‚Äôd wear, and thought ‚ÄúI‚Äôll buy this once I reach this goal‚Äù. I started to feel hopeful again because I thought I had loads of time until the lockdown lifted, and even though I wouldn‚Äôt be 100% complete on the outside, I would have a much clearer mind. So for a couple of days, things looked good, I felt a bit better was able to manage my stress and depression better.

But then the last thing I expected to happen happened: My boyfriend all of a sudden broke up with me.

And frankly, I don‚Äôt even care that he broke up, but I was shattered because of the disgustingly terrible timing. When I had told him I had gone depressed and needed some support, he couldn‚Äôt wait to propose the breakup when I was in a better state of mind and with all the help I had given him in the past, I at least expected that consideration given my situation was a lot worse than his. So I felt betrayed.

On top of that, he was the only person I ever really talked to, the only person who came to talk to me first when my entire life, everyone just threw me under the bus. I felt like I lost the only thing I had left socially. (When fucking hell, he has real friends and so many good things going on in his life, and he KNEW I had no one else)

So the cycle repeated. I feel like life is telling me it‚Äôs not worth it to have goals because something‚Äôs just gonna come and ruin it. Kinda like that song from Linkin Park, ‚ÄúIn the end, it doesn‚Äôt even matter‚Äù.

And now trying to return to the escapist fantasy makes me feel even worse because now I see no purpose in anything. What‚Äôs the point in going somewhere if I can‚Äôt show someone pics and they‚Äôre interested? What‚Äôs the point in looking good and feeling good when I don‚Äôt care for myself in the first place and I don‚Äôt have anyone waiting for me to reunite? What‚Äôs the point in buying things if I have no reason to work for it so I can feel like I deserve them?

My mother is telling me that things will be better once university starts but honestly, I‚Äôm scared. I was not given the proper chance to prepare myself and I feel like I‚Äôll just get in looking retarded and giving a bad impression. A motivator would be to make sure I‚Äôll give a good impression and prepare, but it‚Äôs such a new thing and a massive change on top of the pandemic that it‚Äôs overwhelming me.

I really wanna die, but my corpse self would be a bigger burden so I try not to act on it. But now I‚Äôm in desperate need of an optimistic mindset and hope that can motivate me to take care of myself better.

219,"So lately ive been having a hard time knowing whats a dream and not. And i dont know what to do...

So in my dreams i can look at my phone, count my fingers, tell time  and blah blah blah... but what makes it hard is that some dreams restart with me in bed. So when i wake up in my bed i dont know if its real or not. Secondly i see minor shadows, flashes and hear noises. Like simple, small stuff usually. 

Like this was my last dream: 
So i got called by my sister at 9-10 ish n after that i fell asleep again. Its just that in the dream i couldnt fall aslepp, yeh... i looked up i was in bed i picked up my phone checked instagram a few mins went back to tryin to sleep. After a while a heard somethin u kno like somethin slamming a door o dropping somethin that u do when u have neighbours. But i always think its someone tryin to get in my place (thanks to the knife guy last year). So i went up about to check if my door was locked. U kno theres like a mirror before my bathroom that i just next to my outerdoor. So i bend down to get like a smudge of the floor real quick n i look up into the mirror and in the mirror i see that backside of a leg (the back of the knee kinda) but according to the mirror the person standing there would have stood infront of me, i double check. Im scared. Its a leg alright. Dream restarts. Im laying in bed, i hear the noise thinking of the same thing ""check the door"" but i feel like someone is watching me. Im laying on my stomach head in my pillow. I turn around AND I SEE MY-FUCKING-SLEF STANDING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF MY BED. Not looking at me, standing facing my bookshelf like a character model. Stiff.  i freak out. Dream restarts. I get to the same point where i turn around and i see myself. Freakout again. But this time he?me?the dude? Reaches out his hand in a geature like im supposed to give him?myself? Something AND LOOKING AT ME!. I freak out cuss now MY-FUCKIN-SELF MOVED. Dream restarts. But this time i look up in bed seeing MY-FUCKING-SELF standing there. He turns his head around reaches out his hand with the same intent of me needing to give him something. But this time i was so much closer to myself. Dream desides that im all of a sudden next to my fridge, where my mirror is. Next to the fridge is my clothes drying rack thingie. I grab it and bolt for MYSELF? HIS? side/stomach. It goes through him. The stomach, shoulder up to his face starts looking blurry. Like i could see them but at the same time not. Legs and arms are still clear as day. He is still holding out his arm. The only thing clear in his face was his eyes. They looked like chrystals. Way too detailed. And then it ended

The problem is that i tend so see myself alot due to me working as a catwalk and photo model...

So what i need is a ""tell""... so far voices have worked but no one's really talking to me so voices are hard to get by (youtube and spotify dont work). Also im gonna see a docror on tuesday, but until then kind of a thing... and if the doctor dont have anything that works.

Any ideas?",02May2020,1
220,"Hello all I'm just looking for some input on this I don't want to go into too many personal details other than looking to see what people think about this behavior 



A family member we live with exhibits the following behavior:


- They can't admit fault at all anything wrong with their home or in their life is someone else's fault. Doesn't matter what it is could be something as simple as a roof leak on the front porch from a poor repair job to a serious life matter. It is never their fault always someone else's.



- Very quick to anger it's usually their go to response to most situations. 



- Very strong paranoia they feel as if their neighbors do things intentionally to them.



- Very high opinion of themselves and their accomplishments general talk down about others who have ""lesser"" accomplishments or education.



- Behave as if they are the resident expert on every topic in existence.



- Takes any form of criticism as a personal attack



There is more but those are the main behavior traits also this person is very old school and from the Era where mental health issues is considered a weakness so discussing this with them is completely out. I am mainly doing this as a coping mechanism I guess.

Now it‚Äôs been almost two months since I‚Äôve had face-to-face communication with anyone. I get sick easily so I‚Äôve been terrified to go out.

223,"He's still alive. My mum is his caretaker and thankfully,  keeps him on his meds. 

I was in my mid teens when the dam burst but I can't remember a time when I was able to look to him for stability or guidance - certainly not a father figure.  

So,  I don't now, nor have I ever had the luxury of a father.  While present physically,  he was not capable of filling the role.  

My anger in that regard passed long ago. 

However,  now I find myself angry because he simply stopped trying.  He ate himself to nearly half a ton, stopped working, reading, engaging with his grandchildren (unless they came to him - no effort on his part), and turned completely inward. He suffered a mild stroke (very mild) but refused to do the rehab exercises.  One day his knee gave out and he fell. He never got back up - not because he couldn't,  he just didn't.  

He is now a complete invalid,  by choice. He has sat for so long that his hips have literally turned outwards, from the weight of his legs. My mother moves him from his bed to a recliner, several times a day, via a harness and swing. He won't use a wheelchair because they hurt his butt - so they never leave the house.  She washes him, rolls him, scratches all of his itches, and hands him everything because he won't turn to reach. She also cares for his toilet,  including adjusting his positioning because his abdominal muscles have atrophied to the point that gravity does all of the work.  

He just stopped.  

The worst part is that the schizophrenia is still there, making it impossible for him to believe that he is responsible for his condition. He won't exercise,  won't diet,  won't try. 

I don't know how to stop feeling angry at him. I've run out of pity.",02May2020,1

This is not a throwaway (obviously. look at my karma) because I don‚Äôt care if people I know see this. Maybe it will help them too. I (m,20) have had severe Obsessive Compulsive Disorder since the age of 7. I developed it as a result of childhood trauma along with other psychiatric disorders. I won‚Äôt go into detail here, as I have on old posts that were made on throwaways. Sorry. Anyway, I have posted on here several times in the past back when I was struggling, but not since I have reached the end of the tunnel. Anyway, for years I struggled with OCD. I shook doorknobs for 5 or more minutes, I counted things, I checked things, I scrubbed my hands too much, and did several other things. I literally had hundreds of obsessions that ruled my life. On top of that, I had to deal with other disorders. I then decided to go to the doctor because I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. Little did I know, I was approaching one of the toughest times in my life. For two years I had to play musical chairs with meds and therapy. Towards the end of the two years, I was practically suicidal. I stayed in my dark room only emerging to eat and shit. I looked for ways to die. I would be somewhat negligent with my life. Then one day, I decided to once again, for the millionth time and with the advice of my therapist, to get a med change. This med change may have been the best thing that has happened to my life. With these meds and therapy, I no longer shake door knobs more then a few times. It takes more than a month to empty a GermX bottle that used to take me less than a week to empty. I‚Äôm not overly afraid to shake hands with people (before Covid) and my other compulsive symptoms became irrelevant. I went from a very severe life to a normal life. Of course, OCD will always be there because it is permanent. But it stays in the shadows much more than it used to. You might ask how I did this. The first thing I did was stop obsessing over my OCD. I used to think about it constantly. I used to make it who I am. I talked about it all the time. But it didn‚Äôt stop until I got the right meds, talked to the therapist, and stopped thinking about OCD. (In they order of course. It‚Äôs impossible to do it in another order at least for me). Instead of loathing about it, I took action. Now I live a normal life. My final words for this is: whatever you do, don‚Äôt make yourself a victims as many of us have a habit  of doing. This doesn‚Äôt accomplish anything. Stand up, get meds, talk to someone, and quit thinking about it. Don‚Äôt make yourself a victim.

I live alone on a university campus and I just graduated. I had a roommate but she moved back home when everything started going downhill. Right before the quarantine, my boyfriend broke up with me randomly, and we haven‚Äôt spoken since. My friends all graduated last year and now live at home in the suburbs, and they all have boyfriends/are in (online) graduate school. Normally on the weekends, my friends would stay over at my place and we would go to the bars and hang out. 

While I definitely didn‚Äôt expect everything to open immediately, I did have some sort of hope that something would open up that could give me an additional option of something to do. I thought maybe smaller group gatherings would be allowed and my friends would be more inclined to come see me. My birthday is next week too.

My name is Sarai and I am currently studying neuroscience at Boston University. I am working with a team of Stanford graduate students on [Osmind](https://osmind.org/) to deliver a care platform for those with treatment-resistant mental health. Especially during crazy times like this, we want to provide support and do anything we can to help.

Today, we‚Äôre launching a forum for members to interact and socialize with each other. What‚Äôs different about our community is that it‚Äôs for individuals with treatment-resistant depression (people who have tried multiple types of medications for their treatments) and includes evidence-based, MD-verified content on psychedelic medicine and other types of treatments. We just hosted an [AMA on our site](https://members.osmind.org/t/ama-wed-4-29-psychedelic-medicine-expert-from-stanford/124/48) with a leading psychedelic medicine researcher and have one on [May 6th](https://members.osmind.org/t/ask-me-anything-ama-on-wed-may-6-from-400pm-pt/209) lined up with a psychedelics legal expert and one on May 13th with one of the country‚Äôs leading ketamine practitioners.

We wanted to let this group know about these resources: you can join at [https://www.osmind.org/members](https://www.osmind.org/members). Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions about what we‚Äôre doing! And feel free to pass along to any friends who might be interested.

234,"When I was younger my father was abusive, an alchoholic and would cheat on my mom. He would swear at us, hit us, threaten to kill us and hold guns to our heads. He took me and my sibling hostage once too when my mom was on the other side of the state. He told my mother she would never get to see her kids again. She did. We got home eventually and the next day, my mother ran away with us. Our aunt helped. That day my father constantly called my mom swearing at her and telling her to get home. She was traumatized. When he phoned for the last time, my aunt picked up, he said he wanted my mom to hear something she would never forget. My aunt refused, and he shot himself over the phone.

He left us bankrupt. We had no money. We were 3million rand in debt because of him and hidden accounts. Our house got repossessed by the bank. I moved 15 times as a kid due to being homeless. We have actually been properly homeless 6 times, and had to live in houses that were on sale/being renovated. We often went without food.

A different aunt of mine used to abuse me. Her family would train their dogs to attack me. They would make their pet marmoset attack me and used it to scare me. My uncle would pretend to throw knives at me too. I was always terrified there and would wet the bed. They would then make me sit outside in the blistering daytime heat (30+¬∞c /86+¬∞f) with the mattress, as well as put me in their monkey's cage as punishment. I used to get food spat into my face and would constantly be called baby when I would cry because of what was happening. Their children used to bully me too, and would make my brother bully me too. One of the most terrifying times for me there was running away from my cousins, being chased with a loaded crossbow. When I would try call my mom to fetch me, they would take away my phone.

My brother then became physically abusive towards me at home, as they has built this anger in him towards me and my mother.

When I was 6 I was molested. 

When I was in primary school I was bullied. I would get kicked and pushed. Teachers would bully and victimize me as well. I wen to a new school.

I got a scholarship for highschool but left after the 3rd year. I had arranged attacks made against me in the corridors. I'd be sworn at and attacked everyday. They were ruthless and would point out every possible thing wrong with me. I was told numerous times to go kill myself, over online bullying too. The last few weeks of grade 9. I wasn't at school for that reason.

My gran was psychologically abusive. She was abusive to my family because we had no else to go.

I started self harming at 12. I've had 7 suicide attempts. 4 of them I needed to be hospitalized for. I started smoking at 13 and drugs (CAT, LSD, Marijuana and ecstasy) at 14. Never drank though because of my father's alcoholism. 

I got diagnosed with Bipolar disorder. I would often use my medications to get high and for my suicide attempts.

I got a boyfriend. My mother never liked him so It was always a secret. He always motivated me to do better and always tried his best to help me. His parents helped me stop smoking, and he helped me with my other addictions, that I never expected to be able to stop.

All this before I was even 17

I stopped self harming for about a year until i hit a really bad stage recently. I have not touched drugs in over a year and a half.

My partner helps me a lot with controlling my disorder and helps me with breaking bad habits and building good ones. I am forever grateful. He has never taken advantage of my mental state and used it to manipulate me.

I am on my recovery path. I am not always feeling the best, but everyday I am trying my best. I am not entirely happy/proud with where i am and where I've been, but I can certainly try my best with what I have right now, and I'm glad I've had 8 chances.

There's been a lot more stuff that has happened, I just didn't want to make this too long. 

Most of the hell I have endured, is from abusive homes and situations. I'm still struggling, and most of this will affect me for the rest of my life, but slowly I am trying to get myself to a better place. I'm trying my hardest. And I really just felt like I needed to share this.",02May2020,1

My name is Carter, I have bipolar II disorder. I have learned that there are some things I simply have to do every day to stay stable, and some additional things which keep me on a healthy path. I call them the 12 S‚Äôs:

&amp;#x200B;

* sleep
* stretch
* sweat - exercise, get the heart rate up
* sit - meditate, as little as three deep breaths
* shower - SHOWER!
* spruce up - keep your spaces tidy
* slurp/swig/sip - drink water
* social - interact with other humans
* schedule - have a plan for the day, maybe even the next day
* supper/snack - eat three meals, or whatever works for you
* sedate/some meds - take your medicine
* see the doc - have appointments on the schedule

I just turned 17 and I hate my life more than ever. I was so close to living the way I wanted and being who I wanted to be but I ruined it and it feels like it's too late now. I was becoming peaceful with my body and accepting the way I look, even almost started going to the gym just so I could be stronger and run for longer periods of time, but I just couldn't.  I ruined everything. I had the perfect opportunity and threw it to the trash, and Ionly have a year to fix it(and yes, It really is just a year, even less).

My boyfriend pushes me but it just makes me feel worse. I‚Äôm stuck. I struggle with depression and anxiety but i take medicine for it. I don‚Äôt know if I need a good pep talk, some tough love, or a higher dose of medication. I just need help.",02May2020,1
244,"I cannot shake this feeling from my head as much as I try. It feels like I am being watched when I use my phone or laptop, be it through the camera or somehow a hacker can see my every move on the internet or whatever. Other times it is like certain things that seemingly happen at random, are actually just people using technology as a means to harass me and control my life. Even having conversations with family and friends it seems like certain things are being said with a certain tone or even hinting at something else. I have been dealing with this for a few months now and I've done some things to combat the feelings and suspicions, which have helped and improved the quality of life,  but every now and then something will happen that makes me start questioning it all again and this feeling of impending doom reemerges.

Last night I had a dream that my little brother OD'd and we had to look for his body.

My brother doesnt do drugs.

This is just one example. They can be about anything. But they are always disturbing and unpleasant.

I have been through some rough stuff, and have always battled depression. I would really like to not have these dreams anymore.

Do any of you have experience with chronic nightmares?

Ive heard some PTSD sufferers are sometimes prescribed a medication that lessens nightmares.

I would love some advice. Thanks.",02May2020,1
246,"Just to jump right into it I am a 29 year old male living on my own far from my hometown. I can say that for most my life I have gone through the years with episodes of anxiety, depression, and hyper-vigilance. Much like an emotional roller coaster. Lately I feel it has become so bad that my memory has become impaired as for my hand eye coordination and my approach to relationships. Instead of writing a lifetime novel I have decided to start jotting down daily problems I have in small spurts so as to not exhaust or over extend myself and any possible reader. I'm open to all questions and recommendations but mostly I wish to get the problems out and into the open as a sort of therapy since i don't have the means of obtaining the conventional kind. I am of course American and because of the pandemic I am unemployed waiting to be approved for unemployment and there fore I am not eligible for socialized healthcare at this time.  Anyway, here's what I've jotted down in the past two days.

*I cant keep a job, because i show up late, i become overwhelmed easily, and i generally have issues bonding and relating to my coworkers

*I have hardly any interest in anything beyond sitting at home watching tv. Even video games have become tiresome and tedious

*im mistrustful of others and crowds and being around strangers deep down scares the hell out of me, in fact when i go in public  i secretly wish no one can see me

*im so focused on myself that im obsessed over my mental health, how i look, how im seen, and yet at the same time im such a wreck that i dont have the will or energy to take care of myself or stick to any schedule or routine.

* im obsessed with porn. Ive tried to abstain from it for years but i always come back to it. When I allow myself to I will obsessively browse and download it for most of the day for weeks at a time, hardly leaving the house or taking care of basic needs such as eating, cleaning, washing, and sleeping. The side effects of this habit continued over many years has given me erectile dysfunction, a low sex drive, and a warped perception of my sexuality and women.

*My inadequacies cause me to be hyper vigilante and sensitive 
towards percieved slights 

* I always have had a hard time reading people and their intentions and that has resulted in others perceiving me as naive and perhaps even slow or idiotic. Growing up this has caused me to be bullied by peers.

*Ive always been sensitive, even though I can logically understand teasing as a sort of social grooming device I seem to take things to heart and I have trouble deciphering if a person means me harm when teasing me or if they are in fact taking a hurtful jab at me. 

* I am cautious about meeting new people and making friends but those that i feel I can trust and be around never seem to want to be around. It always seems like Im the one calling and asking to hang and never the other way around.

Disclaimer; I am currently abstaining successfully from porn and drug use and I do not see these things as being the root of my problems but rather symptoms of a deeper issue as well as  poor choices of coping.",02May2020,1
247,"I think I don‚Äôt really need people?

It‚Äôs just that the thought of talking to them seems really scary and I always feel alone when I‚Äôm with people, whereas when I‚Äôm by myself I‚Äôm fine.

248,"So if I were to talk about the symptoms I have for a few mental health issues I would be able to go on for days but recently (past 6 months or so) this has become very frequent.

I used to self harm quite a lot, just because I ‚Äúliked‚Äù it? But now it‚Äôs very rare for me to pick a blade back up. I‚Äôve always gotten sudden outbursts of anger and I‚Äôve ripped my clothes due to that or punched something, knocked something over etc.

Recently I‚Äôve noticed when I get these outbursts I keep scratching my face or punching it. I‚Äôve never went to the GP about anything, I don‚Äôt know why but I never have had the confidence to do so. I‚Äôve been managing myself for years but some symptoms have gotten quite bad.

250,"So, for starters, I'm currently in a long distance relationship and have been for 3 months now, and all this time I obviously wasn't telling my mother, however, recently during yet another argument with her she ended up finding out about my sh scars, which I never wanted her to know of (she is possibly the main cause of my harming problem) which then followed up with a long conversation about my mental health, where I ended up lying (more like masking the truth) about my so called female ""friend"" whom I met on social media and have been talking to for around 2 months, and how she really helped me and explained to me what the root of a lot of my problems is and how I can try to deal with them before getting proper treatment (which I have been denied by my mother multiple times) and for anyone who might be wondering, no , I can't tell her that its actually my boyfriend we're talking about here, and not because she won't accept it, maybe mostly because the woman gives me zero to no privacy and right to my own personal time/space, and gets extremely mad and defensive when I ask her to leave me alone or let me have my room to myself, and in that case she wouldn't change her behavior even if I told her I have a boyfriend who I'm trying to spend time with. Going forward to yesterday (and technically today too) in the middle of a COMPLETELY UNRELATED ARGUMENT, she let her overly narcissistic side take over, called me a bitch because I spend ""more"" time with this ""friend"" of mine than her, and for obvious reasons because shes clearly a stuck up bitch, and today when I was trying to watch a movie with him and she kept going into my room, talking about crap I don't care about, while there's a person on call with me and we are watching something together, and when, after I let her do that for about 15 minutes and getting both of us pissed, I kindly tell her that I am watching something with my friend, her reply: oH i aM SO soRry fOR iNteRRuPtiNg yOu TWo, I cAnt eVEn ComE in TO Say anYthiNg nOw SinCE I Am bEInG So bOTheRSomE, fUck yOU stUcK up BRat"" and being a bitch to me yet again.

251,Hi I‚Äôve been feeling rubbish again today. I‚Äôve enjoyed playing guitar and listening music but I noticed my ex unfollowed me on social media after dumping me a couple of months ago (like an idiot) I‚Äôm clearly not over her yet. I would unfollow her myself but that‚Äôll make me look petty and like I‚Äôm keeping tabs on her so I‚Äôm not gonna do that. I‚Äôm not letting a good few months be let down by a bad couple of days no way. Also the fact I‚Äôve had to cut some lifelong friends off for chatting crap behind my back.

253,"It's pretty simple actually. I've recently started to realize that I have some severe trust and attatchment issues alongside with a solid amount of anxiety. I know it's a problem seriously affecting all of my relationships and the thing is I do want to fix it but I just can't bring myself to talk to anyone.

Like, I literally can't tell anyone what I feel even when I try my best to do it.

I don't think I'm a compulsive liar or anything but every time I try telling anyone about my feelings I just end up smoothing over everything and not really discusaing anything. Trust me, I've tried so many times: with my parents, sister, friends..

I kind of want to try a therapist but at the same time they can't help me if I won't tell them a thing so would there even be a point?

255,"I think about my life as a continuous cycle of never-ending doubt and upside down emotions.

The wheel of ""will I be okay today?"" keeps spinning round, and round. Because, I cannot foreshadow the face my mind chooses to portray today.

I wake up. Wow. Happiness. That's new. Let's inform the world until they are sick of all the positivity. Oh. The dark cousin. Hey suicidal thoughts...

Have you met crippling fear? Or irrational optimism? I think you would be good friends! 

Don't look now because here comes adrenaline. Ready to transport you to the land of 'cold hands and feet'. Or maybe a moonlit trip to 'wall-bounce euphoria'.

It doesn't make sense. It's not supposed to. Why would it. I can't tell you what it means if I don't understand it myself?

The leg shakes cause another earthquake as the mind deciphers whether the rain will fall today or the sun will shine instead. 

But the wheather reporter's on strike, whether the weather will weather the flame of passion and hope is yet to be decided.

I guess time will tell.

And I don‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt listen and comprehend what people are saying. But everything I hear I hear back in my own voice. So like a dog whine, I hear the dog whine then I hear myself do the dog whine in my head. Also, sometimes when someone is talking of course my brain is doing the same and then it gets hard to focus on what the person is saying. Then it takes a lot of brain power to focus on what they are saying. I just feel like I‚Äôm so disconnected from everything. As if in reality I‚Äôm in a black void, closed off from everything.

I‚Äôve been having casual thoughts of suicide for years now. I‚Äôm very self conscious about admitting to having these issues, as I don‚Äôt want to be a burden on anyone else.

Anyway, the problem is I did text my friend and said I‚Äôm having a hard time mentally. Very short message and not dramatic or demanding at all. Just wanted some company. He just said something like ‚Äúsorry to hear that. my phone keeps dying and I‚Äôve been at work‚Äù
It really hurt me to think that maybe people don‚Äôt really care. Maybe we always assume the person isn‚Äôt going to hurt themselves until it‚Äôs too late. Maybe I‚Äôd think the same thing if someone texted me that. Like the fact that everyone is depressed makes it harder to tell when someone is *actually* going off the deep end for real",02May2020,1
259,"Tl:dr:  I have always struggled to acknowledge and express my own feelings, especially around family. While I finally understand some ways to cope with social anxiety and depression, I'm temporarily living with parents, and am having troublie coping with my loneliness in this emotionally stunting living situation


I'm 26(M), from Ohio, and I just need to share my stuggle to maybe get it off my mind, and to express that I'm not ok in a way that others will see, instead of it just echoing in my mind.  I stuggle talking about it to people irl, but this anon community can certainly be comforting, so I'm posting it here. Here's a little life/mental health backstory first.  I've always been shy, awkward, or socially anxious for as long as I can remember. I have never been great at discussing it (though there has been occasional glimpses of improvement in recent years). I can't recall ever talking to family about complex emotional topics starting very early in life. Despite my perpetual anxiety and difficulty managing and expressing the extent to which I feel emotion, I gathered a decent sized friend group in high school that I could be comfortable around.  I thoroughly experienced life with the social connection and physical contact as a normal occurrence.  However, there was one relationship I was holding onto that was not great for my mental health. Basically, we had good times, but I developed and mastered the art of ignoring my own feelings for the sake of another's. 

After highschool, I was in a 5 year relationship through college. I fully trusted her and felt comfortable around her; however, I never fully escaped that habbit of suppressing my feelings for the sake of my partner's. She tried hard to help me with that, and she certainly made it clear that all of my feelings, not just the positive ones, were worth expressing. Nonetheless, I still wasn't able to do that, and didn't really have the language or courage to try talking to anyone. I didn't really start communicating with my major classmates outside of class until a couple months before graduation, and even then, nothing emotionally charged. 

After I graduated, we split up (as planned) to allow each other to experience new things and work on ourselves. I agreed both then and now that was a good idea. Though that was the start of my 2 year deep depressive episode. 2 years of literally no physical contact with another human, with the exception of my parents (who I have never spoken to with any significant emotional honesty), which did not provide any comfort. Multiple jobs, eventually I'd always start start spiraling mentally and quit.  

The turning turning point was when I experienced psilocybin for the first time. Suddenly, I had a way to shift perspective and view my emotions and insecurities that had been blocked from view by the wall that I put up myself.  I also gained new perspective  on connecting with others, and emotional honesty. I started going outside more, going to parks, developed a love for hiking, inciting my sense of adventure again.  I bought an SUV with the help of my dad, built a bed to replace the seats, and explored the south west. I saw Denver, camped in the San Juan mountains, saw the grand canyon, then Vegas. My car broke down outside of Moab, where I some people at the hostel I stayed at who I eventually had some quick, but deep emotional connections with. I worked a seasonal winter job, which ended early due to Covid-19.  

That brings us to now. As I've mentioned, I struggle with social anxiety, and have a tendency to disregard my emotions and urges to satisfy other people's wants and expectations. I am in between seasonal jobs, living with my dad and step mom, and with no vehicle. As I also vaguely mentioned, I have always maintained the tendancy to hide my emotions, especially from family members. Now, stuck at my dad's, I currently have no physical place where I feel comfortable to acknowledge what I feel. The place I lived during my 2 year depression was a comfortable place for me, but I had only started to develop the skills to notice my emotions and needs that weren't being met soon before moving out. Even my own car can be a emotional safe-space, for lack of a better term, though I no longer have one. I'm so socially starved, and long to be touched and hugged. But I'm trapped in a place where I constantly portray the persona of someone who is fine and not struggling, taking away the ability to sit with and cope with my feelings. I just need to get this off my chest. Thanks for listening to my story :)",02May2020,1

My vision began to close into blackness and I ended up passing out. I was with a friend and he said he was trying to shake me, but couldn't because my body was too stiff to move.
