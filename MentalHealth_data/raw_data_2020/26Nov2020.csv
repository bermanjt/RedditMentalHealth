Long story short, 16-18 wasn’t the most fun time for me; probably the first crush I actually asked out rejected me (shit happens), dropped a ‘friend’ group after I noticed their shitty and unproductive actions who were draining motivation out of me, joined a different group, or should I say, tagged along a group, for some reason became the target and even the people in that group who seemed friendly and the best ones out of that group were the ones who would talk a lot behind my back. 

As a lad this isn’t ideal, probably ain’t for anyone, but this shattered my trust along with confidence, which I ‘rebuilt’ to some point at the cost of social skills/‘interactions’ (interactions sounds lame but I don’t have a better word for it), up to the point where I wouldn’t go to a party when I got invited by 2-3 decently attractive girls, who had some interest in me, and at one point I wouldn’t even dance with a girl who was pretty much a 10 (looks and personality) because of some form of fear within me. 

Just to emphasise that- I didn’t dance with a girl who herself pulled me in to dance, who was giving me some form of compliment(s) before and trying to get me to laugh and join in sometimes, probably not out of wanting to date but just because she was a decent person (or so I think, which brings me into my next point). 

Now I’m definitely better, turning 21 soon, but I am somewhat cynical and have become very analytical and sometimes overthinking when it comes to people. If I notice a pattern/trend in someone’s or a groups behaviour, I switch into the ‘analytical’ mode now and then (just as an example, recently I noticed the people I work with, who I am on somewhat decent terms with, within the span of few weeks started to ask questions about me using dating apps, girlfriend/s and so on, which may be benign and they’re just asking because I’m new at the place, or because they want to talk about me behind my back, which I don’t actually mind anymore, but I do enjoy knowing what people are saying and thinking, sorta gives me a peace of mind, note that I’ve had one friend tell me that when they were talking about someone else, one person said something along the lines of “he’s probably a virgin lol” when talking about someone else, so that automatically connected in my brain). 

I really want to believe that these are normal questions out of curiosity, but I am wired to think it through, to make sure I don’t give away too much information about myself which could be used against me, to ‘playing the long game’. 

I’ve also tried ‘analysing’ and guessing the personality of some people out of the few interactions I’ve had with them at the start, example- one person was acting superior because they have a higher position (Bare in mind this job isn’t prestigious or anything), so automatically I knew that if I do something wrong/mess up even in the slightest with a minor thing, they will immediately talk behind my back to other workers on my level and then keep bringing it up, which did turn out that way, which lead onto me thinking that they must have some form of insecurity, probably relationship related and the only way them feeling ‘powerful’ was through having a higher position in a company, which once again, turned out to be true. 

Is this just me or has anyone developed in a similar way?

2,"So, I have been dealing with this globus sensation for more than a year. It feels like something is stuck in my throat and I can't swallow it. Apparently, this is caused by throat muscles being stiff because of stress and anxiety. Some people said that massaging their neck helped a lot, but it has done nothing for me. I have a trouble falling asleep, as I feel like I'm choking on my own throat. Has anyone dealt with something like this before? I don't know what else to try.
I checked up on my thyroid gland too, and everything's okay with it. My tonsils are of a normal size, so I guess that this is caused by anxiety.",26Nov2020,1
3,"This may help me..

Wondering if anyone knows the process for admitting themselves into a Psych Ward.

I live in Brampton and have taken a leave of absence from work.

I’ve attempted suicided in the past but brought myself to a stop, I had a shift in energy and felt like I had control of my life , but I fell back into a horrible spiral.

I’ve been smoking weed constantly and listening to music for 12-14 hours a day... just to block out the noise.

I’ve read a little bit about it whilst googling, and it really appealed to me.

So if anyone could shed some light for me, 

I just have the following questions: 

1) process? Age? Family physicians consent? costs? Location? 

2) Ive renewed my health card a while back but never got the renewed card due to mailing address issues, I just have my old health card. I was able to get tested for Covid with it so not sure if it’d suffice for the psych ward.

3) this may be a bit too personal but if anyone could share their experience and if it helped them in any way? I’m really curious and interested in this and have high hopes that it may help me 

Please and thank you,",26Nov2020,1

7,"I’ve been seeing a therapist for a few months and have briefly mentioned to her these reoccurring “bad dreams” I’ve been having. I say “bad dreams” because I don’t know what qualifies as a “nightmare”. This morning, I had a very intense reoccurring dream. My heart was pounding so hard in my dream that I woke up and my heart was still pounding after waking up. The pain in my chest went down to my stomach. I was so angry, I don’t necessarily know what the anger was towards. After a few minutes of lying there trying to calm down, I decided to get up and make breakfast. When I got to the kitchen, I saw the sink and it reminded me of something that happened a few weeks ago and my anger was then directed towards that. Then my mind started racing to all different kinds of things that I don’t like to think about. I was stuck in this racing, negative mindset all day.

I’ve had dreams wake me up because of my heart pounding and I do experience a lot of racing thoughts. It’s just, having all of that together plus the anger...this was a little more intense than usual. 

I told my therapist about this today and she wants me to research more about anxiety. She also mentioned PTSD. She didn’t say I have it, but this is something I was concerned with when I reached out to her a few months ago. I originally went to her thinking that I might have PTSD because of the things I’ve been through the past five or so years. Does anyone have any insight on this? These dreams are usually manageable but idk.",26Nov2020,1

Personally, mine is George Michael and his music. He's so inspirational to me and he suffered with his mental health for a long time but still made something of his life. His music speaks to me on another level and I could just sit and listen for hours, sometimes I just cry for no good reason because at least I have George, who understands me and what I am going through in my head with depression.

9,"so my ocd largely involved with thoughts like ""if you don't do this you're gonna die"" like picking up something or putting it in the right place and i HAVE to do it or else, you know i will have the overwhelming fear that i'm going to die. so this is how it started and of course obsessive thoughts, thinking the same exact thing over and over and over again. fast forward to about 6 months ago i found out my boyfriend was prostituting himself for drugs first thought was hiv so then my brain started telling me if you don't do this you're going to get hiv. i OBSESSED over it, after many tests and not sleeping with my boyfriend anymore for months i finally accepted i don't have hiv and the thoughts just went back to regular i am going to die if i don't do this or that. so then we break up briefly and he sees someone else a bit and sleeps with them and i was such a fucking mess it's like my depression overcame my ocd and obsessive thoughts about my health and i let him fuck me withpit a condom on and then find out that girl he started seeing is hsv2 great! so now i have symptoms of some fucking sort, i can not stop the thoughts going over and over and over again and now it's if you don't do this you're going to get herpes and if you don't do this you're going to get hiv, again. i just want the thoughts to stop, i can't stop saying the same things over and over and over and over in my brain. i can't escape it, i can't distract myself. i am driving myself insane. i fear i attracted these diseases towards myself. another thing i have a large problem with is contamination, meats, chemicals, drugs, germs. so i'm having the hardest time around my daughter, feeling like i'm going to contaminate her and give one of these things to her. i don't want to make her sick, i'm so scared to make her sick.",26Nov2020,1

I react upset about moving and her only response is “WHY ARE YOU SO SAD!! I HAD IT WORSE” and she just guilts me for feeling any emotion at all. I honestly fucking hate her.

19,"I really want to go to a therapist and probably need to. Probably for the past like 8 years to be honest, but especially now. Quarantine has really taken my security in myself that I had started to build and threw it in garbage because I feel terrible. 

It feels like every since quarantine I make more and more mistakes with the people I call my friends because I've just fallen out of practice talking to people (and I was honestly pretty awkward in the first place too). It feels like my relationships are constantly in jeopardy and the second I make a big enough mistake they're going to leave or hate me or think less of me. 

I used to be able to push through these thoughts and stop myself from talking down to myself but now it feels like I do it unconsciously and uncontrollably. I feel so much more depressed and I want to kill myself almost every night unless I happen to get lucky and my roommates let me drink/ smoke weed with them or do something else. 

I think if there's anytime I should see a therapist it's right now, but I feel like right now is also the worst time to see a therapist. The only free option at my school is virtual and I'd have to do that in my apartment which I share with a few other girls. I have my own room but I'm terrified that they'll hear me through the walls and think that I'm crazy. If I wanted to do something off campus I'd have to use insurance or pay out of pocket which both would require talking to my mom about it (or paying with my credit card, though I really don't want to- I'm not growing money in my bank account) While I think she wouldn't really care, and would want me to be happy, I just can't bring myself to tell her about all my problems yet. I've worked so hard to convince her I'm fine and normal I'm not even sure she would believe me. 

I'm also worried that even if I do manage to talk to someone I'm gonna water it down a lot so they don't think I'm too crazy or a suicide risk (I'm not, I think about it a lot because my brain wants me to feel like trash, but I've never seriously considered it/attempted) and throw me in the hospital or something. I really don't want people thinking I'm more messed up then they already do and having pity for me or anything. I keep up a front all the time so I don't think I'm just gonna be able to let it fall down the second I talk to a therapist. 

I just needed to get this off of my chest. I'm not sure if there's anything that can help me right now. I'm probably just gonna try my best stomach through it until my school offers in person appts or I'm able to work up ability to tell my mom or do a virtual appointment. I feel a bit better now though.",26Nov2020,1
20,"I was emotionally, mentally, and physically abused by my father for 3.5 years without pause. (Ages 16-19) I won’t go into the details because it’s honestly too much to describe and like nothing I’ve ever heard of. To sum it up though, I was pretty much stripped of any and all privacy and even in my own home I felt unsafe 24/7. I didn’t have a working phone, no tv, no computer and no internet. I had nothing to distract myself from the torment. I would often go 40-50 even 60 hours with barely a few minutes of sleep. It’s worth mentioning I was also in about every extra curricular imaginable and I worked 20 hours a week. I was a walking corpse practically. The reasons for my fathers very specific and vile abuse are complicated and I’ll spare y’all the details, but let’s just say it turns out he was a pretty much a criminal mastermind and my mother and I knew had figured out just a little too much for his comfort. His goal was to literally break my mother and I, so any accusations we had about him came from 2 insane women. It was truly the darkest time of my life (and I’ve had plenty.) 

It got so bad about 2 years in that I completely broke from reality for about 2 full days. All I could think was that it felt like somebody was cutting my under eyes with scissors. It started early one morning and it got increasingly bad for the next 48 hours. It was the ONLY thought my brain could produce and I remember going thru my school day barely even able to push words out of my mouth. Eventually it got so bad that I ended up beating my self in the face so badly I had to be restrained. 

I’m 20 now, and it’s been about a year since I’ve been free of my father, but now I flinch at everything. Literally everything startles me. You can even just walk near me and if I don’t hear you immediately I’ll jump out of my skin. I didn’t use to be like this. I’ve been diagnosed with C-PTSD and my therapist and psychiatrist have compared me to war vets many times in the past. 

I guess I’m just sharing this because I rarely hear folks talk about these types of symptoms in regards to non-physical abuse. I was never beaten, raped, or hit. I guess the threat was always there but nothing much ever happened in that regard. It’s a trauma response so deeply ingrained into me now that I’m not sure I’ll ever be ‘normal’ again, but I’m working on it. I just want people to be aware that physical trauma responses can form even from non-physical abuse.",26Nov2020,1

22,"i don’t really know how to use reddit or if anyone will ever see this but i figured it’s worth a shot. sorry, this is gonna be a long one but i appreciate anyone who takes the time to read my story. i’m not looking for sympathy just venting i suppose.

i’m 20 year old female, and i suspect that i have some sort of mood or mental disorder. i’m not one to self diagnose but i think i might have BPD. i guess i’ll give a little backstory about what i’ve been dealing with.

i’ve dealt with declining mental health for years now, but it’s worsened in my recent circumstances and during the whole covid pandemic. i’ve recently gotten out of a tumultuous relationship (he cheated on me with his ex-girlfriend). his sister warned me he’s a narcissist, but for some reason i was super attached and put up with a lot of his shit. at first he seemed like a decent guy and we had fun, but there would be periods where he would berate me, verbally abuse me, undermine my emotions, disrespect any boundaries i’ve tried to set up, etc. he even peed on me one time (gross i know). yet throughout all this i constantly desired his validation - i’d clean for him, cook for him, take care of him when he was too fucked up and clean up his mess, buy things for him and try to convince myself it would work out and that i could change him. he would puke and piss all over his house. he talked to his ex throughout our whole relationship, i found that he sent explicit videos of me to people without my consent, he would talk disrespectfully about me to others as well (call me bitch, names, etc). i felt like i was always walking on eggshells. he also was a drug addict and an alcoholic but denied having a problem and rejected anyone who tried to help. unfortunately, i ended up using cocaine with him as well as forming some other unhealthy habits. luckily, i had no problem stopping cocaine. but the relationship ended when he cheated on me with his ex-girlfriend. i was devastated, and to top it all off i had a miscarriage (for a second time - the first time he treated as no big deal). when i told him about this, he sent me a dick pic in response. i was in shock about how insensitive someone could be and i think that’s when i realized he was just no good. throughout this i’ve had a not so good relationship with my parents, which i’ll get to later.

this happened this past semester of my second year of college, so this was very recent. i came home after the break up and lived with another family member for a few weeks, where i began taking pills in attempt to numb my emotions. pain killers and ativan, i think i took maybe 7 at a time and was frustrated i didn’t feel anything. but now i can’t remember hardly anything from those two weeks. it was over halloween and my birthday and i don’t remember any of it, which scares me. i ended up moving back in with my parents, which is where i’m at now, and things have only worsened. they are supportive in some ways - they pay for my college and i’m grateful for that. i know it’s a good opportunity but i lack the passion for what i’m studying and i’ve really been slacking. i don’t have the attention span or the motivation. however, i’m severely isolated at home. as in, i literally cannot leave. even when i just want to go on a drive or clear my mind, they track my location. i understand the severity of the pandemic and by no means am i trying to undermine it, but the isolation is absolutely agonizing. moreover, my ex has been reaching out to me again because it didn’t work out with the ex he cheated on me with.

i spend every day in my room, i’m repeating the same day over and over and it feels like it’ll never end. i can’t talk to my parents about mental health or ask to see a therapist because then i will be kicked out and no longer will be able to attend college. seeing a professional is absolutely NOT an option. they control all of my finances and things like that. nothing is private. i’m not allowed a job - i’m not allowed to leave. they have never been understanding people, i’ve never been able to come to them about anything. they provide for me, which i’m lucky to have, but it’s like i’m living with two strangers that only love me if i am the exact person they want me to be. if i show any emotion other than happy i get yelled at, but it’s hard to pretend all of the time. my mom tells me she can’t deal with me crying anymore and tells me how much of a burden i am. in the past, they have used some cruel and unusual punishment. my mom once sold all of my clothes and ripped them up because i wore her sweater to school. things like that. all i can do is sit on my phone for hours on end. i don’t know who i am, i feel like i don’t have anyone close to talk to, i end up alone with my thoughts and can only replay situations over and over again in my head. i have thought about ending my life but i know i will never actually do it and don’t really have intentions to do so. my parents have some issues of their own, my dad has anger issues and is an alcoholic and my mom i believe is a narcissist too. they’re very unrealistically paranoid people.

i suspect i might have bpd for a multitude of reasons. firstly, i have extreme mood swings. sometimes i feel good but at the drop of the hat it can change to extreme sadness or irritability. if i get angry i lash out and say things i don’t mean. i push people away because i have a horrible fear of abandonment which causes anxiety. i will beg for validation and reassurance constantly, i try to overcompensate by buying people things and doing favors for them and stuff like that. my fear of abandonment rules my life. i engage in reckless behavior, i spend all of my money i ever get ahold of. i buy things because they bring momentary happiness. i have a nicotine addiction i can’t kick. if there are pills around me i have no impulse control and i will take them just to feel something, or nothing. and the strange part is i get EXTREMELY attached to one person at a time, usually romantically. that person then ends up consuming my thoughts, they’re all i care about, they’re all i think about, nothing else matters in my mind. the only way i can get over this person is if i can find another person to latch onto. i give and give and give. and most of all i just feel empty. this is amplified by the extreme isolation. the constant boredom is horrible.

that being said, i’m aware i have a problem and i’m not denying that i don’t probably bring on a lot of these problems myself. i’m not trying to do the woe is me act, i know i’m not a perfect person. that’s why i’m looking for help. i want to know if anyone has any healthy coping mechanisms or insight that might help me. i do have interests and hobbies but i do not have the motivation to engage in them anymore, i’m disinterested. and some of my hobbies i can’t partake in due to the fact that i’m confined to my house. i tried to go on a walk once to clear my mind and my parents locked me out and i spent hours on the street in the middle of the night because they thought i would bring in covid. i live in the middle of nowhere (literally in a corn field) so i had to eventually call someone to come help me. i just want to be happy again. i just don’t know where to start. even just sharing your experience would help.

23,"I get really stressed over problems such as a job not being finished, my boss being mad at me, or doing things perfectly. I lose a lot of sleep over it and it makes my anxiety worse because of it. I try and listen to Joe Pera before bed, watching old rom-coms (not because I like them but because they help me sleep), and drinking hot sleepy time tea.

24,"I thought about time to time, but I will never hurt them, nor will I hurt myself. Still...

When I got mad, I often get too far with my sarcasm, or ignore/humming to myself while others are talking. It’s a trait I need to get rid of, but it won’t be easy. I did it because I don’t want to scream and cry, or throw things around. I throw things, scream, and cry in order to control the urge to punch or stab someone. The anger is directed at no particularly body, buy I blamed myself and my parents. My earliest memory with my biological father consists of beating me up in the dark when I was only two. My affection for my mother got cold; most of my memory of her is yelling, punishing, and a mix of bittersweet remembrance of sort.

Then, my stepfather; I never liked him. 1) I wanted to be the center of Mom’s attention 2) He also punished me 3) I hated men that are associated with Mom. My younger cousin got the short end of the stick, since I used to blame her for taking away any attention and then I would beat her up till she got scratches and bleeds. However, I never regretted it. 

And I also kept hiding something from everyone: Ever since the age of 5, I started to watch videos of women getting beheaded, strangled, and hanged, as well as suffocating my own stuffed animals. When people break down in front of me (even my mother), I just don’t feel... anything. It stopped when I was 12, but now I still get tempted from time to time.

My logic says that it’s wrong, and my gut says so, too. But I just... don’t feel anything. I don’t have any motivation or emotion to propel me towards doing something about it.",26Nov2020,1

26,"What the title says basically and for some background I'm 17m and I have mild-moderate ADHD. Basically, I have a problem where I am way too easily able to convince myself that I like something when I don't and the opposite sometimes. Basically, I never truly know what I truly love or anything like that in terms of hobbies, not in terms of what I study or read however. Also, I have a problem that I basically hate having the interests I have and I hate myself for liking the things that I like. I'll elaborate, essentially, I like to learn about stuff like history and political stuff and other stuff like that and I like reading(mainly sci-fi and creepypastas) and writing and learning foreign languages(I'm learning French, Russian, and Chinese though French is the only one I am decently conversational in(like B2 going on to C1 level) and in Russian I am just starting to become conversational(like A2 level going on B1)(that's the interest I hate myself the most for having) and travelling because I view a lot of my interests as boring or old fashioned for someone my age and I often wish I could be interested in technology or computers but I just get bored of that so quickly since I'm not a detail oriented person and I also wish I was interested in more visual mediums of art such as drawing instead of writing because no one really seems to read as much anymore and I wish I could be more visual but I can't since drawing is tedious and I hate doing it and I naturally suck at it unlike writing where I have an innate talent for it and like to do it. Where does this stuff stem from and how can I be proud of what I like without feeling boring or old fashioned and even hating other people with the same interests in the humanities?",26Nov2020,1
27,"So I’m actually not a big gamer, there’s only 1 game I play which is runescape for those who know or wonder. I used to play it when I was much younger and i came back to the game after years. I actually enjoy playing the game a lot. 
Now the problem is that obtaining items in this game is based on luck. Like there is a certain droprate for every item and you’re ‘supposed to get that item at that rate in theory’. However, ever since I came back to the game my luck has been insanely bad. 90% of the items I try to get take forever to obtain, I always pass the droprate. My friends in game usually just get them all before that doprate. But me, I always have to put more effort to everything than the average player. So at some point I realized that I have been stressing a lot about this. I know it’s just a game, but it’s extremely frustrating to have bad luck in it constantly. The stress and frustration made me consider quitting the game several times, but I just can’t do it. For some reason I just keep playing which results in more stress and frustration. I don’t want to try other games, as I’m a student and basically cant spend too much time on gaming so it’s either gonna be this game or just none. But whenever I tried quitting the game I found myself playing like nothing happened and this goes on all the time. 

I’m thinking that it’s just an addiction, but I don’t think it’s healthy to keep doing something you’re stressing over so much. What do I do? Any help could be useful.  I know it sounds weird and there will definitely be people laughing at this post but it actually starts bothering me to an extend where I actually hate the game, but can’t leave it either.",26Nov2020,1
28,"So, today I was working on a self-esteem workbook that my therapist game me and I realised that I used to be confident up until I went to university (19). I realised I was okay with asking for help, or sharing my opinion with others, or being criticised. Those things were not difficult, when I had problems in the past, I was not afraid of taking responsibility or asking for support, or when I disagreed with someone, I just told them, it didn't affect me personally. 

But now, I am so afraid of sharing any personal thoughts, I am so afraid of disagreeing with people or asking for help. I would rather hide myself than ask for help, I am so afraid of other people slightly criticising me, to the point that I'd rather not talk to them, I get offended so easily and the only way I have to deal with things is crying. 

When I was 19, I met my boyfriend at the time, we stayed together for 4 years. I suffered terrible mental health for about 3 years with him before I got help and gradually tarted improving. after we broke up (1 year ago), I met someone else ( I let him know that I had been suffering from mental health issues for a while), but as soon as I started having a bad anxiety episode, he dealt with it so well that it made my generalised anxiety improve so dramatically basically overnight (before I was unable to leave my house or get out of bed, take a shower without anxiety, then I managed to do these things normally which was honestly a huge improvement ). 

Even though I improved a lot, I still struggle with having little confidence, for instance I am so scared of asking people for help or share my true opinion about something. it is affecting me because I delayed my time at university and I am literally scared of talking to anyone, including lecturers in the class, or even just attend. it really hurts me because I want to participate and I used to love learning in school, but I am so afraid of going there now. I also distanced from all my friends because I didn't want to share my mental health issues and be judged. the only person who knew was my ex boyfriend, who was very private and didn't want other people to know about the problems we were having.

so my question I if anyone had a similar experience with losing confidence as a young adult and gaining it back? 

Is confidence my problem or do you think I should look into something else?

Any thoughts appreciated.

tldr: I used to be a normal confident teenager, but after meeting my ex I suffered terrible anxiety and became unconfident. anyone had a similar experience with losing confidence as a young adult and gaining it back?",26Nov2020,1

30,"I have been diagnosed with depression, SAD, GAD, social anxiety, and mild PTSD. When my symptoms of depression and anxiety started getting worse in the past few weeks, I thought it was just the SAD kicking in. I started a new medication and upped my dosage of vitamin D3 to help. So far, it has done nothing but get worse. 

I’ve been in a relationship with my SO, and although I am usually typically sensitive when it comes to what he says and does to/around me, I’ve been borderline obsessive and toxic within the past 2 months. All I think about it’s him. When I don’t get a reply to my text I obsess over it for hours. I think he’s ignoring me or forgotten about me or that he doesn’t love me anymore. If it goes on for long enough, I’m terrified something happened to him. It’s gotten to the point where he can ignore me for just a few seconds and it will cause me to just get so worked up and progressively more depressed that I start planning a suicide attempt. 

I’m being ridiculous! I’m so so toxic and I don’t know what’s happening, I wasn’t like this before. He wouldn’t let me draw something on his arm one day and i was upset about it for 5 whole hours. 

Yesterday I had an anxiety attack over something minor he did that didn’t even matter and it kept getting worse and worse. I drove through it instead of pulling over. I was thinking of Suicide by crashing my car. The only thing that snapped me out of it was that I slapped myself hard three times in the face. It was like instantly I was out of it. I could think clearly and wasn’t feeling suicidal. My anxiety was still high, but I wasn’t feeling obsessive or depressed or like I might kill myself. 

I’ve also been having back problems recently and am usually in pain. I normally don’t take more that 3 painkillers at a time, even when I was dangerously suicidal and didn’t care about myself or my health at all a few years ago, I only took a maximum of 4. I realised I’ve been taking around 8 at a time several times a day. I’ve been fantasising about smoking or abusing painkillers to take the edge off when I never have had an urge to smoke or get high before.

I’m on my work break right now and I can feel myself spiralling. A few very minor things and the fact that my SO responded to my text a little late are affecting me way more than they should. I feel like I might have to call a crisis line once I get home or something. 

But I still feel really happy on a regular basis. Yesterday when I had that little episode, I had a great night with my SO after it happened. I don’t know what’s going on and why I have such extreme reactions to things. Especially when it comes to him. I’m constantly afraid he’s going to leave me to the point where I’m so obsessive all I can do is think about him for hours. 

The medication I started is called mirtaziphine and I am also taking esctalophram with it. I was taken off buspirone (I took it for anxiety and insomnia, not schizophrenia) but none of these medications cause a reaction like I’ve been experiencing, or at least from what I have found. 

What is happening with me? I won’t be able to see my therapist for a while and I am afraid I’m going to snap at something and kill myself.",26Nov2020,1
31,"I know  a lot of people have reasons they still want to live. Their families, friends, goals, hobbies, etc. I don’t understand why i shouldn’t want to die because none of those matter to me.

I envy people who are music nerds, or cinemaphiles, or are actually talented because I have no personality traits and even if I was interested in those things I wouldn’t be able to afford it.

Getting help via my school won't work since the schools dedicated psychologist is also a teacher of mine and I don't think I could open up to them about my problems. And all other options would require money, which I don't really have, or my insurance card which my parents have.

40,"Here is what happens:

I’m sitting somewhere in public, minding my own business and listening to music. I’m chillin or reading a book. I’m doin any number of perfectly normal things when suddenly..... I sigh! 

I know I’m a bit tired, but I sighed! I’m an attention whore! Oh god, somebody looked at me! I know they’re now judging me harshly because of that sigh! I have nothing to be upset about, I have a good life! Why am I even complaining? They’re right, I really should leave.... I should be ashamed! 

You may think I’m kidding, but oh boy.

Maybe I suddenly get conscious of my breathing. I’m breathing too heavily. Oh god someone is gonna see me struggling to breathe just from sitting down, I must be fat. I will be intensely judged. The end. But now that I’m focused on it I can only hear my breath and heartbeat, even over music if I’m listening. Trying to take more shallow and quiet breaths, I nearly pass out. Ultimately I have to stop what I’m doing and excuse myself to go do breathing exercises in the bathroom until I calm down. Even then, it can be an issue the rest of the day. 

Yet another example is this:

I lay out my clothes the night before, with full confidence. I think “oh this is cute, and I haven’t worn it in awhile, why not?” Well Ill wake up the next day an tell you why not! That’s too fancy for this occasion! That’s not nice enough! Those boots are dogshit with this outfit! Since when did you have the confidence to wear boots anyway? If you suddenly begin to ware boots people might notice and point it out, and what if they don’t like them? An that shirt, even though it’s literally full length and covering everything and is perfectly acceptable shows too much. Or that shirt is too loose, people will assume you’re fat and trying to hide it. Because of my indecisiveness I ware the opposite and sometimes bring a jacket even if it’s hot out. 

The examples are endless, and that’s just the small stuff. In actual social interaction situations.... oh god, my brain just malfunctions until I make a right fool of myself.

I feel really pathetic writing this out honestly. I know I'm paying them to help me, I just feel like a  disappointment to everyone else, and I crave the ""Good Job, That's awesome"".

I have been under a lot of stress for roughly the last two months from my job, often skipping lunch. It’s gotten to the point now where I hardly ever feel hungry and I have to force myself to eat. It typically doesn’t go over 500 kcal a day, but I think I have gotten up to around 1000 on certain occasions.

My diagnoses have switched from MDD+ Gen Anxiety+ ADHD to Bipolar 2. I think I may have BPD, but that’s another story.  

I have read online that most of the time people cope with stress by overeating and it’s less common for loss of appetite to occur. I was wondering if anyone else has had loss of appetite, more importantly the complete lack of hunger signals, with similar diagnoses + prolonged stress and how you were about to get back to eating at least somewhat properly. 

I don’t like in an area where marijuana is legal, but I have used edibles to get to a state where I can eat. I’d just prefer not to have to depend on them to be able to eat something as simple as a sandwich.

52,"\*TW: abuse, suicide, depression, ptsd, anxiety\*

Last year from February to June I was in a mental hospital because I had attempted suicide. I was stressed out because I was juggling a bunch of honors classes as well as robotics and track, I had severe depression, I had to do all the chores around the house, and I was suffering from ptsd because my brother who had recently moved out would beat me and threaten me on the regular. The meds I took did not work and my mom refused to take me to the doctor to get a prescription change and she also wouldn't take me to therapy because it didn't fit in with her schedule (she was in nursing school).

My time at the mental hospital helped a lot, I went to therapy, i got proper meds, and I got family counseling with my mom. I was pretty happy there and I enjoyed spending time with all the other kids that I could actually relate to but I missed my friends and my pets and honestly I missed my mom. So In June I got to go home, it was a three hour drive home and the entire time I spent it calling my friends and listening to my music. I was excited to spend time with my mom, I thought we were gonna eat dinner and watch a movie. Instead she took me to her boyfriend's, I don't know this man that well and I didn't want to spend my first night back with him but I did because I didn't want to upset my mom. She kept taking me back every night even when I said I didn't want to and I had a panic attack every night because I didn't know what was happening. Finally I had a panic attack in front of both of them after a discussion about the blm protests and my mom scolded me and threatened that if he broke up with her she would beat me. She never officially apologized for it but I still love her and she has been nicer. She has been paying attention to the little things but it doesn't make up for it. 

Then (online) school started, things were going well at first but then I started getting behind and eventually I just gave up on the work, I stopped doing it and so I got kicked out, and now I just sleep a lot and I don't really have the motivation to keep living. My meds stopped working so I stopped taking them and I stopped going to therapy because my therapist doesn't do a good job but his office is the only one that accepts my insurance. My mom doesn't spend much time with me because she's so busy and so she leaves me home alone for most of the day and we still have about $1,600 still left to pay from my mental hospital bill even with insurance. My mom always talks about how much my meds cost and how my therapy is so expensive and I really feel like a burden. Also we are moving to a smaller more conservative town and I am not straight or cisgender so I am definitely gonna be bullied and one of my sisters told me that my father (who has since passed) was a pedophile.

I feel like an entitled dickwad because my mom works so hard to help support me and I don't want to put this much stress on her but I really think I need to go back to the mental hospital because I'm afraid I might attempt suicide again. I want to get better and I want to live but it's so expensive to go there. I don't know what to do.",26Nov2020,1
53,"So for context I have a extreme form of (SID) sensory integration disorder. This causes all of my senses to be heightened. This caused me to easily loose focus in school and procrastinate. This also caused me to have anxiety about school and a extreme fear of heights. This also caused years of bullying because other kids found out quickly that squeaking there chair or whistling irritated me. People loved to bully me because they got under my skin easily.   


This made finding friends in school nearly impossible due to the extreme bullying. The years of extreme bullying caused me to have tons of guilt for my disorder and anxiety.   
I also got made fun of by sister for my disorder and for my fear of shots. My fear of shots stem from my heightened sensitivity to touch. This wasn’t as extreme compared to the others but when I got a shot it felt like like was stabbing with a metal fork. This luckily got better over growing out of it. But my heightened sensitivity to sound and sight still is around.

Most teachers never helped either with my disorder and caused me to have a distrust to new teachers. My first grade teacher worked with kids who Autism and ADHD. She was mean to me and was convinced that I had Autism my mom had to get me tested in order to prove To her I had SID

My parents helped in many ways but also caused things to become worse as I grew older. My parents would think I heavily exaggerate things. My parents had such a distrust to my true sensitivity that it took three months for my mom to take me to the hospital when I twisted  my knee which caused my right foot to stick out and my right knee weak.

56,"So for context I have a extreme form of (SID) sensory integration disorder. This causes all of my senses to be heightened. This caused me to easily loose focus in school and procrastinate. This also caused me to have anxiety about school and a extreme fear of heights. This also caused years of bullying because other kids found out quickly that squeaking there chair or whistling irritated me. People loved to bully me because they got under my skin easily.

&amp;#x200B;

This made finding friends in school nearly impossible due to the extreme bullying. The years of extreme bullying caused me to have tons of guilt for my disorder and anxiety.I also got made fun of by sister for my disorder and for my fear of shots. My fear of shots stem from my heightened sensitivity to touch. This wasn’t as extreme compared to the others but when I got a shot it felt like like was stabbing with a metal fork. This luckily got better over growing out of it. But my heightened sensitivity to sound and sight still is around.

&amp;#x200B;

Most teachers never helped either with my disorder and caused me to have a distrust to new teachers. My first grade teacher worked with kids who Autism and ADHD. She was mean to me and was convinced that I had Autism my mom had to get me tested in order to prove To her I had SID. I also had many teacher who felt I was faking for attention.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents helped in many ways but also caused things to become worse as I grew older. My parents would think I heavily exaggerate things. My parents had such a distrust to my true sensitivity that it took three months for my mom to take me to the hospital when I twisted  my knee which caused my right foot to stick out and my right knee weak. In middle school I got more friends but they would just stop talking to me or find a way to stop talking to me. I’m now 15 in freshman year of high school with 2 friends I can’t talk to. This causes me to fell suicidal at times

She's happy and smily, and shows no signs of social anxiety at all. We have spent an entire day together, and can spend 6+ hours just chatting on video.

However, it takes her forever to agree to leave the house and meetup. In the past three months, we've only met up around three times, and it's about 50/50 if she will agree to an in-person date. I asked her about it today, and she admitted that in order to get her to go out on a weekend, she needs to start mentally preparing the Monday before. She's also not the most responsive texter.

She's definitely introverted and loves her personal space and alone time. She says video chatting is fine, but leaving the house is totally different. So if I ask her on a Wednesday for a weekend date, she will agree to a video call, but not to going out of the house. She says she had been like this since she was little, and doesn't really know why she's like this. She also says she knows it's a problem, and is willing to work on it.

69,"Some backstory to the events of today. I (18F) have been going to a Christian College for tertiary education and I’ve hated it, but my mum has also paid over 6k for the course. 

I’ve told my parents that I haven’t really liked it there at all and they were supportive to go to a different University to study the same course, just better. As my mom and I have been looking at new courses today, she asked to see my profile at the Christian College to see if they were going to make me do another year, and we stumbled across all the classes I have missed due to my poor mental health, and all the assignments I haven’t handed in, which started from me visiting the hospital for psychiatric reasons.

Safe to say that she flipped out and got my dad involved, in which he threatened to hit me (he has hit me before in case you were wondering), and to kick me out of the house, my mum won’t allow me to get food from the kitchen, and now I have to finish 13 assignments by tomorrow night otherwise my parents take everything I own.

I’ve been contemplating just running away and living in my car as my parents have been the main cause of making me want to kill myself (and I have a dead best friend so that says a lot).

71,"
before i give you some ways to help i would like to remind all of you that you are not alone in this! your intrusive thoughts are not you they don’t reflect you ideologies or character. your actions reflect who you are. for example i like to see people happy i like to buy them things and help out whenever i can. i am not a bad person my thoughts are not me. 

ways to help:
1) art ! i cannot say it enough it doesn’t matter if you think you are good or bad. any kind of art takes focus and all your attention. listening to music at the same time also helps a lot if you are really struggling!!

2) working out. i know working out sounds like something you might not want to take part it, but it helps a lot. working out takes a lot of your energy and focus this helps best for people who get these thoughts mainly at night. bonus: if you are really struggling with falling asleep melatonin helps me a lot as well. 

3) writing. you can write about your thoughts or about anything you want. it helps a lot because again it’s something you have to be creative with and focus on. 

4) a job! this is ofc if you are old enough or can work! working takes again focus especially in a fast pace job where things are constantly happening. you will also be making money well controlling your thoughts!

5) talking about it. many of you probably don’t feel comfortable sharing these things with people you know in real life. that’s why i think this sub is a great place to get out all your feelings. you can also seek therapy which can help a lot. 

this are somethings i do to help cope! i hope they can help you all as well! if there is anything else you would like me to cover or just have some questions lmk!",26Nov2020,1

Why did you let pain become something I had to go to the darkest parts of my soul not to feel. Where I decided to follow the darkness. So why. Why. Why. Why. Why. Why. Do you ever really feel me. Do you ever hear a haunting. Not even a thought of a sound in the middle of the galaxy of your mind. And your heart quickens because it was the sound of a tortured daughter. A scream that tiptoes across your essense. Can you look up and see me. Can't you see my truth anymore. Can't you ever see past your bubble, to the tired old grey soul that now lives on a grey cliff.

79,"TW: suicidal thoughts, homophobia 

I hate myself so much. I keep getting angry and frustrated at myself. I claw at my arms and stomach. I punch my head. I keep having these... intrusive self destructive h thoughts I think? I imagine bashing my head against the wall. When I stand at the top of the stairs I imagine just letting myself fall down them. Yesterday I imagined throwing myself out the window. I get the urge to throw my whole body onto the ground. Sometimes walking up the stairs I start to lose my balance and I’ll almost let myself actually fall. Today I just thought to myself “I deserve to die.” I don’t know why I thought that. I don’t think I believe that. But I’m scared of what I’ll do to myself.

I keep looking for and reading homophobic religious texts like it’ll turn me straight or something. But it just makes me feel worse. I’ll cry and have panic attacks and think about how much my family would hate me if they knew. Or think about how they’d say “I just don’t agree with the lifestyle.” How they’d pray for the “evil spirits” or “demons” to leave me. I read something where they said willingly fantasizing about the same gender counts as homosexual behavior, makes you a homosexual offender, which means you’ll go to hell. I’ll read about other bisexual Christians who have managed to pursue their relationships with the opposite sex and ignored their feelings for the same sex. I get angry that I feel I can’t do the same. I get angry at how unfair it all is. I had a dream last night, where I flirted with someone of the same sex with no shame, and it makes me sad because I wish I could feel that free in real life and it makes me angry because I shouldn’t have done that, even in a dream. I feel disgusting. I keep thinking “I want to die,” but I don’t actually want to die, that’s terrifying. I just want the pain to stop. But I’m not suicidal, not really.

I don’t know why I keep looking for these hateful texts. I want to stop having these thoughts of being violent towards myself. I’m trying to talk myself out of it by reminding myself I’d get a concussion or something, but I’m not always rational when my self hatred flares up.

91,"Hello all. 23 year old man here. Using a throw away for this.  So...  Where to begin. Most of my life I've always been a social outcast.  Had issues making friends, couldn't maintain a friendship or relationship, and socializing in general. However, I definitely had my talents.  Excelled in school, had strong hobbies,  and played sports like football.  Currently I like lifting weights, shooting, hiking, art, and reading.  

     In elementary and middle school (age 5-13) it was Hell. I was constantly fighting and getting picked on.  In between this I struggled with social dynamics and interaction.  In group settings it was even worse.  I didn't know how to fluidly  work with people. Class projects etc.  Going onto high school (age 14-18) it improved for me.  I was good at football and academics so I became ""popular"" to an extent.  Despite this I still has problems relating to others.  Didn't know how to talk about my hobbies and interests with teens interested in typical shit that age.  Social media, partying, and music.  Being a Metalhead not many understood this.  During these times I would experience ""breakdowns"" or ""shutdowns"". Me and my family thought this was due to teenage hood so we didn't give it much thought. Also, never really displayed erratic behavior that would call for professional help.  

     In college (age 18-21) it was a similar situation but now I was a bit wiser. Learned to handle my meltdowns and shut down phases but still had problems.  Dating was a constant ordeal.  Whenever I did manage to talk to women I would be flushed with stimulation I would be awkward.  That or I would become exhausted and my drive was inconsistent.  During this time I decided to see professional help.  Two therapists suggested I was on the high functioning spectrum of autism. They educated me and it started to make sense.  Upon this discovery I stopped seeing them due to issues with insurance.  Also, I was really busy with school so time in my end was tied up.  Finding work for myself was actually not too hard.  I always put my best forward in an academic or work environment.  I never talked to my co-workers as to avoid awkward moments or them discovering my condition.  I would go out or at least tried too.  During this time in my life I got into a few fights, knife fights, and nearly killed in a shooting.  This definitely didn't help my social angst haha.  Needless to say I'm still alive right?  This was when I started to feel more and more detached from reality. Everything was becoming a dream and distorted. With my life being in danger and gradually disillusioned feelings toward society due to rejection.  I would layer discover this as depersonalization.  

     After getting my degree in biology (age 21-23) I evolved quite a bit.  A lot more mature and refined. I chose my friends better as well.  However, my mentality was another situation. I felt really unsatisfied with my life and progress.  I was thinking of going to  university for my bachelor's but didn't like the idea of being I'm debt.  Also, didn't like the social dynamics of the local school.  I'm pretty conservative and they're far left.  Second was the military.  I come from a long line of military men so I thought it was about my turn... Biggest mistake of my life.  I enlisted in the Army as a combat medic and shipped off to Basic Combat Training.  There I excelled in shooting, physical exercise, and classwork.  Naturally.  On downtime it was another story.  I didn't know how to bond or socially interact with my platoon.  They were into girls, their own hobbies, and things outside of the Army.  With so much going on I felt overwhelmed and stimulated constantly.  I had no options so it built up.  My psyche degrade sharply and started to shut down.  My performance in training dropped and suicidal intentions built up.  On top of this my detachment from reality grew wider.  My cadre and commander eventually decided to admit me to a psych ward.  I was rock bottom and never felt so hopeless. There I would be further evaluated.  I was tagged with autism, anxiety, and depersonalization.  The Army kicked me out.  I felt both disappointed and relieved. Relieved I got actual help for the first time in my life but disappointed I failed.  

     Since then I've learned to be more at ease about my quirks.  Embrace what I am and not compromise myself for others approval.  Right now I'm working at a bakery and as a COVID screener.  I applied for the firefighter brigade in my city and waiting to hear back.  For the first time in my life I feel their is a path for me.  A surreal and clear path as I view in my unique mindset.

92,"Hi. I don't know where else to go. I hoped to get some help here.

I have a condition called maladaptive daydreaming. It usually reacts to stress as well as a toddler reacts to somebody banging pots and pans by their head- As in, not well at all.

Usually, I'm able to pull myself out of a daydream and stay out of it, but today was different. I suddenly remembered the panic attack I had a few days back, began to daydream about it in different situations multiple times, and ended up falling head-first into a morbidly out-of-body state of derealization (Does that make any sense? I don't know what I'm even doing right now).

It scared the ever-loving crap out of me. And, along with that, I still felt the echoes of panic that had occurred during my daydream.

Not only was the derealization new, but I started randomly convulsing. My muscles seized up, my hands started to clench in movements akin to strangulation, I started shaking, and it felt almost like what one would imagine a tic to be like. I know for sure, though, that I don't have tics.

I have been told I’m a kind person but looking back at the things I’ve done and said I don’t think that is true. I don’t see myself as a normal person anymore, I’ve considered suicide many times since 3rd grade but have kept going because I feel like it would be too big of a inconvenience to others. I hate myself and the way I do things, I don’t have a father and I hate the person I’m becoming. I always wanted to be a kind person but that is not who I see anymore. I need support from people because I can think of a few people in my life who would even care. 
I need support and advise on what to do. Venting here has helped but I need advise as well. Please help",26Nov2020,1
94,"Oh literally hate myself. Everything about myself. Down to the fucking way my fingernails are shaped and the way that I talk to people. I’ve been thru a lot in the past couple months, I won’t go into detail because I’ve posted on here about it.. a lot. My anxiety has never been higher in my life, at work I constantly think my co workers are shit talking me just for existing and I feel like the customers are doing the same. I take it out on the people that I care about which I hate, but I also take it out on myself. On really hard nights I will literally just rip my hair out. Among other things. I have not told anyone about it, not even my closest friends. Because I’m just to anxious. I have a therapist but he’s rarely available. I’ve began to do things I would normally never do, using alcohol and sex to forget about whatever is going on inside my head which I honestly don’t even know. There’s been so, so much trauma in the past 2 months. I feel like to other people it looks like nothing but to me it is tearing my world a fucking part. I feel alone, I know I’m not, but I feel like it. I feel like a waste of space and I’m only staying around for the people who really care about me. If I could die without anyone getting hurt from my actions I just might. I feel so worthless. So disgusting. Like I’ll never accomplish my goals in life. I’m scared to get better help because my step dad has literally told me that people who want to die are cowards and should just end it because the world doesn’t need them. And I know that’s not true at all, but those things get to me. It felt like a brick to my head. I feel such a weight on my head and chest that I can’t seem to lift. It’s like I’m drowning. But I can’t fucking cry. Not even writing this. Maybe a couple tears roll down my face but have I had a proper time to process what’s going on in my life? I haven’t. I feel so emotionless and at the same time so, so, so depressed and anxious.",26Nov2020,1

96,"I’m coming to this subreddit because I can’t see my therapist for the next 2 weeks and I would ask her but I can’t wait.

I’m having extreme paranoia whenever i’m alone or at night. I’m hearing voices from different parts of my house and it feels like they’re beckoning me to come closer. They’re androgynous voices. Then as soon as I turn my back to walk away, it feels like there’s an invisible person behind me and my hairs spike up on my neck. I felt it just a bit ago when I was downstairs. The only light on was my kitchen and as I was heading upstairs, I felt someone’s watch and felt someone behind me and I turned around and no one was there. I ran up the stairs and turned the light off and it looked like someone was staring at me from the dark. Shit like this makes me locks my doors at night. No one is in my house besides me and my parents. But i don’t understand those creepy feelings, creepy voices, and creepy stares even thought they’re not there, it feels like they are. The paranoia is even there when it’s daylight. I’ll feel a stare and I just want to grab the knife from my kitchen and lock myself in my room to protect myself. 

I’m not crazy I swear and i’m not making this up, but putting this in words makes me sound stupid. Is this just me or is this normal? Like not NORMAL, but is this normal for some mental illness? I have depression and anxiety, lots of past trauma, and i’m getting tested next time i go to therapy for other things. Does anyone know what this may be so I can talk to my therapist about it? Also since in my time zoom it’s morning, Happy Thanksgiving to everyone reading this.",26Nov2020,1

Certain thoughts trigger my anxiety in regards to an ex. Certain events, places, sounds, images triggers me to negative scenarios about my ex. It takes me to painful future where I start a negative scenario in my head. 

How do I get over that? Observe it in peace, acknowledge it and then let it go so it doesnt hurt even if it visits again? 

Thank you",26Nov2020,1
98,"A couple of months ago I lost my best friend to a drug overdose. I know it's not my fault but I just feel like I could have been there for him more. He didn't really have any other close friends and he was always going through a lot mentally. He moved like 30 minutes away and we just didn't hang out as much and he started to get into serious drugs. I just can't get it out of my head bc I was the only one who could have been there for him and made him understand how much he would be missed if something ever happened. If I had just been over there a couple of days before I could have stopped him from getting into the things he did because he always came to me for advice. It's been weighing heavy on my concious bc I feel like no one else would have been able to talk him out of the things he was doing.

Losing 2 family members is aweful but only a week later my buddy from work died in a car accident. I just feel like the mental toll of all of this happening is making me feel the worst I ever have. Started taking Xanax bc I was so depressed and I really don't think it's been helping, only creating an addiction. My question is what's the best way to cope with all of this and how can I forgive myself for not being their for my friend. I just want to forget that any of it happened but that feels disrespectful and I do wanna remember the good things about them but it's just too much and it's been hard to opperate normally in life lately with all this on my mind. Anything helps. Just want to talk to people about it bc I'm just not comfortable being so vulnerable in front of my friends as a guy.

102,"Happy Thursday everyone! 

We are getting nearer and nearer to December, which means one thing... **Christmas Time**. Unfortunately, not all of us will spend Christmas at home with our loved ones. Down below, I will be listing different Christmas charities that will be over-the-moon with some donations and support. After such an incredibly bleak, tough and quite frankly, disappointing year, many people are struggling out there. Yes, we have all struggled, but for some of us, we are fortunate enough to work, to eat, to drink and to have a roof over our heads. For others, they are not so lucky. 

This gives the people around the World the most perfect of opportunity to share and give to others who are in need, to finish off the year in high spirits and great generosity. If you’re interested and made it this far into the post, I will post the charities down below!

- **Salvation Army, Christmas Present Appeal**

Here in the UK, we have all heard of the Salvation Army. The Salvation Army has many churches all across the UK. Not only that, but this year, it will be running a *Christmas Present Appeal*. What does this mean, you say? The Salvation Army will be collecting gifts and toys for all the children who may not receive a Christmas gift this year. So, if you have a bag of toys in your house, which you haven’t touched for about 10 years, how about you give them away to children who are in need of them? Let’s be honest, no child wants to wake up on Christmas morning... to nothing. It’s upsetting and it will ruin the whole Christmas experience for him/her. If you want to donate, you’re able to do this by contacting or getting in-hold of your local Salvation Army Church, by doing so, you’ll then be given information on how and where to donate your belongings. This year’s donations are open until Mid-December, so hurry, hurry, hurry! :) 
Not only that, but due to the number of people sleeping in the roughness this year, the Salvation Army will be offering various different things, such as: hot meals, specialist support and a sleeping bag. 

For further information on donating, please visit here: (Unfortunately, I am not able to link the website, but you can visit the website by searching up “Salvation Army Donate” on Google!)

- The Book Trust

BOOK LOVERS, THIS IS FOR YOU! The Book Trust Christmas Appeal are doing everything in their power to raise enough money to send book parcels to children who are vulnerable or in care. Due to COVID-19, people have lost many jobs and because of that, they are not able to bring money into their household. These children’s families have been experiencing challenging circumstances and due to that, the children may also face their first Christmas without their families, which can be incredibly tough on them. With your donation, you will not help 1 child, but you’r donation could end up helping up to 14,250 of them! For the first time ever, the parcels will be given out through community food-banks to help out the same families who have been affected by the worldwide pandemic and lockdown regulations. 

For further information, please visit here: (Visit The Book Trust website!)

- **RSPCA**

This year, the RSPCA is doing everything they can to raise as much money as possible, asking for donations in the range of £15, £25, £50 or any other amount, anything you can afford. With this money, the RSPCA will use to help answer calls to the Animal Rescue Line, it will also go towards being able to keep the Animal Rescue Teams out on the roads during the Christmas period and lastly, look after the animals that are in need of care. For example, the £40 would be able to cover the cost of 5 cats and dogs to be microchipped. Last Christmas, a number of 2,500 animals were taken in to be looked after and cared for. Christmas is a very common time for animals to be abandoned by their owners, which is why they are asking for as much donations as possible. Understandably, due to how the year has gone and many people struggling with work, the owners are struggling to look after the animals, emotionally and financially. Thankfully, the staff and workers at the RSPCA work tirelessly every single day to ensure that every animal that’s been brought in is treated right and with care. The staff don’t take any time off, even on Christmas Day. If you’re able to donate, it would mean the world to them. You can do so here: The RSPCA website! 

- **Age UK**

For over 1.5 million people, Christmas is the loneliest time of the year. This can be due to their partner dying, their parents are not longer with them, they no longer see their families and many more. It can be a sad, depressing and dark time, if you’re alone. The Age UK charity is here to ensure that nobody spends time on their own during Christmas, as they say, it’s the happiest time of the year. If you’ve experienced the good or bad, you deserve to celebrate Christmas. Down below are information on how to contact this great and meaningful charity:

The Age UK Advice Line: 0800 678 1602. It is open from the hours of (8am-7pm), 365 days a year and OPEN and AVAILABLE on Christmas Day! 

Here are just 4 of many, many other charities that are out there. I have done my best to mix up the categories as much as possible. In this list, we have care for: The Elderly, Animals, Children and The Homeless). If you’re to donate 10p, it would be incredibly grateful and a brilliant thing to do, to ensure that someone, out there, will spend Christmas with someone. 

Thanks for reading the post!",26Nov2020,1
103,"i know that the holiday season can be difficult for many people, so i just wanted to reach out and say that i hope you’re all doing okay. but, i realize that many people in this subreddit might be struggling right now so i want to point out that this sub is an incredible community filled with people who look out for one another. i always know that if i’m having a bad day, i can post here and get support, which i think is pretty cool. people in this sub are willing to listen to others, give advice, and share their own experiences. also, i think it’s really important to *try* and take care of yourself when you’re struggling and professional help can be a great option for that! plus, self-care can be very helpful as well (taking walks, drawing, watching tv, etc)

anyway, i hope you’re all taking care of yourselves and doing okay overall. if not, though, make sure to get help if you need it. let’s all support each other through the end of 2020!!",26Nov2020,1
104,"It's too common for people to act like people who emotionally suffer are lazy for 'not putting the work into therapy'. It stems from he idea that *medication and therapy will always help*, and it that isn't working it's because *you aren't doing the work; you aren't ready to heal yet.* Why can't people accept that therapy, as it exists now, isn't a fucking panacea. It's like asking someone to wear a badly fitting shirt, and blaming the person's body type for the poor fit. You ask for a new shirt but the person at the store says, ""no sorry this is the only size shirt that exists, if you don't like it there is something wrong with you.""

 Now, If I try to say that therapy isn't helpful I get bombarded by people telling me some variation of ""therapy and medication is the **ONLY WAY** and you must **try harder**, if you can't see that it is the **ONLY WAY** it is because **your brain is sick** and your thoughts and or emotions are broken so you are unable to see that of therapy and medication are the **ONLY WAY.""**

It is beyond infuriating, beyond offensive to have people treat you as lazy and mentally incompetent because their belief about your life doesn't match the realities of your life as you experience them.

106,"I'm just constantly confused about what's been happening to me and I'm annoyed. These symptoms have been going on for months now.

I had hit the left side of my head when riding my bike. I had gotten a small, pinching, cold headache, but I didn't really care much until the symptoms occured. 

2 week later I had started showing symptoms, such as

1. Sudden memory loss for recent events
2. Increased fear for future events(due to the memory loss)
3. Random moments of apathy and depression
4. Confusion
5. sudden increase in pain when looking top right at random, that goes away after 1-4 hours(it went away after a week or 2)

Later I developed symptoms of

1. Increasing rates of insomnia and restlessness
2. Extreme tiredness during the day
3. Difficulty with time and dates, and sometimes not recognizing some known locations
4. Introversion
5. Difficulty trusting people
6. Increased confusion

Then I developed

1. Poor behavior and judgement
2. Getting more agitated easily
3. More difficulty with following certain directions.
4. Difficulty with remembering people(I forgot someone I know for 3 months, and seen every other day, even though I heard her voice, and saw her face)

My doctor says I don't have a brain injury, but only have iron deficiency, which might be right, but it's weird how all these symptoms happen 2 weeks after the accident.

108,"I can't tell anyone I know IRL my problems because I think I'm burdening them and it's not their place to know but I really need to say something before I do something I might regret. 

When I was in an argument with my mother yesterday, she kept going on about how selfish, lazy and ungrateful I was. Recently, it's been getting really bad again and I stopped eating, caring about school, and it's so so hard to get out of bed sometimes. In a moment of rash decision, I told her that she was the only reason I kept myself alive. My father left when I was a child and I'm an only child, so whenever I had any harmful thoughts I told myself I had to stay alive and work in the future so I could support her when she can no longer work. She told me I was a liar so I finally showed her my arms which are covered with SH scars. 

Instead of showing any compassion, she only got even angrier. She told me that it was completely disrespectful that I could harm my own body because she birthed me, and it was disrespectful to her. When I started crying, she laughed at me. She told me that if I was going to kill myself, I shouldn't do such a half-assed job. If I were to attempt, I should make sure it works because she doesn't want to have to take care of me if I had to stay at the hospital. 

This isn't the first time that she has been so toxic. She's always belittled my feelings. When I was younger and tried to tell her that I should maybe see a psychologist because I was so numb and felt so horrible I could barely do anything she told me I had no right to feel that way. She constantly tells me that I'm ugly and fat, and when I stopped eating and lost weight, she told me that it was working and maybe I should just keep neglecting my health. She also hits me sometimes but I know that's part of Asian culture. I know it's difficult being a single mother and I should appreciate what she does, but it hurts so much when I'm struggling with suicidal thoughts and she tells me to just do it instead of trying to help. 

I don't know what to do. She's the reason I can't die but she's also what's killing me.",26Nov2020,1

I've been to counseling before and I've been on meds, but didn't want to be dependent on medication so I got off of it. I go through periods of being really happy and then will have days that are just so hard. But even when I'm happy, I seem to have trouble seeing a point to existing or even refuting the idea that everything would've been so much simpler had I never existed at all... The thought of death really scares me, of never seeing friends and family again. I am catholic and believe in God but am very science minded so the fact that there is no hard proof of there being a God or higher power causes me to freak out over it.

111,"There are times when I feel like I’m on top of the world and that everything will be okay. There are also times when I feel defeated and spend days crying and moping over negative thoughts and memories. I close myself off and sleep as a way to cope. This happens every few months. 

It’s usually a small problem that triggers me to act this way. The most recurrent issue I’ve had is probably comparing myself to others. I am constantly doing so with almost everything, including colleges, appearance, grades, and personality and it always leaves me feeling like there’s no hope left for me to shine. It feels as if everyone else has at least one thing that makes them special, while I have nothing. I become too focused on my own shortcomings that I end up becoming as uninteresting as possible when interacting with others.

Are there any suggestions on how to get over this and to stop thinking so negatively? I’m worried this will impact my career since I’ve had various people criticizing my personality. For example, someone has said that I’m not fit to become a nurse because I’m expressionless and she feels that I’m not compassionate enough. Hearing that really broke my heart especially because I never saw myself as what she described, which made me feel so misunderstood.

114,"Someone I know was verbally abused on here yesterday for a post they made on a sub-reddit, they showed some vulnerability and opened up about a few things which they have issues with in their life, such as addiction and depression.

Some of the comments they received by this one person were -

""Grow some balls"", ""You crack head loser"", ""Why don't you do us all a favour and OD and kill yourself"".

Thankfully this person is mentally in an ok place right now so they kind of brushed it off, however I know from my own mental health issues in the past that sometimes when you are in a bad place that it can feel like the world is against you, and as such, remarks such as this could be the straw that breaks the camel's back or contributes to further isolation and depression.

I'm a believer in processing emotion, so although some people probably can brush such remarks off as just being the ramblings of a lunatic, there are other people who act like they are not affected but deep down they are, and the longer the carry around these things the more problems they can create for them in every day life. It can even start to make them bitter against the world, especially if they don't have a good support network around them and if other people on Reddit don't come to stick up for them (which is what happened to my friend).

So some things which I offered as perspective and support to my friend were -

**Consider the source**

Similar  words can have different weight to them depending on who says it. And  the source of those words is important. The weight of the words is  higher if you value that person’s opinion.

So ask yourself, does the opinion of this person actually matter? Most often, the answer is no. You shouldn't take a strangers opinion of you too seriously, even if they did read a few things you wrote on Reddit, that is a very limited perspective of you.

**A happy well-rounded person would never say such things to another person**

It's more than likely they have issues themselves and their way of dealing with those issues is to attack other people to make themselves feel powerful.

So this is more about them than about you, or they may even see something in you which they hate about themselves so they chose to attack you, 'projection'.

**If this does bother you I don't think that makes you weak**

Some people are more sensitive than others, and I don't think this is a weakness. But no one is immune, if someone ran up to you in the street and said these things in your face, although you can brush them off as being a lunatic, all the bad energy they have directed at you needs to be processed in someway.

So if you feel pissed off, angry etc, don't try to hide that to appear 'tough', admit that was a bad experience and give yourself time to process what happened, then you can laugh about it and move on.",26Nov2020,1
115,"Trigger warning: su*cide

I’m 17 and I’m confused and scared. I don’t know what to do right now so feedback would be appreciated.

I’m 99% sure I have social anxiety disorder, but this is a self-diagnosis. Two years ago, my social anxiety was at its worst. When I interacted with people, my heart would race, my body would shake, and it was nearly impossible to speak. I just couldn’t get the words out. I went to great lengths to avoid people; I spent my freshman year of high school eating lunch in the bathroom on stalls. I was constantly worried that people were watching me and judging me. I had a toxic, non-stop internal dialogue in my head. My self-esteem was incredibly low (and eating lunch in the bathroom didn’t help). This went on for months. I grew further away from my family and there were times where I would go days without saying a word to anyone. I was completely socially isolated. 

This led to a period of about two months of feeling completely worthless and exhausted. I slept a lot and was having a tough time with school. It was a huge challenge to get up in the morning, shower, and do most other things. It was a constant slog. I became irritated and violent at times for no reason. I slammed my hands against the kitchen counters to feel something pushing against my body. I broke the door to my bedroom. I hoped that my parents would notice that I felt like complete shit but they didn’t seem to care. This whole time it never occurred to me that I might have a problem with my mental health. I just viewed myself the way I thought everyone else viewed me: a lonely, moody, weirdo.

There were times where life did not seem real to me. I would sit next to classmates at school and it would feel like they were far away from me even if they were physically right next to me. It felt like I was viewing the world through a foggy pane of glass from a distance. I had strange, almost compulsive thoughts about doing absurd things just to see if life was actually real or if I was in a dream. 

At one point, late in my freshman year of high school, I realized that I might have depression. I remembered the lessons I had been given in health class in middle school about depression. I did a lot of google searches about depression and the other troubles I was having and I stumbled across a Wikipedia article about social anxiety disorder. I was shocked as I read this, because up until that point I didn’t know SAD (social anxiety disorder) was a thing. I assumed that social anxiety was just an inherent, negative aspect of a person’s personality. 

I’m not going to get into the details because then this post would be a lot longer than it needs to be, but I reached out to my school counselor. Ultimately, I only meet with her a couple times because I did not feel like she was listening to me. I largely dealt with my mental health issues through research and implementation of at-home treatments. I took up meditation, journaling, and focused more on exercise. I established a better sleep schedule and quieted my negative, cyclical thoughts. I researched ways to handle anxiety in the moments that It occurs and this helped monumentally. Over time, I become more comfortable talking and did not feel like passing out when my name got mentioned in class. I even made some friends over the next year. 

Today, I still continue to run, journal, and meditate and I feel much better. However, recently I have been growing close with a teacher of mine at school and we have been studying neuroscience together. Both of us have turned to this subject because of our personal experiences with mental health difficulties. This is something that has been implied in the past but not really talked about specifically. A couple days ago, though, this teacher told me about some of his specific experiences with depression and essentially invited me to share if I have ever experienced anything similar, if I was comfortable with sharing. This was extremely difficult because I wanted to share about my experiences but realized that if he found out that I had a history of depression and suicidal thoughts that were not really treated, he might have an obligation to report those issues. 

This realization made me think about the fact that I might not really have a very good grip on my mental health situation. From what I understand, social anxiety disorder is a chronic condition and it could come back again strong in the future. This has kept me up late tonight because if I somehow end up in a similar place as I was in two years ago, I might once again have crazy dissociations and become detached from reality. This scares the absolute shit out of me. If I’m not mentally stable, I want to make sure I get help. 

With all of that being said, I am scared of sharing any of this information with my parents and I don’t know if I need a mental health professional helping me with this. It feels like my life had been going well but now this traumatic stuff is suddenly flooding back again.

it's like seeing someone you hate, someone who has absolutely destroyed you and you feel no guilt or remorse in wanting to stab them to death, but you know theres people who care about them and you'll hurt them immesurably if you kill or hurt them. and for some reason you feel unfathomable rage towards every aspect of their being, their very concept enrages you to the point of murderous fantasies, you can feel nothing but hatred for this person and you feel they are absolutely worthless and nothing but garbage, and you feel absolutely no compassion for them. you just hate them so fucking much, and your biggest joy would be stabbing them repeatedly, watching their stupid little fucking face cry and suffer immensely.

120,"So basically I went through alot of stuff the last few years. Nothing more or less then the most people here experienced too. I don't want to go into much detail. Basically it involves a huge trauma caused by an abusive relationship with W(29) which ended almost a year ago and a lot of stuff revolving around my new job which I just started in March this year.

Every single day I wake up in the morning with a crippling amount of anxiety. It's so bad, I can't really move, it's crippling, I snooze my alarm like 10 times hoping it gets away. I'm in a leadership position at work, often the anxiety revolves around responsibilities that come with this job including my huge disappointment with the company, which is why I still tend to lay in my bed when I join the first three meetings in the morning and do everything with Teams on my iphone, because I just can't get up. At around 12pm I jump in the shower and then I walk to the grocery store nearby and get myself some food for lunch and dinner. 

I do that because it's the only reason I have to leave my apartment, 'cause we're currently in lockdown.

I've been living like that for the majority of the year except for summer.

The thing is I'm actually a very social person, I'm extroverted, kind and outgoing. I've had a lot of friends, at least that's what I thought. But for the past few months my closest friends have gotten into new relationships and take ages getting back to me on text with no intentions to hang out. So basically I'm lonely.  


There's two underlying issues I've identified. First: Nobody takes me serious when I talk about my mental health problems, neither doctors (""you seem perfectly fine"") nor my friends or my family.

Theres nobody who cares about me, I get ghosted all the time by friends or girls no matter what I do and I've been working in homeoffice since March and my CEO forgets about my existence on a regular basis. I often procrastinate, let my apartment become a mess or don't put effort into day to day things because I've got thoughts like ""my life won't improve anyways"".   


I don't know what to do and the first question to tackle this would be:

How can I cope / deal with the morning anxiety? It's a huge problem for me..",26Nov2020,1

I (20M) feel like shit constantly. I feel so alone yet I surround myself with people. Most of these relationships I wouldn't call toxic per se but they are most definitely one sided. I prefer having this shitty relationships with people than be alone because when alone my mind races far too much and causes me a lot of anxiety. I've been depressed on and off since I was maybe 13 or so. Attempted suicide a couple times without success. I have no sense of self worth. I like maybe two things about me and that's it, everything else is a negative and I hate myself for it. After years of attempted self reflection and talking to some people I know what a lot of my problems are but I have no idea where to start with trying to fix them. I have so many bad habits. I'm overweight. I feel like people don't take me seriously. I put up this facade that everything is ok and people see me as the funny guy. I spend so much of my time trying to make other people happy yet nobody ever checks on me or even goes out of their way to talk to me. At uni, I can socialise perfectly fine but I can't help but feel unloved. I have lost all interest in sex and sexual relationships. Occasionally at parties and stuff I'll have one night stands but I don't feel good or bad about it afterwards as it's just meaningless sex after all. I just want to feel loved and wanted. It feels like everyone takes me for granted but it feels better than being alone. I barely attend my lectures but I'm smart enough to be able to do my assignments to a high level and do perfectly fine in that aspect. My uni knows that I struggle with mental health problems and have offered support but I can't accept it. I can't open up to people because it feels wrong to me. I find it hard to express my emotions. Everyday, all I do is distract myself from my own problems and ignore then until I have my next mental breakdown. I don't know how I expect people to love me if I don't love myself but at the same time I can't love myself because I don't feel complete. I'm just stuck. I'm fed up of being so fucked up yet I'm too lazy to do anything about it.

124,"So, I have quite a few mental health issues, depression, anxiety, body image disorder, eating disorders, suicidal ideation and plans. 

Everytime I have asked for help, I just get brushed off and told that ""it's not that bad"". 

I am only officially diagnosed with depression and they refuse to talk to me about any of the other issues because I am obese. I have quite a lot of issues with my endocrine system, so my hormones are all over the place and I have mobility issues due to a busted spine, so weightloss really does not come easy to me. Throw in my eating disorders and I'm screwed but my Drs will not help me with it. Just tell me to go to the gym and eat a salad... 

Anyway, I have been asking and asking and asking for a psych assessment because I know this is more than just depression and every time I am told straight up, No. I been told my GP can't refuse a referral without good cause and they really don't have one. Every time, no matter what I try to say to them or explain to them, I'm cut off and they just come at me with ""Well, you are fat. Maybe you're depressed about that!?"" No, I'm not, you fatphobic f***wads. They've told me I can't possibly have eating disorders because I'm fat, I can't have body dysmorphia because I'm fat and it's a ""thin person issue"". Even that I don't really have anxiety and my suicidal thoughts are over exaggerated because I'm just fat and It's all just low self esteem apparently! My weight is not my issue, my brain is. And how can I possibly even attempt to lose weight if I can't get my head level?

I finally got someone to listen to me and they were really concerned and was really determined to get me help but he's only a nurse practitioner and can't send referrals without GP approval. So my case went to their weekly mothers meeting, he gave them this huge list of notes Id brought in when I spoke to him, and they turned around and said, I'm not depressed, I'm just fat and told him I just need to go to CBT. They can deal with me. 

Now, I have been to CBT repeatedly, I have been to CBT and 1on1 counselling around 8 times? None of it sticks, it's not set up for long term care and I have never once been offered further help, they tell me my GP needs to do that. 

So what do I do now!? I've been unmedicated since late spring because my Dr randomly decided he felt I'd be better off without! I'm not supported, I'm in a really bad headspace and I have no safety network. I need help.",26Nov2020,1

I met a girl who was close with the owner of the server. (Btw I had no intentions on getting into a relationship with this girl). Anyways  I met this girl and we start talking. She’s a really smart girl with a very cute voice and everyone would simp for her in the server. She’s also a minor like me, and I would find it weird that some of the mods who were 18 plus would do the kissing command and @ the girl but I’m getting off track. So I became really close with this girl, we would talk everyday and she gave me her snap. Remember I was trying to get mod still, plus was also not looking for a relationship. But... as time went on I caught feelings for her and she did for me too. One day we’re talking on snap and she’s ask me if I wanna be her boyfriend meanwhile we live on opposite ends of the world so I respond saying that I would love too but it would be so hard having a long term relationship. I would later regret saying this. Now here’s a key part of this story there is this boy who lives in the same country as her and also in the same country they’re also around the same age. Well this boy was also close with her. He also had feelings for her, I kinda knew this in my mind but didn’t wanna confront her about it. Alright ima give this girl a name it’s call her Mai so this other boy had a crush on Mai and was sad when Mai didn’t like him back. But for some reason I was jealous and grew to become clingy to Mai I never realized how much of a toxic person I had became infill after she told me. I would text mean things in chat and would when Mai wouldn’t text back I would think she’s texting other boys and would become legit crazy. It got to the point where I asked her out cuz I didn’t want to lose her but I ended up making it worse. She then blocked me after I said some rude things that I regret till this day. It’s been about 3 months after this occurred and I can’t get her outta my head, everything reminds me of her. I don’t wanna give up this girl was one of the best things that happened to me.

I was in there for over an hour. I think I said 5 mins of words. He talked about himself and how good he is. Spoke of some other crazy shit that I cannot even remember it all.

What really stuck with me is that he told me depression isn’t real, it’s just a construct of Western society, invented in 1910 at Harvard.

133,"I was wondering if anyone has anything to say  
about creatine supplementation in the treatment of depression?

Although I have no diagnosis from a psychiatrist I have experienced symptoms of depression for around 2 years. I have had some counselling and my GP has suggested I could try antidepressants a couple of times. I was holding off on SSRIs for a while but as things got worse I was about to make the decision to try them. Unfortunately in the UK antidepressants are basically the only treatment for depression you can get through our government run healthcare system. 

I had tried many self-guided activities for my depressed state: skateboarding, weight lifting, healthy diet.... And I got into really good shape but it didn't help. I also got very good grades for a year long project. Yet nothing helped and I continued to feel worse and worse until I felt there was no other option besides Anti-depressants. I was sick of just waiting for the days to end, filling out the time with whatever activities I could squeeze in. I had decided I wanted to try antidepressants.

On this same day I received my first order of creatine monohydrate. I purchased this for my weightlifting and strength exercises. There is a lot of strong evidence in the use of creatine for increasing strength and muscle mass in athlete's etc.....

Over the next few days and now a week later, I can definitely say that since taking creatine I have noticed a significant improvement in my mood. Things that would usually pull me back into that dark place, are more easily overlooked and forgetten about. I was confused and I thought it was strange that my mood as noticeably gotten better since I started taking creatine.

After reading online I found out that creatine is actually important for brain bioenergetics and there have been several studies suggesting it may be useful in the treatment of depression. After reading about these proposed mechanisms of action and the preclinical sicess in mouse models.of depression I am quite fascinated by this topic. 

Does anyone have any opinions on this topic?? Has anyone tried to use creatine in this context?? I'm not promoting the use of any substances but creatine is very safe and pretty cheap. I am no neuroscientist nor do I know the importance of brain metabolism but this is interesting. I am very surprised that I have noticed such a distinct change in my mood and such changes coincide with when I started creatine supplementation.",26Nov2020,1

135,"I apologise about the length of the post, but I wanted to provide as much detail as possible. This is kinda a vent, kinda me asking for other people's thoughts.

I'll start with myself. I'm an HSP (meaning emotions are very intense for me, and I'm also overly-empathetic to others to the point I'll cry if someone else cries even if I'm not ""sad"" myself, just sorry for them). I think I have anxiety (I am quite literally always overthinking, overanalysing and overstressing about everything), however at the same time I have heard people describe anxiety attacks and it seems a lot of people get things like physical reactions as a result of anxiety - which I don't get. I also don't pick up on basic social cues and body language correctly, and sometimes struggle processing basic instructions (but not all the time - it depends) - my mum tried to tell me a few years back that she was worried I had mild autism, but I dismissed it. I'm also a massive introvert, have a small friend group and tend to avoid social interactions (but I can have a really good time when talking to the right person).

Now, my mum's side. I think my mum might also be an HSP, and she may also have anxiety (as she experiences overthinking, overanalysing and overstressing to a similar level I do). She does not, however, show any signs of autism, and she is an extrovert (unlike me). My mum is estranged from her paternal family, but I know her maternal family well. I am very similar to my maternal grandmother in terms of personality and us both being hugely introverted. However, my maternal grandmother is not an HSP, and any anxiety she does experience is a lot more mild than myself and my mum's. As close as I am to my maternal grandmother, there is one quality she has that nobody else on the maternal side has, and that is potential anger management problems - I remember at times (as a child) her anger would seemingly escalate really quickly for no apparent reason, and my mum has mentioned how it still happens on the odd occasion when she tries to talk to her (although I've not experienced it when I've tried to talk to her). One of my mum's maternal cousins has ADHD, another is autistic (much more severely autistic than I am, assuming I am autistic to begin with) and narrowly avoided prison after hacking computer systems and stealing millions of pounds to ""prove his point"" about a security risk that companies weren't taking him seriously over. The rest of my mum's maternal family are just generally rather ""eccentric"" for reasons that are difficult to describe.

Now, my dad's side. This side have problems of almost the opposite end of the spectrum. My great-great grandmother died in a mental hospital at 37 only a year after giving birth to my nan's mum - we don't know any more about her other than ""she went nuts and died"". My nan's mum was apparently a ""really messed up person"" - she used to apparently play favourites with her children, and would treat one child nicely whilst outright neglecting my nan (comparisons have been made to Harry Potter and Dudley). My nan, at one point, ended up getting taken away by social services due to the level of neglect that was going on, though I know they ended up reuniting in the end. My nan herself has some traits that I'm fairly sure are psychopathic - she has been known to display emotion over matters relating to herself, but to generally not care or feel empathy about others. My great nan (her mother-in-law) lived to 106, and when she died her reaction was ""it's about time she died"" before telling people that they should not go to my great nan's funeral, they should instead ""spend time with the living"" and that ""going to that funeral counts as betrayal and will result in you being written off my will"". My dad really didn't seem to care the slightest (kept saying ""it's just a funeral, it doesn't matter, think about the money"") but in the end we went to the funeral after I uncharacteristically became incredibly stubborn about it. My dad does show some emotions (mainly happiness, laughter, stress and anger) but never seems to get sad about anything - at the funeral, for example, he didn't show a shred of emotion, and he was closer to my great nan than I was (and I was crying a lot). He makes a lot of narcissistic comments about things like cooking dinner and uses it to automatically excuse himself from doing other things, and often times comes out with stuff that is just outright pleasant. Whilst I know he cares about people (he's done a lot for me and has been a good dad), he does also seem to get a lot of enjoyment out of belittling and berating people and it clashes with my HSP to the point I sometimes feel like I can't even be in the same room as him.",26Nov2020,1
136,"I’ve talked to two different therapists about this but it didn’t really help. So basically the problem is I am paranoid that I stink no matter what I do and everyone can smell me. It’s been going on for about 2 years now and it has made my social anxiety that was already pretty bad even worse. If someone is even near me I get hot and a rash from the anxiety. I’m afraid to even hug my mom. 

Rationally I am pretty sure I don’t smell but when the anxiety kicks in even a little I am 100% sure I am the worst smelling guy out there. I think this started when my sister said I smelt bad but I couldn’t smell anything at all. So I was worried what if I smell bad all the time and everyone is just sucking it up and nobody wants to be around me. She told me this after I had track practice but the thing was I felt like I didn’t even get that sweaty or anything so it really shocked me.

I have very good hygiene and I would say I’m definitely a clean freak/germaphobe. I can go through a bar of soap in about 3 showers. (Lately I have started to consider that maybe so much soap is bad for my skin so I may try to cut that down a bit.) I shampoo, thoroughly wash my body, and dry off with a clean towel. I apply an odorless lotion so I don’t get dry skin. I apply deodorant after I shower and again in the morning. I wash my bed sheets frequently. I don’t where the same shoes 2 days in a row. I don’t wear clothes more than once and I dry everything in the dryer so there’s no musty smells from hang drying. As for oral hygiene I brush my teeth twice a day with an electronic tooth brush and I also floss with regular floss and sometimes one of those water flossers and I scrape my tongue and use non alcohol mouth wash. As for diet I don’t eat super healthy but I avoid any junk food as much as I can and try to eat fruits and vegetables and stuff. I basically only drink water and aim for 2 liters a day. 

I am convinced that most of the smell is coming from my behind and I take extra caution to walk around people. But the thing is I use a bidet so my butt is very clean. I have never smelt a poo smell or anything coming from me. If I smell my underwear when I take off my clothes before I shower there is no smell whatsoever. I spent a lot of time in Japan and now it just blows me away that a lot of people in America only wipe with toilet paper. But nobody here has ever walked by me and smelled like poop. So logically I understand I probably don’t either but I am still very paranoid. I feel like since there is poop inside us shouldn’t the smell be able to seep out?

I can count the number of times on one hand someone has said I’ve smelt bad and it was either after I forgot to put on deodorant or ran around all day and got sweaty. But I can also count the amount of times I’ve been told I smell good on one hand. So I’m guessing I have a neutral smell? I use a hypo allergenic laundry detergent so I don’t smell like tide or anything. I know everyone has their own smell but maybe what I’m worried about is that my natural smell is bad. I should also note that until that until a few years ago I was a very social person and even when I started to get anxiety I still would hang out with people. So it’s not like people avoid me. 

It has made my life a lot harder and destroyed my confidence. If I’m alone in my room I don’t really care but If I’m near someone or in a place with a lot of people I really start to worry. If I’m on a train or something and I hear a lot of people sniff I start to worry too. It gets pretty bad too if someone else smells bad because I start to think what if it’s me. I also am afraid to talk near people or make direct eye contact because I’m worried I have horrible breath. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I miss being able to look people in the eye and talk to them. I miss being able to walk around in public and not worry about anything. I miss hanging out with friends.",26Nov2020,1

139,"Figured I’d do some cathartic ranting on reddit to get things off my chest. I know I’m not in the right, but I just wanted to write this all down for my own sanity.

I have been living at my place for a couple of years now, shared flat with two girls. One I get along with fine, one I really don’t.

Thing is, I’m an incredibly friendly person - invariably to a fault. Always asking how your day was, how you’re doing, whatcha cooking, that kinda shit. And the girl I don’t get along with is like the complete opposite. I feel like I could count on one hand the amount of times she’s asked about my day/my life/whatever. It used to get me down a lot, but over quarantine I got kinda used to it and just accepted that she won’t ask me, but I’ll ask her and she’ll generally oblige... because in typical fashion, she’s perfectly willing to tell me how her day was, how her job is going, but never feels the need to ask it back. Fine. 

But over the last couple of weeks even that was becoming too much. She was barely responding. How was your day - fine. And that was all I could get from her. And fuck me, it really chipped away at my soul. 

So I broke lockdown. Not a rave mind you. A dinner with a couple I know work from home, yadda yadda. I could spend all day justifying it, but long and short of it all is, I shouldn’t have but I was in a low, low place and had to leave that fucking house. Should I have used Zoom? Yes. But I couldn’t. I had to be WITH people who cared about me and engaged with me, etc. 

Well, my housemate found out and confronted me. And whilst she was perfectly within her rights (and mostly correct) to call me selfish and call me out, I think she did it in a pig-headed, confrontational and generally unpleasant way. And it really threw me off the deep end.

Spent the next few days skulking around the house, staying in bed, just feeling like absolute lome. 

Now, a week or so later of continued toxicity in the house, I’m self isolating as I feel ropey and some people around work are going into self-isolation, so I figured I’d play it safe. 

And I’m in a BAD place. 

I just feel so low and nervous. I’m looking for a place at the moment to get myself out of here - but I’m just in such an anxious, depressed, low mood. First time in forever I just wanna be with my parents haha. 

And it’s just me and her here, as the other housemate left for some time due to COVID..

I dunno how I’m gonna get through this... even more so if I actually do get COVID.

146,"I have had this for a long time. For me it's because I've spent most of my life from age 13 to age 30 at a computer. Mainly playing games and socialising online.
This has led to me being confused between the reality I know and the ""real world"". I can best explain it like Morpheus asks Neo what is real, in The Matrix. I am living in two different worlds. I don't like the ""real world"". I prefer virtual worlds. Games, socially socialising online which includes streaming.

My main problem is having a job. Before I had the full time job I'm in now I was happier. I was in control of my reality. I want to go back to that. But I have a mortgage to pay off and bills that always seem to pile up at the worst time.

I have thought about going on disability but I'm not sure if I'd qualify. I've had a glance over of the requirements. They are ridiculous. Why is it that when someone breaks their arm or leg they get treatment almost immediately? Yet mental health is treated as if it's nothing serious. 

I am sick of having to suffer and struggle everyday.

The only solutions that I've been provided with is therapy and medication. All that does is keep me a compliant docile wage slave. I want out. How to go back to the way it was?

I'm in Australia and there aren't many options here. Mainly only therapists or psychologists that are mainly targeted for women. I don't think it's worth it to go see a therapist or psychologist because they don't really have any long term solutions. And no cure. So it's a waste of time.",26Nov2020,1

This is who I am

There’s something inside me, I don’t know what it is. It’s the reason I will never change. It’s the reason wherever I go I fail. It’s the reason whoever I meet I hurt, lie to, and let down. There’s something inside me i don’t know what it is. There’s a reason why I keep failing. There’s a reason why doing everything I can is not enough. There’s a reason why my family now, my family then, my family when i depart will remain scarred. There’s something inside me I don’t know what it is. Black day and white day. Paralyzed in my bed. Room scarcely lit. No souls, no heartbeats to be heard in range. Feeling nothing, thinking nothing, doing nothing. Stuck in my own mind. There’s something inside me, I don’t know what it is. Unable to reach out. No close ones to share with. Not ones that I haven’t damaged anyways. Sitting still, glancing at my timeline. Memories, pain, tears, fave buried under hands. Regret, sorrow, darkness, hate, loathing. There’s something inside me, I don’t know what it is. Repeating, Repeating,REpeating, REPeating, REPEating, REPEATing, REPEATIng, REPEATINg, REPEATING, non ending cycle. Damaged, hurt, broken, gone, lost, incurable. There’s something inside me, I don’t know what it is.

Sometimes people never fix themselves even if they try

Sometimes we stumble, lose our way

Sometimes we’re lost forever 

Sometimes we’re weak

Sometimes

However since my parents being who they are I find it just impossible to get a diagnosis of whatever I actually have and officially find ways to deal with it.

Apart from being unable to seek a professional my unexplained difficulties are often viewed negatively by my parents and it strains our relationship even if I never intended to cause any of what I have done. They're always confused and perplexed whenever I do extremely odd and often times illogical things and I never have an answer as to why.

154,"Hi all,

Yesterday, I took my daughter to play group and I asked the coordinator how much she spends on her daughter for Xmas. I was thinking about how my MIL always pressures us to spend more money I’ve the holidays and I wanted to segue into talking about that. My friends are kinda blasé about money (they’re both rich and poor and everywhere between) so it wouldn’t be outside of the norm to ask within my friend group. But right when it came out of my mouth, I felt a lot of shame. I backtracked immediately and went “whoa....I meant moreso do you stick to a budget”. She looked a little taken aback. I felt bad that I’d put her on the spot and embarrassed that I’d asked something so so personal to someone I barely know. 

I feel really guilty and I can’t get it out of my head. And this isn’t even close to the first time. Not even the first time this week. I joked with my brother a few days back that mom wasn’t cool enough to have a painkiller addiction (she doesn’t have one, we were just doing a bit), then felt stupid that I was implying addiction was cool when it’s really devastating for some people. These were two cases in the last week, just to give you an example of frequency. 

It’s like, once I start thinking I’m shitty and socially awkward, I can’t get out of the headspace. And events that trigger this kind of thought happen so often. It makes me feel so bad about myself. Does anyone else experience these kinds of thoughts? Has anyone been able to overcome this type of thinking? I’ve done therapy in the past, but in the councilling I’m approved to get through insurance, they give me a CBT workbook.

158,"Hey everyone,

I usually never post things online but I finally feel compelled to given my situation right now. 

I’m nearing 20 yrs old right now and I’m a student in my second year of university Studying medicine. Im school I was a pretty good student often getting top marks for many of my courses. I used to study near the exams like everyone to be fair cos we had the time to do so looking back. I managed to pull the same trick for my first year of uni and managed to pass everything with fairly good grades again. Come second year tho and I’ve failed 3 subjects in the first semester and I’ve realised a major problem of mine... I can’t seem to work hard, I don’t seem to have any respect for myself or for my future. I don’t think I’ve ever worked hard for anything in a sense and I’d say I’m a careless lazy person. Heres the principle example, before a set of exams we have two weeks before of study period beforehand. Instead of working hard for myself my lazy ass would just wallow in self pity realising the amount of work there is and resort to watching youtube videos and plunging into denial telling myself I’ll work ten times harder the next day. This has been going on for a while, even in school and last year too but it always ended up working out because I managed to compensate with my understanding and since exams were multiple choice luck played a large part too. I don’t know if it’s subconsciously reinforced my devastating methods but my mind seems to think everything will be ok and that I’ll have a good life in the future because I’ll have worked hard... which is not something I’m currently doing and it’s impacting my life more and more as time goes. I’m ok socially, average looking and I’m probably a bit of a bland person but I used to be comforted by my grades telling myself I at least seem to be coping well with academics but yeah I’ve realised that’s not even true in itself because I’m a lazy sack of shit who likes to drown in self pity and can’t work hard. I’m sorry for the messy text above I’m just typing whatever’s coming to mind but to recap my main issue is I simply can’t force myself to work hard. I don’t even know how to explain it but I feel like everything I’ve been doing so far isn’t for myself and I just can’t seem to convince myself. I just daydream of great things and my mind seems to subconsciously think my dreams will achieve themselves without hard work.


I don’t know if any of that made sense to anyone who took their time to read this but eitherway thank you very much for taking your time and I guess my main question is, if anyone has experienced what I’m going through right now and managed to get out of that situation and start working for themselves, can you tell me how you did it?",26Nov2020,1

So basically it all started when I was in high school back in 2012 I kept seeing dark small figures coming to me in an incredible speed, one incident i can never forget i was walking with my friend at school and i saw this dark figure on the floor no idea what shape it was but i was small just running across me and my reaction i IMMEDIATELY jumped so that it runs under feet!!! My friend was like wtf was that and i couldnt explain it, it was nothing. 

Second incident at physics lab i saw similar dark figure flying across the room and i just looked up startled thinking it was a bird but nothing was there.

This is my earliest memory of when it started happening to me. Similar events kept happening till now except it’s not as much as they used to.

Something changed about me i have noticed too idk if its related but ill just mention it, I am incredibly jumpy right now at any sound or any movement it could be loud or not, i still jump and like close my eyes scared for a split second.

165,"Hello

I have been struggling and decided to ask here for help. Maybe I can get some advice on here.

First, some background:  
I'm 21, moved to the UK 3 months ago, grew up in Switzerland. I've had depression trichotillomania since I was around 15 years old, visited multiple therapists over the years and have now been on 40mg of fluoxetine for about a year. 

I live in a very supportive environment (thank god), but nobody around me has experience with mental illnesses. 

I've worked 40 hours jobs ever since I was 16, finished my fixed term contract in August and moved to the UK to find another job. I was unemployed for 3 months and now started a customer support based role that I can do based at home. My hours are 9pm-5:30pm and 1:30pm-10pm. 

The job isn't too bad, I earn a bit above minimum wage. 

But at the moment I'm in a down. I do not know how to get out of it. I cannot concentrate on work and I dread to think about having to work like this for the rest of my life. I barely have free time anymore. 

But I have to work, I need money. I literally cannot survive without a job. And I don't know how to deal with that. I feel lost and pressured. When I was unemployed I took a lot of time for selfcare which is something I've always neglected. I took up old and new hobbies, made this house a home and tried to maintain social contacts (online ofc).

Now, what do I do to escape this situation? I can't not work, but I also can't keep going like this, I feel like I am trapped.

Any advice is welcome, thank you for taking the time to read this.",26Nov2020,1

I’m not very confrontational and (I like to think) I’m open minded about things, but even when I try to bring it up I get immediately shut down or it turns into a yelling match (a one sided yelling match). 
At this point, I try to avoid even talking about my opinions or beliefs around them, but even THAT gets me in trouble when they get mad and just “Don’t you have opinions on ANYTHING?” Or “Before you assume I hate *insert example here* because I know that’s what you secretly think!” 

I feel like I’m going insane, and with the Holidays here, I know it’s just gonna keep going nonstop. I love my parents, I do, but I feel suffocated and like I shouldn’t even be here with them.

169,"My ‘story’ is briefly described in my previous post. 

I’m kinda interested in psychology whilst not doing anything remotely related to it, I enjoy reading into people and social situations, behaviour etc, I’m very analytical about those things with a hint of over thinking, and a girl at my workplace kinda impressed me when I said something and she had this form of clear acumen in her eyes and behaved very analytically and just passionate in general, and it was probably the first time I’ve ever seen that in someone. 

Now that question was related to me, more specifically a slight problem with something, and i kinda wish I could talk more about it, but that ‘doot’ leads to other doors which I don’t feel comfortable sharing (for reasons mentioned later), although I wish I could.

Reasons as to why I’m not comfortable sharing that information and going to that topic;

- it’s quite personal and I’m limiting how many people know my thoughts 

- Like I said before, I’m cynical, past experiences caused this, and I literally never told my thoughts on that experience even to my parents (in essence, being bullied)

- Some form of lack of trust in people. The girl seems like she is genuinely nice, but she behaves differently around some people, one of which she is some form of ‘best friends’ and before I could sense some form of negativity from them together, steming from the other person as I worked with them too, also she did talk about said person behind their back to my friend (who’s a lot older), which leads onto-

- me thinking that I have everyone’s clear image of who they are, except for her. In my head, it’s very unclear who she is, she could be genuinely nice, or she could be very good at masking socially, which is what I do (by ‘masking socially’ I mean hiding my thoughts, acting stupid to make others feel superior just so it’s easier to read them and gain information, and things along those lines). It’s sad, this would test my trust again, and if it turns out she wasn’t genuine and uses this information in a negative way, I would be repeating my old mistakes from which I learned, which caused me to be cynical and analytical. 

Now I know this probably sounds like a ‘crush’, but it’s unrealistic for anything to come of it- I’m 20, she’s 26, i just want to feel some form of compassion or understanding, but the risk isn’t worth it. 

At this point, I doubt I’d even share this with a long term girlfriend. By sharing it, I give away my ‘power’, I provide a schematic which clearly shows a form of ‘weak point’, something personal and my thoughts. 

When it comes to my self esteem and how I feel, I feel good, I’m progressing in life. I think I am strong mentally, but it would be good to share if there were no consequences. 

Now I’m in the ‘overthinking’ mode, as you can tell, but I think this is enough information.",26Nov2020,1
170,"This is a question that comes to my mind pretty much any time I see any discussion on support / accommodations for mental health disorders. Just curious about some perspectives on this. 

Of course avoidance might be necessary, sometimes you just really need to amp up coping skills and so on before facing something. There are limitations and we gotta respect those, unless our intentions are to force someone into a serious mental breakdown. 

However, just speaking for myself, in retrospect, there absolutely have been instances where people had good intentions to support me during a mental health slump but ultimately just enabled a bunch of pretty unnecessary and exaggerated avoidance behaviors. That's quite the opposite of support, considering that it's well established that avoidance e.g. actually worsens anxiety in the long run.",26Nov2020,1

i‘ve always had social anxiety and insecurity even as a kid. I remember worrying how my gaze looks as far back as primary school. 
I push people away because i‘ve built this big wall around my personality due to mobbing as a young child. People always mocked and mock me because of my poor coordination. 
I have a few good friends, but most other people dont like me. I still don‘t know why, my guess is I come off as rude and standoffish. 

With 21 years, I still can‘t talk to new people, and especially people of the other gender without being extremely nervous. Thinking about having to hold a presentation next week makes me want to vomit and quit my education. 

Ive been to 3 therapists in my life, no one could really help me with my struggle.

My anxiety and not being able to live an adequate life developed into depression in my teenage years. Im now addicted to weed to numb it, but even that isn‘t fun to me anymore.

I dont want to live really, there I said it. But like always, I‘m too much of a pussy to even kill myself. That and I dont want to hurt my family or friends, who always had my back since day 1.",26Nov2020,1
181,"It’s a long story but to summarize, I had an “episode” of sadness/anger/etc yesterday and things got out of hand with me yelling and crying about school/my body image/coronavirus/my relationships etc. I expressed to my boyfriend that I needed space to ground myself so he went on a walk. I probably cried when he was gone but things were mostly calm I think until couple hours later he threw up in the washroom (we were fasting) and he yelled for my help and the police were called to check on a noise complaint/domestic. They pretty much confirmed the call was because of concern from prior yelling and then the “[my name] help me”. 

The police “laughed” it off and I explained everything and they gave “advice”.  I’m so grateful for how they treated me while I was in the state I was, even though I think I hid it relatively well. The problem is though that anyone who heard and saw doesn’t know that things are fine. 

Since then I have been sorta throwing up and haven’t been able to sleep properly or do much of anything but sit and smell essential oils I have. I’m so full of anxiety and fear and embarrassment over the fact that someone (at least) heard me and that people would’ve saw us with the police etc. I’ve called my mother and that has made me feel a bit better but she doesn’t understand how this is going to hang over me like you might. 

The entire situation and my embarrassment keeps coming in waves where I’m distracted, and then am hit with it again and my anxiety levels shoot up. I decided I can’t leave the house again (basement apt) but realized I should go on a walk soon to take in the fresh air, exist normally with my neighbours who could’ve seen/heard, and not encourage myself to stay locked up. 

My landlord says how my one neighbour “sees everything” and the person who lives above me obviously knows. I’m so full of fear that my landlord will call or show up angry and try to evict us because of my poor behaviour. My mom said that she doubts she will call/come even if someone tells her and that if she does to apologize and say we didn’t realize at the time how loud we were being and that it will never happen again but I REALLY feel like I’ll never feel better until she confronts us and I don’t need to live in fear of it anymore. I feel like I can’t go on with my life and I’ve been a mess for days before over much smaller things. 
 
Sorry if this is a bad post but I’m desperate for any advice you could have. I’m planning to look into worksheets and stuff I can do to deescalate when I’m getting to the place I was at last night so this won’t reoccur. What can I do to put this out of my mind and generally stop reliving it, being sick, being terrified and generally the most embarrassed I’ve ever been. I want to let go and feel better when I don’t know how I will. I’ve been looking for new apartments because I don’t know what will fix this besides moving but that is unrealistic for me right now",26Nov2020,1
182,"I’m 19M and in university. My psychiatrist gave me medicine but still has ask me more about stuff. I would like to know if anyone has any idea what’s wrong with me so i can do research and get a name to what has caused the worst mental health i’ve ever had.

It all started with me being perscribed Adderall for my ADHD. I was fine before, I had a tiny bit anxiety/depression, but nothing bad. I also have ADHD and an eating disorder with being abused growing up so lots of trauma. But I’m strong and it didn’t effect me until I started adderall and started therapy for my eating disorder (ED) and just my issues.

Everything was going good until 4 weeks in I started having really bad depressive episodes where I would think about something sad (for example, I would be sad I didn’t have a bf or sad that I had mental health issues) and then start thinking about all my issues and it just spiraled and spiraled and I would cry. It was nice at first bc I never cried that much before (raised in toxic masculine household). But it turned to be every single day that I would break down and cry. Sometimes it was warranted (only about 2 times out of 30) but it was every single day. I had what i think was an anxiety attack where I think the world was crumbling around me, i didn’t know what was real around me, I felt trapped and so alone, and I wanted to die because I thought this would never end. I kept having these small depressive episodes and I didn’t think much of it. The Adderall helped my productivity but, some days it wouldn’t work and I was having a lot anxiety and depression. I would go from being so happy and ready to start my day in the mornings to crying and wanting to kill myself (literally) by afternoon. Evenings, I was still sad or I was happy again and would even workout or do something fun. I smoked medicinal marijuana a lot because it was rough. 

I changed to Amomoxetine bc i got a psychiatrist and she told me with my ED, I shouldn’t have it. For the first couple days, I was really happy and productive. I got work down, I was really happy and everything was amazing. But then I had another episode and it was the worst I’ve ever had in my life. I wanted to die die, I even tried cutting myself. Here’s my thoughts from that day I wrote down: 
- i think nothing will ever get better  and i will be broken for the rest of my life
- the world seems so distant, i feel so alone. like i am here surrounded by a literal black bubble by myself forever 
- i keep  just busting out crying no matter how much i tried to stop or get my mind off it 
- i feel scared to leave my room
- i feel like i didn’t know what is real and what isn’t around me 
- i want to die because i am so scared and i feel like i can never get better and i will be trapped feeling this way forever and I am so scared of everything 

That was awful and I am now on Lamotrigene. I don’t know what’s going on with me. I wrote down some things I experience everyday that I wrote down:

-keep thinking things are there when they’re not (i will think there’s a killer in my house so i get really anxious and am scared to go into my living room)
-episodes where i loose touch with reality 
-always see things/hear when other don’t (think ppl are staring or looking at me)
-trouble with talking, keep repeating until i get something right 
-when someone talks to me or tries to get my attention, it will register in my head but my body won’t respond 
-repeat the beginning of my sentence multiple times because sometimes my thoughts are so scattered and my brain feels like it just pauses
- bad memory where sometimes I forget what i’m saying in the middle of a sentence 
-get anxious 
-mood swings 
-bad mood: unfocused, i feel everything is so hard to do anything, can’t talk, everyone probably thinks i’m crazy, i don’t want to talk to anyone, don’t haver motivation to eat or brush my teeth 
-good mood: productive, eating disorder gets better
-sometimes, I feel like life is over, these mental illnesses are a lot
-around people, feel way better and I am happy for some reason. I don’t like showing i’m weak or struggling. 
-hear random noises when i sleep, feel bugs on me, get paranoid that someone’s looking in the window to the point where i’m too scared to even open my eyes. 

Can someone please help me? My psychiatrist is good but it’s also a school psychiatrist and everything is closed until spring. Please I’m so scared of having another episode.",26Nov2020,1

I'm planning my way out as my skills are much better than this but I had no choice last year so I accepted this opportunity.
Every single day after work I am crying for at least one hour and then I just don't feel anything anymore.

184,"My son has serious mental health issues. He is paranoid, and hears and sees things that aren't there. He gets violently angry pretty frequently. He has been in jail a couple times. He has substance abuse issues, I'm not sure about details, but it is a lot and it's very serious. He has ODed a couple times. I stopped counting how many suicide attempts and psych hospitalizations. He is an adult. He has lived on an off with his dad since he was a teen, by his choice at first. They are really bad for each other - violence, shared drug use, etc.

I allowed him to come home a couple times but things always deteriorate very quickly, and I am afraid of him. He's currently bouncing between psych and couch surfing and his dad's.

I thought he was in the hospital right now. He called me yesterday. He sounded bad, high but also like, incredibly sad. He sounded beaten down. He asked for money or a place to stay. I asked him why he left the hospital and if he could follow up with his caseworker about getting his own housing, and he said he hates the hospital and that it is like jail. I encouraged him to go back to the hospital and he was crying and saying he needed a place to say and I had to say no. I just keep thinking about how bad it would feel to hear that I wouldn't get any help from someone I trusted. He's never cried before when he asked for help. 

It's so incredibly painful to be his mother. I can't imagine what it is to be him. I want to fix it but I can't and it must be so scary and sad and confusing and painful. I feel like I am drowning in grief and I keep thinking it's infinitely worse for him.

189,"Scared that anxiety, depression, and dissociations will return.

Trigger warning: su*cide

I’m 17 and I’m confused and scared. I don’t know what to do right now so feedback would be appreciated.

I’m 99% sure I have social anxiety disorder, but this is a self-diagnosis. Two years ago, my social anxiety was at its worst. When I interacted with people, my heart would race, my body would shake, and it was nearly impossible to speak. I just couldn’t get the words out. I went to great lengths to avoid people; I spent my freshman year of high school eating lunch in the bathroom on stalls. I was constantly worried that people were watching me and judging me. I had a toxic, non-stop internal dialogue in my head. My self-esteem was incredibly low (and eating lunch in the bathroom didn’t help). This went on for months. I grew further away from my family and there were times where I would go days without saying a word to anyone. I was completely socially isolated. 

This led to a period of about two months of feeling completely worthless and exhausted. I slept a lot and was having a tough time with school. It was a huge challenge to get up in the morning, shower, and do most other things. It was a constant slog. I became irritated and violent at times for no reason. I slammed my hands against the kitchen counters to feel something pushing against my body. I broke the door to my bedroom. I hoped that my parents would notice that I felt like complete shit but they didn’t seem to care. This whole time it never occurred to me that I might have a problem with my mental health. I just viewed myself the way I thought everyone else viewed me: a lonely, moody, weirdo.

There were times where life did not seem real to me. I would sit next to classmates at school and it would feel like they were far away from me even if they were physically right next to me. It felt like I was viewing the world through a foggy pane of glass from a distance. I had strange, almost compulsive thoughts about doing absurd things just to see if life was actually real or if I was in a dream. 

At one point, late in my freshman year of high school, I realized that I might have depression. I remembered the lessons I had been given in health class in middle school about depression. I did a lot of google searches about depression and the other troubles I was having and I stumbled across a Wikipedia article about social anxiety disorder. I was shocked as I read this, because up until that point I didn’t know SAD (social anxiety disorder) was a thing. I assumed that social anxiety was just an inherent, negative aspect of a person’s personality. 

I’m not going to get into the details because then this post would be a lot longer than it needs to be, but I reached out to my school counselor. Ultimately, I only meet with her a couple times because I did not feel like she was listening to me. I largely dealt with my mental health issues through research and implementation of at-home treatments. I took up meditation, journaling, and focused more on exercise. I established a better sleep schedule and quieted my negative, cyclical thoughts. I researched ways to handle anxiety in the moments that It occurs and this helped monumentally. Over time, I become more comfortable talking and did not feel like passing out when my name got mentioned in class. I even made some friends over the next year. 

Today, I still continue to run, journal, and meditate and I feel much better. However, recently I have been growing close with a teacher of mine at school and we have been studying neuroscience together. Both of us have turned to this subject because of our personal experiences with mental health difficulties. This is something that has been implied in the past but not really talked about specifically. A couple days ago, though, this teacher told me about some of his specific experiences with depression and essentially invited me to share if I have ever experienced anything similar, if I was comfortable with sharing. This was extremely difficult because I wanted to share about my experiences but realized that if he found out that I had a history of depression and suicidal thoughts that were not really treated, he might have an obligation to report those issues. 

This realization made me think about the fact that I might not really have a very good grip on my mental health situation. From what I understand, social anxiety disorder is a chronic condition and it could come back again strong in the future. This has kept me up late tonight because if I somehow end up in a similar place as I was in two years ago, I might once again have crazy dissociations and become detached from reality. This scares the absolute shit out of me. If I’m not mentally stable, I want to make sure I get help. 

With all of that being said, I am scared of sharing any of this information with my parents and I don’t know if I need a mental health professional helping me with this. It feels like my life had been going well but now this traumatic stuff is suddenly flooding back again. For a while, it felt like the raw terror and confusion were in my past but now I’m not so sure.

What should I do? Do I need help? Should I tell my teacher what is going on and let him take the necessary actions? Should I just tell my parents that I need to see a psychologist? Or, are these problems in that past?

Edit: I should add that these days I generally have a difficult time with communication and I think this is due in large part to social anxiety. This has a pretty big effect on daily socialization and friendships. I also want to add that there is a lot of strain with my parents and I think that some of my mental health struggles might be related to my relationship with my parents. My relationship with them is still strained today.",26Nov2020,1

I hate this so much. I know the cause. My mother, who has since passed, was emotionally, mentally, and physically abusive. Classic case of narcissism and manipulation and continuing a cycle of abuse that she herself had been a part of with her own parent.

.
&gt; (my brother) Well this makes no sense. People appreciate humility. Not bigging oneself up. Your value to me is your warmth and kindness, and your sense of humour.

.
&gt;It's my ability to be more humble than anyone else that makes me so special

&gt;I am far better than anyone else at being able to accept that I can be wrong

&gt;See, I'm supreme being at everything.  and this is the only way I can be of any value.  I have the best obscure sense of humour. nobody is as good as me at this type of humour.

&gt;and being kind is especially good trait. I am so good at this, that people have to like me for that. if they don't, then I am worthless
without those things you mentioned that make me such an amazing and wonderful person, I am scum and shit. just detritus infecting this planet

&gt;if someone, say for example and internet troll, fails to see how right I am, how kind I am, how skilled I am, if they don't respect me for how special I am, I can't just let them get away with that

&gt;and how could I possibly be wrong about something?  something I was so sure of.. how could I be wrong, unless there was reasonable doubt? how could I be fallible? If I were fallible than I am not worth spitting on

I do have Bipolar 1, PTSD and ADHD, but maybe even aside from that, if my brain wasn't ridden with mental illnesses, I would still have trouble functioning everyday.

Let's start off with the fact that my brain is always running, every single moment of each day. I feel like it never stops. Going from thought to thought without stopping, I rarely have grounded moments when I'm in the present because my brain just doesn't want to take a break a relax. I notice the weirdest things about me, for example my brain transitions between 3 or 4 songs stuck in my head, playing on loop 24 hours a day. It jumps from one random song to the next most random song. I could be having the worst day mentally and all of a sudden the most light-hearted, uplifting song plays in my head. Almost like it's mocking me.

I have to constantly rub my face with my hands to snap out of it and be grounded. And sometimes I get this feeling where every 30 seconds I have to do this technique because it feels like somethings coming over me. I just don't know what.

198,"so I'm an empath, which anyone who is like me understands how much harder it is to be in a relationship with someone when you're an empath. 

anywho, I just need some advice or to see if anyone else experiences this and how to deal with it and all of that, I truly just need help. 

to give some background: i am 17F and my gf is 16F, we've been dating for almost 10 months. we both suffer from several mental illnesses (quite severe) and have had a very complicated relationship bc of it. though im only 17, I have never met or seen or known about anyone who has went through more than my gf has. NOT comparing, trying to give perspective on what im trying to find help with from this post. 

anyways, being an empath I obviously take on what others feel and what they experience as long as my own stuff so it gets immensely overwhelming and damaging to me as a whole. but lately it's been getting a lot worse for me and im trying to understand why.

I've learned a lot about my gf and a lot of the heavy stuff I've learned was back in the first few months of our relationship and it never affected me as badly as it is now. im too afraid to talk to my gf about this bc I know how she gets and she will never want to open up to me again out of fear or self blame and all that.

no blame going on here, just trying to understand why my brain is hurting me so badly all of a sudden. lately I've been thinking about the things she has gone through when I'm just doing normal things or not even trying to think about those bad things at all. 

for example, a couple weeks ago I was at her house and we were sitting on the floor eating and listening to music and all was good, I turned on one of my favorite throwback songs that I was obsessed with a few years ago and was enjoying it, then my gf told me that the song was one of her 'party' songs when she lived back home. I can't go into too much detail but my gf started partying/doing hard drugs/heavily drinking at a VERY young age. she's come so far from that awful time in her life but she still struggles. so when she told me that, completely harmlessly, my mood kinda dropped and I haven't been able to listen to the song the same way again. everytime I listen to it all I can think about is what she told me and then I start spiraling with my thoughts and start thinking about her troubled past and it just hurts me. I can't explain it that well but I just can't help it, and I do it with EVERYTHING. there's so many more examples I could give you but that'd be this whole post by the end of it. 

being an empath I just over think her past constantly and let it hurt me. like I'll hate myself bc I wasn't there even tho we didn't even know each other yet, I'll get upset just thinking in general about all of the awful things that have happened to her, I'll blame myself or feel guilty, overall it's just starting to hurt me so bad and idk how to fix it, idk how to not do it. it's like im trying to heal from something that didn't even happen to me, but it happened to someone I love so it hurts me just as bad? my brain isn't even trying to make it so that it feels like it happened to me, but when I over think about the things she has told me about her life I can like visualize them and it feels like I was there watching it happen but I couldn't stop it. theres just so much that has happened to her and i cant stop thinking about it constantly at random times for no reason when im just trying to live my life. it's so hard to explain bc there's so much im unintentionally leaving out but I hope someone can understand what im experiencing with this right now.

I just need help understanding why this happens and why I do this to myself and any ways I can stop it or something, just anything. I just need help, im so desperate and I hope someone can help me. anything is appreciated, i really need it, it's really starting to damage me mentally and emotionally and it's affecting my relationship with her and I just need it to stop. 

I know this was long but if you read it all, thank you for reading. I hope this reaches someone who understands or who can help me and even others too.",26Nov2020,1
199,"I can't tell you a time or place in my  life when I wasn't told not to cry by either myself or others. I remember a time when all the abuse I've experienced was catching up to me in the beginning of school. I couldn't cry there as teachers are mandatory reporters and I don't want to go to foster care. Tried to vent to some friends but got told I was too emotional, and only one friend really listened at the time. I have only one specific place and time I could cry in without anyone seeing, but it's difficult as I'm as hard as a rock at this point in time (a result of many, many trial and error that would take up the character limit if I even started with it) and it's difficult, at times impossible to shed a tear.   


The most laughable thing about society is when you hear ""You should open up more! I'm always here for you"" from others. Feels like 90% of the time it's fake, and you get shot down fast for not being tough enough. If you're wondering why 76% of all suicides are male, the majority by young men, you've got your answer right here. That sinking feeling when your problems are just swept under the rug because women suffer so much worse, it hurts man. Like yes, y'all have your problems, but you can't actually believe that an entire gender is more important. If you're going to advocate for equality and women's rights, you can't do so in exchange of men's rights. Yes, that is what we've been doing these past decades. How about we advocate for equity, as that would be better for all? I don't know, I'm going off topic. I'm 15 years old, and yet I already feel the pressure of this sort of reverse misogyny, misandry if you will. I've actually been called a misogynist for my ""unique"" view on life lol. I find it ridiculous how society tells us to ""suck it up"" and ""man up"", yet when we refuse to show our emotions it is now ""toxic masculinity"". Then they act blind and even blame the men sometimes for reports of domestic violence (not that this isn't the abuser's fault) and male suicides. If you're gonna build the pressure, best be ready for the eruption. I swear, you'll see the rates plummet when we finally are able to advocate for male rights without being called a misogynist and are able to cry just like women. Y'know, we're human's too. We have bad days, we get mad, we get depressed, we get anxious. We cry just like anyone else. We're people.  


And yes, I posted something similar to this about a month ago. However, someone didn't read properly and missed the fact that it's a vent and maybe they shouldn't write a paragraph on how women have it worse than men. I'm gonna try again but if you're planning on shifting the topic in the comments, please don't. This is a vent, not a debate or opinions forum. I don't give a damn about your opinion, and I won't take BS. If you have beef with this post, let off the steam by punching a pillow. Once again, this is a vent. Do not berate me in the replies, feminists. Thank you.",26Nov2020,1
200,"Its kind of hard to explain. Its like I know I cant kill myself, I am scared of dying and shit. But at the same time all I can think about is wishing I had enough courage to do it. Like my mind is screaming at me to kill myself, yet I am psychically unable to do it.

I daydream like %75 of the day and my daydreams changed from me being in a better place to me having the balls to just doing it.

203,"I am in the military stationed on the East Coast away from my family in California. My sister gave birth to her first child half a year ago, and prior to the birth had a stable relationship with the father that quickly declined and led to a current ongoing custody battle. My sisters mental health has steadily declined since the start of the court hearings. The fathers main case is that my sister is mentally ill and up until a few weeks ago that was completely untrue , my sister was as a good as can be. But now out of a sudden she is exhibiting very odd behavior , sudden emotions and other things that correlate to mental health. 

for example she showered at 11pm and didn’t get out the shower until 6am when the sun was in the sky. She then randomly walked outside , recorded a complete stranger asking him if she knows he baby daddy and the man was confused and scared so he got in his car and left as my sister followed on foot flipping him off. She also has posted 2 photos of IT the clown with zero context on her snapchat whom she was horrified of growing up during the hours she was in the bathroom showering. she also erased all IG posts and in the span of 20 minutes posted 34 COMPLETELY random photos of just random celebrity type magazine articles and the video of her flipping the stranger off . 

My Family is afraid to take her to seek therapy because the Fathers mom is a medical biller and they believe she can see that my sister would be admitted to a mental institute and use it in court against her to take full custody . 

it’s so disheartening my sister literally not acting herself at all .

204,"Every day I constantly have a monologue running through my head that says things like ""I hate ____"", "" I love ____"" , saying obscenities and slurs, and the most disturbing "" I need to kill myself"" or ""______ needs to kill themselves"". 

Full disclosure, I would never kill myself or anyone else. Don't even really have actual thoughts about it beyond the words themselves. Feels more like ""kill yourself/themselves"" doesn't relate to suicide or murder in my mind. .

I say one of these things every 5 minutes, maybe more, all day long. I can't stop, it never goes away.

Despite all these negative things I feel about myself.... Somehow I still also think that I'm better than everyone. I can't accept the opinions of anyone else. (Which I assume is why therapy doesn't work). I actively seek arguements to justify being better than the other person. I talk behind peoples backs I guess to put them down or raise myself up.

I have no motivation to do anything and don't want to try new things. I cant seem to care about anything. Things like BLM, tragic events like 9/11, boston bombing, school shootings etc. don't resonate with me and I don't feel bad like everyone else seems to.

I've tried long term therapy, multiple different antidepressants. It never goes away.

If it makes a difference,   I have separation anxiety,  intrusive thoughts, OCD and mild depression. 

I've had an Imaginary 'friend' for three maybe four years, but I don't know if it's something I can brush off anymore. The first time I felt/saw him it was really calming and actually made me feel better everytime i was having an episode for a while, but now (for about the past year) he's been completely terrifying to me. 
I gave him a name and appearance a couple years ago which I thought would help but didn't, I've even tried talking to him a couple times  but got too scared to say more than a few words. 
I'm not sure if I'm afraid of him because I've pushed my mentality onto him to sort of blame him for my bad thoughts and actions or if he's really like that. 
He's not even human looking he's more of a rag doll.
I'm just so scared of him now and I don't really talk to my family about things like this so I don't know if they could help in any way. 
There is another 'thing'? I see but he's not as big of a problem and practically comforting compared to the one I've been talking about. 
I just want to know if anyone knows if this is something to tell someone about or anyone has any tips on how to deal with it because I'm sick of him and want him to go away as soon as he can.

I want to go to a support group or something but I don’t know what my actual issue is. Do I have a control issue? Do I have an anger problem? Is it anxiety? I’m having a bad day so I’m posting my 3 big problems here. Maybe someone has some insight, I desperately need a starting point to go from.

1) I get unnaturally angry when things don’t go according to plan/the way I want. It can be as simple as “we’re having dinner at 7pm tomorrow” and then changing it to “we’re having dinner at 5pm” the next day. I don’t know how to deal with disappointment, no, but I also just don’t know how other people can just adjust to minor and major changes while I can’t.

2) I have always been touch starved but feel incredibly uncomfortable and “wrong” whenever someone initiates physical contact, even if it’s just a hand on my shoulder for a brief moment or a playful punch in the chest. Romantic affection overcomes me with emotion and I want to cry. I feel the same way whenever someone shows anything that may feel like genuine concern. I cannot even *read* words of affirmation.

3) I self harm mentally. I tell myself all the reasons I’m alone, convince myself that everyone secretly hates me, and cannot think of any positive qualities about myself.",26Nov2020,1

I have no experience in this type of role (I mentioned this in my application) but I like the idea of this type of work, plus it's a permanent full-time position with a good salary. In my application I was asked about my knowledge of mental health, so I'm going to presume I'll be working with people suffering mental health issues in a therapist. I also have mild autism (which I feel would be an advantage given I'll be working with people with the same disorder), but I'm not going to mention that in my interview in case it hurts my chances.

If there are any support workers on this subreddit, could they offer any advice for my interview? What your role requires of you, what to expect in the interview, etc?

Recently I started crying a bit more often after meditating and getting in touch with my feelings more, and I liked it. Now  though, I'm on SSRI's and it's basically gonna be impossible for me to cry because for whatever reason they stop you from crying. I need to be on the SSRI's because my OCD just makes life too unbearable if I'm not on them, but it would be nice to shed a tear so I can have a mental clean out now and then.

But all I have to do now left is wait, for like 2 weeks. It seems like a long time to wait. I keep wanting to talk about the stuff I’m experiencing but don’t really want to annoy anyone I know.
I think I didn’t suspect adhd myself because I think I didn’t understand it could be different for everyone and I think my family doesn’t really believe I have it for that exact reason.
It isn’t their fault. I can’t put anyone in my head or trade brains with them for a week.
I said I feel like my life is in pieces until my appointment and my mom just said “it isn’t though” but it kinda is in pieces.
It’s always feeling my life is in pieces but I try not to talk to anyone about what I’ve been dealing with and have been dealing with for my whole life.

It’s just that I hate waiting for the appointment and until it’s diagnosed and treated I feel like my issue isn’t going to be taken seriously or resolved without the help of medication.
Right now I’m overwhelmed and having a hard time functioning and noticed I do have time blindness to a pretty noticeable degree which I thought was just me being irresponsible and now that I’ve noticed it... it’s almost ten times harder because I know it isn’t this hard for everyone else.
My mother does 4x the work I do and seems to be managing while being as stressed and stuff as I am but she actually handles it. I don’t work as hard as she does, I don’t have as many things to keep track of in my life. So why am I as tired and overwhelmed as I am?

this is going to be a long ramble because my brain is dead at this point.

i want to just end it all... this is so hard to explain but i can't see myself living anymore. my health has been crap and i've been turned to nothing but dust now. i didn't realise how much home has been affecting me until i've opened up to my chemistry teacher and now i just want to get lost from the face of this planet. i don't know where to start so i'll start off with my parents. my family is disabled. father blind. brother blind. sister blind. its my job as a carer to look after them whether its reading mails, doing some random tasks, teach them, whatsoever. but they're so bitter towards me and they always criticise me and i always end up crying and its been going on for years and my mum endures the same abuse but she tells me to stay strong because they're in more pain without their eyesight. my family wants me to be a doctor. eye surgeon. my whole life has been me helping my entire family, and i never knew how other people lived their lives. going out with friends, having your own dreams. being aware of yourself. nothing. all i've ever done were got good grades because my chemistry teacher has said i've always been intelligent. to do any medicine-related stuff in Uni i have to get 3 As/A\*s in any three chosen topics... as if this wasn't hard enough i've been mentally torn. i've had manipulative friends, friends who berated me and teased me all the time and i just had to sit there smiling. i've had social services make me feel so ashamed of myself, my sister tried killing herself. my brother will slowly become completely blind (he's not blind enough to not attend school but goes to those special school for disabilities), so much guilt has swallowed me. its my responsibility to worry for 3 people and i'm just bloody 16 for gods sake. i got pushed to do sciences by my mother because we are financially unstable and live in a very small flat which doesn't suit the needs of my blind family. she is also physically disabled and when she complains of back problems it breaks my heart. people chose subjects they personally enjoyed... i've never knew what i ever enjoyed because my entire focus in life has been my family and all this crappy abuse and nothing else. my mother never listens to me, she believes she has it much worse than ""all mothers"" and she makes me feel so guilty about myself. i want to change subjects in college now because i can't deal with this mental torture but they said its too late. like honestly what the actual hell i can catch up even if i hated my subjects i got better grades than 70% of the people without trying so clearly i have the work ethic to do another subject. my father is an evil manipulator who just stirs trouble and has little social contact apart from my helping him, reminding them i am ""their child"" and always says ""if you do medicine i'll give you 20k"" like what the actual bloody flipping hell and i've just been mentally recovering from corona and lockdown as well. my mother wanted me to do medicine from a young bloody age. so she made me do all sorts of volunteering and sports which made me experience and develop high levels of anxiety, fear and cowardice.i've been contemplating to just die now. i can't do this anymore. i am from the UK for context. my mother always says when i get good grades ""there are people who also work when they are 16 and get their driver's license"" like is she trying to make me feel even worse about myself. its hard enough attending lessons. i've been bunking and my school knows that. if i fail then what. blind people can't get jobs. my dad can't get a job my sister won't get a job. lord knows what will happen to my brother. my mother will guilt trip me saying she can't get a job because i've reported her to social services once for physical abuse. they can't do anything.

why did i even bother getting good grades in high school it just made me feel worse but it doesn't feel like its my own life at all

what the hell am i supposed to do now???

Ok so for some background information, for the past few years my (15f) mental health has always been a but rubbish, it kinda kicked off when I was about 9/10 and it wasn't too bad (don't want to get into specifics rn sorry) but my parents were worried enough about me that they made me start seeing my school counselor for about a year, which idk how much that did but whatever. Anyways, when I moved schools I stopped seeing the counselor, and I ended up being alright for about a year, so my parents decided not to worry anymore. 

Long story short, after about a year of being ok, I fell into a quick decline and I don't know exactly what's wrong with me but I'm pretty sure something's not right and I'm pretty miserable, to be honest. Exams at school are coming up and I've been getting a lot worse, and I really want to speak to someone. However, my parents have a lot on their plate right now and neither of them are in a good place mentally (both have various mental problems and are in the beginnings of what's shaping up to be a pretty messy divorce). My mum did get a bit worried one time and tried to make an appointment but forgot about it and I never ended up going. I really can't imagine bringing my mental health up with them as I can tell they'd immediately conclude that they're bad parents, it's their fault, etc (as in one time I dropped a bit too strong a hint that I wasn't 100% ok and she literally broke down). I feel like if I were to tell them the full extent of what I've been going through it would break their hearts and I really don't want to stress them out more.
I know that suggesting I go to a school counselor is a popular choice, but I can't/don't want to for a couple reasons, partly because apparently the one at my school is awful and also because I know they'll just call my parents even if I tell them not to (has happened to multiple friends).

So does anyone have any ideas on how I could either get help without my parents knowing or how I could tell them without really hurting them? (I'm in England btw)",26Nov2020,1

Then as soon as I turn my back to walk away, it feels like there’s an invisible person behind me and my hairs spike up on my neck. I felt it just a bit ago when I was downstairs. The only light on was my kitchen and as I was heading upstairs, I felt someone’s watch and felt someone behind me and I turned around and no one was there. I ran up the stairs and turned the light off and it looked like someone was staring at me from the dark. Shit like this makes me locks my doors at night. No one is in my house besides me and my parents. But i don’t understand those creepy feelings, creepy voices, and creepy stares even thought they’re not there, it feels like they are. The paranoia is even there when it’s daylight. I’ll feel a stare and I just want to grab the knife from my kitchen and lock myself in my room to protect myself. 

I’m not crazy I swear and i’m not making this up, but putting this in words makes me sound stupid. Is this just me or is this normal? Like not NORMAL, but is this normal for some mental illness?

It just makes me incredibly anxious that he’s going to leave her one day and leave her and us with the baby, but we have no room for a baby at our house nor money. Call me selfish but I’m a college student who lives at home and I do not have the energy to take care of a baby. I’m just feeling horrible over this entire thing. It’s like I’m constantly stressing over when the day finally comes, if anyone has any advice that would be great.",26Nov2020,1

227,"I have always seen people that are struggling being encouraged to talk things out with either a professional or a family member/ friend. 

I have a friend (long distance due to covid, cannot visit) that is suffering from sever anxiety and possibly other mental health issues. And they insist that the only way they feel things are going to get better is if they cut of all contact with everyone and just let themselves be alone. I know they are the type of person extremely uncomfortable with being emotionally vulnerable but this wanting to be alone still worries me. They live with family so I think they're safe from taking any drastic measures. 

I want to be there for them but I am worried about whether a contact less existence would make things worse for them. I have encouraged therapy but they cut me off and insist that I stop talking about it because even the simplest discussion of any serious issue causes them anxiety. So basically we never get to discuss anything important, because talking about mental health issues causes them to spiral.

230,"hey guys.. contemplating suicide right now. cut the crap, I'm an adult, and if I wanna make a political stand ill make one. why am I saying this is a political stand? 

well there comes the question, just recently found out about the concepts of involuntary treatment and outpatient commitment. 

and since all of the suicidal bits of my life jump back to the time of my life when I was homeless and got stuck with this charity..  

back in those days I started hearing people comment on my thoughts, first I was so caught up in my own narrative that I kind of just drowned in voices and didn't realize how specific they where and how unlikely it is that I'm making this in my head. 

years have passed, its gotten worse and less bad and worse again.. currently feel like I'm half way out.. but I'm struggling with suicidal thoughts ever since this started. now, what I'm trying to say here. is.. is there any chance that this is community treatment order taking place, without me even being notified? years of my life stolen away cause someone deemed me less than human? now I know what you are going to say, why didn't you look into it earlier? life is hard for me, I'm never in just one place and I can barely get by for food and shelter. so since my necessities are so immediately present all the time, and this theoretical treatment keeps making me feel guilty about stuff and constantly riding a low pathetic ass wave.. my mental health has clearly shown no improvement.. as I feel more aggressive less able to connect and generally dehumanised, my self image is fucked, and my anxiety makes your anxiety look like a golden retriever puppy. 

so.. this being a thing. and me now being familiar with the fact that this may actually be a thing that I was tricked into getting into...

I wanna commit suicide. 

My dreams will be carried on by a massive beautiful community SO r/parkour 

but I no longer feel.. like I can live with this. Its been like this for a while now.. and today I'm getting closer. 

I just want to know.. know for sure, and honestly, that there is a chance that I am not making this up and that there is some evil institution out there doing this kind of bullshit.. If that is the case.. then apparently they consider me less than human.. or at least not human enough to even ask me if I want treatment.. which I would've gladly taken, as long as Its MOTHERFUCKING VOLUNTARY.

238,"Hi there!

I’ve been struggling a lot with myself and my mental health for a while now, especially around last year. I think it’s time to take action... Can someone tell me which abstract type of disorders/ilnesses I could possibly have by reading my story? This could help me further in my recovery!

So let’s start my story.
I’m a teenage boy from Belgium and I have been struggling for a long time now, and things got worse over the last year. Before that I used to self harm which I’ve luckily already left behind me. 

But now I’ve been particulary struggling with eating disorders. After I was been sexually abused and dumped by my first boyfriend, I had the feeling that I was undesirable, not good or beautiful enough and simply not worthy, so I started to restrict (and in just a handful of cases purge) my food. I lost 16 kilos in the course of 3 months, which gave me power, I was told that I looked good an felt generally accepted, except by myself. Although my eating pattern has gotten slightly better, my weight stays around the same number and I have a lovely relationship where my partner fully supports me and tries to help me in every way. Although he’s there for me, The hate towards my body, frequent weight shifts and unhealthy mechanisms stay the same. I’m struggling with food and these kind of symptoms every day of my life, but that’s not all of it.

This is where I have symptons that I can’t place or don’t know what they are, I will list them up, so it’s easier to read:

- thoughts about killing myself, which mostly end 30 seconds later. I feel very angry about it afterwards.
- angriness towards myself and others.
- the feeling it can never be quiet, I can’t stop thinking, it’s like there are voices in my head or something, weird to explain
-the feeling of being useless
-the feeling of being hopeless
-the feeling of being worthless
-a sudden panic where I don’t know what to do with my life
-the feeling I can’t do anything at all
-thoughts about my abuse or just bad experiences in general, which will trigger me to stop eating
-the feeling of being trapped, this one feels very weird, this is a state where I just completely spiral down and feel so out of control about everything. I can’t seem to think straight at all. this one is the hardest to explain as the feeling is so specific and hard to describe.

This where the ones which I experience the most... The thing that confuses me the most is that I don’t know why I’m experiencing all of this. Could it still be a consequence from the abuse, stress, anything else? I have no clue! Is there someone who knows more on this topic than me and can explain what I should do/on which topics I have to do more research to get some help eventually? That would be much appreciated and needed! Thank you x",26Nov2020,1
239,"I'm 25 years old, and I am showing major signs of something.

 My mother has a couple issues mentally. Bipolar, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. 

I, however, have battled with depression and anger outbursts since as early as I can remember.
 I sought after help when I was 19 and I was diagnosed bipolar 2, with signs of PTSD, and bulimia, granted I only saw a psychiatrist for one sitting. They prescribed me Remeron, and It did not help, it made matters worse and I tried to commit suicide after a week of taking Remeron. 

 I can't control how heated I get and I make really bad choices. I'm always depressed and the times I don't seem depressed is because I'm putting a mask on and it's exhausting. Sometimes it's a genuine moment of happiness but depending on how happy I am will dictate how low I get later. 

I spend most of my life between being fine and being depressed. I have read about SSRIs and I am usually completely against taking medication but as of lately I am no longer to do this without help.

 I have no insurance. I am supposed to be covered by my native american tribe but I don't know of any doctors close to dfw that accept tribal coverage. 

I don't know how to seek help or where to start but I have decided that I can't do this alone anymore and if I don't get help soon I'm scared of where I am headed. I can't keep a job because of my performance. I work my ass off and I actually enjoy working but sometimes the shit in my head won't let me. I need help and don't know where else to turn.

But recently the voice is growing louder and louder and I've never wanted to hurt myself before but I do now as it makes me feel something that isn't just utter lonliness.

I always believed I could win this fight with myself as thats what it is, its just a fight that i can claw my way out of. But it's getting harder and harder to do that, and the thoughts are just getting worse and worse. Its hit the point where the little voice in my head is now the one telling me to tell someone, and to ask for help. But the big voice is too loud, telling me that I'll worry people and that no one really cares. I don't want to upset people, all I want is for them to be happy, and if me being unhappy is what I took, I used to be willing to do that, now though its all just becoming too much, if I don't get help I don't know what I'm going to do.

245,"I tried posting this on r/self and I got barely any responses so I'm posting it here.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm a young teenager with ADHD, Severe Anxiety, and Asperger's Syndrome. This has been going on for as long as I could say, two years. Maybe three. I basically just lost interest in some things. Whenever I would look for a movie to watch I would never find anything and I'd spend ages looking for a movie to end nowhere. This happens countless nights and I feel that I've seen all the good movies out there or the ones I'd be interested in. I've seen all of them to the point that there are no movies left. There are very few new movies that I haven't seen that I'd like. Most movies just look the same these days in comedy or in writing.

My birthday is in late October and Christmas is right around the corner. So I spend ages browsing Amazon all throughout October trying to find things I want, but nothing interests me and I only get 6 or 11 very small and cheap presents like sunglasses because I can't find anything big I want. The same happens with Christmas where I just can't find anything I like or feel interested in.

Sometimes I'll spend an eternity browsing the XBOX store or Steam trying to find just one game I'll like. But like I said with movies, I don't find anything interesting because I've seen all the ones that are. So I'll spend ages and I won't get anywhere. The Playstation Store is the only place I've found something interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

To be clear, I am interested in things. I go out with friends, eat with friends, have fun playing video games I do and watching the movies I like and I always study and learn new things.  It's just sometimes everything feels the same and you spend hours trying to find a good movie or videogame or present but there's nothing that fits your interests or that you want. This feeling gets to me almost every year.

Sometimes I just feel like giving up and not celebrating Christmas or my birthday, or just celebrating my birthday really small with only one or two friends. Why do I feel this and what is this feeling called?",26Nov2020,1
246," There  is power in standing up for yourself and sticking to your personal  boundaries regarding how you participate in life as a trauma survivor. I  hate the constant barrage of showing up because of obligation. Fuck  that. I mean, when I think about the fact that people will shame you  over not doing something that you don’t want to do, I get irate. I think  about how many times in our lives that we are put in the position of  showing up due to social constructs, and I want to smash my face into  the wall. **You don’t owe anyone your time or sanity.**

I  implore you to please take care of yourself over the next few weeks  starting today. The number one thing that people healing trauma can do  is to say no or to say nothing at all. You don’t have to go to family  gatherings and events where past abusers are present. You don’t have to  go to work get-togethers because you are in recovery, and Tom can’t have  just one drink. You don’t have to go to the hundreds of things you are  invited to. Why? Because you are a goddamn adult, and you have the  choice here. No one is going to force you into a car, to put the key in  the ignition, drop the gear to D, and hit the road. If I’m wrong about  that, we have much more severe problems on our hands.

Creating agency as a trauma survivor

Look,  here is the deal. We are used to putting our needs secondary as CPTSD  survivors. At some point, our needs got put on the back burner as a  survival mechanism. That is OK. We can acknowledge that. However, as we  move forward, we must follow our gut instinct and listen to what our  soul tells us. If everything in you is screaming, **don’t go,** then don’t go. And don’t tell me that it’s easy said than done because you are in control. Y-O-U.

You  have the power here, and look, I know that is scary, but it’s true. You  can step into your personal boundaries, and your right as a human being  is that you only have to do what you want to do. I trust that the truth  of our healing journey recognizes that we are allowed to have agency in  our lives.

I challenge you to  continue to double-down on your personal boundaries and your right to  say no. Hell, start today. No law states you must suffer through another  family thanksgiving with your narcissistic mother, verbally abusive  step-father, racist grandmother, or anyone in between. Today, if you  need to say no, please say no. Order Pad Thai; it’s better than turkey  anyway.

Until next time my friend…

258,"I'll try to make this quick.   My lovely, manic depressive ex girlfriend, and best friend for the previous year, claimed I was horrifically emotionally, and in our final days, sexually, abusive. These claims arose after she started taking snri meds, and months after I ended the relationship (in hopes of working on ourselves, and getting back together). Even though i have countless recorded phone calls, texts, and videos showing confidently this was not the case, I live in constant terror that even a public accusation, would destroy my career. She took me for about $8k during our relationship, between gifts, gas money, cash, and food.   Two months after her accusation, and not speaking with her I receive a venmo request for $800 dollars titled ""wisdom teeth"" Her oral hygiene was always very poor, and I offered repeatedly to cover expenses.   The idiot I am, sent her the money captioned ""miss you so much, man.""  Since then all she's done is slander me. 
I miss her very very badly, and the idea that she hates me, has me in shambles.  She got a ""gold digger"" tattoo the week before  we broke up. 

 My parents have tried cornering me into a financial situation that is not legal. I have refused to participate. They no longer speak to me. Half of me says ""screw that, how dare you put me into this position"" and the other wants to oblige them.  I want them to be happy with me, but I don't want to risk my freedom for their bullshit.

It makes things much worse. I know this is stupid and I should not do so. I'm good friends with all of my ex girlfriends (and their significant others). So her being the outlier proves I'm really bad at being disliked. The drinking is going to lose me a really great job if I don't get it together. 

TL;DR:   I'm irrationally heartbroken over an unhealthy relationship, my parents are being manipulative and selfish which is putting me at legal risk, I drink way too much, and I'm really struggling to keep going.   This is a lonely Thanksgiving.   What do?",26Nov2020,1
259,"I want to preface this by saying I don’t think I’m necessarily suicidal. I don’t feel like it’s the only option I have left to make everything stop or anything like that, but sometimes the thought just pops into my head and stays there for a while. It usually happens when I think of everything I have to do still (school, work, ECs, etc.) and the thought that “you know I could just end it all and be done” just pops in. There’s not necessarily emotion behind the thought, it’s just kind of like a matter-of-fact statement. I know I’m not wrong but I know saying it out loud would freak people out. I’ve been feeling overwhelmed lately, but are these thoughts a cause for concern? Could I end up spiraling? I had a passing suicidal thought about two weeks ago, but none since and it seemed like a one time thing. Are these thoughts normal? Should I be concerned?",26Nov2020,1
260,"I tapered my dosage of duloxetine from 90mg to 30mg over about 4 months and everything was going well. However, I took my last 30mg dose (the lowest available dose) a couple of days ago and the withdrawal symptoms are pretty bad. Eyes feel like they cant focus on anything properly, brain zaps, feeling sick and so on. Luckily I havent experienced any suicidal thoughts like I did when starting it.

261,"I noticed that I became a lot more cynical and gained an interest in psychology ever since. I am fascinated by ‘reading’ people’s body language, what they say and why they say it, decision making, etc, but at the same time I can sometimes switch to a overthinking analytical ‘mode’, where I will usually think of the worst possible thing when it comes to why someone behaves in a certain way, even if it’s nice and cheerful. Don’t get me wrong, I can live in the moment and have fun, but afterwards when I look over my day, I suddenly try to make any logical connections with what happened today and before, and reasons for that, and it’s a little saddening because that’s the only way in which I can ‘protect’ and prepare myself from the worst and typically unexpected.",26Nov2020,1
262,"Hi. This is my first post to this sub! I’m just feeling really confused atm. 

I (f15) have these thoughts. Urges to do things I know I would never do. Some examples: my school has a really bad problem with people pulling fire alarms (4 in 3 days, at least 3 a week) and now the teachers are guarding the fire alarms between classes and at the end of the day lol. Every time I walk past one I have this urge to press it. I know how stupid that would be and I don’t purposefully think about doing it. But I’m worried I might accidentally do it..??? 

Another thing is when I’m with my (15)partner (we’ve been together over a year) I have this urge to hurt them even though I have no reason to. Physically and emotionally. My partner is so kind to me and is generally loving, caring etc. All the traits you’d want in a partner. I sometimes can’t stop myself with the mean comments I know it will probably upset them and I shouldn’t do it but I can’t stop. I don’t want to do it but it happens. I’ve not physically hurt them (I really wouldn’t want to do that) but sometimes I just think about punching them or something. It makes me feel so guilty because they’re always so nice to me and would NEVER hit me or anything.  I honestly think they deserve better. 

I also feel like my demeanour changes randomly, for no reason. I’ll be friendly and talkative. Then I’ll just act really cold and passive aggressive, almost angry. I don’t know why. I feel so bad because my partner just wants to love me but I feel like I’m making it so much more difficult than it needs to be. I do love them so I’m really confused why I think about hurting them. 

I don’t think it’s anything serious, I’m just wondering if anyone has any advice. I don’t think I’ve done a good job at explaining it very well but it’s difficult.",26Nov2020,1
263,"I just got home from campus and I’ve now found myself spending a considerable amount of time alone. Randomly, I’ll remember some awkward social interaction or mistake I made and cringe really hard as I regret the moment. I noticed these thought loops really affect my mood and I can’t figure what causes these memories to resurface. I’m really emotionally exhausted and would just like to move on but I can’t stop feeling so embarrassed and upset with myself even though I can recognize that I’m misremembering many parts of the event. I find myself trying to explain my past actions to myself but I’m never convinced. How do I reconcile my past with the present and move on?",26Nov2020,1
264,"I live with a woman in her 50s (my mom) and my younger brother (18). We have been isolating and me and my mom working remotely due to a few health conditions and general anxiety over the virus. 

My younger brother has strong IBS and has been sent to the hospital several times in the past. Done complex tests but nothing has been diagnosed. Because of bowel issues he is on a strict diet and doesn't eat until 5pm everyday due to nausea when he wakes up. (He goes to bed at 4am and will continue snacking in the night). We try to adjust his diet schedule and what he eats (mostly snacks, almost no greens or vitamins) but he gets very angry when we berate him for it. 

On many occasions when he gets sick or bad IBS episodes he'll get very irritable if we don't support him carefully. He would start yelling at my mom if she doesn't ""handle"" the situation correctly and my mom would enter a stepping on glass situation. Where if she offers to cook a light meal or give certain medication he would yell back that she is making it worse. If I step in to defend my mom that's when he will get violent or start crying. E.g. lecture him harshly how just because he's feeling sick doesn't mean he should make my mom feel miserable. And being a very big guy myself I can accidentally throw him in a spiral of damaging the house (he once broke through a wall with his fist). Because I would metaphorically put him in a corner. I know my mom is scared of him when he enters these episodes and I try to firefight

Ultimately my mom wants me to take a supportive and kind gentle mothers touch role as he is going through a bad period. Isolated and no job and bad IBS. 

I try to recommend a counselor or family counselor or psychologist but my mom would tell me that ""its a tough time since its covid and we can do this after. In the meantime do as much as you can for your brother. Ask him to play games, watch movies or cook""

But I find it hard to act as a good brother and act as the more mature person due to his irritability. Even though supporting him will only do more good than harm.

266,"So I told my friend about me being mildly suicidal and how I’m genuinely scared sometimes. They couldn’t offer much aside from support and a very scared look on their face. I was very shaky and my voice was all over the place, but it felt nice to tell someone. 

Then Religious education class came around (Catholic school, not awful but everyone is forced to take RE). Since a bunch of people are off because of a Covid case in out school, my friend and I were the only ones in our row (back row) of 4, with two people sitting in front of us: the only one significant to this story is the dude. 

This dude is known for being irritating, funny, but annoying (on purpose). Him and my friend were having a conversation which eventually morphed into how they’d like to die... quite light hearted with jokes and self deprecation- until he asks me “hey OP, how would you like to kill yourself?”  My friend looked at me really scared, sort of a cross between a deer-in-the-headlights look and a “omfg, I was not expecting that” and “are you okay”. They started telling him off, because YOU JUST DON’T ASK PEOPLE THOSE QUESTIONS! And my response to him was “don’t-, just genuinely don’t-. Please don’t-“ I think he got the message that asking me that wasn’t a great move. That definitely sent me spiralling for a couple minutes, and I was having a hard time taking any notes for a while. I nearly cried because- I don’t know, I was just not in a good mental state at that moment. The rest of that class was mostly uneventful and it was the end of the day. I don’t really blame him, he didn’t know, but I hate how much it affected me. 

I don’t know wtf I’m gonna do in the next few weeks because I’m genuinely scared for my own safety but I’ve lied to my parents so many times about this stuff that it just feels like I’m screwed. I may tell a pastoral teacher (pretty much a guidance counsellor) so they can help me tell my parents in a way that doesn’t immediately make them panic, but that also feels too difficult. 

Anyway, sorry for the ramble... it helped a bit.",26Nov2020,1
267,"I am currently really going through a rough ass time for seemingly no reason. I have these bizarre, strong delusions that have no basis in reality and am 100% aware that they are crazy. Yet here I am, compulsively giving in to them or unable to relax / be in the present moment. It's maddening. I don't want to go to a psych ward because I truly believe it'll make things worse (all of this started when I was put on (and then taken off) Zoloft several months ago. Prior to that, I was maybe a little down but a normal, well adjusted person who had low levels of anxiety and was managing my day to day life. After Zoloft, I am crippled emotionally and unable to function in day to day life. I am so afraid of the meds they'd force me to take and end up being stuck there for weeks or longer while I get worse and worse.

I feel both grateful and bitter that I am at least of a sound mind even if my emotions and stuff are out of control. On one hand it's a good thing, but on the other I somewhat despise I have to watch myself falling deeper and deeper into this hole. I hope everyone is doing alright out there today.",26Nov2020,1

272,"Hello, I'm a 20yo make, I used to go to A phycologist once a month, but since prices have gone up, and my income has remained the same I can no longer afford it, since I stopped going  I realized in this time that  the  only thing I was getting was ""attention"", someone with whom I could talk with and express my worries, fears and problems (and get motivation and realistic feed back of how disproportionaly exaggerated all these thing are ).

So I have arrived to the conclusion that I need someone like me/therapist ( basically a emotional punching bag ) but I don't have anyone in my life that is like that  ( and also I feel bad for the person having to listen and reason everything I have to say ), instead the only people I have are narcissists that prey on people like me/empaths and always put you down.

So the point is, does anybody have a suggestion or something that might allow me to achieve the same result I got will my therapist?

(making friends is definitely a no go, I'm too introverted and can come off as dry when it come to small talk and reaaally hate ""social obligations"" )

Also any tips to avoid getting depressed / suicidal when around narcissists ( I live with three narcissistic family members and moving away is extremely hard )

Lastly, I take Concerta 5 days a week, not sure it this affects mood in some way.

276,"Long story short: I told my mom something that upset me and she did the whole ""I don't understand why that bothers you. It shouldn't,"" and so on. Family matters that I witness my parents handle in front of me that unintentionally pull me into it. It's incredibly toxic dishing out your dirty laundry in front of your kids, I don't understand what's so difficult to understand about that. I grew up as a parental mediator so yeah their stuff gets to me whether they include me directly or not.

I take my negative emotions out on myself. Some people inflict their pain on others, but I take it out on myself. I'll quit my meds cold turkey or something like that because in my head, I wonder what the point of any of it is. She came to me and said that she doesn't understand why I do things like that when I'm upset and I tried to explain that when I decline, I take it out on myself. I gave her a letter explaining all of it and how the self-harm is like a milder version of an attempt, to put it simply. She read it and just never talked to me. 

Fast forward to today: she came to my room asking what I wanted for breakfast but I was slumped and responded in very short statements. Hours later I come down all happy, excited and energetic and she says in a certain way ""Oh there you are. I assumed you were upset"" and then I told her that I was (in general but it has nothing to do with breakfast) and went into it, noting that I didn't want to be negative because of the holiday and she stayed silent unless she had some sort of quip about not understanding or telling me not to use certain examples. Until finally she ended things by saying she didn't want to talk about it until next week because of this, and this, and that, and then she stopped talking to me overall. 

I am now huddled up in my room and I can't say I feel very festive anymore. My brother came to see me and I kind of told him what's going on but ultimately I just went back to my room. I wouldn't be surprised if all of this comes off very bratty, and I apologize if this is a stupid post, but I don't feel like putting on an act just so that everyone else feels happy. It's happened before. I'm the dark cloud that ruins the holidays.",26Nov2020,1

I don't know, if you're anything like me nobody prepared you for such hopelessness. I can't take it. Sometimes, maybe even most of the time I move on trying to be as productive as possible keeping the hopeless realities in the background, but in the end it's all a farce, and eventually you have to fully deal with it. At least I do. What the hell do you do about that? When you're so broken that every interpersonal interaction is an act of charity from the other person? Where you're so slow that nothing you do or create could possibly be of substantive value? My upbringing prepared me with a charisma of about 6. I'm entirely unlikeable, socially inept, stupid and useless. Life is a vague nightmare. Can't deal.
