I looked in the mirror and I said goodbye.
wonder how many pills it will take to die ?.

Taake a breath and try to think straight. 
Come on drugs ,I don’t know how much longer I can wait ?!.

The morning light is so far away .
I use my metal saviour to keep demons at bay. 

So please tell me you love me ,even if it’s fake .
And fingers crossed ,tomorrow I won’t wake .

As night turns to day my world will shatter. 
Why was I sobbing all night , does it matter ? . 

I won’t let you not loving me ,Determine who I grow up to be . 
when you left you said it was us ,but it turns out it’s just me .

So you keep shoving these meds down my throat and I will keep reading motivational quotes.
maybe then in the summer I can wear tank tops and not coats .

I’m going to sharpen my teeth on every rock you throw.
Because just like flowers, even when stepped on, I will still grow .",11Oct2020,1

Just wanted to share the Best News Ever :)

It has absolutely changed my life. Its alot to read but I beg you to read. You will never read anything as important as this.

The following is from a book that I began reading over a week ago that counteracts the LIES of negative feelings, thoughts, that I and many of you probably struggle with. Its written by Christ Stefanick, who speaks to thousands of young adults a year, and shares the Message of God to them all (find him on youtube). His book is called I AM: Amazing, Strong, Beautiful, Blessed, Fearless, Forgiven: REWRITE Your Name--REROUTE Your Life

This is from the introduction called ""The Power of the Word."" (The Word is Jesus, is called the Word Made Flesh). Chris begins:

"" '*There's a war of words happening in your mind. The outcome of that war determines your destiny*'

There's a dialogue happening right now that's more important than any other in your life. It's the dialogue in your head. You spend a lot of time and energy wrestling with the voices in your head. Sometimes they speak in whispers too subtle to hear, but they're always there. And the way that dialogue pans out matters a lot.

**The words you speak to yourself shape your self-perception. Your self-perception shapes your actions. Your actions shape your life. So the words you speak to yourself form the foundation of your whole life.**

Where are the words you speak to yourself coming from? Self doubt? Old wounds? Echoes from past mistakes? Lack of affirmation that *should* have been there? A materialist culture? Or your Maker?

God has told the truth about who we are. Liberating truth. Truth that breaks our bonds and sets us free. And that truth wasn't meant to remain on scrolls. **God wants scripture to rewrite the script in your head. He wants his Word to form the words you speak to yourself, how you see yourself, and how you live. But you have to do your part for that to happen.**""

That sets up the next part that I wrote. If this book sounds interesting to you, please get it and read it. IT HAS CHANGED MY LIFE. Chris is Catholic, as am I. This message is not exclusive however. THIS MESSAGE IS FOR YOU AND EVERYONE. Please take it in and let it transform you.

I originally wrote this in response to another person who needed support but thought I'd make a post of it so that more of you, CHILDREN OF GOD, can see and believe and be MADE NEW!

You are a child of God. You are worthy, you are beautiful, you are absolutely amazing, you are strong, you are lovable! You know how I know this? It is because God loves you and made you so. You and everything around you did not just poof into being from nothing. You were made. You were thought into being, and created by Love Himself. You are royalty because you are a child of God! NOTHING ELSE DEFINES WHO YOU ARE. YOU ARE GOD's CHILD!

""For you formed my inward parts;  
you knitted me together in my mother's womb.  
 I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.\[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20139&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-16254a)\]  
Wonderful are your works!

My soul knows it very well.  
 My frame was not hidden from you,  
when I was being made in secret,  
intricately woven in the depths of the earth.  
 Your eyes saw my unformed substance;  
in your book were written, every one of them,  
the days that were formed for me,  
when as yet there was none of them! "" Psalm 139

Just as you are, God loves you. There's nothing that we have to do to make God love us. He loves unconditionally, whether you know it or not, whether you love Him back or not. His love remains constant.

""Just how much does God love me?"" You may ask. You are loved so much that God sent His one Son, who's name is Jesus Christ, to die for you. Think again: He, the God of Love, who set the galaxies in motion out of love you and I, loves you so much that He sent His One Son, Jesus Christ, through the Love that is shared between Them, the Holy Spirit, to die on the cross!

It didn't end there. God is Life. God's sacrifice on the Cross defeated death forever. Jesus didn't stay in the tomb, but rose again for you and all of us that we may all have Life through Him. Not life that is bound by sin, death, and despair, but Life filled with Faith, Hope, and Enduring LOVE!

This did not take away sin, death, and suffering, but He gave us power over Them. We may sin, but that is not the end. God's Mercy and love is opened wide to us ALWAYS! We all still die, but that is not the end. God's Death and Resurrection opened to us the Gates of Heaven, our eternal refuge in which we live always in the presence of God's infinite Love and Goodness, the fulfilment of all our heart's longest hopes and desires! We have, through Jesus's death and Resurrection, become sharers in His own supernatural Life.

""More than that, we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us. "" (Romans 5:3-5)

God wants you to be happy. Even above happy. We are all created for love by God. A love that is never-changing. There God tells you to be Joyful. Not in the things of the world, but in that which never perishes, God's Love. You can always be Joyful in God. Trust in Him.

""Rejoice in the Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice! Let your forbearance be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand. **6** In nothing be anxious; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. **7** And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.

**8** Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honorable, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are \[[d](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+4&amp;version=ASV#fen-ASV-29435d)\]of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. **9** The things which ye both learned and received and heard and saw in me, these things do: and the God of peace shall be with you."" (Phillipians 4:4-9)

Those words were written by St. Paul as He was imprisoned and awaiting to have his head cut off. The Joy that God gives, that He desires you to have, is not dependent on our condition. It is basic, we are loved by God, who is all-powerful, all-loving, and always in control (yes, many times it absolutely does not seem so). We are His children and we can TRUST in Him in everything.

Say this prayer daily, even several times a day, say it once for every hour of day with as much trust as you can muster:

Jesus, I Trust in You!

Those are the words of St. Paul, who used to be one of the great persecutors of the Church; he became one of the greatest saints we have. He was in charge of persecuting Christians. That was before God called Him and changed Him. His name was Saul, then God bestowed His grace upon Him and it changed Him forever (ST PAUL, pray for US!). To mark this change of making Him new, God changed his name from Saul to Paul. ""The greater the sinner, the greater right one has to My mercy,"" is Jesus said another great saint in modern times, St. Faustina. THERE IS NOTHING YOU HAVE DONE OR CAN DO THAT CAN SEPARATE YOU FROM THE LOVE OF GOD. God's love is the love of a father. Trust in Him, you are His child and He is Your Heavenly Father!

""He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away."" (Revelation 21:4)

Whenever you experience the feeling, thought, or voice that says ""You're not worthy"" or ""You can't do that,"" or ""Who do you think you are?"" RENOUNCE them as the LIES that there are. THEY ARE LIES. Whether its from you're mental health, a struggled past, emotional insecurity, or from Satan himself, THEY ARE LIES. Begin everyday with the statement that You are royalty, you are beautiful, you are worthy, not of your own accord or doing, but from the God that made you so. God's Word is. If He says you are His child, that He loves without condition, you best believe it.

Whenever these lies creep in, and before they even have chance, say ""Jesus says that I am (opposite word/feeling), and His beloved."" Slowly, your mind will shift from the devil's lies to the truth of who you are in Christ.

God bless you all. May Jesus, Mary, and Joseph bless and keep you safe in their arms!

4,"I have clinical depression and anxiety disorder. When I was younger I used to be extremely passionate about a lot of things, to the point of being nerdy and even obsessive. I loved it though. But when I try to engage in any hobby, old or new, I don't get that rush of enjoyment. Like, they're enjoyable, but not the way they used to be and they're rarely exciting. What do you think is the best thing I can do right now?",11Oct2020,1
5,"I feel like I can't do it. Any time I'm about to start trying to open up to someone I just stop myself from doing it. I don't understand why, I just can't.i thought about texting a hotline but talked myself out of it. Im suppose to go spend the night in a town about 2 hours away from my home to pick up my partner tomorrow morning but can't get out of bed and don't feel like making the drive. And I can't call them because they are on vacation in a different time zone and don't want to be a bother. What do I do?",11Oct2020,1
6,"So... The fear of losing someone is part of my life. But one case is very extreme. I have a friend for a few years now. 100% online friendship, yet the realest and deepest friendship I ever had. Basically chatting literally all the time. He lives rather far away and we will probably never meet irl. That's not problem. The problem is that... When I try to think about if we will still be friends in 10,20,30... Years...i get really sad and even cry. I'm extremely scared that as time goes by we will stop being friends. I'm scared when I imagine myself being older, I'm just thinking back to these amazing times and he will be a memory. I wish our friendship could go on until we are old and eventually die. But the harsh truth is that... This probably won't be the case...",11Oct2020,1
7,"I avoid conflict to the point where friends and coworkers tell me it's impacting my life.  (I also avoid conflict as it relates to stuff like personal debt, which is obviously another issue.)  I grew up in a house with an abusive father, so avoiding conflict is something I tend to knee-jerk just do to protect myself.
 
This has impacted me recently - I recently left a new job that paid pretty well because I had a manager that I couldn't deal with, and I figured walking away from the job was an easier solution than confronting her or switching positions at the job.  And I've been jobless since the beginning of covid.

I'd more describe my situation as conflict avoidance with a side of entitlement.  I had such a horrible upbringing, I don't EVER want to deal with conflict and tend to get resentful and indignant when I have to - and that's at best.  When I have to deal with a particularly bad situation, I get very upset and have at times flown into blind rages.

An anecdote that describes me at my worst - a few years back, I visited my parents for Christmas, and my sister was there.  We disagree about politics intensely (and she knows I don't like discussing them with her) so I told my father in advance to please not turn on the news, leave any newspapers lying around, or bring up politics in the two days she was there.  He thought I was being overly neurotic, but went along with it for the sake of a pleasant visit.

My plan works for about a day and a half, then she suddenly, completely oblivious (or testing me?) brings up politics while we're watching a completely innocent children's film.  I immediately completely lose it and shout at her for about five minutes straight, beside myself with anger because my plan to sidestep politics had been working so well.  She told me later she was afraid I was going to hit her or something.  The tirade horrified my father, and my sister and me didn't speak for a good year after that.

What I hate most about this problem is that it's almost impossible to describe.  Anger problems is one thing, chronic conflict avoidance is another, but I've never seen anger tie directly into conflict avoidance like this.",11Oct2020,1
8,"I have been having suicidal thoughts for over a month now and the weird part is I don't feel any emotion when I think about it. it's like ""I should kill myself"" and  I mean it but like there is no sadness there. My train of thought during these episodes is that it's probably better that way and i could finally get away from my issues, I think about this emotionlessly. I have an idea of what this could be but i am not sure, i was thinking it's because I don't feel like there is a purpose to my life and that the rational choice would be to end it all, I just need someone to maybe help me out, and give me an idea of what this could be, cause i can't afford a therapist and mental health really isn't seen to be that much of an issue where I come from.",11Oct2020,1
9,"Something that's struck me while I was talking with a friend was that I really don't know who I am. I feel as if my struggles with mental health have drained all semblance of who I once was down the gutter, never to be seen again and where the only remembrance of what and who that person used to be are fleeting memories and faint recollections of what my intentions flagged as important or crucial. I aimlessly footer around this life while struggling to keep my balance as depression, anxiety and a meriad of other unresolved or conveniently ignored problems try to pull me by the wrist down into the deep dark abyss of self pity, hatred and anxiety-riddled fear while good intentions and a feigned optimism for the betterment of tomorrow to be just around the corner. 

I was robbed of a personality by this fickle disease in my brain and I wish it no remorse or pity when it's finally kicked to the curb by self improvement, whenever such a thing arrives.",11Oct2020,1
10,Lmao y’all can someone tell me what the hell is wrong with me like I get irritated as hell when people can’t read my mind. I get annoyed that I have to actually say my thoughts out loud.,11Oct2020,1
11,"My sibling has been experiencing mental health problems for a couple decades now. They have been a huge drain on our family and seem to be stuck with no way out. They have a substance abuse problem - alcohol in the past, cannabis, nicotine, and caffeine now - and virtually a hermit. They have rarely been physically violent but are very quick to anger and what I would call verbal violence - their anger gets translated into terribly vile and toxic speech. I was under the impression that they were getting better - but I think I was wrong.

They have had problems with (a) specific person(s) for years now, on a daily basis. This person is a constant trigger and it is mainly because of noise. This has sometimes escalated to verbal confrontations. Other times, my sibling will simply walk around the house fuming with anger, taking it out on whoever is around or muttering and speaking to themselves. Me and my family have heard them speaking to themselves when they didn’t think we
could hear - they do this rather loudly. They have said horrible things in the past, regarding themselves and others, including their immediate family. Sometimes this will take very dark and overtly racist turns. Then, when talking in other settings - not to themselves, rather with me for example - they ostensibly express an aversion to racism. When confronted, they claim these rantings/mutterings to themselves are a form of venting, of catharsis perhaps, and are nothing more than that. They are sometimes ashamed of them and say they don’t mean the things they express.

Up until just now - at least as far as I know - there have been no overtly homicidal thoughts expressed, at the very least not directed at a specific person. I walked by their room just now - it’s around 3am - and heard what I can only describe as the telltale aggressive mutterings. I decided to eavesdrop - I am never proud of doing so, but have sometimes felt it was absolutely necessary - and heard the familiar toxic and venomous tone of voice, them muttering to themselves. This time, they were using ethnic slurs and homicidal intentions towards what I can only imagine is this same triggering person. First I heard them use an equivalent to the n-word concerning another ethnic group - the use of which I have already confronted them about - and ranting about how they should be “put in camps”, how they want all of them and another group “out of the country”. This in itself, although I thought they had changed their stance somewhat since they’d recently expressed this themselves, wasn’t terribly surprising anymore. Then, however, I heard them say that they would “kill you, if I get my hands on you”, and that they would “make them suffer and hurt them”. They reiterated the intention of murder several times and added that “I’ll bury you in the woods where they won’t find you”. Again, they are speaking to themselves, thinking they are unobserved. The tone in their voice was, quite frankly, absolutely terrifying.

Can this even be swept under the same rug of “ranting and venting”, to be casually ignored as just more ramblings in order to “get it out of their system”? They always said that whatever bad things were expressed when speaking to themselves were never meant seriously - but can I afford to be complacent and accept this explanation when homicidal ideation comes into play? Last I heard, they were going back to therapy, but I have no idea about the status of that. 

Has anyone had any experience with anything similar? I have absolutely no idea what to do, if anything. I just know I’m creeped out and very uncomfortable right now - their room is next to mine, and they may still be muttering murderous musing to themselves as I type. I really don’t know.",11Oct2020,1
12,"I didn't really know where else to post this, hopefully here works. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year and everytime we go to sleep I hear him start to cry and breathe heavily. I always asked what was wrong and hugged him to try and console him but nothing seems to work. I tried getting him to see a therapist but he refused because he didn't want to get in trouble. I havent gotten much out of him, but what I have gotten out of him could get him into trouble so I dont want to say and I see why he doesnt wanna tell a therapist. I'm not sure what I should do, it breaks my heart to hear him cry and hear the things he says, but he won't talk to me or get help.",11Oct2020,1
13,"Hey there.
So to give some background ive been depressed for the past couple of years.
Im 22 year old, male, and my mother left me at 15, and i never met my father, i went through a lot of abuse as a kid, since then im all alone.

My problem is, in order to get out of my predicament i started going towards self help, and ive listened and read many things in my time, ranging from discipline, philosophy meditation etc etc.

My problem is, after making a daily schedule and trying to balance my activities (im addicted to dopamine and technology) whenever i need to start working. Learning , or reading about topics that DO interest me. I feel a really weird phisycal cue.
The front part of my brain gets very dry, straneous, itchy and painful whenever i try to concentrate or think deeply.
That and i get an un controllable sleepiness and tiredness.
Even if i sleep 8 quality hours, when i wake up and i know i have (learning, self development kind of work, not salary job), i fall back to sleep and get extremelly tired.

This also happens lets say if im awoke and i suddently decide to learn even after a good nights of sleep. That front portion of my brain hurts and i cannot concentrate and i drift away 

This also happened at a course that i payed for my job and i needed to pay attention. I couldnt focus for more than couple minutes, and even if what i was doing was really important, i was falling asleep in class and i needed to slap/ phisically injure myself to keep myself awake.

From what ive read on internet people say this might be some leftover untreated ADHD since childhood. As i was really aggresive and hyperactive as a kid and my parents didnt psy attention, but i cant know for sure so i had to ask here 
As well i have to mention i talked to my local mental health institute , but theres months long waiting list, and meanwhile i want some answers so i came here.
Whats happenning to me?..",11Oct2020,1

Everyone who's struggling during lockdowns with mental health should watch it to understand that YOU ARE NOT ALONE. I'm struggling like everyone else but I'm doing okay and this video helped a lot. I want to spread awareness about the struggles of isolation and being alone during quarantine because it's not getting enough attention or being talked about like a serious problem.

17,"Using an old throwaway account I intended to use for a post I never made lol

I physically struggle to talk about my feelings and issues. I don’t think this is to do with my specific therapist as it’s an issue I have had consistently with other therapists and just talking to people in general. I know in my head how I feel but I somehow literally can’t put it into words. I’m somewhat better when writing things down but I always end up shredding my notes because I’ll re-read them and feel like I’m either being over-dramatic or not accurately explaining things. I’ll have an awful emotional week with at least one serious depression/anxiety spiral but when my therapist asks me how my week was it somehow comes out as “oh I’m doing alright”. I don’t feel like my current medication cocktail is working any better than the last one but I just end up with “it’s fine” because the idea of trying to start over and try new meds AGAIN feels like more than I can deal with right now. I’ve thought about asking about alternative treatments (Ketamine infusion, etc) but I always end up feeling like those are only for the “bad” cases and I’m not suicidal so that would be overkill. 

My relationship of 10 years is struggling because my spouse feels ignored and like I’m withdrawing both physically and emotionally. I haven’t had a sex drive since I started taking meds (even trying different ones) and no matter how many times I say it’s me not them and they say they understand I know there’s part of them that’s afraid I don’t find them attractive anymore (we had an abundantly healthy sex life early in our relationship). I know part of this is because I’ve been struggling with hating my body and being physically uncomfortable with myself and they have a similar body type to mine and I don’t know how to adequately explain to them (I have tried my best) that it’s different (because it IS. I still find them very physically attractive it’s just my own body I’m uncomfortable with despite the lack of logical sense that makes). 

And again I struggle to say this stuff to my therapist even posting about it here is already making me feel self conscious and stupid and the only thing letting me hit “post” is the anonymity.

I started graduate school (engineering) in August after graduating from undergrad in May. I am really struggling with the stress of classes and work (all online) and my mental health has deteriorated, especially after I had an unrelated traumatizing event occur. I am considering dropping out at the end of the semester.

Has anyone here had experience dropping out of graduate school? I have an undergraduate engineering degree to fall back on, but I am concerned that employers will be judgmental. I am also concerned that my coworkers and my advising professor who paid for my tuition will not understand (none of them know about my struggles with anxiety/depression/CPTSD).

25,"So this requires a whole lot of backstory, and all of this is a lot.

So, I've been deep in the mental gutter since August. Ever since then I've regained my problems with depression. And during mid September my anxiety has returned to absolutely haunt me. And a very large part of my anxiety came back because of my best friend. Now, I feel like our relationship isn't the best right now, but not because we're arguing or any of the sort. I just feel like our friendship should've evolved into something else, stronger, further. But because she has a lot of things to do, her parents straight up not letting her hang out with anyone, and the whole pandemic, we've only been able to talk to each other through text. And I think that was pretty stifling. The reason was because she got a boyfriend. Which doesn't really bother me a lot at all. You got a boyfriend, congrats gurll. But, it's the thought of something that made me break, and I'm not sure if I can say it right now, but it does have to do with my past experiences, and trauma.

But either way, in mid September I had a breakdown and told her what was making me be filled with hate and envy, from my thoughts about her boyfriend. Anddd, she did't respond for 3 days. I wanted to give her at least some time to process it, and go through it, before talking to me. And I can say, that was definitely some of the most brutal, and fucking agonizing 3 days I've had in a while. I was constantly filled to the brim with anxiety, and I felt like crying all the time. I felt like she would hate me, despise me, and never want to be my friend again. During the span of those 3 days I talked with my mom, whose had hard experiences with her best friends in the past, losing them and such. She told me something that hit me like a brick. That I wasn't in any of her priorities, and I should forget about. Now that fucked with me...a lot. Because that's one of my worse fears. Feeling like I'm not a priority in the life of someone I care about, especially if they saw more as I priority before. Now, I know that I can't be the center all the time. We're only people, and like I said earlier, she has a lot of things to do, and a lot of responsibilities, and it takes time for her to respond but I don't mind I understand. And then time with her boyfriend and blah blah blah. But again, that fucked with me. This put a thought in my head. 

Since my only other friend that physically lives in the same city as me is moving away, this offers me a few options. I've been in the mental gutter for a lot of other reasons, having to do with stress and putting immense pressure on myself. Because of this, I thought that a good thing to do could be rebuilding my life a little bit. Now, if my best friend does want to be my friend still, than good, she still bestest friend. And if not, I will have no obligation to my past life...I can rebuild my self...from the ground up....anew. 

Well, she ended up still wanting to be my friend. And turns out she didn't hate me, she just didn't know what to say and was really busy, understandable. But, the same thought was still in my head, she's stopping me from fucking rebuilding. But then again, I still have my best friend, so at least that I'm glad for that.

But since then I think I've just gotten worse. Im yearning to evolve my friendship with her, and I feel like I can't be friends or really comfortable with anyone besides myself. It's not helping that I feel fucking dumb that my stutter's becoming worse because of all my anxiety. And generally, I feel like blowing my fucking head out. I've been listening to this specific song over and over, that makes me never want to make friends again, so I don't have to feel like this I want to discuss the evolving friendship thing with her so bad but I don't want to bring it up, because during all these months, I've vented to her about all my feelings.

But, we're really alike. And one of those things is that we're more understanding than we think. And I want it to be a long, really thorough, conversation. I want to hear her thoughts, and vice versa. And I want to work with her with this, because we're friends. 

That is, all I can think of right now. If I'm reminded of anything I'll put it in through an edit. Also, if you guys actually want to hear what made me break with her boyfriend, I think I could, it's just that it's a bit weird and honestly, I'm fearing being judged a bit. But if someone asks me than I'll just suck it up and confess. 

I can't come up with a TLDR for this, because there's just so much detail that I feel I can't compound it down really, the title really explains everything, at least in my view.

I'd appreciate it so so so much if any of you read the entire thing, for that I thank you. Sorry if there's any grammar errors though, I'll edit them out as I notice. But, thank you guys  \^\^",11Oct2020,1
26,"I’m sorry, I’m sure everyone here has heard and even thought this a billion times before. I just feel like I haven’t made an positive impact on anyone’s life. I want to make people happy, but I can’t. I have such a hard time being vulnerable and expressing love even though I have so many feelings and I truly love my friends and family. I don’t know if they really care about me though. I only have 3 friends. I have so many thoughts and feelings I want to share, but I know they don’t want to hear it. Whenever I try and open up, it’s usually through text so it’s possible they just don’t see it but they always ignore me. There are so many things I want to talk about and I have nobody with whom to talk about them.

I feel like if I express my true self it’ll be too depressing for them. I’ve tried to talk to them but whenever I tell them what’s on my mind they act like I’m weird or they brush it off and talk about something else. Nobody wants to hear what I have to say. Not even my parents. When I’m alone with them they only talk to each other. They don’t even ask me how school is going and they ESPECIALLY don’t ask how I’m feeling or what’s on my mind. It’s like I’m invisible to everyone. When I die, nobody will even miss me.

I haven’t seen my therapist in a long time so I am going to make an appointment with her as soon as I can. But I really wish I could talk to my friends and family, not just her. I live with 6 other family members. I am surrounded by people, yet I feel so alone. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m so lonely and depressed.",11Oct2020,1
27,"Mental health is a very complicated subject. Don't try one thing and give up because it doesn't give you the result you want. Many of us have such deep-rooted traumas that we'll need to do a lot more to undo the influence we've had.

Visualization: [https://imgur.com/IFnFolz](https://imgur.com/IFnFolz)

**Level 1: Mindfulness: emotion and mood trackers.**  

For 30+ years, my goal was to suppress my emotions. It's my naive attempt at keeping my cool.  Our emotions are the windows to understand ourselves. They tell us what we care about and what we fear. So we can deal with them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Level 2: Self-care: exercise, diet, meditation, journaling, iCBT, ACT.**  

Instead of blaming ourselves, reframe old beliefs, improve physical health, or allow ourselves to do nothing.  It's okay. There is plenty of time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Level 3: Therapy: talk therapy, group therapy, CBT, DBT.**  

If anxiety, stress, or depressive thoughts become out of control, find help.  There are many professionally trained and empathetic therapists who are willing to help.  It's not normal to feel life is pure suffering.

&amp;#x200B;

**Level 4: Growth: goal setting, coaching, learning.**  

When all the self-doubts and self-blame are cleared, you'll want to have something to look forward to, something to work towards.  We become curious and resilient when we know what we live for.

&amp;#x200B;

**Level 5: Productivity: habit, prioritization.**  

Productivity is easy when we don't limit ourselves. Whatever we want to achieve, we can execute without feeling internal resistance.  We're willing to do what it takes to reach our goals. Implementing productivity hacks becomes easy.

Obstacles no longer seem like evil spirits trying to stop us, but merely problems we need to solve creatively.  We'll reach an equilibrium between happiness and productivity.",11Oct2020,1

 But, whenever i get a surge of strong emotions, ie. I get into an argument (idk how to deal with fights because i freeze), or someone gets mad at me for whatever reason, i get this very very very very strong urge to just go and end it, i have all my meds here, i'm a medical student, i know how many pills it takes to be lethal.

33,"
Ok so I think I have quite a long history so I'll just cut it short. I won't go into detail about any emotional stuff in the past but I will talk about how I feel currently (hope that makes sense, English isn't my first language) 

When I was in primary school, I would try to fit in with the popular girls a lot and do/say things that I thought would draw attention to me. E.g accuse someone of talking shit about another girl just so people could listen to me and gather around me (it made me feel proud but I'm obviously not proud of it now). 

I would do similar things up until I got into middle school, I got better, didn't do much of these things anymore but I'd do something different. I would text the seniors especially the senior boys and try to talk to them. I wouldn't flirt cuz obviously 11 year old me didn't know what flirting was. But I'd talk to them, message them everyday and pretend like I was close friends with them. Sometimes this would happen with some senior girls. My friends didn't buy the fact that I was ""close friends"" with the seniors but for some reason it made me feel cool. 

Then when I first got in high school (15 years old) I guess my efforts got me a boyfriend. This bf was emotionally abusive which lead me to seeking support from one of my guy friends. I was pretty close with this guy, we ended up being intimate and I cheated. The relationship between my ex and I got worse, he cheated to get back at me and we continued to date for a year after all those things happened. Along the way, there was name calling, emotional black mail coming from him etc. He would purposely flirt with the girl he cheated with just to make me feel like shit, while I blocked out all my friends so I could ""prove"" to him that I could dedicate myself to him 100%. 

After we broke up, I felt the need to hook up w a bunch of guys just to ""get my freedom back"" but that ended up in me feeling like crap. This was the beginning of the second phase of me doing weird shit that people will make fun of me for OR labelling me. In this case, I was labelled as the slut that nobody wanted to truly date. 

I had mental health problems along the way even after the breakup with my ex. I was diagnosed w depression and anxiety during the time with my ex. So I guess it continued along the way. 

The last time I hooked up with someone random, got me into a relationship which apparently ""wasn't real"" according to the guy. He cheated on me during the weekend with another girl who I thought was my friend and we broke up. After this, I'm not sure about the reasoning behind it but I tried to overdose on pain killers. My family found me, I went to the hospital, came back to school, and even more severe labelling continued. 

People who I didn't even know came up to me offering support which I knew wasn't genuine. Dumb kids from the years below would come up to me and make jokes about me self harming. People said I faked my attempt which makes me feel like crap. 

After all this, I started becoming reckless. If anybody at school had an issue with me, I wouldn't really hesitate to confront them or fight with them about it. I often offered to confront people for my friends cuz I ""didn't have anything else to lose"". I said this a lot. I remember. 

After all of this, I have had a few of my old friends tell me I've changed and stopped being friends with me. I know some kids from my high school say I'm problematic and all, cuz of all the ""faking"" etc. my ex definitely makes fun of me behind my back. I just have a bad reputation. 

In terms of friends and family currently, it's all good. I have a tight group of friends either from my school or university. And I have a boyfriend who actually treats me really well. My mental health has gotten way better but the only thing left is that I keep getting flashbacks everyday at least once about the things that happened. It gets me in a really uncomfortable mood. Nobody mentions what happened in the past to me, but it's all in my head and idk how to get rid of it. I really really dread it.",11Oct2020,1

36,"I've been struggling with anxiety for the past few years. 2019 was a year full of major improvement and life changes. 2020 has certainly tested me. 

I've been finding myself being anxious more often in the past few weeks. I've also been catching myself singing and dancing mindlessly. This hasn't happened in YEARS! 

School has really been a source of anxiety for me. I love learning but school and due dates stress me out.

Today I'm finishing up a 7 week course. I started out the morning super happy. Two hours later, I was almost in years as I worked on one of my assignments. 

BUT I DID IT!!

Finishing that assignment gave me the encouragement I needed to get through my day. I was able to mostly keep my anxiety symptoms under control.

Now it's getting late. I just want to be done. I have one assignment left that I've been putting off for a week. I'm actually doing it and I caught myself dancing and singing while simultaneously feeling anxious.

40,"I started sertaline (Zoloft) a few weeks ago and other than the terrible mouth ulcer I developed around the same time I’ve mostly been fine... (the ulcer has remained unfortunately but that’s a separate issue and not the focus here).

Except now the very slight arrhythmia (was never properly diagnosed as they could never catch it, so I’m guessing it’s just a normal heart glitch or something) seems to have... evolved?

I now wake up a lot to random panic attacks, even at times I’d normally wake up anyway. So they don’t tend to interrupt sleep (it has happened but not primarily). Often I just wake up at a random time, get very disoriented and then boom panic attack. I’ve also started getting them randomly in the middle of the day, and I haven’t found a common factor for the stressor yet. 

The reason why I think (but am not sure) about it possibly being linked to my heart is because... it’s hard to explain in text but the sorts of situations where I’d notice that I’d also around the same times I have these sudden unexplained panic attacks. (Sorry I don’t know why grammar went weird there oops). And I have more of this arrhythmia things when I have the panic attack.

45,"Basically since the end of 2019 i try to get proper treatment for my mental health issues. But so far it has been one of the most frustrating things i have ever experienced. I just have no idea how to proceed and if i did something wrong or just have bad luck.

I live in Germany and im in my Twenties. I have been diagnosed with ADHD (primarily inattendive) as a child I also have some strange OCD and anxiety phases about every two to three years that i cannot really grasp but so far they are not my main problem.
For reasons i dont exactly know anymore i have never had actual treatment for that so i had to push through school and my first job without treatment or medication. 
Last year my life broke down. I had to quit my job because i was bullied because i was basically too unreliable because of my ADHD. Around that time i also developed a panic disorder and severe anxiety. 

As bad as that time was it was like a wake up call for me. I have read a lot about mental health and for the first time in my life learn about ADHD and mental health in general. I really want to adress my ADHD and my other issues and finally piece my life together and really work on my issues but for some reason i fail to get basic even treatment. 

As far as i know the way to get mental health treatment in Germany is as follows:

You go to your GP and tell him about you issues. He then links you to your health insurance. 

Your health insurance has to provide an appointment with a doctor specialized on your issues e.g. a psychiatrist or neurologist in case of adhd. The specialized doc then proceeds to work out a working treatment plan (for example i want CBT and ADHD medication).


So, far my nerve crushing journey is like this:

I talked to my GP and he linked me to my insurance. 
I got an appointment at a psychiatrist and told him my issues (At that moment i struggled with OCD like intrusive thoughts and anxiety and basically a stress induced burnout.) 
He concluded that it could be an onsetting Schizophrenic psychosis gave me promethazine in low dosage and sent me away. ( i had to wait two months on this appointment.)

After the medication didnt work at all, i went to my GP, again (because the next psychiatrist appointment was in like 3 months ) and he linked me again to my insurance and i got an appointment at another psychiatrist after waiting 2 months.

So after 4 total months of improper treatment i got an appointment at my second psychiatrist in a bigger insitution in my city. I told him my issues and he was really understanding. After listening to my situation he asked some questions and i felt like he knew exactly what he was looking for.
He diagnosed me with OCD and Anxiety combined with a stress induced panic disorder. 
He warned me about my old psychiatrist and that the treatment so far was total quackery. 
He explained how stress and anxiety play together and how he would try to treat it. 
We agreed on trying a low dose of the ssri Escitalopram wich has literally worked wonders. 
My panic attacks were gone about two months after that and my anxiety lowered slowly after i quit my job and the stress reduced. 

Unfortunately the second psychiatrist quit working at that institution and my second visit there was with a different doc. I had to wait for an aditional 4 months for that appointment amd the new doc seemed cold and wanted to get through the meeting fast. I told him that now that my anxiety is somewhat manageable i want to get  psychotherapy and work on myself. I also want to get treatment for adult adhd based on my diagnosis as a child.

He said that for psychotherapy there is no place left at this institution and for adhd i would have to see a neurologist to re evalue the diagnosis. He couldnt tell me how and where and told me i had to search on my own.

At this point i feel like i tried everything. 
I called multiple hospitals and neurologists and they all have no appointments.
Same with Psychotherapy, everything is full.
I tried to get an appointment via my insurance and saw a psychologist who seemed to understand my issues and wanted to offer me a CBT Therapy but cancelled the appointment due to „personal reasons“ after additional 3 month of waiting time.


This has been really tiring. Everywhere i ask i get either rejected because waiting lists are full or i have to wait like 6 months for an appointment that gets cancelled anyway. I have never been so frustrated with my life because i feel i need to solve my mental health issues befor i can move on fommmy current half time half paid job and get on in life. I REALLY REALLY want to work on myself but i dont know where to go anymore and im just stuck and depressed right now.

My whole life seems like it is stuck on a damn waiting list and i cant proceed and i promised myself that if another 6 months will go by like this, i will go tho the next ER, and just lay on the floor asking for help. Maybe then i will get some attention........

46,"Hey, I'm not 100% sure this is allowed but I wrote this poem today about an abusive ex of mine, and wanted to share just to throw it out there. 

 

*You*

I still feel you

Sometimes

Burning needles in my back

Yet my body is cold and alone

I wonder if you think

About all you did to me

How deeply you hurt me

And how much pain you caused

I doubt you do

You never cared about me then

So now I’m a memory to you

And you’ve moved on to another

The pain you inflicted

Will last me a lifetime

But for you, it’s nothing

Just another boy who couldn’t satisfy

You hurt my friend

Took his feelings and twisted

Turned him against himself

All to satisfy your desire for control

Do you regret what you did?

Do you feel any guilt for that?

Or do you sleep well at night?

Is it normal for you to hurt others?

Did you get what you wanted?

I know I didn’t, not in the slightest

You ended up right where you started

And I ended far worse than I began

You’ve become a boogeyman to me

A demon that is forever engraved in my past

A ghost I can never truly exorcise from my mind

A shadow behind every thought and every memory

And yet, despite all of that

I wonder if you think about me

If you regret how you treated everyone

Or if you’ve tried to become a better person

But I doubt that

You never admitted your mistakes

And you never cared for anyone else

You were only out for your self-interest

You never knew the pain you caused

But I’ll never forget it",11Oct2020,1

I once tried to hurt myself. About five years ago I was having a problem with getting into arguments with my supervisor at work. I was worried I would get fired. I started reading Aliester Crowley at the time and carved a large pentagram in my stomach and praying as I thought it would protect me from losing my job. I then suddenly quit got on a train and moved far away and started a new job.

Some reason I will be doing well at my job and out of nowhere I turn into an argumentative and crazy asshole. Not a happy guy like I expect with mania. I then will quit and start knew. It happens every couple of years and I do not understand why. I also go through depressive episodes. 

would a personality disorder better describe such a scenario or is the fact that it happens in intervals this behavior an indicator of bipolar disorder? 

I go from being known as super easy going to being known as crazy and everything falls apart. And I do not understand why it happens",11Oct2020,1
50,"I’m in college and my roommate just dropped out and left, and I don’t have any friends so I feel completely isolated. I’m an introvert but I still need interaction sometimes so being alone has really taken a toll on me in the past few days and this is the only place I could think of to reach out and possibly get any sort of help. 

On top of feeling depressed because I’m alone, I’m also not doing well in my classes so that really doesn’t help. My entire life has been dedicated to getting into college and doing well and now that I know I’m not prepared, nor have I ever been smart enough for something like this, I feel like a failure. It’s all just starting to get really heavy really fast and I don’t know what to do.

51,"My symptoms are high fever and a soree throat and today is the 4th day since i was first isolated in my room and my fever and sore throat are gone now but my flu is still present. Even tho i should be happy that im recovering, this little thought in my head wishes that i had covid so i can just die

My depression started at 2017 and during that time i kept cutting and crying all by myself, i was all alone and wanted to end my suffering so badly  that i even praying to God to let me die by December but it never happened. I recovered around March 2019 but it came back after a few weeks and now im desperate to bring back the short freedom and happiness that i felt from escaping this hell-like state. 

Now im currently wishing that my prayers would be answered this year so my family and friends can live a better life without a nuisance like me. I adore them, but i want them to be happier. I even listed all the things that would happen if i never existed and turns out that everyone around me would be happier, so mere comfort like ""They care about u more than u think"" and etc. won't affect me.",11Oct2020,1
52,"So this might be kind of a long post. I'm sorry about that. I'm not really looking for solutions. I'm just going to try talking about what has happened to me and hope it makes me feel better. I am an Army veteran. I served just under 10 years. I wasn't anything special. I was a Blackhawk mechanic. I was able to go most of my career without any major accidents or losses close to me. It wasn't until I came to my last unit I should have expected it. I was there for a day. I met a Warrant Officer as they had just got back from the field. He was a nice guy I helped him out to get his things together. We had a formation and went home for a long weekend. Monday was a grim day for the unit. This officer who has served honorably for several years took his own life. I knew him for one day. It was hard to grasp how to feel about it. Ultimately there was sadness. The pain for his family that he left. But I hardly knew him. This death really hit the unit hard. It was a sad month for us. But it wasn't the last. Fast forward 2 years later to Afghanistan. We are a few months in. The feeling is surreal. Almost like we shouldn't even be there. It's March and already hot. We are just trying to make it one day at a time. One night one of our NCOs is sent on an observatory maintenance flight. I had also known one of the crew chiefs on that flight. From the reports we were told they flew in a downdraft on the backside of a mountain. The amount of force pushing on the aircraft sent it to the ground. The force was enough that it killed everyone on board.  Five crew members were lost. Knowing almost half the crew personally was devastating. Then a few days later I had found out that one of my good friends from my first unit was shot down. I wasn't ever told for some reason. It happened a few years before this crash. So after finding out about that I was trying to change the mood for Easter. I and a civilian contractor were going to go around in a bunny costume and hand out candy shipped in from some very nice strangers. Just 2 days before Easter one of our favorite Warrant Officers has a heart attack. Minutes away from the best hospital in the world and we couldn't save him. I wish I could say this is the end of it. But after that deployment, it got even worse. One of my favorite NCOs had taken his own life. Even after all of this there was still hope in my eyes though. I always looked up at that time. I just didn't know how dark things were going to get from there. So I found a great group of friends and veterans on Facebook. I would pass the time each night getting in to long threads of comedic arguments with them. At one point one of the female admins had purposed a mock marriage between me and her. The thought of it had made several thousand other veterans jealous very quickly. This event lasted several weeks. It gained a lot of traction in the group. I gained several close friends. I kind of wish that I hadn't. One of them I spoke to often, almost daily. All of a sudden he was not there for a while. I didn't know it but he was planning his own suicide. He came back for a day or so. The next day we got the news he did it. Through this all I just wanted it to end. At this point, it seemed hopeless. I can't be close to anyone. I also found out that my mother had breast cancer. She was in the middle of chemo and treatment. It just felt like my world was closing in. I kept friends distant. I didn't want to be close to many people. My mother had fought cancer for 15 months. It was a losing battle. After surgery, cancer came back in her heart, lungs, and liver. The worst was the lungs. That's what killed her. How are you supposed to feel after watching your mother suffocate to death? With everything I had lost already, I just felt numb. I didn't know how to go on. Life is just different after that. I feel guilty sometimes. I feel empty most of the time. I feel grief all the time. It seems that for a while the weight was getting easier to carry. It was like I could manage everything. Most of everything was taken from me in 2 years. Aside from my mother. That was several years ago now. I seem to be slipping back down. Like I can't function anymore. I'm in my last year of college. I am doing really well. Except for these last few classes. I can't seem to grasp anything on the assignments. I'm supposed to be doing one now. I just can't focus on doing it at all. I want to do it. I stress about doing it. I get anxious about doing it. When it comes time to do it I can't. I don't know what to do. I'm scheduling more appointments I guess. I don't think I can work in the field I'm going to college for. Who would hire a coder who can't even turn in assignments on time? Probably not many at all. Especially since this job is so fast-paced.",11Oct2020,1
53,"When I turned 13 I was excited, I heard it was so much fun to be a teen. It isn’t though. I’m 14, so I could be naive. But it seems the Only thing I’ve gotten out of being a teen is heartbreak, loneliness, and negative thoughts. These negative thoughts used to be sometimes, but now they happen basically on a schedule.

54,"As far as my personal experience, I’m still in the early stages of this rotted brain matter, but for people like me with minimal family and silent friends until they need something, how do you pull yourself out of this isolation, much less gravitate toward a support group that fits? I know it may be a try on make sure it fits kind of journey, but something as simple as “reaching out” and extending arms to groups can be very taxing on a person who doesn’t respond to texts, refuses to make plans with friends, or simply cannot handle the stimulation that verbally socializing entails.

56,"Heyo! I posted this to r/relationship_advice also.

So my parents were emotionally/verbally abusive, very poor at giving any affection (don’t remember them ever hugging me as a child, or any other physical touch), had anger issues and overall were not there for me emotionally.

I’ve been in and out of therapy for about 5 years now, and started taking Prozac last year. I’ve found that therapy has helped me a ton. Every time I stop going my mental health declines.

Some things I struggle with are depression, social anxiety and c-ptsd.

My boyfriend has made several comments throughout our 6 month relationship that have been unsupportive and downright disrespectful when it comes to my mental health. He’s said that he was raised to believe people who struggle with their mental health are “weak.” 

The other day in particular was a rough day for me. I was feeling really bad about myself for no reason, just one of those days. I was crying a bunch and wanted to leave his house and be alone. He had had enough of me being dramatic I guess and said something along the lines of *he would understand my struggles if I had been like physically abused or molested or abandoned or tortured or something but my parents “just yelled at [me] sometimes.”*

I asked if he thought I was weak. He said “don’t make me answer that.”

I don’t know what to do. Everything else in our relationship is perfect except for this. Mental illness runs in my family so I’m also just predisposed to these things, so even if I had a perfect childhood I could still be struggling with mental illness. He doesn’t understand that and seems to think I’m making up my mental illness?? He straight up said “you don’t have depression.” Even though I was recently diagnosed by a psychiatrist. 

*SIGH* help me out Reddit. Is this relationship worth saving? Can I reason with him? 

TL;DR boyfriend thinks I’m making up mental illness because I wasn’t severely abused and thinks I’m weak and over dramatic. He doesn’t understand that anyone can develop a mental illness even if they weren’t abused and refuses to believe my diagnoses. Is this relationship worth saving??",11Oct2020,1
57,"I was a happy and outgoing kid until about 9 years old when I experienced some traumatic stuff in school during the fourth and fifth grade. After that I struggled with my mental health, but managed to bring myself back to being generally. But four years ago I had another traumatic experience and ever since then I have not been able to reel myself back in. I’m good at putting on a happy face, so most people don’t know that I’m struggling. I have moments of happiness as most people do, but my overall mood is sad, negative, and I’m much more introverted. 

These last four years have been so hard and I sincerely worry that I will never be happy again. I take antidepressants for my depression and anxiety, and I see a therapist (something I’ve done on and off for about 3 years), but I don’t feel any better. The thought of living another 50/60 years feeling the way I do now is unbearable.

I had my initial psych evaluation recently and was diagnosed bipolar and put on abilify. During that appointment, I answered a 9 question questionnaire, which I'm assuming was the phq-9 as that has all the same questions I answered on that form.

60,"This started when I was young. I would learn a new curse word and I would get this kind of narrative in my head that if I didn't type it and almost send it, then somebody who I loved would die. When I was 10 I remember I learned the F word and typed ""fuk yu"" in a chat to my dad (trying so hard to do what I had to do but not actually write fuck you) and accidentally actually sent it. Somehow I was able to lie my way out of that one. Throughout high school, these compulsions bothered me and I'd occasionally write some garbage  like ""bitch fuck you"" and then hit the send button in a way that it wouldn't send and then delete it. However, this didn't happen too often because I was so anxious about other things that I would immediately find something to fixate on that distracted me from my current distress and gave me a new distress. 

Recently, as things in my life have actually been getting low key better, this urge has come back. The worst part is that it happens to me when I'm a teaching assistant in a text-based class for high schoolers. A few classes ago I just had to type the F word in the chat and then I deleted it. I was shaking for the next 80 minutes of the class thinking about how horrible it would be if I had accidentally hit the send button. More recently, the narrative started developing in my mind that I had to type some racial slur into the box or someone who I loved would get seriously ill  and somehow out of desperation, almost in tears because of what I thought I would have to do, I managed to twist that developing narrative into if I DID type a racial slur into the box then someone who I loved would get seriously ill. It took a lot of effort and I had physical pain during that process. Last night during a video call with a bunch of friends I had a similar urge to speak with curse words and I bit into my hand and said all the curse words I had to really quietly to get rid of the urge. During all of these situations, I have this narrative in my mind that if I don't do it, someone who I love will get seriously ill, die, etc. 

I'm scared that I'll succumb and make a mistake and am wondering if anyone knows what this is and what kind of coping mechanisms/resources I can use to navigate all this. I am really scared of accidentally hurting someone. I've started to talk to a new therapist recently, and I am currently struggling to open up.",11Oct2020,1
61,"I feel like I need to be doing a lot more but I have literally zero motivation for everything.

My grades are so bad I think I'm failing 2 of my classes and barely passing/almost failing 2 more. I have literally no motivation at all and can't pay attention in any of my classes and literally never do any work. I need to get my grades up to at least Cs and Bs by finishing the shit ton of missing assignments I have or else my parents are gonna get mad. I used to be such a good student my freshman year but now I just don't care anymore I'm just trying to get through it.

And I need to do this while managing my time with working part-time but I have to keep working or else nobody else will have a job at my house and I won't be able to get a car and get out of my house sometimes, I hate it there.

It's even worse because its October and everywhere I see people together, but it's literally impossible to talk to girls online and the only girl I had a real chance with is dating someone now. And I have almost none of the confidence I had anymore at all. I just want to be with someone who appreciates me.

And all of this makes life just alot worse, all I can do is keep this all to myself and vent on an app. I can't vent with my friends because my situation is nowhere near as bad as some of theirs and I'm supposed to be the rock emotionally. So theres just so much I know I have to do but I have no motivation for anything anymore. Idk how I feel.

62,"I hope I'm posting the right thing to the right subreddit in the right way. If not, I apologize in advance.

21 year old guy, been single for several years now. Mostly by choice. When it comes to being attracted to people, I typically exhibit the same patterns.

I'm generally rather obsessive, overanalyzing text messages, thinking about how long it takes them to respond, paying attention to their tone of voice when they say things to me to try and gauge them, and so forth. I put a great deal of emotional weight on the person, so while ethically I can comfortably go ""Yep, that's their right if they don't feel the same way I do"" But then I will be immensely depressed. This makes sense to me for someone I'd fall in love with, but I can be this way about a girl I barely know.

It's like I'm just so lonely that I'm quick to throw all my stock into whether or not someone feels the same way, I just go all in based on nothing, over and over. If I try and be not all in, I then have an issue knowing if I'm even attracted to them in the first place.

Back in high school, I had a couple instances of me being this really emotionally unstable boyfriend, and whatever poor girl I was dating (assuming they werent also unstable in some way) would often be in ground zero of my self-made melodrama, because I'm often insecure in a relationship. 

Since then, every time I'm attracted to somebody, it feels like I make an ass of myself because I again just end up falling in love with somebody I barely know based on very little (I usually fall for movie tropes, like ""what a romantic way for us to have met"" and shit). It feels like because of my weird obsessive nature probably juiced up by however 21 year old dude hormones are affecting it, any time I'm attracted to somebody, I'm in the position of needing to hold back my feelings just to comfortably engage the person. But then I'm bottling shit up, festering, and that leads me to weird insecurity based on nothing.

So, because of this, I've remained single. Seems unwise to date someone if I can't get a grip on my own weird manipulative obsessive insecure clingy behaviors. However, the obvious problem with that is, I relentlessly hate being single and crave intimacy. I worry that because of my long standing loneliness, I am perhaps lowering my standards, which I feel is the opposite direction I should be going. My understanding of this point in my life, especially with how I feel about things, is the whole ""I need to learn to love myself before I can love others"". 

So that's what I've been aiming to do. It's taking time, but I'm in the perfect environment to cultivate healthy self-care habits, I'm exercising, I'm keeping myself and my living space clean, I'm learning healthier foods I can eat, I'm drinking more water, I'm trying to get myself to get more sun, trying to read more instead of staring at screens all day, and trying to foster healthier relationships with my friends and family. But godfucking damn it all, the one thing that's missing at the end of the day is someone to share it with. 

The thing is too, because of my stance on the pandemic, and with how it seems like it's going to progress, I'm 99% sure I'm not going to date any time soon even if I let myself. 

Basically, I'm asking advice on how can I reduce my obsessive behaviors so that I'm less dependent on a relationship, and that I can not spiral into a 3 day depressive episode just because that pretty girl I liked didn't like me back.

He explains his reasoning behind his beliefs but they all seem to make zero sense or I am able to give him a logical and justified answer to everything he believes is going on. It seems everytime he miss understand the situation and believes what are saying is about him when it actually everytime has nothing to do with whatsoever. I’ve had countless conversationss with him recently trying to help him understand we all love him and no one would try to hurt him whatsoever. He is in full denial I’m telling the truth and thinks there is going to be some grand finale leading up to everything. He also thinks that people are taking photos and recording him all the time. And me telling him unrelated stories about things is my way of teaching  him a lesson. He also keeps saying he has fucked up thoughts and I would think his crazy if he told me. I’m so worried about him and just want to help him and prove to him that everything he thinks is going on is completely not true. I’ve told him that he needs to tell me everything he feels and I want to help him. But can’t if his too embarrassed to tell me what’s he thinks is going on. He does smoke weed fairly often and it seems to Be the times where he feels attacked. I asked him but he says he feels like this evens when his sober and picks up on all the little jokes we makes about him. When everytime it’s not even close to being even a little about him. He is also in a very toxic relationship with a gf that’s doesn’t like us due to us calling her out on her Shitty treatment of her boyfriend. Who knows what she could be saying to him. Can anyone provide me with some ideas and tips help my friend and get him back to his normal happy and excited energy.

69,"I’m not the best writer but I’m really hoping to get some advice. My life has been an up and down spiral of anxiety, depression, insecurities, and over thinking, it always has. I have been in 4 more “serious” relationships the 23 years I have been alive and they all end the same way.... I’ve been cheated on every time. It’s making me feel like I’m not good enough nor will ever be good enough for anyone. I don’t feel pretty enough and when I put makeup on I wonder if I have too much on or see other girls did theirs better, I have a high metabolism so I’m skinny, healthy weight for my age mind you, but I still want and feel as though I need to put on a little weight but as soon as I do put on a couple pounds I feel like I’m getting fat. I have been in my current relationship for about two years now and about a month ago we got into a fight. It was over a very stupid subject but I have been an emotional wreck for some time now because I had just had a miscarriage so the mood swings were worse than normal. I had to work third shift that night and left while we were fighting, he went to some party over at a buddies and brought another girl home. He was acting funny all night, not answering phone calls or texts like he usually does and I freaked out and called him about a hundred times. After I finally got sick of it I left work to go to the party just to talk and see what his problem was, about half way home I get a phone call from my girlfriend that says he brought another girl home and I need to come to her house right away and don’t worry about it. Of course I didn’t listen and went over there anyways. I screamed, I kicked, I hit, I went full crazy mode. After a couple days I decided to give him another chance because I know that I truly do love him more than anything in this world. I wasn’t going to but we sat down and talked about it as I was moving some of my stuff out of the house. He cried and begged to not leave him and give him another chance and by the things he said I truly believed he would change I mean I’ve never seen the man like this in the two years we’ve been dating. So here we are getting along great, this is honestly the best we’ve been since the first 8-9 months we started dating but I still get the feeling he is talking to other girls and I notice I am overthinking things a lot... things that aren’t happening. He goes out for boys night and I still think something is going to happen even though he is texting me the whole night along with sending me videos constantly on Snapchat. I work third shift and have nothing better to do where I work than be on my phone (yes it is boring😂) as I’m going through social media I see he is liking a lot of other girls pictures and this is where the insecurities come into play and I don’t think I’m pretty enough or good enough for him. As I overthink I wonder if he’s texting those girls that he’s liking pictures of, or lying to me about who he’s with and I just end up lashing out on him and freaking out which of course leads to an argument I really, truly am not trying to start. It’s really starting get to me and I am truly trying my hardest to change the overthinking part and try to give him a little more slack and trust him more with certain things because he really is proving himself and changing his toxic traits but I can’t seem to stop mine. I could really use some advice of ways I can stop overthinking everything and trust him more because I want to more than anything.

I’m a jealous emotional mess and I feel like I’m straining my relationship. How messed up is it to want to cry anytime they are with friends. Why do I feel like this?? 

Sometimes I even fantasise about getting into an accident or someone murdering me. I would never kill myself and I’m not suicidal but I can’t help to keep thinking about these scenarios where all the pressure would be gone. Even getting into a serious accident would be enough so that I could just do nothing but sit there and not feel guilty about it.

79,"Recently I’ve been very uneasy being around people even my family, it used to be a rare occasion. I would describe myself as a shy and nervous person I’ve been thinking about it for a while and the feelings I used to feel were definitely normal they weren’t paranoid or even anxious feelings but I think what I’m feeling is almost schizophrenic these feelings are extremely intense. There had been an occasion where I thought someone was going to snipe me (let me explain) I remember seeing a green dot on my wall (it was in no way real)and the only thing I could think of was dying all I thought was I am going to die I thought without reason that someone wanted to kill me and all I could do I silently sob in my bed. Another occasion took place where I woke up and was doing my thing for about an hour and suddenly the feeling that someone was watching me, waiting for me I hid in my bathtub for an hour  trying to find something to calm me down but all I could do is rock back and forth. I’ve been having these feelings for about a month and have been religiously checking under my bed around my house and outside my house. Whenever these feelings come over me I lose the ability to reason and sometimes even talk. I’m very scared. I’m a student right now and school is only making it worse every time I pick up my laptop I feel like I’m being watched.

I know this sounds dramatic and some may respond with things like “give it time, be positive” and stuff like that but please I have heard it all before. Please do not dismiss what I’m saying. I get trying to be positive and encouraging but I’m tired of people invalidating what I’m saying. I said what I said. 

I do not love. I don’t anyone in this world, never had. I don’t love myself and I don’t even love God (grew up religious and this is supposed to be the greatest love). I have family that I honestly do not love and feel nothing towards. If my parents or siblings died tomorrow, it wouldn’t mean anything to me. I just don’t feel emotions like that. I mean last week my little sister tried to kill herself. True story guys. And even in the middle of all that I just deep down inside didn’t care. I gave the impression that I cared and I was greatly impacted but honestly on the inside I knew I was pretending and the emotions I was expressing were not genuine. It’s like I’m always putting on a show. I feel like there is genuinely something wrong with me. Theres a disconnect, something is off. What do I do?",11Oct2020,1

85,"This is my second night that I can’t sleep all I do is sit outside at night and stare blankly at the red yellow and green hues that hit the car when the street light changes this is when I’m alone with my emotions. Today I held my composure and took the kids out to do things it was all good and kept my mind busy but till I got alone with my emotions..
All I think about is how numb I feel. I honestly feel like inside there’s nothing but darkness and there’s only the smallest candle lit which is the only reason to keep on. My daughter Idk . Like yeah I have goals and aspirations but they were never just for me they were always for her to make sure her future and her family are taken care of. The reason is enough to keep living but why do I still feel so god damn dark . Why do I feel like everything that I accomplished isn’t even good enough. I. Feel as if my mind is stuck in a small bird cage circulating thoughts .I’ve been drinking daily since Rach died just enough to not think of my emotions. Idk how to take it . I can’t even explain how I feel . I can’t comfort others grieving because idk what I’m doing .How can you get comfortable with never seeing someone again.? How can you go into an old place and not think of how painful that the next time you see someone could be your last ? I’m never going to create anymore memories with them, I’m never going to hear their laugh, see their smile, hug, or be able to see them again. All the songs and memories.  Than Mad dies , same way. I’ve cried a few times but I can’t make tears I’m just dry heaving for air that feels so thick to breathe .. why are they taken from us.. why do I feel like I’m just here..  why do I stare off into the abyss thinking absolutely nothing. I have no train of thought . I’m heartbroken. I never really experienced a death as hard as these 
The darkness leads me to think deeper I can’t get images out of my head from my ex either. I keep daydreaming of him beating me and dragging me into the the hotel room where I lived for almost a year.. I keep remembering driving down the highway at 3 am and him saying “you’re going to die tonight” while going 90 mph with the passenger door open..
I remember using my toes to hold the door shut while holding onto the head rest on the seat to keep me in the car .. “I never loved you” “I dont feel anything and don’t even want you to touch me” but with those same words ask why I don’t show him I love him and show him affection. I can’t get these outta my head. I want to let go I want to forgive.
I can’t even get the thought of my biological father seeing me almost daily and never says hello. I drive past the house I grew up in everyday and all I feel is sadness. I feel sad that you will never get to see your grand child progress with her life , I feel sad that you gave me up and put myself into foster care with my child and missed out on everything I accomplished. I overreached so many things you thought I couldn’t .
How do I break an emotional abuse habit of blocking my emotions and hiding them away to the point when I get upset I never know what is actually bothering me ? It eats me alive . I don’t know what to do or how to feel like myself. 
I don’t even know if I am who I really am . Like I know I am sorta but like which all the trauma what is currently stopping me from becoming a better version of myself ?

I was diagnosed with PTSD, depression, and anxiety over my life span. I’m 23 now and I’ve been with my boyfriend for about a year now. He live together and are around each other all the time. Sometimes I have these waves of sadness where all I want to do is sleep on the couch and watch movies and cry, not for any particular reason. It just happens. And my partner think I’m upset at him or that he’s done something wrong but nothing is wrong. Some days I just feel like zoning out. How do I manage this?

87,"Ima get str8 to the point. I feel like a toxic individual that’s gets taken for granted and is viewed as less of a human being. 

I’ll admit I have issues with being social 8/10 of the time where I’ll either act awkward and fidgety or I’ll tend to go out of my way to impress friends and other individuals just to try and seem different... the end results I’m just seen as annoying and/or extra. 

Most times I find myself either carrying a conversation with someone then often times end up being cut off quickly OR getting lost and forgotten in group conversations to the point nothing I say even matters. The only time I feel relevant to anybody is when I’m being asked for a fucking favor. “Can you do this?” “Can I borrow that?” “Can you hold this for me?” “Can you go there for me?”

My feelings tend to be ignored quite often and I truly don’t know how to feel about that. I thought that in M U T U A L friendships, common energies are supposed t be exchanged, but ffs I feel like anyone I talk to pretends to listen and tries to seem like they’re somewhat interested in what I have to say, but let it be literally anyone else, they get treated like gold. I’m simply seeing the worst in the vast majority of all my “friends” 24/7 and I always end up wondering what’s wrong with me because they’re so energetic and hyperactive with everyone else.

When I’m upset and need someone to vent to, I literally only have ONE person to vent to ever besides a therapist, cuz everyone else will view me as “too emotional” or “crazy

I don’t talk to anyone regularly but one person, and convos with that person are starting to grow stale- other than that my notifications stay dry, I almost don’t even need my phone to be honest with all of y’all. 

But at the end of the day, I want to address this kind of shit through creating art (digital art at that) and I need better understanding of what I’m going through said in different words that make more sense to me than my own if that makes any sense? And if anybody has any ideas on how I can create specific art addressing these said issues please let me know I’d be happy to discuss that",11Oct2020,1

89,"I (26 M) recently begun to suspect that I may be displaying signs of one if not several personality disorders and￼ this realization is deeply conflicting me as to whether or not I should seek help. I know the obvious answer is if I have to ask the question then yea probably, but the past few weeks or so I’ve actually felt motivated to make major positive (or so I think) changes in my life for the first time and I feel pretty confident that I can stick to them. Additionally, I started to embrace my desire to avoid social interaction and now feel content to just be by myself focusing on my hobbies and new interests like exercising and trying to care more about my physical health as well.

So I guess my question is: am I on to something here just doing what I think makes me happy on my own or is that a recipe for me to have a terrible life by leaving myself to my own devices? Is there any chance therapy could interfere with the sense of self I’m finally beginning to develop? Honestly just any advise would be great, I’ve neglected my mental health my entire life so I’m trying to approach this as open-mindedly as possible.

I’ve had a couple people tell me I’m destined for greatness and that I’m gonna change the world but I just can’t get out of my own bubble no matter what I do or how much time I put in for my mental health I always end up at the same point wanting to end my life. I don’t have a plan or anything but the burden of life just seems to much at times.

I just wanna open my eyes and start my life cuz I’ve been just stuck in this little bubble my whole life and no matter how many people tell me I’m awesome or handsome or caring I just can’t see it. I see myself as this scumbag kid that doesn’t want to grow up. I just can’t learn I don’t know why I just can’t wake up. I’ve had so many dreams but I haven’t chased one. People would kill to be in my position but I just have no motivation to grow as a person. To me I see myself as psycho. I used to hallucinate and I didn’t know what was real and what wasn’t this started randomly and I’m scared if I go to far down the rabbit hole it will start again. I’m on medication for this but it’s scary cuz sometimes I question myself even after how many times and how many people have told me it’s my manic depression.

94,"So a few months ago i watched a video about some with OCD and i realized how much i related to the symptoms this person was experiencing but i brushed it off. This morning i listened to a mental health podcast talking about OCD, and when this person described their symptoms i felt so recognized. There are a few things about me that i have always felt very i guess... alone in? Not in a bad way necessarily i just didn’t realize this was something other people experience. So can this mean I might have OCD?
The person said that if someone were to punch them on one shoulder they would need to punch themselves on the other shoulder or they would be very uncomfortable, which i relate to very much. If i touch something i have to touch it on the other side or else i feel uncomfortable. Another thing he talked about is how he has to touch the corner of an object when touching something or we won’t be able to stop thinking about it which i VERY VERY much relate to, i have to touch all the corners of objects i touch and all of the outline w my finger or i’ll go back and do it later, there are some acceptions like i won’t trace in entire bookshelf, but i’ll trace the shelf. Also when like grabbing something from like a cubby i have to touch the corners all the way in the inside. If i’m watching a video i get uncomfortable when people don’t touch the corners/edges of things. I always have to make myself think about other things while watching things to distract myself from a character not touching the edges. Another example
of symmetry; i make transition videos like the edits you see on instagram and if i see a transition video where it slides to the right twice but only once to the left it makes me very uncomfortable, or if it spins a certain direction many more times than the other direction. Idk if this is all normal and i’m overreacting but idk it just stood out to me when listening to the podcast. 
If you do think i should get tested how should i tell my mom? i am asian and my family never talks about mental health. it isn’t very taboo but i know my mom wouldn’t be happy if i asked her to get tested for OCD. i’m sure she’d think i’m asking for attention or that i’m crazy. My mom doesn’t know i cut but when she found out i dig my nails into my skin she lost it. She got so upset and told me i was mental and looked like a crazy person with the nail marks on my arm, and told me i looked homeless. I think she just cares more about what other people think if i’m being honest.
I don’t want to self diagnose so this post is really only to help me come to the conclusion whether there is a possibility, so i could think about actually getting tested.",11Oct2020,1
95,"All my life, I was bothered by certain sounds, like some piano notes that actually hurt my brain when I'm listening to piano songs, some notes make me feel like lightening struck my brain, or when someone slams a cabinet door i feel like my ears will explode.

People talking too loud bother me, most of the time, especially my mom, I dont even think she's speaking too loud ( on the phone ) but it hurts my brain and her voice makes me wanna scream and cover my ears. I cant stand the sound of chewing I cant focus on anything when I'm with people who are eating, I chew so quietly with my mouth closed and I wish that everyone did the same.

 I used to sleep in the same room as my little brother when he was a child and his breathing drove me crazy I used to cry myself to sleep because of it, or I just left the room. I had to sleep with my mother this summer, and her breathing drove me wild ( and she snores from time to time ) I went to the bathroom and slept in the tub because we were in a hotel.

At night I can hear the refrigerator motor running, but I soon forget about it, and when it stops, I feel like someone was holding my head so tight and released it, I feel so relieved its such a weird feeling.

I can't focus during the day, I always had a hard time focusing at school, I listen to teachers for 5 minutes and zone out, still happens in university. I just stopped trying and recently found out that I work best at night, so I have been pulling all nighters to work. I can do so many things at night and can actually focus to a certain extent, 80% better than during the day.

Does anybody relate to this? I'm starting to think that I have ADHD but I live in a small city and doctors arent so great here so I sont really know what to do.

96,"In around May-ish, my girlfriend has developed episodes that would cause her to not act like herself and would constantly try to self-harm during it, say obscene things, and just overall not herself. She describes it as someone else living inside of her taking over and she has no control over what's going on and is only watching. Usually, she forgets what happens afterward unless reminded of what happened during it. She went to the hospital and got put on medication and it worked really nicely for her and the doctors said she has schizophrenic traits but did not officially diagnose her but after some time after she ran out of medication and she never got back to who she was referred to and it seemed to have gotten worse and more violent. I recently moved to where she is finally because we were long distance for a bit and handling her episodes in person feels extremely overwhelming. I have to physically restrain her from her hurting herself and she would sometimes try and hurt me by trying to choke me and threaten to hurt me if I don't let her go, she never actually goes through with it but having that happen in general and how she talks to me when it happens and seeing all the bruises on me after trying to keep her safe hurts me a lot. I understand it's not her fault and she feels immensely guilty about it afterward but I still feel horrible and it's been happening almost every day and I feel so exhausted in so many ways and I just moved here and I just feel lost. I'm starting to feel depressed again, I still need to get a state I.D and a job to get a therapist for in general things but I'm not sure how to even deal with my own emotions during the meantime. I try and journal as often as I can, do square breathing/meditation, take CBD oil, and go for walks and hang out with friends. I don't want her to feel like a burden, but at the end of the day, I still feel horrible from it. I just want it to be ok around each other without having to worry if she's going to have an episode and still feel depressed from her previous episodes. I did make her get in contact with the people she was supposed to be talking to a little while ago but the appointments are scheduled until the end of the month and I'm not sure how much longer I can do this until I lose myself. I'm trying to have her reach out to more people to get her medication and therapy as soon as possible but I'm not sure what to do with these intense leftover feelings. We also can't have her go back to any mental hospitals either because most of them are transphobic and just don't treat her well. I just don't know what to do about how I feel.",11Oct2020,1

98,"Since being prescribed 300mg of Venlafaxine, my sex drive is practically non-existent. My boyfriend, on the other hand, has a very high sex drive. My antidepressants were increased gradually and my sex drive has always been low but now I don’t seem to have one. 

My boyfriend is very touchy-feely when he’s “excited” and I let him fondle me etc. and sometimes, we do have sex but it’s very rare that I’m “in the mood” or I become turned on enough. I hate saying no and turning him down but I would also feel awful if I let him “have his way” when I didn’t feel like it. 

In past relationships, I’ve reluctantly had sex and despite crying and being visibly upset, they have carried on. I have never said no but I have expressed that I would like them to stop. My boyfriend, however, knows and can recognise when I’m uncomfortable and constantly offers me reassurance and asks if I’m comfortable enough and happy to carry on. I still feel so guilty for saying no, though. I’m really worried that eventually, he’ll snap or worse, he’ll go looking for somebody else. I know he would never cheat but as I have GAD, I always catastrophize and think of the worst possible scenario.

Like (graphic) the other day at school, he told me to take my glasses off and plunge the two sticks into (let’s call this kid Dave) Dave’s eye sockets, and then proceed to beat the hell out of him with my metal water bottle. He wanted me to use the water bottle to smash his face in, and use my hands to shovel his brain and stuff in his head into my mouth, until I can’t eat anymore. And then, fill my bottle up with his blood and drink even more, until I think I might actually be sick. He told me to paint myself red with (his words, not mine) *Dave’s sweet crimson liquid, a product of his anguish and my ecstasy and pleasure.* He said to them take off what’s left of his scalp and secure it to my head using my mask, and then he said I’d finally be free and that he would take me to the End. He said that I could finally be Gone. He doesn’t let me die right now; he’ll only let me die when I free myself. When I break out of the simulation. I just want to be Gone, so so so so so bad. My psychiatrist doesn’t understand how bad I need to. I would never, EVER follow through with his Whispers though. I would never hurt another person.

101,"I went through some shit when I was like 20 where my mental health changed for the worse. I’m 30 now and I’m happy to say my life has almost done a 180. I still have elements of depression but the manic episode side of things has improved (less severe and less frequent) with meds. 

It’s a long story but to put it briefly at the time I failed university, I messed up with a girl who I truly loved, I had a betrayal with some friends and some money for an event that had sentimental value. The last one seemed to be the one that tipped me over the edge. It wasn’t the money but I felt so wronged. That’s when I had my first manic episode. I wasn’t acting normal. Then after that it was like I froze and couldn’t talk for a long time. I just felt devastated and couldn’t function like I was used to. Before this I had a very happy childhood and stuff. I was doing well and I had a lot of friends etc. I used to just drink a lot and smoke weed. I guess I played too hard and didn’t work hard enough.

Does this seem like reasonable reasons to form a mental health illness? Considering I have no family history of bipolar",11Oct2020,1

Ok. So im a 14 year old guy. I was on omegle to kill sometime and i got horny (like all teenagers do). Plus i dont remember the last time i got a genuine compliment from someone (other than my family) and i wanted to feel validation. So i talked to some people and they sent a few pics. And i sent a few pics. I didnt think about what i was doing. But After a while i realized and stopped it. I just feel like the biggest fucking loser. I feel so dirty. Knowing that some guy now has pictures of me. Im just a fucking dissapointment to everyone in my life. I just wanted to remember what it feels like to get compliment from someone. And i know that most boys dont get compliments so maybe im just a massive pussy. I tried to talk about this on another Reddit Account but i god banned for ""sexualizing minors"". And people said that it wasnt weird because i was a boy and that its kinda normal. Am i overreacting? Am i just some pathetic attention seeker?",11Oct2020,1

I insulted her sister because of the way she treats my girlfriend and me but I was way too harsh and she leaked my number on her Snapchat story with the text. I sent her an apology and one of my girlfriend’s friends is suggesting indirectly that she should break up with me. She’s one of the few things I care about and if she does break up with me I’ll kill myself. I can’t mention it because it’ll get thrown back at me as manipulating her when I’m not. I may be in high school but this is the happiest I’ve ever been. She’s a good girl and she recognizes that I fucked up. She helped me write an apology that hasn’t gotten a response yet and she’s upset about the whole situation too. She’s not mad at me even though she has every right to be. I fucking hate myself and I really really fucked up. I hope her sister accepts my apology. If she tells their mom their mom will force her to break up with me. Like I said, she’s one of the few things I care about and she’s what makes life worth living. I will honestly commit suicide if she’s forced to leave me.

So I just finished school and got my bachelor's degree. Now I started my new job and it hit me really hard, real life begins now and I can't handle it atm. I'm really stressy and anxious all week. 
I don't know if I made the right study choice and I don't want to disappoint anyone around me. 
Atm i am feeling really unhappy. I'm waking up with a high heart rate . And atm I don't know what to do.

I hope I can get some tips on this.

It also shows the genetic aspect of mental illness and doesn’t romanticise depression either which I appreciate.

Im not embarrassed about crying I just can’t do anything without crying which is getting annoying.

All I want to do is to speak to someone about how I’m feeling before it gets any worse. I’ve tried getting professional help but there’s such a long waiting list due to everything in the world atm. I’ve tried speaking to my best friends where’s they’ve asked how I’ve been, and instead of the whole ‘yeah I’m good, you?’ I decided to tell them everything that’s been going on in detail, all I got was why didn’t you tell me, and I reply with I am now, as I never really wanted to speak about it. And that was the end of the conversation as it always moves on to them and their lives where I help them, I’ve also tell them I’ve spent the day crying where all they say is I’m ‘loosing it’ and I agree then the convo changes which makes me think they never really cared. 

The only other person I can speak to is my partner which I’d rather do in all honestly, he has depression so I don’t want to add my problems to his also. He knows I don’t blame him for pushing me away due to his depression, and I’ve listened to him with his thoughts without judgement when he’s ready to talk. But I’m ready to talk to him but don’t know how to go about it.

I just need someone, as the only person I talk to openly which I’m not ashamed of is mine and my partners dog, which we may have to get rid of soon just to end of lease on our property. I’m just under so much stress with no outlet, so it boils up and I then just cry.

112,"idk I just wrote this out for myself and thought I’d share—————Thoughts are just thoughts- so don’t worship them, let them pass, but don’t force them to pass. Sometimes the scariest part of anxiety taking it at the top of the thought, right when you’re starting to feel most anxious and petrified, where you feel worst, but if you keep working with it, the few moments after it can be the most beautiful, with practice. Instead of shutting it off and resisting it, causing yourself to feel what you focus, you can learn to accept them and let them go, and acknowledge them as just thoughts. By no means is it easy, but when you really dedicate yourself to putting the work in it’s one of the most rewarding things you can do for yourself.",11Oct2020,1

114,"Recently I've come to understand most of the reasons associated with my depression:

* I am lonely

* I am lonely because I am scared to talk to people

* I am scared to talk to people because I'm afraid of getting hurt by them

* I am afraid of getting hurt by other people because I've had many such experiences before

* My low self-esteem is a result of this and it feeds into this cycle making it worse

""I don't feel deserving of being looked at as human by other people. In my eyes I'm an alien, hated by everyone, wanted by no one. How could it be any dfferent? People are just barely tolerating my presence."" - Me, every day.

Where do I even beging unraveling this? I know that I feel better when I talk to other people but I'm deathly afraid of them, like they're out to get me. How do I break the cycle? How can I learn to feel well even when I'm on my own? It's like I have this abusive relationship with other people.

118,"I absolutely hate living and am sick and tired of constantly feeling like crap. To give you a brief overview of my life, I am a girl who is suffering from vision loss and has depression and anxiety. 

I spend the days just wasting away, secluding myself from everyone else around me. It’s so bad to the point where even seeing my family downstairs just absolutely sickens me, since I just hate being around people in general as a result of how low I feel. This has gotten especially worse since the beginning of lockdown, but my room has always been a place where I’m in solitude for most of the time. I use masturbation as a coping mechanism in order to find a sense of release, and have grown to be fully dependent on that to keep me from going off the walls and harming myself physically like I used to. Of course this isn’t the best way of dealing with it, but honestly it’s the only thing that gives me a sense of pleasure out of life and is the only thing I can gain enjoyment out of. 

In my life I’ve dealt with several hardships, including being bullied for my disability in school, both primary and secondary. In primary school it was just disrespectful teasing, but I was pretty lonely and had to learn to be fine with my own company. I was also sexually assaulted a month before I turned 11 years old by a man in a foreign country, which I have never told anyone besides my therapist and my (only) friend. I couldn’t tell my family because two years prior I was groped in a public place, and when I told my sisters they laughed and mocked me for it. 

Soon after the assault I dealt with bullying in secondary school for years (this time much worse than before), and it led me to almost commit suicide on several occasions because I was just done with everything. I only had (and still have) one actual friend, but for the first year of school we weren’t as close, which led me to try and seek friendship on the internet, leading me to be groomed by lots of older men over the course of 5 years into doing sordid things on camera. The mixture of being lonely and being bullied led me harm myself, masturbate out of distress everyday and cry almost all the time (which led to students and even a few teachers to not take me seriously when I would cry in school). 

Fast forward to now and I’m in university, extremely unhappy, and continue to feel alone, since I have zero friends here. I feel like I can’t talk to my family about the situation because they’re too optimistic and put an exaggerated spin on things just to try and reassure me. Some also tell me that I’m ungrateful because there are people that have it much worse than I do and that because I achieved good grades in school I didn’t have a right to feel down about myself. I occasionally speak to the one friend I have about how I’m feeling but only occasionally go into the full ins and outs of it, not because of lack of trust, but simply because I just don’t always have the energy to bring myself to discuss certain things. 

I wish I could just get to a point where I can feel happy with myself and embrace my disability, but I just don’t see that happening. I already feel like I’m going to not do well in university because I can’t bring myself to do the work provided despite studying a subject that I’ve always loved, it’s just that I don’t see the appeal in pretty much anything anymore. I’ve only been there for a couple of weeks but I already feel so behind and am considering dropping out at this point, purely because I can’t keep up with the demands of the course, and my course is very academically rigorous so it can only get more intense from here. I’m still in therapy and I still don’t find the current methods of it helpful at all, as it’s just exploring my thoughts and not coming up with an actual solution. I’m basically always told about how much I hate myself and that I’m always attacking myself, and I think to myself ‘no shit, how can I actually solve this?!’, i find it pointless but I do it only because I want to be able to talk to someone who isn’t incredibly optimistic or invalidates me without understanding. 

But to sum it up I feel like is a worthless, hopeless piece of shit and I’m tired of people being optimistic and wanting to keep me here. 

I honestly don’t know why I’m even posting this online as if anyone can even help me, I just really needed to vent somehow and get my emotions out somewhere.",11Oct2020,1

I found out that its actually been an issue even before the pandemic occurred. Hence, i wanted to do my part in solving the problem and started to brain storm different ways I could.

After attempting to help some of my own friends in the situation, I found out that the main reason for loneliness and anxiety is because the person dealing with it, quite literally, lacks the energy to reach out for help.

122,"I have heard about trying to appreciate what you have so as to feel better, but it does the opposite of me. I always end up feeling more sad and frustrated that there are people out there who don't have food and are born in a third world country. 

It is not limited to this. My brain seems to be divided, with my subconscious always judging it. If I get angry on something, I feel angry and guilty for being angry. I'll always beat up myself for something which I have done in the past. Luckily I don't feel like harming myself physically.

Then there is fear. Although I am not very religious, there is still a part of my brain fearing it. I get scared many a times that what if things like heaven/hell/rebirth exist and I get fucked. My brain plays 'what if' scenarios and I hate them. 

When I'm happy these things don't happen to me (or I brush them, idk) but the moment I get sad/angry all these thoughts come running to my mind and I start guilt tripping and hating myself.

124,"So recently, life has taken a very bad turn and I've found myself in a position where I don't really know what to do, life feels meaningless. About a month ago, I broke my thumb on my right hand. I play (played now) basketball and loved it, so I told my mum id push through it and continue playing with it heavily strapped and supported. It wasn't a major break, so it wasn't a big deal. In an unfortunate twist of events, during only my second game back from this injury, I ruptured my CFL (cardio fibular ligament) in my ankle, as well as damaging my Achilles, side-lining me for the foreseeable future. With my history of injuries, myself and my family decided it was time to call it quits on basketball. At only 16 I could never have imagined giving up the sport of love, but here I am.

&amp;#x200B;

Not a week later, my girlfriend broke up with me. Now I feel really lost. I am currently about to finish year 11 and start the most important year of my life, but I feel helpless. I lost everything, my ability to play the sport I love, my ability to simply go outside with some mates (I live in Australia so COVID over here isn't a big deal currently), my ability to just enjoy life. I haven't left the house in about a month, I am going to miss the first week of school because I cant walk, I lost my girlfriend, who was someone who truly supported me through everything, and at this point I feel truly hopeless.

&amp;#x200B;

The helplessness comes from a sense of, over my entire relationship with my ex, I always had a goal, which was to make the best life I could for her. Everything I did contributed towards that, but now that's gone I don't know what to do. I feel as though life has become meaningless, mundane, scary to a sense, as I don't know what the future holds. I know I'm only young, and everyone always says ""You have so much life to live"", and while I believed it at first, the longer I contemplate it the less I believe it. My one true fear in life is being alone, truly alone. I don't want to grow old with no partner, no family to raise, no one around me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Relating to the partner thing, since the breakup I've had conflicting feelings about relationships in general. On the one hand, I am scared of relationships. I'm scared of the fact that I could give my all to someone and never know how they truly feel. On the other hand, I don't want to be lonely, and would rather be heartbroken then alone. I just cant sort the idea out in my head as to what I truly want, and all these other factors definitely arent helping me figure it out.

&amp;#x200B;

So in summary, I just need advice, advice about how to get through this dark patch in my life. I've never quite experienced this before, and I don't have any tools or knowledge on what to do to grind through it. Thank you in advance.",11Oct2020,1
125,"Just reflecting a bit 
 I spent my entire childhood/ young adult life basically having no friends and being treated like a disease by everyone around me and basically feeling like a waste of space(family not exactly supportive either) . Then at the age of nineteen I somehow managed to get a girlfriend and couldn't have been happier that someone finally acknowledged my existence.... The 7 years that followed probably did not exactly help. After just a few months we moved in together and started studying at university. I did not find any friends at university and did not really enjoy studying there. But I couldn't quit as I didn't want to feel like a disappointment to my parents or maybe just did not have any other direction in life. My girlfriend verbally abused me regularly and made me feel like shit. A couple of times she got physically abusive and hit me for minor stuff... What made me feel worse is that I was the one apologizing afterwards because she usually started crying for being a bad girlfriend. At this point I basically was so isolated from the world, that I had nobody to talk to but her ( I never really had an emotional connection to my family and no deep friendships) and started having depression. There was/ is this internal voice in my head that says stuff like why do you even try? Or you will be a disappointment anyway so you should end it now... You know stuff like that. I started hurting my self because at this point I was so emotionaly numb that I just needed to feel something or just wanted to do something that had any sort of ""impact"" or gave me the feeling of control over something ... Or at least that is the explanation I found for my self...

Then i had the best year of my life.
I started a new education and since the school i was going to was basically a boarding school I spent most of the time away from my girlfriend and finally felt like  I could breathe...
I found friends. Not just friends but people that actually made me feel loved.(
My girlfriend actually got therapy for herself since I finally felt strong enough to demand change..

But well... The best year of my life is over now.
I really had a strong emotional bond to the two girls that were my best friends (they were also a couple) and made the mistake of basing my entire self worth on the attention I was getting from them. (as one person put it, replacing one toxic dependecy with another) 
Then the two broke up and now I am basically left with no one. One of them immediately replaced me with other friends, the other one, my best friend, had to get some distance from me as she has her own issues and tbh I got quite toxic and caused her to feel to much pressure with my abandonment issues (also I kinda developed feelings for her so that didn't help either) 

Now I am basically back to the start. No support network of friends,severe  depression,  absolute sense of meaningless and self harm. I feel like I have no identity at all because I spent my life being nobody.  I am stuck with my girlfriend who admittedly loves me, but I don't think I love her because the damaged she caused is just to deep.
I was going to leave her because I felt strong enough with  the support of my friends, but now she is the only person left in my life to whom it actually makes a difference whether I exist or not...

I've been thinking of getting help because I think I might have borderline... But what keeps me from getting help are a couple of reasons..
First of all I'm scared of using a diagnosis as an ""excuse"" for my bad behavior..
Also I honestly don't think paying a stranger to listen is gonna change anything... Neither will it solve my problems, nor will I get my friends back
But I've been doing worse the last couple of weeks...
I spent my time mostly either in classes where I have no one to talk to or lying in bed for hours watching the same YouTube videos for the 100th time because the loneliness is just too crushing if there is not a background voice... I cant bring myself to do anything because ""it's not like it changes anything anyway""... The cutting and the bruising has become more frequent and I just feel ""replaceable"" and not even worth existing.. I  never have thought about actually  commiting suicide so far since I never thought of it as an actual solution to anything... But I'm scared. I'm scared of where my thoughts will lead me if I continue getting worse...

So.. Well.. I talked a bit to much there I guess.. But I just had to idk ""reflect"" a bit on my own inner thoughts... If you read it, thank you for listening",11Oct2020,1
126,"Apologies if this is too long, but I felt it was necessary to explain it well.  

Background:

My wife comes from a normal ""white picket fence"" family, with two sisters, one older and one younger.  

Both her older and younger sister had to get extra attention from her parents, due to various reasons.

As a result, my wife felt she had to be perfect, to not cause any extra worries for her parents. She finished highschool with straight A's and got a master's degree in engineering. Noe she has two children and a husband and on paper everything is perfect.  

However, she cares way to much about what other people think of her: ""do you think they like me"", ""I think her/she thinks I'm stupid because I said ""xyz"""", ""I don't think your mom likes me"" (she does, by the way).  

She has a lot of insecurities concerning her own performances. This is probably because she has always had the need to be perfect.  

She says she hates her younger sister, since she was a horrible sister when they grew up, and now she hates that her sister is doing well.  

She calls and we visit her family more than the other way around, and she feels they don't care about her, and that the only family she has is me and the kids.  

Having said this: she's a wonderful woman and wife, a great mother, has many friends, is well liked and seemingly happy (and a lot of the time she is truly happy.) She doesn't let her true feelings show, and even go on weekend trips with her sister.  

My question is: how can I best help my wife? I'm as supportive as I can be, I'm a good listener and try to respond as best as I can.  

I have asked if she might want to ""see someone"" to talk about it, but she says it's not necessary. I have been thinking about telling her ""you have to go see a psychologist"", but I'm a bit worried that things might get worse if she thinks that's a waste.

Is there someone else that can help, or is a psychologist the best option?",11Oct2020,1

I'm a 17yrs old girl. I always wonder if something's right with my mind. When I'm feeling really low I panic and walk in circles in my room while overthinking all kind of stuff or I stare at an invisible spot and can stay like that for an hour or so, mind blank. I have thoughts of killing myself or killing other people (but I won't and don't want to act on that), I feel a lot of anger and I sometimes hit myself to feel better. Then I switch to sadness and I cry, and then I laugh or smile. At these times I'm just really confused. It's like I'm just watching my body react on its own. And I make terrible decisions after that, that can put me in danger. Danger and bad stuff is what help me to cope. Sometimes I'm insensitive to horrible things, or I like it. I still have empathy but sometimes I don't... I'm not mean to other people though, and I don't want to hurt them. I just have these thoughts when I'm feeling low. I want to scream but I can't, I want to break everything etc... Sometimes I have the urge of cutting my skin just to see my blood and to feel it/spread it on my skin. It's not to suffer, it's just because it comforts me. I'm always irritable with people irl but I don't show it. I just lost a bit of my self control once and was really bitter with someone. I have a lot of friends honestly but I don't even feel emotionally connected to them, except for one person that is my childhood friend. The others, honestly I'm kind with them and I kinda like them but I barely care for them. If they were out of my life, I'd be ok with that. And they annoy me sometimes. It's mean of me to think that but I can't help it.... I find it hard to connect with other people. Sometimes I feel like I really like them and the day after I just don't want them in my life anymore, even if they did nothing. I'm feeling better being alone but it's dangerous as I always end up having weird thoughts if I'm not busy with something.

My opinion of others change easily/I easily change my mind. I'm often regretting my decisions right after, or the day after and my thoughts change too. I don't feel like I can trust my mind anymore.
I have a lot of twisted thoughts when I'm distressed and panicked but I don't want to tell you, I can't help but judging myself for that. What can I do ? Do I have a problem? I really think I do to be honest...

130,"I’m just not myself anymore. 

Even through i have recently been diagnosed with depression ontop of the other things, i’m just not myself at all. 

People are starting to notice and i don’t like it. Like my teachers at school have been saying if i’m ok and do you want to talk. I just say no.

I have been hiding everything for around 4 years now because i’m scared to show it. 

At school there is about 2-3 people who constantly call me names and make fun of my hobby and stuff. Basically making me feel bad about the things that make me happy. 

They do it even when they can see i’m happy and i’m not speaking a word. I don’t want to tell them that i’m like this because they will only make fun of everything else and make everything worse and cause alot more shit than now. 

I’m just showing no emotion or just down most of the time. In class i have no motivation to do any work never mind the shit called ADHD that doesn’t help. 

He called me a “f***ing r*tard” because i was using my fidget toy to try and focus more. I almost broke the fuck down right there. I’m getting so close to just breaking down. My friends are drifting away for whatever fkn reason, they don’t reply often when i message and they seem to keep it ‘quick’. 

I’m breaking down almost every night because anxiety gets to me and makes me think the worst and i start to panic and shake. 

I just feel like i can’t do anything without getting called a name or if i pass someone they will do something. 

I can’t go to sleep easily anymore. 

I’m slowly losing everything. 

My mum is awsome and always tries to cheer me up and stuff and she is always there but i cannot tell her anything because i’m scared.

I don’t feel like eating or drinking anymore and i am on and off my meds because i either forget or just don’t want to. 

I told myself today i will have a good day but i have now seen that quickly went straight out the window.


TL;DR: basically i’m depressed, anxious and stupid and i can’t do anything right and i feel like something is gonna happen to me when i pass someone or if someone says something and i say something back.

here i am again. i never thought i would be writing in here to vent cus yea i thought i was getting better. im 18 now. and i spent rhe last 2 years going from a straight A student to impulsively obsessing over drugs and watching my dad fall sick and die infront of me and just watch as our money slowly goes away. so yeah thats my baggage. it fucking sucks, i thought i was getting better. i know i was i mean how couldn't i have been? i got rid of everything that was bad for me, i stopped doing drugs, i wasn't in a toxic relationship anymore, i wasn't around people that were superficial to me &amp; my family is getting better in terms of relationship and wealth and we're getting more comfortable. so why do i still feel like this? not gonna lie this feeling has been familiar to me since i was a little kid, always felt like this but everytime i get older the more its amplified. last few months ago i feel like i broke off the cycle of feeling 'rock bottom' started doing sports, started sleeping early, eating well, training myself with a healthy mindset. so why am i here? if you're wondering what this feeling or place i keep describing, i don't quite know how to explain it. i feel like every second is just me wondering why im even alive when i feel like this, how its unfair that other people don't feel like this, or atleast as much as i do. its unfair, i feel like my luck is the worst, i can't comprehend the idea of anything good happening without something bad happening behind my back. happiness and everything i thought i felt when i was getting better was all a lie. i want to die, i don't think i'll live past 24, i dont necessarily have a solid plan to kill myself. but if this is how ive been feeling for 18 years with each year it amplifies, i don't think i can last a decade more. 

I'm getting help by the way, but my psychiatrist appointment isn't until a month +. god i wish i had energy to live, im so tired all the time i can barely do anything in a day. how did i get myself back up? how DO i get myself back up? i hate feeling like this and i wish i could abuse drugs or just impulsively do something thats not good for me so atleast i get satisfaction cause all i feel is nothimg but frustration right now 

but i cant talk to anyone about this, no words can make me feel better if its from a friend i guess. ive heard it all. besides, i can't even get myself to meet a friend and talk or think about anything else besides the deep agony and despair i feel right now

I did ask her straight out why she doesn’t let me connect and flow and she said cos she’s not use to someone making the effort and also wonders why I want to get close to her.

One convenienced me to take a pill that will help me relax from my anxiety. He yelled at me when I said I didn't want to try it, claimed I didn't trust or love him. I'd never had sex with him before and never planned to. He gave me half of a xanax bar then pressured me to take a huge bong rip. I barely able to kiss him... I remember I took my pants off, because I was scared but I didn't want to have sex. We had sex that day. He apologized for it at some point in life and I told him it was absolutely fine. 

I was suffering from undiagnosed CPTSD, a personality disorder, both of which include severe depression and anxiety. I also stumbled into drug use from the guy mentioned above. He would use the same manipulation to pressure me into drugs and the drugs numbed the pain of my illness.... I became an abuser/addict for 4-5 years. 

There are countless other times, even with other men, where I'm too drugged/drunk to consent. Never gave consent. And was always too scared to speak up. I tried pushing them away sometimes... But it never did anything. My fight or flight told me if I let it happen, I'll be safe afterwards. 

Deep down I know what everyone is going to say. I.. just never liked to consider myself a rape victim since it wasn't the violent, horrific stranger scenario. I was also always so drugged up, I don't have to remember many of the details. 

I had a dream last night of being sexually assaulted by a stranger who kept biting me (guy from paragraph one did this to me, leaving deep marks all over my body. It was his way to ""remember I was his, and if anyone else tried to touch me there they would know I l belong to him). I also ran into him for the first time in... 8 years last weekend.

Im posting here because I don’t really know what to call what I’ve been going through and I’m nervous to talk to anyone more personal than some internet strangers. Mostly for fear of being laughed at.

The stress I have been experiencing is related to driving. I’ve had a license since I was 17 and have had to constantly drive to and from work,school,etc. I have a 100% clean, I’m talking pristine driving record. No infractions of any kind, but for a while now I have had this crazy fear that I’m going to hit a child on my way to work or on the way back. (I have to drive through a neighborhood with tons of children playing/biking during the day) It’s hard for me to determine when it started exactly, but I remember I would just occasionally for some reason think on my drive about how sad such a thing would be. It has evolved to such a point where I feel as if I’m going to throw up whenever I have to drive and genuinely dread it. It’s especially difficult because I used to love driving. 

My question is if I feel like I should seek help what do I call this?

I’ve also never had any other mental health issues before this other then adhd when I was little and I stopped getting treated for that when I was 15.


TLDR: I feel like I’m gonna hit a child while driving and don’t know what to call it.

Hope you are all safe and doing well.

I am in need of help, anyone’s Input is much appreciated

I have felt depressed for the past few years now, particularly worse this year, but have never seeked any professional help as I feel like I’m just faking it and being an attention seeker

I have grown up with limited social media access, so I really have no friends anymore - I used to have a few when I was in school, but we have since moved on

I am in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend, and I love him with all of my heart. I feel though sometimes as though he genuinely does not give a shit how I feel, I am not open very much when I am upset but when I am to him he treats me like shit instead of helping me feel better. I understand I’m not a very good girlfriend at times but he makes me feel horrible all the time when I am upset and flips the blame onto me as if I am always the problem and he is an angel who can do no wrong. I am upset that the one person I have, the one person who I should feel open with and care for me, I can’t talk to because he has this superiority complex and is unsupportive of making me happy and accepting he is in the wrong sometimes

I graduated school last year, and right after finishing I moved to full time IT work. I am genuinely unhappy with where I am, I feel like I have not achieved enough. Everyone else seems to be at University doing something with their lives but I am not. I am very exhausted and unmotivated to do anything anymore, I come home from work and I basically go right to sleep. I no longer enjoy the things I used to enjoy doing. I want to force myself to do an online uni course on top of work, but I have no clue about my career, and i lack the motivation to put the effort in to make myself a better person, even though in my heart I really want to

I’m just struggling in general and am in a very bad place in my head. I have pretty dark humour and used to joke about it a lot, but now when I think shit like fantasising about disemboweling myself and hanging myself from the roof I don’t genuinely believe I’m joking anymore but more so considering it

At this point I’m just rambling, but in short I really just need someone to talk to 

I am sorry if my post has been incoherent, I have a throbbing headache and am bawling my eyes out over the realisation even my boyfriend doesn’t truly care about he makes me feel

151,"TLDR: great PsychNP Fired/ had to resign no reason given what the heck? 

Has anyone ever been or known any mental health med prescriber to be told “something happened” and that they would be “terminated effective immediately” but no reason was given even when asked - just “you’ll hear from your licensing board” ?? 

I recently heard someone I know well describe a situation where this happened and they had no idea what they did wrong and were really anxious waiting to hear and still haven’t heard. They are a great person and prescriber so this is causing a lot of seemingly undeserved guilt and shame among other uncomfortable feelings, thoughts not to mention life stress. 

Just wondering if anyone has any clarity as this person is obviously filling in the unanswered blanks with worst case scenario and it seems awful and unfair to not know what’s going on or even be able to defend yourself/look into it. She has a lawyer but still has no answers and has to wait. 

Also all clients are just abandoned and there’s nothing she can do about it- seems unethical for an agency to do this to her but also to the clients?

I don’t have any kind of diagnosis but prior to taking Prozac my mood would spend a few weeks at a stable level, then a week where I’m completely hyper (not sleeping, pacing, racing thoughts, overwhelming optimism, talking fast, giddiness, upped confidence, and somewhat risky or bold, unrealistic, fleeting ideas). Then I’d spend a week very depressed (hate myself, don’t want to speak to anyone, can’t look people in the eye, aversion to loud noises, constant tiredness, no energy, passive self-harm and suicidal thoughts, and sometimes barely able to get a shower and clean my teeth let alone go to college). 

The first week I spent feeling completely hyperactive and out of it. Everything felt like it was floating and just incredible, I felt amazing and would not stop talking and fidgeting, the highest week I’ve ever had. Sunday night, within a matter of hours, I went from extremely high to extremely low, and woke up Monday completely unable to meet anyone’s eye and just thought it would be so much easier to be dead. I go to sleep convinced I’m not going to college the next day, but then I wake up Tuesday and I’m back to being extremely optimistic and giddy, yet this time with that irritable, fuming anger that I get when high. Thursday morning I wake up and I just want to curl up in a ball and die and feel like I’m about to pass out. Friday I wake up feeling amazing. It’s now Sunday and I can’t be assed to do a thing and am riddled with anxiety and dread about everything. 

I feel like I’m in a lottery draw as to how I’m going to feel. The entire time I’ve had severe brain fog, memory issues, and lack of concentration, but sometimes I’m so high that everything is hilarious and I’m not in control of my body, and I wake up the next day and I can hardly bare to get out of bed.

I also haven’t had any anxiety at all for the past two weeks, either due to complete careless optimism or completely exhausted apathy.

161,"This guy just confirmed everything I thought about myself is true.. 
(Theres a summary of this at the bottom but doesn't really make sense)

I was diagnosed with anxiety and major depressive disorder.. so three weeks ago when I saw someone on my facebook posting and sharing stuff that they feel alone and they hate their life, I pushed myself to reach out to him. I messaged him saying something along the lines of ""if you need a friend just to listen to you, I'll be glad to listen"". He really appreciate the random message and said he is dying to just talk to someone. 

We sent each paragraphs of text messages telling each other about are lives. 5 days after I messaged him that, he wanted to meet.. I told that I'll be so awkward and nervous then I put in that I'm fat and ugly. He said ""I'm awkward too lol and no your not, you're gorgeous"". 

The day we hungout was literally so nice.. while we were sitting I dropped my water bottle and he got up to pick it up. He said ""you have really pretty brown eyes"". He walked me home and made sure he was always closet to the road. We hugged (I did a shitty one arm hug cause I had stuff in my other hand - wished I did a better one now cause that was the last hug we would have together). 5 mins later he's texting asking if I ever want to play pool with him. I said some stuff and he was telling me he had a really good time and could hangout with me all day. He said I looked amazing.. he even brought up that he should of asked for a kiss (we agreed next time we hungout we were).

Thursday I didn't hear from him.. so I thought ""great, he didn't like me"".. I wrote to him asking if he still wanted to talk.. he said yes and that he was just busy- which was fine, we texted like 2 times a day. Last Sunday (Oct 4th) was the last time I heard from him.. last messages he sent was.. telling me about his daughters birthday, then made fun of the bands I liked then asked how am I today.. I replied and I still haven't gotten a response.. 

But from Wednesday to Sunday everything was fine, he was flirting with me, planning to hang again, talking about that kiss, saying things that were ""bringing"" up my self-esteem.

I didn't hear from him Monday - didn't think of anything cause I thought he was busy with his kids. Tuesday (Oct 13) I still haven't heard from him but I remembered him saying Tuesdays are bad days cause it the day after his kids go home - so I thought he was sad. But that day I did facebook and text him again saying ""hey, just checking in to see if you're okay"". Then in the text also I asked if he was up to it if he wanted to hangout again sometime. I honestly expected a reply in 24hrs.. 

Then Wednesday evening came.. and I saw him sharing stuff on facebook but he still hasn't looked at the message I sent him on there.. that night I cried but I also came to the conclusion that I did not want to date him, I made a list of all the stuff I wouldn't be able to do if I dated.. but I still wanted to be his friend.

So Thursday, Friday and Saturday I was sad but I was trying to get over it.. I'd have these random ""waves"" of sadness that would last a couple minutes. Then I woke up today (1 week since I heard from him) and went on facebook.. I saw him like a post saying ""somebody is going to catch your vibe and love it, be patient"".. I started having a panic attack, I couldn't stop crying cause he knew I liked his ""vibe"".. at that moment I knew I was NEVER going to hear from him again..

Quickly I'll say I told him about me slowly coming out of my depression, told him I always think people are judging me and that I had bad self esteem.. he was okay with it and even tried to cheer me up when I told him those things..

So, I came to the conclusion everything I thought about myself is true.. no one likes me or wants to be my friend. Everyone thinks I'm ugly and fat. He probably stopped talking to me cause of the way I looked, so he judged me. I feel sick, sad, hurt, can't sleep at night, can't eat much, lonely, hated

Thats the only thing I can think of of why he stopped talking to me - cause of how I looked. Like I wasn't ""pushy"" or ""annoying"" I never texted him after hours of not hearing from him saying ""???"". Like EVERYTHING was fine and then bam! Nothing but radio silence.. but post shit a week later about feeling alone and no one cares.. 

I'm literally done with life.. I'm done with people.. I'm never going to be good enough for anyone.. I feel my depression coming back

163,"Hello, my name is Ishaan Singh. I am a 16-year-old student in Mumbai. I built a free AI-powered chatbot called Inaya. It acts as the first point of contact for people suffering from mental health illnesses. It is a free, global, 24/7 chatbot that can always be used to help people. 

I created the chatbot for a very personal reason. My friends have gone through severe mental health illnesses and didn’t have adequate support systems around them to help them through their pain and suffering. When they shared their stories with me I was heartbroken and knew I had to make some difference to ensure no one else goes through what they went through.

The chatbot has since been partnered with one of the largest Indian NGOs for mental health, Vandrevala Foundation, as well as, Juno Clinic and Anata Co.

164,"Hi, I don't really know the reason for it but I always have felt very small(?) and helpless towards life. I can't really find my own voice, I feel like everything is and should be happening to me, not for me or because of me. In relationships, I can get super codependent, I can take all the blame and be very easy manipulated, I don't really trust people cause I've been used and abused by many but then again I always wait for people's approvals and permissions so it kind of creates a dissonance right then and there. I would love to start something new, change my life, go out and get involved into things but I'm terrified and I also feel like I have no choice in what I should be doing, or if I really like or don't like something, I mostly wait for some kind of a ""sign"" or a recomendation from other people when it comes to adressing my life. Right now it's a struggle cause a friend of mine I've depended on for years has kind of unsubscribed from the relationship so I'm freaking out a little bit, but then again there is no point in whining about people wanting to live their lives anymore, I really wish I could become independent instead of looking for another foster parent like that. but how do I even start?

166,"Hello everyone

I am new to this sub and i wanted to just clarify myself if i have adhd or not. Post might get long bear with me( i know people with adhd find it hard to read long posts, you can see my symptoms after the story).

About myself i am 24 year old, working as a game developer in a big company.

I wanted to improve myself always, i knew that i was different from others and i was not typical teenager. At age of 15, when i compared myself with others, i was not like them, i could not talk like the way others would talk. Whatever i talk people would not hear it mostly or would not understand thats what would happen always i would not be recognised anywhere. I tried to improve myself by doing yoga and following youtube videos like improving posture, you know the stuff how you would want to be recognised. Well i got recognised, i got with people but i was always made fun of. I become a kind of a guy you can make jokes on and i would not give a reply to that, if i did it would have been a poor one. 

I came to engineering, first year almost sucked i was finding people i wanted to enjoy with but all i got was people who would avoid me and make fun of me. Here i knew that i lacked something and i then started improving more. When i came at the end of the year, i found a group and i was part of it. Here also people made fun of me and i was the guy who would be picked on for a joke, and usual i would not give a reply. I hated every time whenever someone would make a joke on me, sometimes i would rage on them and get angry at things.

Second year came in, half of the year went good, and in other half i fell in love in with a girl in our class, this relationship lasted for 6 months and we got broke up.

Third year, i went into depression because of this, the whole year i had some pain inside me that i wanted to take off and yes again i started to improve myself but this time i had a negativity so much that whenever i tried to improve i would fall down thinking about the relationship. At this time i wanted to do something, be successful in life, watched a lot of ted talk to motivate myself and learn code to change the world and stuff, but i did not always tried to improve my coding, i would plan it but never do it. This happened in the next year also.

Final year came in , i improved somehow i just let myself be what i wanted to be and i enjoyed myself the fullest, i enjoyed but during the months when the college was to end, the group i was cracking due to misunderstandings between my bestie and another guy in the group which affected the whole group, so we parted due to him and we joined in another group where my ex was in who was in relationship with a guy of that group. I wanted the year to end as soon as possible due to this. We got together at the end of the year but it was not as it was before. 

After engineering, i got into a job in a startup as game developer performed somewhat good and got into full time. My ceo was a good guy, he was not that much of a strict or anything, but i would try to give the update he needed as soon as possible. I wanted to develop games and improve my technical skills, i planned all things to do, but at the end i would not do it and slack off much. I would sometimes rant myself about it in a dairy i write. So after the company got shut off in the later months and my ceo referred us to the big company and i am working here. 

So this is my story

Currently what i was facing from these years are 
1. When i was in college or class, i would daydream most of the time, i would day dream about the tv show or the game i played and make stories about this. Like when i played halo 1 game i would make a stories where if master chief escaped to the earth and this  alien forms would come to earth like that stuff.
2. I would always fantasise or in other time about anything i can. For eg, when i hear some hacker did this, i would research about it and fantasise of if i did this to someone, you know like a story i would create it in my mind.
3. Most of the time i would plan how my life should be, i plan what i should learn and the time i should give for it. But till date i have not done any of those and i just planned and i never did it. I regret this every time, i have been facing this from 7 - 8 years this cycle when seeing myself. Till know i planned to learn ds and algo, i had planned when i started my job, i never still touched it. 
4. I waste much of my money, sometimes i buy things and i don’t use it. This year i bought a gaming pc and airpods pro. I want luxurious items say that you see someone unbox some new console, i feel like i want it but i see my bank balance nope. Since job i joined i have never saved, i would spend it most of it on food or drinks. At the end of the month i would ask my friends abit of loan. Present also i would save the money and buy something ( like in dec i am planning to buy a nintendo switch to play zelda, please give me a good reason not to buy this).
5. I don’t socialise much, i want to talk to people but not in chat or call, but in person but this generation wants in chatting, which i am not into and never developed for. I will become boring afterwards after two talks
6. Personal hygiene i am at worst, i keep myself clean but still i am lazy at washing my hair and my mouth always stinks, last time i visited a dental was 3 years ago i guess. I am bad at this, i have bath for 5 or 10 mins. 
7. I plan everything, i know everything, i know the consequences of if i don’t do this what will happen, but  i go on doing the same thing the next thing, i slack off. It is like knowing you can swim but you don’t want too, this is my case.
8. I feel like i am still like a kid, i dont feel like a adult, i like to do childish things sometimes, in home, in outside i behave somehow.
9. I change my passion many times, i want to take a side hustle or sometimes i mix with it. I wanted to be a guitarist, rapper, a stand up comedian, and many more

Currently i am not using the time i am having, i know this pandemic is a crisis, but i feel like i wasted my time from the start of work from home. In one side i am not doing things that would improve my life and career in the other side i am not doing the job i should be doing in my present company, i watch youtube, go through reddit and do some work and lie to the company.

My questions are
1. Do i have adhd? 
2. What should i do now? Do i really need a therapist or medication for this? 
3. Can i lower my adhd naturally? Meditation, exercising or any other things i should do?

I am just confused i know something is wrong with me and i am failing at doing tasks and if i carry on like this i know i will fall down at once. I want to be useful, i want to be impactful",11Oct2020,1
167,Like I know mine is pretty mild and it’s more a feeling of emptiness than sadness but I’m pretty sure I have it. No one seems to comment that they think I am or anything when I tell them. Doctors have said neither yes or no. I have bipolar so it’s very common to suffer with depression aswell. I have had manic episodes but I feel like because I am pretty high functioning the depression doesn’t really matter. I feel like something is wrong with me but I can’t sum it up. I definitely ruminate a lot. Lack of confidence. Lack or motivation/discipline. Social withdrawal. No interests anymore except about myself. I wasn’t always like this but I don’t feel terrible. I just beat myself up a lot and I think about self improvement way too much.,11Oct2020,1

169,"This might be a long post so I’m sorry about that.

In 2014 I was committed to a psych ward for a couple of weeks, after I was discharged the doctor noted I had a ‘minor stress reaction’ but nothing more. I had a follow up appointment with another psych who told me he suspected I have bipolar and/or borderline personality disorder but wouldn’t diagnose due to lack of history on me. He referred me to another mental health team and that is where I meet this psychiatrist I’m struggling with. We’ll call him Dr.M

Dr.M finally arranged to see me after a few months of the referral, I arrived at my appointment and he asked if a student could sit in our meeting to which I said okay. This meeting lasted all of 10 minutes. In the 10 minutes I was there Dr.M spoke to his student more than Myself and went on to talk about how depression can make someone blind. Not once did he ask me about any troubles I have or any symptoms. A week later I find he has diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder. 

That is the one and only time I’ve ever seen Dr.M and since then I have spoken to Assistant psychs, mental health nurses, I’ve attended DBT several times and every person working in the mental health team has agreed that I do not have borderline personality disorder and that I actually display the symptoms of bipolar disorder. 

Dr.M refuses to acknowledge any of this despite several nurses and assistants who have also expressed a potential misdiagnosis to him. 

He has never seen me for a medical review. He refuses to see me when I ask for an appointment. He refuses to transfer me to another psychiatrist and has now refused my request for a second opinion. 

How do I handle this? It’s genuinely done nothing but cause me so much stress over the last few years, I’m at my wits end.",11Oct2020,1

172,"Hey, this post may be a little long so bear with me. 

so when I was in year 10 (4 years ago now) my school was involved in multiple hoax threats. The first started when I was in art class. Everything was fine until the alarms started ringing really loudly all of a sudden. I at first assumed it was a drill but was skeptical cause usually a teacher would let us know at the beginning of the day so we are prepared and not scared, (this didn’t happen tho). But what confirmed that it was real was when all the art and tech teachers had a worried look on their faces as they huddled around the school map trying to figure out what the ear piercing siren meant. This is when I started to get scared, our teachers instructed us to leave everything, huddle together and run to the gym as fast as we could while staying together. The teachers ended up having a few at the front controlling where we were going, a few on the sides I assume so no one ran off and I think one behind everyone. The entire school which had a couple thousand students were crammed into a sweaty and overheated gym for I think close to 2 of the longest hours of my life. I remember being sooo afraid and the fact that I couldn’t go on my phone at all cause teachers were confiscating the ones they saw made me more nervous cause I couldn’t even distract myself or even talk to my mum who I was really wanting to get comfort from at that time. Before any of the teachers spoke a rumour started to make it round the gym that the office had recieved a threat. (I can’t remember if the first threat was the bombing threat or mass shooting but either one) finally the head teacher spoke to everyone once the police had cleared the school and we were free to go back to class which frankly I went home after that cause I was terrified. 
The second threat came days later, I had barley recovered from the first hoax when suddenly ear piercing sirens rang through the school again. I went into full panic mode immediately, this time I was in the library on a free period, there were fewer teachers around and I technically didn’t have a teacher to report to at that time being so that made it much worse cause I didn’t know where to go. We ended up being rounded up once again as teachers lead us through the back rooms of the library and out the side doors which lead to sport courts and a small patch of trees that we had to ‘speed walk’ in my case jog through to get to the oval where everyone was gathering. We were once again out there for close to 2 hours but since we were on the oval and more spread out I managed to get on my phone to play a calming game. The second time I saw emergency service crews walking around which made me feel safer. I remember after those two hoax threats the school had  drills every couple of weeks, I was forced to squish into a computer server room, locker rooms, year level common areas. The thought of the drills weren’t as scary especially since the school made sure everyone knew one was happening on the day sometime and the alarm was a little quieter which was nice but the being squashed in a small room and the waiting caused me to have anxiety issues. 

Since this experience any sudden loud noise has terrified me and sent me into panic mode. I remember being at home with my brother when our home alarm glitched and started blaring. I immediately panicked and legged it down the driveway and onto the street without a second thought of my dogs or brother (I am very ashamed of that) another time was I was awoken from a nap to my parents knocking on the front door when they came home from shopping. I panicked ran and unlocked the door tried to get out but my parents were blocking the doorway so I ran into my room and hid and had a panic attack for  I think half an hour. 

What I’m trying to ask is, is it normal for someone to be traumatised from something that technically wasn’t real. I mean there was no bomb and no shooters, I didn’t see terrifying scenes and I didn’t lose anyone. So do I have a right to be traumatised? Am I overreacting?",11Oct2020,1

174," 

I'm 17, male, and have suffered from bouts of what can only be depression for the last few years. It's been incredibly bad recently. Like, sometimes the lowest I have ever felt. This year has been horrific for everyone, and even more so for me. Two days into lockdown, my grandad died, Not of covid, he'd been sufferign with stuff for quite a while. I didn't have a chance to grieve for him properly. I have been self conscious about my body image and my general self for years, and having never actually had a gf before, you cna only imagine by happiness when I found an amazing girl, who I actually knew from way back, who liked me. It didn't last for long...I always say 2 months but it might have just been a month and a half. it feels like i f\*cked it up, thats the worse thing, because i brought my political views into, i was just asking why she felt prejudiced towards a certain group and that did it apparently. but we continued as friends, until the other day, when she blocked me on social media and got her friends to abuse me on voice message. so i lost basically my only friend, and i did struggle with a friendship with her, as everytime i saw her face or whatever i realise what i miss and how much i miss it. the last time i saw her, the first time since we broke up, i ended up just goign to the pub afterwarsd and drinking. I just want to drink a lot of the time, even though it does very little. it just makes me realise how much agression i have insdie of me.

i keep beating myself up about feeling like i just f\*ck things up, like not having any friends, strugglign with relationships. in lockdown, i briefly talked to this girl who i knew from school. i knew she was quite a bit younger, but thought she was 13 (i was 17 at the time). i admitted to her i felt sexually attracted to her, she was quite developed for her age, and i instalntly regretted it, and now i can't get over it, even though nothing happened, she has problems of her own i think because i cant remember if i askd or assumed but she said she wasn't even 13 yet, then asked me if i'd f\*ck her, i said no for obvious reasons, but its made me feel dirty and like a terrible person, not evil, but just pathetic, sad, and dirty. and i keep going over it, like asking myself did she say she was 12 before, idk wehenver i'm down i'll either just drink or message a sh\*t ton of girls hoping for some form of thing to make me feel better about myself. i post on social media all the time, hoping to get likes, but i never do, and i even had a girl comment on it as a joke. i'm going to see a psychiatrist and get diagnosed with something, idk what. iv'e talked to my parents about this and the girl incident, and they say its okay, my cousin who i am close to said its okay, people online have said its okay, even some girl i was randomly talking to and asked about seemed to think it was okay, but for some reason i cant stop thinking about it even though it happened in april, i think just around or after my birthday. when my ex, then friend, blocked me and had her friends abuse me the other day...i just broke down. i got a drink, ran out the house, and cried my heart out in a field, feeling like i wanted to run away from all my problems or k ms. I feel like its all my fault how i just cant seem to have any friends or anything. i want to be normal, enjoy and do the things other ppl my age do, just have a f\*cking normal life and have normal feelings, cos i know everyone has low points but im sure feeling the way i am isn't normal or healthy in terms of how depressed they are. I'm not alcoholic but i just drink on my own, in fact i do everything on my own cos i have no one else to do it with, and my ex was rubbing that in the other day. She's making me have trust problems like i used to, she kept calling me her best friend, saying she had no others, then the other day i managed to speak to her afetr she blocekd me to clear sh\*t up, she literally listed all the friends she had and how it was ""cringe"" for her to call me her best friend. i'm so angry at myself. please. can someone offer their advice.",11Oct2020,1

179,"Throw away account for obvious reasons. 

My husband and I have been together for almost 10 years. We have two children. The oldest has dysregulated mood disorder and ADHD.

Shortly after our son was diagnosed the summer of 2019, my husband saw the benefits our son had with his ADHD medication. My husband asked for a referral to be evaluated himself and now he is also taking ADHD medication since fall of 2019. (I don't doubt he has ADHD, just as a side note.)

Our entire relationship has been completely solid for 9 of the 10 years we've been together. He has always been kind, respectful and a doting and loving husband and father to our two children. 

In January of this year his Aunt, whom was like his mother, suddenly passed away. He hadn't spoken or visited with her in recent years because her son called ours a retard, so my husband never wanted to visit,  despite me wanting to go up for holidays, gatherings, etc.

Then the pandemic really hit. Both children were home full time with my husband. (He has been the stay at home parent for 5 years since our daughter was born. )

Ever since January, he has lost 50lbs that he didn't really have to lose... he has been extremely irritable, and any time there is even a smidge of a disagreement between us he is so unbelievably cruel towards me with his words. He's out on the deck all day smoking marijuana concentrate. Since the school year started, the kids have been marked absent 5 times. I try video calling him from work to remind him of their class times. I've posted a schedule for both children on a bulletin board, etc. But when I call him it's like he's in a trance.... 

The most concerning part is that he has become obsessed with religion. Every thing he reads or watches is about priests, prophets, messages.... sometimes he makes up ""memories"" of meeting a specific priest before or being in a specific room. He had an episode a few weeks ago where he truly believed he was a specific priest and was skipping around the house acting totally bizarre. I called his older brother and an ambulance that night and the medics felt like he just hadn't been sleeping enough. 

Took him to the ER next day and they too thought it was lack of sleep as all his lab work and everything looked fine. 

He was seemingly better each day after the episode with sleep each night but then he kept being paranoid and unplugged all of the computers/tvs in the house. So I brought him to a Behavioral Health Urgent Care and they too thought it was just a lack of sleep and prescribed seroquel which HAS helped in terms of more sleep, increased appetite, mood stabilizing, etc.

However, he is still obsessed with religion and finds any excuse to rant and ramble about the weirdest things as well as seek out pastors and priests and try to convince them that he has some sort of special knowledge....?

Our primary care did give him a referral to psychiatry but also thinks he's just been sleep deprived.

I am disturbing ur valuable time and started crying. 

I do a lot of work. I am a cinematographer. Even in all these works I kept talking to him and being there for him but he is now thinking that I am being pity to him. But after 1 hour later he again called and said sorry for everything and slept. His mother told me that he was given medicine by his doctors. But I think nothing is working well. I feel so bad for him. His words are like echoing in my ears. But again he is mentally sick and I don't know how to help him.

189,"I know that porn is very unhealthy and toxic for your mental health. I don't watch it anymore. But is masturbation itself - without any porn (videos, magazine etc.), only imagination and physical sensations - bad for your mental health? Or can it maybe even help with depression and anxiety?

What about the same fact with watching porn stimulating your brain too much? Is the masturbation only and orgasming also too much stimulation that possibly can do more bad than good in a depressive brain?",11Oct2020,1
190,"I'm a female, who just turned 21 two days ago. I would say my mood rapidly changes. Some days in a week I can feel so much down that I have unstoppable crying, doesn't eat anything, doesn't get enough sleep ect. Those days I usually end up with thinking about death and suicide - I would even say if it wasn't because I was afraid of doing it, I might even accomplish it one day, as I'm unable to handle my emotions. But some days I feel so happy and energetic, and get more things done in a day - It is like I'm in my own little fantasy world full of joy and excitement. Usually when I have positive days, I don't think about dark subjects,but recently I sometimes think about death and suicide too when I'm happy - And not in a negative way. It's like I'm feeling that there is something waiting for me on the other side, and I can't wait to see it, like maybe a whole new world.

192,"I do not mean to offend any anyone and I’m sorry if I do &lt;3

I have been through a lot in the last 3 years my short life as a 16 year old female (Australia). I’ve experienced extremely traumatic situations (won’t disclose because I would hate to trigger anyone) which I think have contributed to how I feel. I am constantly tired, easily irritated and extremely sad all most every hour of the day.I struggle every single night to sleep, I probably get 3 hours every night and it impacts my schooling. I’ve tried to cope with stuff that has happened to me with the “everything happens for a reason” mentality but I just can’t believe in that anymore, not with what I’ve been through. I’ve been struggling so much with body positivity (nowadays I can’t look at myself in the mirror without breaking down) and I have noticed I have poor spacial awareness as of late (running into things, buying clothes that I think would fit but turn out to be too big) 

I’ve lost a lot of friends, they always seem to ghost me or have an excuse to why they can’t hang but more times than not they are actually just ditching me for others and they don’t even try to hide it. I’ve basically been thrown out of my Bestfriend group and I can’t understand why, I am generally a very present friend and I am genuinely always there for every single person in my life how ever no one is ever there for me. I’ve been told how I give good advice and people always feel comfortable opening up to me because I help them work through their problem and make them feel better. I was excluded from my school group (wouldn’t be invited to hang out, talking about me behind my back ect) although I had been so kind to every one of them and I never burdened them with my emotional state. They would make minimal effort when it came to me so I cut that off completely, it wasn’t serving me instead I felt drained and anxious around them. I’m proud of myself for taking that step. I’ve been reflecting thinking that I would’ve had to do something for everyone to not suddenly like me, I think every single day and I’ve analysed every single interaction and I genuinely can’t identify anything. Do I have a victim complex? I have been bullied my whole life for my appearance, people threatened to bash me  (first of all why are u made that I’m ugly?). I got bashed by a random girl, her bf and her bf’s brother while my “Bestfriend” stood and watched the much older randoms bash me. I am so conflicted. I take pride in admitting my wrongs and apologising, I think communication is so important and I’ve always practised those values. 

I’ve struggled with SH and SA since I was young throughout my life but I’ve always managed to hide it until I OD infront of my school group in the school bathrooms (they didn’t really seem to care and they have seemed to brush it off, I dont expect them to care as it’s not their problem but it was a hard pill to swallow, no pun intended. It gave me perspective and I realised I need to get better for me). I don’t want to self diagnose but I’m feeling lost. I don’t know what to do anymore I just seem to fuck everything up. I don’t have anyone anymore and my parents wouldn’t understand even tho they love me. 

When I’m out with my friends im a bubbly and energetic person, I believed I was a good friend and a nice person to be around but since losing practically everyone I’m really starting to doubt myself. 

I also have issues with my appetite this year (I’m eating one meal a day on average, I’m just not hungry) and I always feel sick in my stomach. I’m not sure if that could mean anything??I cannot concentrate at all and I struggle with school, I was a good student in the past.

We would have good family nights and hang out all the time. over the years, that all crumbled down. I was trying to find a job for a while, but wasn't able to find one. After a while I did and now I'm happy where I am after finding my current job. The only thing that has been getting to me over the years is my father. He was kindly telling me things in the beginning, but as time went by, he just got worse and worse. Telling me stuff like if I don't find a job he'll start charging me rent. I do pay him rent now. $400 per month. Over the years, he's been saying stuff like I'm not even part of the family anymore. Because I don't talk to anyone and mind my own business. I just go to work and chill out in my room because when I talk to anyone, they just change their tone with me. I don't feel welcome here anymore. When I went out to go hang out with my friends at night. I was locked out of the house over night and all dad said was. ""If you want to go see your friends at night time you're not living here"" that doesn't make sense, cause I get home at the same time I do when I work. so there is no difference to him...that just put me in danger during the night. When I developed severe anxiety and depression, to the point i had to go to the mental ward in the hospital. I told them about everything and all they said was. ""You don't have depression. you have a good life here. I actually have anxiety.you shouldn't have depression"" and assumed I was lying and saying ""just so you know we won't visit you in the hospital unless you are actually dying"" but that's not what made me want to move out of here. It was the locking me out at night. I'm seeing a therapist, and she agrees with me that I am not in the wrong here. I don't know if I can call my dad a parent anymore. I want to add one more thing. I work at a restaurant as a dishwasher, I'm very proud of my job. I obviously work at night so I sleep in when I can. Is that understandable? I got up this morning and the first thing I hear is ""if you don't start sleeping during the night, you are going to go live with your mother or somewhere not here."" And he cuts the internet due to my ""bad sleeping pattern"" so I sometimes get home with no internet even though I pay him rent. Also we all know my mother is a homeless alcoholic, so that's not an option. I thought of just getting a place of my own or a shared rent a room type deal for cheap. What do you think?

Last week there was a big Biology test coming up that I studied for. I was fully prepared for the test and it seemed a little difficult but not that much. 
I got my score back today and I was shocked to see that I got a D-. I was in shock and sad at the same time. I know the consequences for getting a bad test score (getting grounded) but I don’t wanna tell my parents about it yet.  But getting grounded is not what I’m sad about. It’s the fact that I studied for this test really hard and still getting a bad grade. My friend barely studied for this test and he got a A-. I honest feel worthless and I will for a while. My goal in life is to do well on school and go to a good college for a business career. I’m not at all depressed but suicide was on my freaking mind when I found out about the score.

I can't focus on anything. Ever. I get extremely bored very quickly, flicking from app to app to app on my phone, I can't sit on one game very long, a complete lack of interest in everything a lot of the time. I can only spend five minutes in a bath before I'm bored out of my mind etc.

I had a load of issues in high school (UK, so these started at 13/14) when I developed a disability, due to this I ended up redoing my GCSEs four times, I failed every time. My studies had never been A grade but up until these years I was a C/B student pretty consistenly.
After this it's just been impossible, I can't even concentrate, I can't comprehend even the smallest things to the point of losing my temper because I get so confused. I try and read something and it just doesn't go in. I always examed well previously but now they're all fails- even when I think I've done great (I get 100% extra time sometimes. A one hour exam will be two for me. They're also done alone.)

I read pages and nothing goes in, revising doesn't work, even the simplist tasks are just too hard. No matter how hard I try I just don't understand. At all.

I tried taking a vocational course. I decided to train as a personal trainer and even the simplist of tasks in the work book had me stumped- some of the people in those classes thought london was near scotland kind of dim, lovely people but not the brightest. These were simple find the information write it down kind of questions and I just couldn't do it.

I can't just read a book anymore but used to read 4-8 books a week.

I never understand anything no matter what I try. I've tried mindfulness, studying differently, changing my place of study, changing my qualifications. I never understand anything- to the point I just throw my books at the walla and scream when I'm alone because nothing makes sense. Everyone else seems to understand at least one subject and I just don't understand anything anymore. Everything is too hard. It's like I can't comprehend anything ever. I can't even comprehend basic instructions on the phone half of the time.

I've been homeless on and off for a few years now because of my condition and Ive kept together amazingly. My finances are better than anyone else my age and everyone says I'm the most mature and grown up person they know despite being the youngest. I'm always the sensible one, I'm always the mediator, I'm always the one to bail people out and help with money. I'm the smart sensible one. I'm just so damn angry.

Rest of the way was okay but I felt realy weird, it sounds stupid but it was like nobody around me was real like everybody was just an object. I arrived to the bus stop, bought my ticket and sit down. Out of nowhere there was terribly hot so I took off my jacket. After few seconds I started to sweat and feeling realy sick I just couldn't concetrate to the reality and nothing around me felt real. I had realy strong chest pain and anxiety and my hands felt realy weird, it's hard to describe but it was like my hands were magnets and every finger was different pole and they were vibrating.

206,"This is a bizarre thought to have, but I needed to get it out somewhere. 

To start, I've dealt with anxiety for a long time. I was diagnosed with GAD in my teens, Panic Disorder in my early twenties. I also experienced severe gender dysphoria through most of my life which contributed to a lot of stress as well. While the dysphoria has been addressed with hormones and that particular issue has gotten a lot better, my other mental health issues are still present and I think my social and health anxiety has turned into almost an addiction. 

I find myself not feeling ""right"" unless I'm worried about something. So I fixate on what ifs and fatalistic scenarios until that fight or flight response is triggered. Then I just kind of live in that anxious space. It's not comfortable and I don't like it but I feel so much more ""prepared"" and ""centered"" when I'm in a state of total emotional upset. 

Like. I'm actively engaging with triggers. Until I fully fall headfirst into them. I'm not sure what to do about it, but I'm certain it's not ""good"" for me.

Hi all,

In summary, I have been bedridden since the start of August due to pain in my abdominal area and extreme nausea. While things have got slightly better now, the abdominal pain and nausea was very severe throughout the end of August and all the way through September. At points, it got so bad I literally couldn't speak to my mum or even go on my laptop because I was in so much pain. 

I have been to A&amp;E three separate times but because all the tests came out clear, they couldn't do anymore to help me. After speaking to my GP, she suggested some mild laxatives which I am taking which has seemed to improve my condition. The most probable cause of me being ill is that I have faecal matter partially lodged in my colon which is refusing to move. 

However, due to Covid, I am having to wait longer than I normally would to see a gastro doctor in order to identify for certain what's wrong with me. I am most likely going to be in this state until late November. 

I have become severely depressed over the past two months, because I have been spending 99% of my time in bed, in my bedroom. Furthermore, each day for the past two months for me has felt like the same day on repeat. I wake up, eat food or watch stuff on YouTube, fall asleep. I am currently, too unwell to go down the road but can walk around the house and stuff. I have had no social contact besides with the family (who are amazing) because I am not well enough to meet anyone else in person. I have been texting friends but obviously they can't and I definitely don't expect them to converse with me 24/7.

For anyone who has been in a similar position as me, how did you vary your days so you weren't just looking at a screen the entire time?

Feel free to ask any questions and I really appreciate anyone who took time to read this!",11Oct2020,1

212,"I feel like my life has just reached a point of no return. I’m 25 and feel like I have no direction with anything. I wake up everyday with an overwhelming feeling of shame, regret and self hate for the person I have been to those close to me.

Last month my girlfriend broke up with me after I had an emotional breakdown in front of her for wanting to leave to spend time with her friends, I said incredibly hurtful things, tried to manipulate in to her meeting me, told her I didn’t want to see or be with her then drove to her house and broke down in front of her parents and told them things about us.

I offered to go to therapy and get my medication fixed, because I realise how awful I was and wanted to be better for both of us but I had hurt her too much for her to trust me and give me that chance.

3 weeks prior to this I lost my job, failed an exam at university due to forgetting to submit it, was in a car crash and my grandpa was diagnosed with cancer and this just felt like the final straw for me as a person.

I’ve made 2 attempts on my life since that night, and just want to die so badly.

During my relationship with her I’ve realised through a lot of self reflection that I was incredibly selfish, manipulative, controlling and toxic. I’d always create small issues in to bigger ones and try to get my way by doing things out of spite and bating.

I’ve realised this is a pattern in me, and I’ve done it to my last 2 ex girlfriends as well, doing a lot of similar awful things. A lot of manipulative and toxic things that really are so horrible to even think about.

This has made me realise just how shit I’ve been as a partner and it hurts to know I could treat someone that I genuinely cared about so much so poorly.

I see no point in anything anymore, I feel numb everyday, I have no friends and the only people who talk to me are my family but I feel like a burden to them and my previous ex, but most of the conversations with her just reaffirm in my head how shit I was to her and my most recent ex.

219,"Me 23f had a mental breakdown for no logical reason...

Today was normal. I was playing video games, drawing on my tablet, taking a walk on the evening with my father, eating dinner and preparing for a shower.

My floor is built like this: me and my sister are in seprate rooms and I'm the closest to the bathtoom.

When I was about to get out of my room and prepared to go to the shower I heard my sister just went into the bathroom and locked it before I had the chance to enter.

Something snapped in my head and I started shrilling like a banshi, leaving my rooms in periods, kicking and punching the door while screaching for her to leave the bathroom.

When I slightly calmed down I heard the lock opened and I rushed to the door and demanded her to open up. She decided it wasn't safe for her to leave after this tantrum which only made it worse. 

Our parents got involved and told me to wait in my room while she got out and I immediatly went to the shower and cried in shame.

The thoughts that came during this time were not positive. Beating myself down and crying even more.

After I finished the shower and put clothes on I still couldn't stop crying, thinking less and less of myself until I decided to call a friend (after hours of beating myself down and jumping to the worst conclusions of 'everyone hates me' mental state) and couldn't stop crying, after he tried his best he had to end the call with me still feeling like crap but at least I felt a one millionth better, but not by much.

My mom is not very supportive in this situation by telling me 'it can be solved if you would be pentience' or 'use your willpower to stop it', how can I use something that doesn't exists at the moment, I've got no clue.

My mom and sister fear me.
My dad is respectful but asks if the medicine actually works.

220,"I feel like my life has just reached a point of no return. I’m 25 and feel like I have no direction with anything. I wake up everyday with an overwhelming feeling of shame, regret and self hate for the person I have been to those close to me.

Last month my girlfriend broke up with me after I had an emotional breakdown in front of her for wanting to leave to spend time with her friends, I said incredibly hurtful things, tried to manipulate in to her meeting me, told her I didn’t want to see or be with her then drove to her house and broke down in front of her parents and told them things about us.

I offered to go to therapy and get my medication fixed, because I realise how awful I was and wanted to be better for both of us but I had hurt her too much for her to trust me and give me that chance.

3 weeks prior to this I lost my job, failed an exam at university due to forgetting to submit it, was in a car crash and my grandpa was diagnosed with cancer and this just felt like the final straw for me as a person.

I’ve made 2 attempts on my life since that night, and just want to die so badly.

During my relationship with her I’ve realised through a lot of self reflection that I was incredibly selfish, manipulative, controlling and toxic. I’d always create small issues in to bigger ones and try to get my way by doing things out of spite and bating.

I’ve realised this is a pattern in me, and I’ve done it to my last 2 ex girlfriends as well, doing a lot of similar awful things. A lot of manipulative and toxic things that really are so horrible to even think about.

This has made me realise just how shit I’ve been as a partner and it hurts to know I could treat someone that I genuinely cared about so much so poorly.

I see no point in anything anymore, I feel numb everyday, I have no friends and the only people who talk to me are my family but I feel like a burden to them and my previous ex, but most of the conversations with her just reaffirm in my head how shit I was to her and my most recent ex.

226," For the last couple of months, I've been periodically seeing a psychiatrist, on top of weekly therapy (which I've been in for years). I have my third appointment with my psychiatrist this week, and I am really nervous to make a bad impression, or say something dumb.

I had to go to urgent care last week for chest pain/acid reflux, which I thought was odd since I'm a decently healthy female in my early twenties. The doctor there had me reduce my Zoloft dose from 75 mg to 50 mg. I'm worried that my psychiatrist will be annoyed by this. I had been feeling like progress was being made when I was on 50 mg initially, and when the dose was increased, I felt like I plateaued, and my anxiety and panic attacks were getting worse again. Now that I'm down to 50 again, the panic attacks have improved a little bit again, but my anxiety hasn't. I'm really scared to switch to a different SSRI because I feel like I have had a positive reaction to Zoloft up until this point.

I keep looking into different options of what to do so that I feel prepared when I go in to speak with her, and I really want to ask her about adding in Buspirone in addition to Zoloft. I keep reading that it can help when used in addition to an SSRI or SNRI, and that it won't cause as extreme of weight gain as some other options out there. I've also heard that it isn't as addictive as some other types, which I really like, as my family has a history of addiction, which I try to be very cognisant of.

The other issue, is that I read that it can help with the sexual side effects of Zoloft. I just don't know how to bring any of this up to her, and to see if she thinks it could be a good fit in my specific case. I'm worried that bringing up a specific antidepressant to her will be bad...

227,"I've always had a fear of relationships, but I know the issue is more due to my first relationship. In short, fell for this guy, who kept cheating, and would leave&amp;come back/ leave &amp; come back every couple of months, all extremely intense. During that period I think I started associating fear with love. I know it was quite bad as I was crying nearly every night for 5-6 months after, with unfortunately thoughts of suicide...but I'm smart enough to stop myself from doing anything.

I've not had any other relationships (I'm now 29/F). I've tried dating a bit last year, but it didn't work out although I at least learned a lot more about how it all works, and got comfortable talking to men, and with myself.

It's been 2 years, and I finally started dating someone who doesn't seem to want just a casual thing. And I guess I started liking him more and more, but I'm also starting to get anxious and starting to compare this relationship to my prior one although of course it's not at all the same.  All I keep wondering more is 'when will he say to break-up' like my ex did constantly.  I'm concerned I'll do something to mess it up.

I'm not sure what to do to stop feeling like this, apart from just reminding myself that it's all in my head, and if it happens that it doesn't work, that's that. In the past I got over the depression by keeping myself stressed out and tired with work, but I'm not sure I can do that now if I want any energy to give into this relationship.

Next, a specific line of a song kept going on and on, specially when I would start crying, I don't know why it was this specific song as I did not listen to it during that period, and the exact lines that my brain kept playing are ""my heart is broken ...it hurts to see my mother cry"". It kept repeating to the point that I felt like my brain was going to explode. This stopped for the most part (I can still hear it sometimes tho). Yesterday night a thought popped into my head as a guy I was seeing is leaving the country for good and I think he doesn't want to see me or say goodbye, and the same sentence has been repeating since yesterday night ""I can't believe you're leaving and you don't want to see me/say goodbye"". This exact sentence/thought has been repeating all day today, even after I slept and woke up.

I'm wondering if this is an indicator of something? What is this related to? Could it be my brain's way of dealing with pain? And why did it just start very recently? If you have felt this, how do you control it?

234,"
This happens in academic writing and in everyday speech, especially in school. The feedback I’ve gotten from others is usually that it seems like I want to say too many things at once making it hard to follow, and also that I don’t follow through or fully finish my thoughts, in person and on paper. Indeed I usually do become exhausted frustrated and hopeless and often give up midway through. My professors are usually very enthusiastic about the thinking itself that’s happening in my written work but very frustrated by the fact that it’s unfinished, late and/or disorganized.

It sometimes takes me many multiple hours to write a single paragraph of an essay for university. And sometimes I’m simply rewriting the same thing but sometimes I’m not and the paragraph runs on and on and on and I never actually finish the intended point of the paragraph even three pages In. It’s like I feel it’s possible and necessary to expand on everything but the result is fragmented and layered. “A bit Overstuffed” was the only criticism one professor had for me on a paper I actually finished. 

I don’t know when to stop, and even if I do, it’s always too abrupt. It’s like there is a bridge to get from one side of the paragraph to the other that I need to build. And I keep adding plank after plank after plank to expand the bridge but for some reason I can never get to that last plank, the one that would connect one side to the other side. It’s like I can expand forever on something but I’m reluctant and unsure of how to conclude or finish anything. There’s always so much more to say. 

As for organization, I struggle a lot knowing where to put what and when to say what. The structure of my paper can be a bit odd, fluid or unclear. I do try to outline but I feel I must always abandon my outlines because they never work in practice. I feel a strong sense of everything being connected to everything else, like a literal knot I can visualize in my head, and the essential kerne of my argument is right at the center of that not, but the threads are so intricately and tightly interwoven that at some point each one becomes indistinguishable and the knot becomes an indivisible entity. It feels like one long paragraph or at least like everything if I do break it into paragraphs they are not clear or discreet entities, each one, but merely continuations of previous paragraphs. Where I begin and end seems arbitrary and I always feel acutely dissatisfied, as though I’ve only actually written 5 or 10 percent of what I meant to write. I run out of steam and give up.  

Let me be a little more concrete. Say I’m organizing a paper about Virginia Woolf and my first paragraph is about space, while the second is about time. Sounds simple enough but then the quotations most obviously about space are actually also about very much about time when you look closely enough! And not just that, but the very same thing that appears to be about space is also about time, not even different elements of the same quotation, but the very same words and phrases begin to mean many different things. And it’s not like it would make sense to analyze the quotation again later through a different lens because in this case, there is a very direct parallel (at least in my mind) between her conception of space and time. Also, in my mind, this expands to her conception of relationships and hierarchy and words and art. They all become related to a central paradox or conundrum, from which everything else arises and I start to see it everywhere. It is suffused throughout, in various ways. There are parallels and paradoxes everywhere but still there is often an underlying connecting thread that I sense very strongly and I always want to write about that, because that’s why all the other stuff matters, that’s what makes a paper worthwhile in my opinion, it gets to something essential. 

So then I decide to combine the paragraphs about space and time and instead organize in a different way. I sometimes try to base it around certain quotations so that I can talk about each in its complexity without having to jump back to it again but the problem with this is that there is no sense of growth because the first quotation is often just as rich as the last one. I lack a narrative progression because I don’t want to hold back in the beginning. Because like I said everything is connected to everything else and I can’t seem to untie the knot. I become overwhelmed, feel stupid, confused and lose steam. 

Often what I intended (in my outline) to be a single paragraph turns into the entire paper because once I start writing everything keeps expanding. And that’s after many hours of research/planning/outlining. It feels so difficult to condense what I want to say, and structure into paragraphs. I don’t think that it’s because I don’t spend enough time preparing, planning, and outlining because I spend a very long time doing this (and it’s my favorite part). I don’t begin writing until I have a complete idea of what I’m going to say, and evidence for it.

238,"Hi all, the title says it all.

I am addicted to negative environments, in particular some forums where people troll, flame, criticize and argue constantly. It's negatively affecting my psyche -- whenever I quit or take a break, I find myself (and my wife) happier.

However, whenever I find myself bored, I have a habit of checking those websites, and once I take the first step back in, before I know it, I'm fully glued back to those forums. I myself trolled and flamed people that I think deserve it, but then later realize that whatever it is I'm doing isn't solving any problem, and is harmful to my psyche. I've already changed my account's password on those forums to a random string of numbers without memorizing it, so I won't be able to log back in, but I was actually just about to go back to create a new account but forced myself to make this post instead.

I've read books about habit formation, and typically people recommend finding another habit to replace the current one. Any suggestions? Has anyone here successfully kicked a habit?

Many thanks.

But I feel like it was way too much. I felt very unsafe leaving the appointment and have been feeling that way since. I asked for us to take a 'pause' when it was getting too intense and that maybe we could slow down but she just said okay and continued on telling me to 'trust the process'

I left in tears with her telling me to do some grounding exercises after (I was really hoping she would do them with me, I didn't feel strong enough to do them alone)

It just felt like a very unsafe environment and I'm dreading going back and having to talk to her about it. I'm terrible with authority. How do I bring this up?

250,"Hello anyone
I need help because I've just turned 21 and I have hit my lowest point. This happened as I got rejected a year ago off a girl i was crazy about.
 I know why I got rejected now and I was too intense too early and insecure and needy, but until now I have defiantly played the victim card in general about women in general until this point but she was generally a good lass.
I put myself under absolute unbearable pressure whenever I was around her to be perfect and it crippled me and I feel like I have entered a flat tailspin and I took a hard look at myself.

I seeked therapy for social anxiety but on researching online I seem to fit covert npd very well. My therapist said i don't have it but I feel deep down I am secretly evil. 
I've also been told not to Google things as I have also suffered off and health anxiety for almost a decade now but I can relate to some pretty evil things.

I feel secretly happy when I see others in pain ( mist make me feel not quite soo bad about my situation but this disgusts me ). This was in the past and i have defiantly reduced this now
I help other but normally it's just to confirm to myself I'm a good person.
I'm obsessed with my looks 
Have weird day dreams and fantasies

I had a extremely overprotective mother and was spoiled as a kid and now I have grown up the adoption of responsibility for myself hit me hard and I also lasted only 1 year in the fire brigade as a result of health anxiety, this was a hard blow for me. 

I managed to scrape into university and am studying to become a dietitian, I really want to be a good one but this is consuming me and I can't keep track of my studies. 
I told that girl id always be there for her but i deleted her of social media amd ended the friendship not soo ling ago but I'm terrified I'm a evil person, do i have npd or am i being too harsh on myself again?
I've been told I overthink way too much, as you can see...",11Oct2020,1
251,"Sometimes when I get what I want, I become elated but also... terrified... like I don’t even know how to handle my own joy. In a way I painfully start to panic and parts of my joy even start to feel negative and like something I’d subconsciously try to keep myself from experiencing again.

252,"Whilst there is nothing inherently wrong with my sanity, it's been excessively deteriorating and it's withering away with every mental breakdown I endure. My lack of social connections and long history with depression as well as suicidal thoughts have led to an extremely destructive environment in which I've developed my psyche.

It's been 8 long and grueling years, I no longer have an appropriate sense of self. My true self has since long been buried deep, and the identity manifested through endless mental torment has consumed my being. I'm too far gone. I was diagnosed with psychotic depression 2 years ago when I first attempted suicide, and was put on medication. But happy pills and pointless therapy sessions can never rectify my complications. I'm an introspective person and through many years of contemplation and self reflection I've come to know most of the ins and outs of my mind, I've no more insight to gain from the vast majority of other people. 

I haven't held a proper conversation with anyone for over 4 years now. I'm all alone in this world, my time is nearing it's end. I'm since long ago desensitized to the idea of suicide, the only reason I'm still here is because I naively wish for a miracle to come save me.",11Oct2020,1

I told my therapist that I have this unhealthy habit of anytime my boyfriend and I have a fight and we resolve it my brain doesn't let it settle. I don't hold a grudge per say but I can't let go of criticisms and I hold onto them and try to use them to mold me but it simultaneously causes me to shut down and hate myself and feel panicky almost like even though my boyfriend says he is no longer mad and that I don't need to fix myself. I obsess and think he doesn't mean it, that he is holding back that he's actually mad at me or hateful and that he secretly wants me to change because I am so messed up and constantly fucking up.

He has NEVER said any of this. He has never given me any reason to think that he would ever keep anything secret from me-he's always been very straight forward if something I did upset him. He's never raised his voice, never been passive-aggressive and yet my brain just does not stop with the panicking and overthinking. 

I feel like the help I'm getting is literally none. Because I feel like there is no way to really fix this behavior and mechanism.

Ever  since I was little I have been disgusted/angered by the thought of my  parents having to rescue me/help me with something major/support me/save  me/etc. And I mean I am truly disgusted by it and not in a guilt kinda  way, but a rage kinda way. Like that vine of those two girls and then  the mom comes in through the door behind them and yells “Why does  somebody not know how to flush the toilet after taking a shit!?  DISGUSTING!” like that mom. I even think about how I would never want to  be in some kind of emergency or natural disaster with them, especially  not some kind of apocalypse, because of the likelihood of one or both of  them having to protect or save me. gag.

When  I was a little kid and we would play imaginary games and I remember  getting upset and screaming at my dad if he said something about saving  me from the imaginary scary monster or whatever we were “fighting”. My  parents recall my reactions to these situations because they were so  jarring and so different than my siblings.

Once  in HS I went for a run late at night and they didn't see me come home, I  went straight to my room, and so they went out to look for me. I then  came downstairs and they told me they were worried and that they had  looked outside for me. I can still remember the rage I felt when they  told me they did that (I didn't act on it or show it) and I hate  thinking about that memory to this day. I was disgusted by their concern  and the looks of relief on their faces. (Yes I am aware that sounds  psycho)

I also did not want them  to support me. For example I would never ever want them to come to my  sports games or my concerts, even as a young child, I would have  preferred to go alone. I even felt as if I did better without them being  there. I am graduating from college in the spring and I don't want them  to come to my graduation, even though I'm not going to stop them. In  April of this year I had an emergency appendicitis and I was SO GRATEFUL  that it happened during the COVID lock down so that my parents could  not come into the hospital and visit me. It was great!

Them  giving me compliments, telling me they are proud of me, or defending me  are other sources of discomfort for me. I feel like screaming “STFU!”  but of course I never would and always say “Thank you”.

This  feeling also translates into dealing with money. I don't like my  parents buying me things. And I'm not talking about big expensive things  like cars, I mean necessities like clothing (now that I am older it's  pretty much expected I buy my own stuff but this was the case even in  elementary school). I would always drive my mother crazy she says when I  was young because it was so difficult to shop for me because I was so  reluctant to have them buy me stuff. Even if I really wanted the item I  would still feel gross/bad about them getting it for me. I should  mention here that we were fine financially growing up. A majority of  these feelings around money have something to do with me not wanting to  be in debt to them, but a little also has to do with me being a  cheapskate. If I did some kind of favor/work for them, like painting or  yard work, then it was more ok. (Side Note: they are paying for my  college and i am ok with it, and am very grateful, I know it's  contradictory)

And it's more than  just being ""independent"". I can rely on and confide in a partner or  maybe a good friend. I don't feel gross or angry if a friend or partner  shows concern for me, in fact I like it! It's specifically family where  there is a problem. And the fact that it started at such a young age  (like 4 years old) is weird.

I feel a little like this with other family members too (aunts, grandparents, etc.) but I can stomach it much better.

And  I know what everyone is waiting for. Me to tell you about how terrible  my childhood was and how much abuse I got from my parents, but that's  not the case. Everything was fine. We were not poor, while I wasn't  spoiled, I had everything I needed and was never hungry. Nobody in the  family struggled with addiction. My parents rarely fought and are still  happily(?) married. We didn't move around a lot. I wasn't sheltered, but  my mother was a little protective (nothing crazy tho). We went to  church and had a community there (even though I am NOT religious now). I  was able to participate in clubs and sports and had friends. They  weren't super controlling. We rarely ever fought. They were not  aggressive, mean, or toxic. They let me express myself (even tho i was  pretty closed off to them) and they let me do what interested me. I  didn't experience anything extremely traumatic. Literally the most  traumatic thing in my childhood was probably the death of a pet. I had  the plain jane, vanilla, privileged, white picket fence childhood that  those in much worse situations dream of.

I  don't hate them, but I'm definitely very distant from them and don't  tell them anything or confide in them. I know if something ever really  bad happens to me, like i was assaulted i would NEVER EVER tell them. I  would go to the grave before telling them. Even the thought of having to  do something like that infuriates me. And the thing is I know they  don't deserve this. I know it looks like I probably have a very low  opinion of them but I don't think that's the case. They were great  parents and I'm treating them like they were abusive or neglectful. I  know they love me. I have tried to hide these feelings from them and  have never told them anything about it, because i know it would  obviously hurt them, but I am sure it shows.

And  there were definitely times when this wasn’t true of course. When I  went away to sleep away camp for the first time I was very upset and  didn't want to go. I also remember wanting my mother to come with me to  the bathroom at restaurants and such when I was young. And I have also  cried in front of my mother a few times, beyond being a toddler/baby.

Anyways  I'm dumping this here because it's been on my mind for years and I want  to know if anyone is in the same boat as me or if anyone knows if this  is called something specific or if it's triggered by something. Should I  seek help lol??",11Oct2020,1
259,"Hello good people of Reddit,

***TL;DR: I canceled my virtual therapy services 24 hours in advance instead of 48 hours. Now the therapy clinic is threatening to forward my account for unpaid services to a collection agency if I don’t pay them $180.00 for a therapy session that (a) I canceled and (b) obviously did not attend. What can I do?*** 

All of this happened in Ontario, Canada. 

A month ago I decided to be brave and finally fix the issues that are preventing me from leading a normal, happy life.

I sought therapy to treat deeply-rooted anxiety and excessive worrying.

I was paired up with a woman, whom I later learned had been hired only a couple of weeks before we started working together. This information was never disclosed to me, I found it online.

The reasons why I haven't sought treatment before September 2020: 

* $200 per session was too expensive for me;
* I was told that on average you need about 10 sessions to try to resolve an issue, but most likely it would be longer;
* It’s difficult to find the right therapist.

But then COVID happened. My issues grew deeper. Finally, I had to face it: I had to do something about it.

While researching the right clinic for me, I’ve realized that all therapists list the same specialties on their profiles. Anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, worrying, loss, grief...

How can you differentiate them? The answer is easy: you can’t.

So I selected a clinic that had a nice website, and social media, and several psychologists, thinking that those must be signs of some sort of expertise and that I would be in good hands.

I signed an agreement indicating that there was a 48-hour cancellation policy for all appointments. My session with the assigned therapist was priced at $180.00 per 50-minute sessions. All appointments were virtual.

After 3 sessions, I’ve realized that that woman was not what I needed. 

She would stay silent most of the time, including after I’ve made long tirades of painful memories to try to guide her and understand why I feel the way I do today (I have a fairly good understanding of myself and I thought we could make the work progress faster). She would then stare into the void for a good ten seconds, and ask a completely unrelated question.

I mentioned the financial aspect to her, and how much of a stretch it was for me. But she suggested that we meet each other weekly anyway. 

After my first session, that she cut short after exactly 49 minutes (""we only have one minute left""), I asked her what she thought of me. She refused to give me an answer. I thought that it must be part of a plan. 

On the following week, we had a technical issue. Once it was resolved (10 minutes in) we talked about technical issues and what-to-do-the-next-time-this-happens for another 10 minutes. 

I asked her if there were exercises or something similar that I could do during the week between our sessions to make progress - the answer was no.

I asked her if she had any comments about anything that I told her - the answer was no.

Soon I started to feel like she didn’t care, and more importantly, that she barely listened. I realized that maybe she wasn’t the right one for me.

I went on and explained how I felt to friends, who just confirmed what I thought, and after careful consideration, decided not to pursue my therapy with her.

I called the office on Monday\* to cancel my upcoming appointment on Tuesday, as well as all services. Since they didn’t pick-up, I followed up with an email.

They called me back and told me that since I gave less than 48-hour notice, they would charge me.

Since then, they have been sending me numerous emails/phone calls telling me that they would forward my account for unpaid services to a collection agency.

Don’t get me wrong: people should be charged when they are no-shows. 

I totally get that no-shows are bad for business, and are harming the correct functioning of any organization. But in that case, I did warn them that I didn't want to work with them anymore, and I did give them notice (about 26 hours of notice to be precise). If it was for a waxing appointment - sure I get it, charge me. But we are talking about mental health.

This has given me so much more anxiety. I haven’t been able to sleep properly. I feel like for once that I tried to get better, it came back to bite me on the a\*\*.

At this point, it feels like a scam.

They never were interested in me getting better. They want me to stay sick. And worse, they want to get my money even though there were no services provided. How do you justify requesting money for a service that was canceled and a service that was not provided? 

I read the full Code of Ethics of the Canadian Psychology Association, and there is a whole section on “Responsible Caring.” 

I feel like what they're asking for is unreasonable. Or maybe I am?

Am I overreacting? 

Am I too crazy to think that during a worldwide pandemic where everywhere we’ve seen spikes in depression and anxiety amongst people, canceling a therapy session 24 hours in advance is unreasonable? Even if there was an agreement stipulating 48 hours? 

In the specific case of mental health (compared to any other services), is there a different jurisprudence? Do I have any recourse? Is this an ethical question?

I never miss a bill payment. I never pay late. My credit report is spectacular. It feels unfair.

Thank you so much if you've read this post all the way - and Happy Thanksgiving if you are on Canadian soil :)

260,"Hello... I'm a 19 year old female college student and I'm not sure what's wrong with me... I don't even know where to start. I have been struggling with my mental health my whole life practically. It started around when I was 7 or 8 and I'd have these obsessive, intrusive thoughts in my head. Gruesome gory things, like imaginary hypotheticals, that i didn't want to think about. For a long time i thought i was a bad person for these thoughts. My family was Christian and they'd tell me that God knows everything, even one's thoughts, so I thought maybe God thought i was a bad person for having bad thoughts and je would send me to hell for it. Not only did I have the weight of my intrusive thoughts on my shoulders, but I'd also beat myself up over anything I did wrong. I didn't want to 'sin,' so whenever i hurt anyone, even on accident, I'd hurt myself 10x more than whatever pain I caused them. At the time, in my young childish brain, the thought process was ""If God sees me giving myself hell on Earth, he won't send me to hell because he saw I already did my time."" Later on i got depressed and suicidal over struggling with this. And i went to a psychiatrist but she never helped me, she just kinda gave up on me and started talking about random bullcrap. It was a huge waste of time and money.

I think that habit of beating myself ul definitely carried on into my current life. I'm no longer a Christian anymore. I still falli nto that pattern sometimes but definitely less than i used to, and I'm usually able to catch it and stop it. But there's this new pattern that I can't stop. Sometimes i just get super anxious, sad or angry for either no reason, or a really dumb one. I overreact, or just get suicidal out of the blue, it's like a switch flicks. I get very nervous for days, where I can't eat and my stomach hurts 24/7 and I can't seem to calm down. And it's not like bipolar because I'm not going from manic to depressed, I'm never manic. I just have normal happy relaxed days and then other days where I'm super sensitive or freaked out to the point where it's unhealthy. I don't know what's causing it. People ask  if I've been sexually assaulted/raped before but I have never been. There's no PTSD, it's just, all of a sudden something happens and I drown in these irrational feelings. I can tell myself they're irrational all I want but it doesn't matter. And I'm trying to get help but nothing's working. I'm trying to call a new doctor because i go to a pediatrician still now, but they never call me back, i always leave a voicemail, i can never get a hold of them. They never call me back. My mom thinks that everything is fine and kinda dismisses me when i tell her about my problems. I don't talk to my dad. My boyfriend understands my pain and is probably my biggest advocate. He wants to help me but doesn't know how, either. It's hard to get him to understand that i don't have a reason for it sometimes, and whenever I di have a reason it's an invalid one, and I know it is but can't help myself. I can't control my emotions. I just really want to get better, for him, because frankly he's the only reason why I'm still alive, I'm simply fighting for us. I want a happier life.


I'm not sure if i have depression, anxiety, or bipolar, OCD or all of the above. I don't know what's wrong with me but more importantly I don't know why this happens to me or how to control it.. If anyone knows anything I'm kinda getting desperate here. If you even just read all this, you're already an angel. I'm getting sick of fighting, I'm just so tired... thank you.",11Oct2020,1
261,"I quit my job because what happened at my workplace gives me creeps. After I quit my job, I learned my neighbors (I live in strata building with self-managed council and a remote strata manager) have been feeding my daily routines to my co-workers. It is a long story with so many incidence targeted towards me but I'll give a few examples that happened at work:  
1. I had an issue in my unit so I told my superior a few days beforehand that I needed a day off. I NEVER told my superior what the issue was. A couple days later, another co-worker said she had some issue in her apartment (which is the same as mine, but I didn't tell her that) and just went on and on like it REALLY happened. I got alert. Then contractors needed to come in the second time, I had to take another day off work. This time, I said I ""have some problems with my unit"" (still not going into specifics). But my superior said, ""just did what the other co-worker did"". But I've never told anyone what the problem was. Only my strata council and manager knew about this.

2. I ordered some diabetic supplies. It was shipped by a private courier so they couldn't access the mailbox. They had to stick a notice card on the door. ONE day after I received the notice card on my door and picked up the diabetic supplies parcel from the courier, another co-worker (not even in my department) STARTED a conversation with ""why would people get diabetes? I don't have diabetes"". And mind you, this co-worker's line of work has nothing to do with handling health related products. 

3. One day my superior came to me and just told me ""we are laughing at you"" (right at my face). I don't understand what happened because I was in the zone doing what I'm supposed to do. But after I quit my job, I realized what he meant. Before I started my employment, I had several serious mental breakdowns in the parking lot of my building at midnight (because I didn't want the noise to disturb my neighbors, it was a snowy winter and no one was around) and my neighbors' dash cam recorded the whole thing. Now I quit my job (good decision...), I realized what my superior meant. This neighbor had broadcast the videos to my workplace. 

These are just some examples and I wasn't overthinking. Is this what a strata council and strata manager do? To involve so much about your employment? What do I do if I am still living with these people?",11Oct2020,1
262,"I don't know where to start this off. It started off with me exercising every few days, then it became every other day, then it became every day, twice a day, or even more. Then came my eating, before the quarantine it was fine, great actually. But being home with my parents triggered the eating habits.  I didn't eat what I liked until I was alone, and even then I felt like crap for eating it. So then it started, starting to eat good, but then it because eating constantly healthy when I was to treat myself, I would start to get scared and ashamed, to the point where I would leave my family and go off to work out. Then it became the thing I was thinking about. I would spend the night before planning a meal for breakfast, planning in my classes what to eat for lunch, I would be constantly searching for recipes for a fat-free, low card, vegan, something that wouldn't make me ashamed of what I was eating. I don't even want to lose weight, that's the thing. My mind for some reason is making me scared of myself and I don't know what to do. It got to the point where I was making my sibling breakfast and wanted to make myself something, but my mind told me that I already had eaten too much when in reality all I had was water.

263,"I really need some help here, im just so confused hurt and feeling extremely guilty for leaving him. This is my story im sorry its so long, but thank you for taking the time to read

So two years ago I became a lot closer with, lets just call him P, a guy friend of mine since high school. During the first year, we became super close; I would go visit him at school all the time, we went on spring break together to visit another friend, constantly texting or with each other. I liked him, im not sure at what point these feelings developed throughout the first year, but he would give me such mixed signals. When I would go visit him sometimes he'd have me sleep upstairs with him and other times I was mandated to the couch downstairs as if sleeping in his bed was some kind of reward. Sometimes I would wake up and we'd be cuddling like full on spooning or his hands under my shirt wrapped around me. His behavior would also change depending if I had bought him or done anything for him that day, mainly bought. Not once did he pay for anything, I always did even both the concerts we went to that year. I come from an upper class family and a lot of my friend's don't have the same financial opportunity or flexibility as I do, money has never been an issue for me, so I try to help my friends out as much as I can which has backfired and ive lost and been taken advantage of in numerous friendships for it. It was different w P though, he wouldn't do anything, including eat or drive his car, unless I paid for it. Every time we'd go to Walmart or shopping somewhere he'd always somehow convince me to get him a new video game or some electronic. As summer came that year all of our friends were home including, lets call her M, the girl he had been hu with on and off for the past 3 years but would always deny anything between them and that he hated her and he was being manipulated into ""being friends"" with her. I used to be friends with M, and we never had any beef but disliked each other. One night I was at a party down the street from his house and long story short him and M were ""done"" because someone told her we were together. I walked over to his house to see what was going on and if he was ok. He had always been jealous of every guy I ever talked about either in past, present, friends or more. We went back to the party but only for 20 min because he was mad that I hugged my neighborhood friend to say hello. We went back to his house and started watching a movie and then bam we were having sex. No kissing, most clothing still on, and we didn't talk about it after at all. I was scared I was gonna lose him cause at this point I finally somewhat had the boy and best friend that I loved. We continued doing this all summer, no kissing and clothes on too. We go to school in the same city so when the semester started a few weeks later I was basically living w him. I went out with my friends the first two nights only to be called a slut and other shit by him so I stopped going out. Anytime I wanted to do something with my friends, he would get angry and call me a slut. He told me one day that we were ""exclusive"" but not to call it that or tell anyone and that he could still get w other ppl. At this point I tried ending things but he convinced me to stay and to agree that he could get with anyone else and if he wanted to he would tell me. M came to visit him springily which freaked me out, but he convinced me they were just friends and he didnt even want her visiting in the first place. He told me sex with her is no different than masturbating. I was heartbroken but I loved and trusted him. A few weeks later we went back home for fall break and M was in town and it was her birthday. He promised he was just going to go to her birthday dinner with their old friends and then sleepover at his best friend, J, house. Well he didnt, he convinced me that both him and J were too drunk and slept downstairs in the living room of M's house. That was the last time he saw he. We went back to school and our weird fwb relationship was quickly turning into a real relationship. We started kissing during sex, emotionally opening up to each other, but still our label never changed (labels aren't a big deal to me but I was deeply offended and insecure about it). He was still controlling, name calling, and taking advantage of me financially, but I loved him, he told me he loved me too, although we still weren't in a relationship. All of my friends hated him and he hated them too. Well he refused to even actually meet them, even though I was trying as hard as I could to maintain my friendships and not make him upset or jealous. One day in December, so seven months after we started having sex and four months after I moved in with him, P was napping while I was doing homework. I wanted to use his chegg account so I opened his laptop and all of his earlier text notifications started coming through, I know I shouldn't have looked but I am glad I did. Turns out he had been consistently hu w M for the past three years, they were in a relationship from the beginning of the previous year until he ended it bluntly after her birthday but they still talked everyday like the way he would text me. In the summer he would hang out with both of us all day and our other friends, but at night have sex w both of us without us knowing. When she came for a week in the fall and he claimed he didn't even want her there and she wouldn't leave, they had sex and slept together every night in his bed, which he called ours. After her birthday dinner he slept in her bed and she blew him the next morning. There are so many other little lies and manipulations I somehow believed and at points he made me feel crazy for questioning him. Basically he had a girlfriend the whole year we were best friends and cuddling and other shit without me knowing and then continued his relationship with her and started one with me. I packed up all my stuff from his house and moved it back into my basically empty dorm. He begged and begged and begged for me to stay with him and insisted that she was crazy and he didnt care about her. My friends from school, who didn't know him well but knew our relationship more so, had been concerned he was being Emotionally Abusive even before I knew about all the stuff with M, but my friends from home who knew him well but not as much about our relationship told me to stay w him ""if he just blocks the bitch"". 3 days and a lot of begging later, I was back at his house to talk w him about it and agreed to try things again. I was sincerely heartbroken for the first time, but my friends and his friends and him made it seem like not a big deal so I thought I was overreacting and being crazy for wanting to end it w P. So I didnt, I decided to give him another chance to rebuild the trust he lost because I still loved him. 3 weeks later, I became very ill out of the blue and no doctor could figure out what was going on. I continued to get sicker and P became my boyfriend/caregiver overnight. He would drive me to my classes if I was able to go, make me breakfast every morning and dinner at night, drive me back and forth from home, and became my only support system outside of my parents during that stressful, confusing, and scary time. I was dealing with so much shit: still trying to process and understand what had even happened w him and M, trying to regain his trust, my anxiety and depression skyrocketed, and I was slowing losing my friends because of my medical issues, they say it scares them which I understand, Covid hit, while trying to get good grades and keep up with my classes. P became overly loving to the point where I question if he even does love me or was scared of me leaving him. It was too much to handle for me and I knew it. I wanted to end it with P, I tried to numerous times, but he would convince me to stay and try harder to forgive him and make it work. This happened probably around 9 times from February to now. His jealousy and controlling issues continued, but he never gave me any reason to question his trust again, but I couldn't just let everything that happened w M go. I cried every night and still do frequently because I don't understand how he could do that to me, why he did it to me, and for letting myself be played like that for so long only to go back. I feel so guilty for not leaving initially and felt like I had been hurting him more and more eachtime he convinced me and I decided to stay. At the end of July I just couldn't handle it anymore. I felt responsible for his happiness and his mental health, I was going through a traumatic time of my own mentally and medically, I didn't really have any other friends left, and everything w M was still playing in my head all the time. We broke up for good that time but agreed to be friends because we still love and care about each other, but I needed to figure out my own shit and move on from the relationship. I was at my breaking point and couldn't be convinced to stay w him any longer even though I love and care so much about him. I felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders and no one was holding me back, but I felt and still feel extremely guilty for staying with him that long. My heartaches at the thought of me hurting him in any way. I tried, I really really tried. I wanted him to be the one, and I thought he could be the one. For the past few weeks he had been texting me a lot and sometimes flirtatiously, so I told him that we need to stick to the boundaries we set. He responded alright bye then and I haven't heard from him since. I know I need to let him and the situation go but I feel so guilty. I cant even describe it. I feel like I fucked everything up in his life with all the on and off, medical stuff, being so confused. I feel over the relationship but not him. I hate myself for loving someone so much who could lie, manipulate, and do all that for so long straight to my face, but at the same time I hate myself for hurting him and leading him on and going back each time. I don't want him back, I want to move on and stop feeling so guilty of hurting him and stop hating myself. Idek what answers im looking for, im still so confused on how it all happened to begin with and how I let it go on this long.",11Oct2020,1
264,"What a loaded topic. 

I have pretty bad social anxiety, which I know is a common problem for kids my age. I am in 8th Grade and have close to no friends. For some backstory, I had some severe physical health problems beginning in 6th grade, so I was only at school for the beginning months and was on Home and Hospital for the rest of the year. I only went a few weeks in 7th grade before going into a hospital program. I returned to some classes after that, which was nice. I made some school friends, but none that I could call after school or hang out with. With social anxiety as well as fear of a health  scare, I don't interact with anyone outside of school.

During the pandemic, I haven't really talked to anyone outside of Instagram or Snapchat. I don't know how to talk to people or make friends. It's hard! For the life of me I can't seem to make or keep plans. My few friends have stopped asking me to hang out because I cancel due to anxiety or physical health. I hate it. I need help. How do I talk to people? How do I not get anxious while talking to friends on facetime? HOW DO I MAKE AND KEEP FRIENDS??",11Oct2020,1

266,"I’ve read posts from people who finally moved out and cut ties from their abusive families. And for the longest time, I had been wanting to do that. I wanted to live off the grid or find a new identity. But now I’m in college and I’m working towards my career all the while battling my depression, anxiety and schizophrenia along with my borderline personality disorder. 

Would you say abusive parents should still be respected? Because ultimately, no matter what, they are the reason we’re alive today. 

Because i think my mind is a little twisted or maybe it’s not wired right. I feel like a loyal dog towards my family, my father who tried to kill my mom, my mother to told me to kill myself and my brother who makes fun of me for attempting suicide (several times). They call me weak and ungrateful. And my brother calls me “soft” and every time I try to reach out to him, he asks me if I’m gonna kill myself. 

In the end though, they’re still my family and I still love them. 

Do you think it’s right for my parents to do or say whatever to me because they were the ones who made me?

I always wake up feeling tired and exhausted but thats not the reason to why i am sad. i dont really know why. i just feel like im always forcing a smile or something and it annoys the fuck out of me. I have started to feel better and worse at the same time. Its hard to explain exactly what i mean but i am less stressed and sad but when i am its worse than before. this is also dumb but ive had a crush on a girl for a couple months and i asked her out and she said yes which is around the time i started feeling less sad, but now i always worry abt sounding like an asshole or doing something wrong. I get panic attacks so much more now too. its like 1 am rn, idk why im writing this but whatever. is it normal to feel like absolute garbage and not know why. its very hard for me to explain it because idk the cause. anyway this is my way of feeling better at night.

I feel like im a waste of a human. I have no values, no skills, no drive, no will, no good qualities. Im too sensitive, but im also a dickhead, im inconsiderate but i also overthink, i try not to make anyone feel bad but i managed to do it anyway. I dont have a best friend, i dont have a girlfriend, i dont have anyone whos actually interested in me. I dont blame them, i blame myself. I understand. I wouldnt be interested in me either. I feel like a character from a game whose maker decided to just move the scale into the negative on every quality or skill that i have. I dont have anything outstanding about me. Nothing interesting. Im boring, im unfunny, uninteresting, painfully fucking average, or worse. I cant even just hold onto one thing about myself which i know ill always have and use that to motivate me. I dont know how to make friends, i dont know how to talk to women without sounding like a fucking creep, i dont even feel equal to everyone else. I feel like everyones ahead of me, better than me, and worth more. Nobody would lose anything if i died. Nobody would miss me for longer than a week or two. Im wasting my life away but also not really because i dont think i have what it takes to have a normal one anyway.

The tiniest things make me angry, frustrated, depressed. I almost cried twice tonight for being misunderstood and offending people even though i just wanted to be nice. I cant get over things other people easily forget about. I overthink, i worry too much, i keep apologizing, i keep being a creep, im always horny, im always tired, im fat, im ugly, im annoying, im bored, im dumb as fuck. I need someone to tell me what the fuck is wrong with me. Please. Just tell me. Ill believe anyone but myself. Tell me how to stop this i just want it to stop. I wanna be normal, i wanna be someone. I wanna feel alive, i wanna want to live. I want to have goals, interests, a job, money, food to eat, people to talk to. I just want to be okay. I dont wanna be anxious, i dont want to feel like i need to impress people around me for attention. I want help but i dont want to ask. I want company but i dont wanna bother anyone. I want attention but i dont deserve it. Why waste your time on me...please tell me whats wrong with me",11Oct2020,1
269," —-I’ve been hurting my friends on purpose, the people I love the most, I’ve been doing this I know will make them cry and feel emotionally hurt, I know I would usually never do this and I’d regret it but I don’t feel like myself.——————————————————————
   I’m pretty sure this all started when one of my closest friends became suicidal again. She’s been suicidal in the past, but this time it was much worse. My friend lives in a different state and I cannot see her so we chat online. She told me her parents went on a vacation without her and left her home alone, she said she didn’t trust herself not to kill herself and that she was self harming. ——————————————————————
   She ghosted me for 3 days, I thought she was dead, if she was it would be so difficult for me to find out since she was in a different state. Every night I would be so terrified my closest friend would be gone when I woke up, that she could kill herself any second. I continued to try to text her but I got no response. I couldn’t sleep and I’m currently on 4 hours of sleep from the past night and 3 cups of coffee. Last night I even went as far as to praying to god to keep her alive and i’m not even religious. I even tried to speak to her telepathically well knowing it wouldn’t work. For 3 days and 2 nights I was so fucking terrified she would be dead any second.

——————————————————————
Now today I had still gotten no response, I went on an online game with one of my other close friends. She got into a fight with a random person who was obviously very rude to her, I defended the rude person not my friend, I called my friend’s argument pointless and unnecessary when she was clearly just defending herself. I knew my friend has anxiety and ADHD, I knew what I said to her would hurt her, i said it anyways, I felt like I didn’t give a damn. ——————————————————————Today I felt like I was in a complete different mindset though I wasn’t super sure why, The past other days I was afraid to loose everything and now I felt like loosing everything on purpose. I’m never like this, i’m usually a very empathetic person, today I was acting like my mentally abusive mom, who I would never strive to act like. ——————————————————————
Today my suicidal friend who I thought was dead texted me, she asked why my other friend is pissed, and she said sorry she had ghosted me and that she attempted suicide again. I have no idea why but I didn’t feel like I was relieved to know she was alive, I told her to leave me alone, knowing it would hurt her, knowing she was suicidal still. ——————————————————————I’m hurting the ones I love on purpose like my mom does, and it’s starting to get addicting but I don’t know why i’m doing this and how to stop.

271,"I don’t expect anyone to read this I just need to get this out somewhere because I can’t tell anyone how I’m feeling.

I (23f) have been quarantined with my entire family since early April. I live with my parents and siblings. I had had plans to move out after graduating college. Tried to save money. Tried to get a job in my field. Covid hit. And everything feels so over for me. 

Every day gets worse. I haven’t been able to see my therapist or contact my psychiatrist for refills. I don’t know why. But I’m off everything for the first time in over a year so my brain is extra out of wack right now.

I can’t talk about my mental illnesses with my family. I grew up emotionally neglected by them and they don’t understand mental health issues. They are the type to react with anger instead of just listen. So I’ve had to mask most of my life. Was fine before quarantine because I still had outlets. Friends, going shopping at goodwill, the beach, drinks at my favorite bar. Movies. House parties. Therapy appointments. My outpatient groups. And most importantly time ALONE.

I’ve been bottling everything up inside for so long because I can’t do any of those things I mentioned. And I’m starting to just get so burnt out and angry and irritated at everything it has been SO hard to not lash out at my family members. I just need a break. Every day there’s a weird pointless fight about politics or getting mad at each other for no reason. But I can’t get away from it.

I’m trying really hard to not snap and just start screaming at everyone. Even when they’ve done nothing wrong their presence is getting to me. Sometimes I wanna eat a meal by myself and not have to have a 2 hour discussion over politics. I’m starting to feel like I’m trapped in a cage and every day I feel like my life has hit a dead end and it feels pointless to even go on. Like what’s the point. I’m stuck here. Can’t ever afford to leave. Can’t do anything about it. 

But in the meantime I don’t wanna blow up on my family members and hurt someone’s feelings or even start another fight.

275,"I have fibromyalgia, OCD, PTSD, anxiety, depression, IBS etc etc etc. 

I'm struggling. I'm going to school for computer programming at my local community college after having taken a break from school for a few years. 

This is my 3d semester. 

I finally made the big leap and moved in with my boyfriend and a friend a few months back so I could get out of my parents' house, which wasn't a good place for my mental well being. This had been tremendously helpful since I don't have to deal with the stress of living with them (can be emotionally abusive) and my brother (special needs that aren't addressed properly so it's chaotic and triggers a lot of my issues). Unfortunately my roommate (not boyfriend) has some issues that are making it difficult to live with him. 

I want to do well in school, my OCD practically forces me to do well. Not having A's in classes or perfect scores gives me anxiety and makes me feel like a failure. 

Lately I've been having trouble even turning my homework in on time, attending the online lectures, or even doing the readings. Part of it is I'm not in physical classes - which I don't want to be in due to Covid - but at the same time, they are helpful for my learning. 

I'm exhausted emotionally and physically. I've been sleeping a lot and unable to get out of bed. My stomach has been a mess and I've been having Ibs flare ups like crazy. 

One moment I'm happy, the next moment I want to die. 

I've been clean from self harm for years, but lately all I want to do is hurt myself. 

I've been thinking about death a lot. I'm not going to kill myself, but I really want to some days. 

I don't want to apply for disability services at school because I don't see myself as disabled. But the way all of these issues are impacting my life, I feel like I am. I just don't want to be considered a lazy liar. 

I haven't seen my family in weeks because I've been too busy, and I miss my dogs. 

I've been smoking more weed for my pain, my lack of appetite due to antidepressants, my anxiety, and my need to just get through the fucking day. 

I'm dehydrated, living on sugar, and gaining back wright I lost. 

I feel like there aren't enough hours in the day to get done what I need to, but at the same time I'm wasting those hours mindlessly scrolling (and feeling guilty about it) or sleeping (and feeling guilty about it). 

My house is a mess and it's triggering my OCD and anxiety. But I barely have the energy to clean. I feel like I have to clean it because I don't trust my roommate to do it properly, and it isn't really my boyfriend's mess. 

I feel lazy. I feel exhausted. I feel scared because of Covid and the election. I feel like I'm floating. 

I have a therapy appointment tomorrow and I can't fucking wait. 

I have homework due tonight that I'm probably just going to ignore because I just worked for about 2 hours and even though it isn't that much time to be doing homework I'm exhausted. 

And I feel guilty for being tired.

283,"I find it hard to go to anyone about my problems and the few I do; something always go wrong. This has taken a toll on me and it’s only getting worse. My last major self harm incident (I’ve punched myself a lot recently but I don’t consider it as major) was when I gave myself 20 cuts that looked like cat scratches.


Mom- doesn’t like when I go to people like doctors or school counselors. Says it might get me in trouble and things along those lines. Once told me about my self harm “why did you do that? Were you caught in a lie?”. I can’t talk to her because...I think she’ll think I’m dramatic :(. Adults come from a different generation than gen z and have different morals. They often use the “Ive been thorough/and or more than what you’ve been through” or “you’re a kid what do you know?” Which she literally told me when she found out I was pansexual. “Watchu you know about some pansexual?” I’m not stupid okay! My age doesn’t qualify things like that! In fact this is a common age for people to learn about love and orientation.

Dad- he doesn’t talk to me a lot :(. He makes some small conversation about buying the latest Nintendo console or shows me dogs (since I like those two things). That is if he talks to me in the first time. I never go to him about personal stuff.

Siblings- I’m too quiet and scared. I’m  the youngest in my family and they were adults so they were out the house most of the time. When I could walk and talk they weren’t around a lot; they visited of course. I remember talking to them at a younger age but now? I’m such a mute and rude person around them :((. I feel like I’ll mess up around them; maybe by spitting while I talk or talking the same time they do.


Friends- they all leave, something always goes WRONG. I had a friend that made me look like this bad person when all I wanted to do was stop our fighting. She made friends want to fight me; caused a friend to tell me “you make a big deal out of small things” no I don’t!; if anything the girl who caused all this is doing that/ or we both are and I’m not the only bad guy :(. I’ve had friends guilt shame me and say “do you know how it feels”. I’ve had friends give simple responses or change the subject. I do that too sometimes but I always find a way to make it up to them. I’ll help them with their issues; sometimes behind their back. I once threw a party for my friend because I knew she had so much wrong in my life. 



School counselors/teachers- a few reasons, one of them being self explanatory if you’ve read the part of this rant about my mother. They also may not have the energy to help me since I’ve come to them so much. A friend once told me “Y’know they’re tired of us? I saw one of them sigh”. I’m sorry I’m that weak and bothersome; I didn’t know I always cry to people that much :c. Last thing, they may not know how. A lot of students say this about counselors. 


Pets- yeah...I’m that pathetic. When I was younger I used to pull my dog in the closet and cry when my parents fought. I still kinda do that. If an animal is around me and I’m sad; I feel like they’ll do what all those pet articles say. Apparently pets can sense when you’re sad and may even do something. I don’t remember them ever doing anything though... I’ll just look to them in hopes at least THEY can help me.


I just don’t know anymore. I’m so nonchalant and so Un-nonchalant at the same time (I care and don’t care). My voice and face are low and monotone. I feel trapped :(... A lot of these people above I’ve mentioned have even came out and asked me if I’m fine but I feel like it’ll do no good so I say “I’m fine”. I love these people I’ve mentioned dearly but it’s so hard to talk with them...it’s my fault for being weak. People say I want attention...maybe that’s true. I’m not getting proper attention or any at all and it’s causing me to cry out to people. Either that or it’s simply that I’m a bad, selfish person...I feel like people hate me and I’m a burden all the time anyway. They probably think of me the way I think of myself.",11Oct2020,1
284,"TW: ED, SH, Suicidal thoughts

When I think i’m getting better with my mental and physical health something happens and it just goes straight back down hill. And fun thing is, i’m not open with my therapist:) so I have no one to talk to. Yeah, I have friends, but I really don’t want to become a burden to them so i’ve stopped talking about things with them. reddit is literally the only place I can be completely honest so yeah i’m gonna rant.

i’ve been denying it but for the past few months i’ve been obsessing over food and portions and weight. I’ve lost around 15kg because of not eating, and it’s sick but that makes me feel okay? like i’ve always had issues with my body, people have always made comments so i’ve just grew up hating it. Even now, the weight I would be so happy with a year ago, I see no change, at all. I look in the mirror and still see the same pathetic fat loser who stood there a year ago. Right now i’m eating tops two meals a day, but the portions aren’t my usual so i’m
hungry all the time. 

I started sh again, a relapse after over a year. and it’s bad now, like scars that are gonna be with me forever. I just do it to escape what’s in my mind, bring me back to reality, prove i’m still here. It helps, but it’s addictive and i’ve stopped feeling the pain from it.

I tried to kill myself a month or two ago, or maybe I just tried to turn off my thoughts and didn’t care about the consequences. All day every day is just thoughts on why i’m still alive and how i’d be so much better off dead, emotionless, not breathing.

288,"Hi,

I've no idea where I am right now, mentally. Idk if I am doing ""well"" or what that means. I feel succumbed to being this way - always feeling sad. I don't feel it when I am distracted or with someone else. 

In the past days or week I've thought that maybe I am making this feeling up, and I don't actually feel this way. I can't trust what I feel and I can't trust me. I feel like I am attention seeking and making it up. I don't understand it and I really want to. What is that feeling?",11Oct2020,2

My name is Naomi and I'm an undergraduate student, currently working on my honours project.   
I've decided to do my project on the effects social media has on mental health. I would appreciate it if you could spare 5-10 minutes to take this survey, as it would help me collect the data necessary for my research.  
The link for the survey is:  [https://survey.napier.ac.uk/n/zz6k7.aspx](https://survey.napier.ac.uk/n/zz6k7.aspx)   


Thank you loads!

291,"I’m a 55 yo divorced woman with adult kids. I’ve been on voluntary leave from my dream career all year (Covid) and have now been laid off indefinitely. I’ve been living off UE and will have health insurance until the end of the year. 

I feel utterly lost in life. I finally landed my dream job five years ago that also was my lifestyle, and now it’s gone. I feel hopeless in finding other work at my age that I can be as passionate about and that would afford me the flexibility I value. I’m dreading even looking for a conventional job. I know I should be dating, as the thought of growing old alone isn’t appealing, but I don’t feel I have anything to offer someone in my current frame of mind. 

I have some equity in my condo and would love to just sell it and move away to Europe or somewhere for a new start, but both my parents are in the area and have advanced dementia and I know I can’t leave. My 18 yo nephew also just moved in with me to get out of a bad situation at home and I’m glad I was able to help him, but now I’m really stuck. 

I’ve been to counseling which helps somewhat. I’m sure I’m depressed, but I’m sure it’s situational and I really don’t want to go on medication. 

This is partly a vent but I welcome any input. Thanks!",11Oct2020,1

I never want to do anything. I’d rather lie in bed on my phone or use the Xbox. I have this constant, crushing tiredness. I feel like people want too much from me, even if it’s not true. Hanging out with people stresses me out, id way rather not do it. Forming relationships is even worse. I’d rather be single for eternity than deal with the discomfort and demands that come with a romantic relationship, the invasion of my personal space. Almost every day I wish I could just put the whole world on pause and spend ten years doing absolutely nothing, and then press play and no time would have gone by. I feel that life is much too hard. I’m sick of working. I got my first job at 16, and I’ve pretty much been working ever since, except a few years where I went to community college before dropping out. School was just as hard as work. It was just a blur of exhaustion and mental strain. I can’t seem to get anywhere in life. I’ve been saving up for two years and all I have is 4000 dollars. That’s not enough for the new car I need. I never have enough even though I work and work and work. And I never have energy, though I drink four cups of coffee or more daily. I’m just so sick of the demands on my time. I feel like a slave to everything around me, like I haven’t spent one day being free and happy. I’m so anxious all the time, it’s like I’m locked in my own head. Making appointments, phone calls, replying to text messages, cleaning, it’s all nearly impossible for me. I often wish I could just sleep for a month straight. Wtf is wrong with me?",11Oct2020,1

My dad is a HUGE control freak and very spastic. He wants everything done his way and if it’s not done his way, it’s the highway. He is extremely judgemental and is always making negative comments. 


Whenever I get into an argument with him, no matter how small he gets all defensive whenever I disagree with him or stand my ground with him. He takes these situations to heart. He takes it as I’m disobeying him and basically saying “fuck you dad” whenever I don’t follow his orders. There a lot of examples of small instances where my Dad gets all defensive and makes me feel guilty



He doesn’t understand the concept of free will. I’m 21 and I still don’t have a license because he doesn’t want me driving. He basically won’t let me get a license until HE feels IM ready. It makes me feel like shit because I know I’m completely capable of driving but he projects his fears on to me and makes me feel like I’m not capable. He says stuff to try to make me afraid of driving

“It’s no joke out there. You’re driving a death machine!  You can’t trust other people won’t kill you out here”

I can’t ever drive with him cause he’s such a intense back seat driver 


Another  example today my Dad told me not to take a shower because there’s an issue with the water. He started beating a dead horse about it and said it like 20 times.  But I felt so gross I just had to shower I couldn’t take it anymore. So I took like a 3 minute shower. I was in and out without him even knowing. Later on he once again reminded me not to take a shower because I don’t know how to take a quick shower and I always take forever. So I got annoyed and snapped back “I already did take a shower!” I feel awful for  how I responded and I’m overwhelmed with guilt 


Another example is this weekend I was going to visit a friend for his birthday. My friend used to take a lot of LSD and my dad knows this. So before I left he got all suspicious and kept beating a dead horse saying “you’re not doing acid right?? don’t let him talk you into anything. Don’t do acid. Don’t do it. I know how these things go, it’s his birthday and he’s gonna wanna trip.” He just kept going on and on and on it’s very intense and exhausting to listen to him beat a dead horse like this. I don’t know why he thinks im gonna do acid. 


It bothers me he doesn’t trust I won’t do acid. I’ve promised him countless times I won’t do any hard drugs and I barely even drink. I don’t know why he thinks I’m gonna do acid. It’s like he’s projecting his fears on to me. I wish he’d see me as a responsible adult who can make his own decisions.",11Oct2020,1
295,"It’s like a feeling of numb but there’s so much pain. I hate getting help and talking to people about my feelings I guess it’s just I’m too used to pain that I don’t feel the need or feel like I’m worth all the trouble of getting me help. It’s a feeling of coldness like I’m not wanted and Ik I’m not wanted people have made that clear to me. I seem to fu*k everything up and I can’t do things anymore. I can’t cry, I can’t cut, I can’t cope, I can’t feel. It’s like I’m not in reality like I’m in a dream nothing really seems real to me everything seems like it just didn’t happen like I’m in a dream. Idk I’ve been harming myself in anyway possible though cutting my hair and wrists, touching hit things, not eating for days, hyperventilating till I feel like passing out, chewing my cheeks till it bleeds, grinding my teeth, picking at my skin on my nails and really any way I can just feel something. I want to give up so bad but I know that when it gets to it I won’t because I can’t do anything. I’m ready to die but I won’t go.

I run cross country. I can’t help but feeling like shit. I really don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m never going to get back in full shape (one of better runners on the team, junior and senior year is my chance to really become one of the top runners). I feel like a dry dirt pit with crumbling sides that keep crumbling into itself. My parents are supportive but realistically I can’t do anything for months. I also feel shitty because I spend all my time outside biking, skating, running. All I can do is sit in my bed which FUCKING SUCKS (&lt; sorry). I can’t help like feeling all of my teammates will always be better and I can never reach my real level again.

297,"I just need to be able to speak my mind and I don’t have anyone I can talk to about this so here you go.

So this summer, I was hanging out w this guy. I thought I really liked him and my lonely self had sex w him because I wanted to feel loved.

Well. He wasn’t very nice to me sometimes. He wouldn’t stop or go slower when he was hurting me during sex. He wouldnt take no for an answer when I said I didn’t want sex, he would keep trying (i said no like 10 times) until I got upset and said “you never take no for an answer” and he got mad at me for that. He’s made me have sex this way. He almost anally raped me, I said no and he said he didn’t care and he was doing it anyways but then he stopped for some reason. Probably because he couldn’t get it in. One time he pulled my hair so hard during sex I said “stop that’s too hard” and he pulled even tighter and I cried afterwards and he said it’s probably because i feel like a slut. He called me a slut and a whore a lot. He’s forced me to suck his dick. Hes forced me to do that so i could get a drink of water.

I don’t know how to feel about this. I feel sick to my stomach thinking ab dick and having sex w men now. I feel so upset with myself because I thought he liked me and it’s my fault that he did all this. I feel guilty. I want to die",11Oct2020,1

Maybe there’s a solution to this that’s right in front of me. Or maybe its just false hope. Idk what to think anymore.

Even tho I feel this way It's been hard to talk about, this being the first time because no one I know knows about this account. I always smile when I don't feel happy and TBH it seems RN I'm not living just existing and walking where life takes me.
