0,"I am totally exhausted. I can't seem to recover. I was off work on Monday for Easter and called in sick yesterday cause was unwell. I was hoping that by two days total rest I would regain some form of energy. Nope.

I sleep between 9 and 10 hours a night. At bed at 8 pm. I take pills for sleep, Zopiclone And Quetiapine. Whatever you say against them, they saved my life. I eat well. Work has been intense, 7 days a week, in the past month, with workload increased because of pandemic. I'm working mostly from home. I'm quite isolated. I live alone and didn't see any human being since Friday except for the grocery delivery guy.

I've had depression and anxiety issues for several years. In the past year, it was going much better, finally some stability in my life after some job and apartment problems. I found someone also, but we are now in a long distance relationship. Not able to see each other now because of the situation. But it greatly help to bring some balance in my life. But been working a lot. Maybe it's catching back on me.

In the last days, I've had this huge brain fog. Trouble to move, like this very heavy weight against me. I feel like my face is being stretched by ghost hands. Not sure how to describe it exactly.

I'm not sure what to do. My hours are flexible as long as the job is done. I tried to alternate between naps and work..I'm just so so so tired.

Just I be off work for some time? That would be bad for my finances, I can just make ends meet with my actual revenue. That's a stress also.",16Apr2020,1
2,"Does anyone know how to tell if you just have extreme anxiety or if it is actually crossing over into something more?

4,"Need some advice on a situation for a close friend of mine.

Him and his ex-girlfriend broke up. The day before the breakup they were arguing and she was crying and begging for him not to leave her, because apparently he was getting close to leaving because her behaviour is controlling and abusive (would scream at him, kick his car, hit him at times, etc). The next day, she broke up with him. He tried to reconcile but it never happened. Now it's important to note, everytime they argue, he always apologises and takes the blame. He treats her well; he is always at her place, picks her up from nightouts, and spoils her (£1050 Tag watches, £200 Gucci belts, £100 MK heels, etc).

Anyway he has really had enough and hasn't contacted her in roughly 10 weeks, to which I am positive she is surprised at. They were together for three years.

BUT this is where the concern comes into it. Her social media is very much about a perceived lifestyle of expensive gifts and nice restaurants. Obviously all provided by him and he is no longer there to provide it. About 3 weeks after the breakup it started. First she did makeup like the joker, then as an evil nun, then as a clown holding knifes and now as a witch. This is totally unlike her and odd to say the least.

Although he is concerned (I told him about this), I must admit I am too. He always suspected her to have BPD or bipolar due to her mood swings and unreasonable, not proportionate or necessary reaction to life's little obstacles. I am fascinated by how someone can change so easily.

Any ideas?

I don’t want to exercise, play video games, have a beer with my family, or do any of my hobbies. Nothing. 

The only thing I could imagine making me breathe a sigh of relief right now would be waking up far away from everything in another part of the world for a little while. 

None of these things that could blow up my life have happened, I’m just terrified that they’re all going to happen at once.

12,"Hi I'm (28, M). Recently, I came to a realisation that I have started to get angry a lot. Smallest of things upset me. If things do not happen the way I want it to be, then I get angry and I tend to get into an argument with my loved ones. Also, I get more prone to throw my anger at those who are really close to me. For example, if I'd ask someone to make a cup of coffee for me and they did not pour it in the cup I wanted them to put in then I'd get so furious and out of control. I'd fight with that person verbally and not drink the coffee and because of this the whole day of mine would get ruined. I'd not be able to have a conversation with anyone for a whole day, if I do talk to anyone I'd end up having useless quarrels with them too. I know my behaviour isn't right and I shouldn't be like this but I'm unable to control this. After all the arguments, I also feel major heaviness in my head with a bad headache and then after few hours or days (depends on the severity of the situation) a feeling of slight regret comes that because of me some people had to go through so much. I've had this problem since 2 years after my bad breakup (do not want to go into the details but the breakup was the worst thing in my life). I don't know if it's realated to my past or that I'm going mad. Even while I'm typing this I've a really bad headache.
If anyone of you has ever faced such issue or know someone who has or had this problem then please help me! I don't know if this is the right platform to talk about this or not so forgive me if this isn't supposed to be posted here.",16Apr2020,1
13,"I feel like I'm not living up to my potential. I feel it is also too late for me to succeed or be someone I love. I feel like I've wasted so much time in my life worrying, stressing, being depressed and anxious, worrying about what that person might think of me, assuming everything will go wrong, assuming the worst, assuming I'm simply not capable enough to do something, that I've never learned who I am or what I truly want for myself. 

I don't know much about myself or even anything in general. I'm extremely ignorant. I have no knowledge of the world that I probably should. I'm not sure if it's because I doubt my ability to learn, so I don't. Or if I'm just stupid.

Deep down I know I'm capable of achieving great things for myself, but I have these negative thoughts and feelings and doubts that are always lingering. Thoughts and feelings that I'm not good enough, smart enough, attractive enough to achieve anything. I think and feel this way about myself which leads to not taking action because I believe I won't succeed anyway. Which then sort of becomes a negative self-fulfilling prophecy. I think I can recognize that it's all mainly ""in my head"" or something, but It still feels so real.

I need to get out of this negative cycle so I can fucking do something with my life. I'm 19 and I have literally done nothing with my life. Not exaggerating at all. I have never been employed and I'm a high school dropout. 

It's like I just exist and I'm not actually living.",16Apr2020,2
14,"my mental health has sucked for years.  i started restricting calories at 14/15, self-h\*rming at 16, and have generally struggled with what I think is depression and possibly anxiety for years.  i'm 19 now and still struggle a lot, though more off and on.  i'm also not trying to self-diagnose, maybe im just a wimp idk.  

i come from a very religious home, so all through my growing up there was never much talk about mental health and such, so my family knows almost nothing.  i don't think they meant to make it such a taboo topic, its just one of those things where a lot of christian's, not all but a lot, respond to mental health issues by giving the impression that your faith is lacking and that's why you are struggling.  (i'm still a Christian and truly my faith has helped me out of some very dark places, I just don't think that your faith is the only answer.)

 so here's my issue.  my mother mentioned multiple times through my teenage years that she struggled with depression in college.  she has also struggled with her weight/body image and I believe that she most likely had some disordered eating thoughts/habits.  my older sister struggled with bulimia in college and into her adult life as well, so there definitely seems to a pattern.  knowing all of these things, i feel like as a parent i would have discussed mental health a lot more to my younger kids and made sure they knew they weren't alone, could get help, etc.

fast forward to my teenage years, and me and my mom definitely did NOT get along.  i was homeschooled my kindergarten through twelfth which was honestly just not healthy for our relationship and created a lot of tension and distention between us.  most of my childhood memories were wishes to be her favorite child, for her to love me, etc.  i was definitely my dad's favorite child and we made jokes that were really true throughout much of my growing up and into the current day.  i truly believed she didn't love me and would never love me, and it made it so i never talked to her or was around her if i didn't have to be.  

this was definitely a contributing factor to my struggling mental health as i entered my later teen years, but i also just had incredibly low self-esteem and hated myself as a person.  when my mother noticed that i was maybe not eating a lot of food, she sat me down with my dad (whom i love so so so much but was mega clueless lmao) and began to talk about me not eating and if i was having disordered eating thoughts, etc.  and then she told me ""your sister struggled with bulimia, and i just can't handle that again.""  

i don't think ill ever be able to forgive her for that statement.  to look at your child and basically tell them that even if they're struggling, as a parent you just can't handle it and need to suck it up? am i wrong to still be upset about it?  the more i think about it the more i just can't even believe that you would look at someone who clearly hates themselves so much that they are literally starving themselves and basically tell them they can't struggle because someone else in your family already struggled with something similar a long time ago.

after that, i feel like i just really fell apart. i felt so unloved i started self-h\*rming and eventually tried to commit several times later that year.   they have no idea that i still struggle with self-h\*rm to this day, and the one time my mom saw the scars on my leg she just looked at them, rubbed a finger over the corner of one, and then when i pulled my shorts down she never asked me about them.

i didn't realize until i talked to my best friend a few months ago that most parents would have asked about them or discussed mental health issues if they had seen physical evidence.  my best friend knows more about my mental health than anybody in my family.  

i don't really know why i typed this all out.  i guess to just know if i'm unreasonable for still being angry?  is it wrong to think i have depression?  does the pain and loneliness ever go away?  will my mental health struggles always be such a constant battle?",16Apr2020,2
15,"I was going through pictures on my phone and saw a bunch where my hair and make up were crazy, I was drawing weird stuff and other things I did while I was manic. Experiencing mixed feelings on whether I should delete them or not. On one hand, they don’t make me feel good, but on the other I guess I could say I’ve come pretty far. Thoughts on whether I should just take the time to go on a pic deleting spree or should I just leave them? Ugh. Thanks.",16Apr2020,6
17,"**Description:**

I wake up feeling weird and generally in a low mood. I have these dreams, I can't quite recall all of them but upon waking they feel taxing to me. Sometimes their vividness scares me, for example, although I can't remember now, the music I heard in one of them felt very hallucinogenic if that makes sense.

The persistence in my low mood generally spans through the day. I try to work and concentrate, but find it incredibly hard. There's this ringing in my head that doctors have put down to tinnitus, for reference I'm age 22 Male and physically healthy. Although I hope it's tinnitus, the ringing first accompanied my decline in mental health. It brought with it brain fog, a perception that overall my cognition such as memory and intelligence has diminished. I can easily sleep 10hrs in a day. This ringing ultimately feels like it connects my symptoms. The ringing comes from my head. If I put my hand over my right ear, it doesn't seem to be prevalent. If I do it over my left ear it becomes apparent, but it sounds like the source is coming from the back of my head.

I used to have a very vivid imagination when going to bed, able to conjure up all sorts of stories. That seems to have gone now. When I close my eyes and sleep, it feels like nothing. Although it's not nothing. It's more lack of control and power in imaginative thought to what I used to have when going to sleep. Thoughts sometimes come to me, none of them disturbing, but then 30 seconds later it passes and I can't recall what I thought. Kinda like memory amnesia but only as I'm closing my eyes trying to sleep. This worries me quite a bit. It doesn't happen with every thought, but sometimes it does occur.

Fortunately, panic attacks have stopped occurring. When they did I got this sense of impending doom and kind of isolation from the environment. At some points, I thought I was going to pass out or start losing control of my mind - ie perhaps hallucinate, lose the sense of what and who I am.

I've never had what I considered 'mental problems'. In fact, if you asked me last year I'd be confused as to someone's struggle. But there's definitely been a transition from normal to this, and that scares me. This ringing in my head leads me to worry about my health as well.

1. I know what I said is very broad and vague, but how can you diagnose something you can't see? This is my first question?
2. Can anyone relate or perhaps suggest what my problem could be? If it was depression, I think there would be some satisfaction in that because I can look into treatment. But I don't know if ringing in heads and sleep issues can be related to this or not.
3. **There is no physical pain. All my symptoms are mental.**",16Apr2020,1
18,"I’m a loser in my own sense, that’s not what this is about. I grew out all my hair and I still get shit from people, even more than I used to. I look this way because for the first time in my life I can look in the mirror and feel like I’m not completely ugly. I still feel like nobody could possibly love me, and even if they did I’m too uncomfortable with myself and my body to do anything. But that’s also besides the point, the fact that when I feel the least bit of comfort with myself makes me feel like I’m crazy. Like I can’t even look good without criticism. Some of it’s funny and I take lightly, being called captain red beard (blond hair red beard) and Benjamin Franklin. I find those funny, but being told I look disgusting, and look like trash, I look like a loser (guess i fit the part quite well) and that I look like a dirty hippie, it hurts man. I’m sick of this, but people don’t care, nobody cares if they hurt me, and to be honest why should they, I probably do look ridiculous and dirty. Why is life so hard man?",16Apr2020,15

20,"I have a history with mental illness. Now, I use that word “illness” not as a call for pity or to induce shame but to remind myself that I, in fact, have a disease and need to treat it as such. If I need to call out sick from work because I can’t get out of bed, THAT IS OKAY! We need to be gentle with ourselves. We need to remember that sometimes we can’t completely control the chemicals in our brains yet, we can take steps towards finding tools to help us cope in a healthier way. The “illness” aspect does NOT mean that recovery isn’t possible. When I say “recovery”, I don’t mean cured. This isn’t always possible for most mental health issues and guess what? That’s okay. We can still live fulfilling lives.  

I am not a therapist, expert or anything of the sort. I’m just a human who has struggled. I want to share this to bring us closer together. I can’t save anyone’s life. I’m not a knight in shining armor but I’m hoping these dialogues will inspire people to be proactive about their healing and hopefully want to stay on this earth a little(much) longer. \*\*\*My only qualification for creating this space is my experience, strength and hope. 

Tiny bit about me: I was born and raised in Burbank, California- in Los Angeles County. I’m really close to my family. I am beyond blessed. I did have a family member who struggled with extreme mental health issues and it affected my childhood heavily. This was the first appearance of mental illness in my life, as I grew older, I found, I too, have mental health issues. Confronting this fact was not easy AT ALL. So, don’t feel weak or ashamed if you’re having trouble reaching out. The first step, as you’ve heard many times before, is admitting it to yourself. You’re not defective due to this fact. 

Fast forward- I started having panic attacks in high school and then, quite suddenly, in my senior year of high school, my best friend died. This was a traumatic turning point in my life. Scientifically, some of us have a pre-disposition for mental health issues and trauma can trigger the manifestation of these issues. When Sam died, Bipolar disorder and alcoholism/addiction showed up. I was out of my body-completely out of touch with reality. Night terrors, extreme depression, suicidal ideation, disassociation,  angry/sad mood swings, couldn’t get out of bed. Started drinking heavily and using drugs. My life was, needless to say, a fucking shit show. 

This experience started a 7 year sprint of depression without any breaks. I attempted suicide while I was brown out drunk. I parked my car in the middle lane on the freeway and prayed to God a car would hit me going 80mph. My using became more constant and by the 7th year, I was pretty much always fucked up. Couldn’t shower, interact with people, eat, or do anything else without being utterly loaded. 

I learned so much about life and myself through my young adulthood. All of that pain has made me into this strong, empowered woman I am today. 

One great thing came out of that phase in my life. Well, two actually. I got my degree in social justice theater. For my thesis project, I interviewed 30 people with mental health issues and created, co-wrote and directed a play about their struggles. It was filmed. I’ll put the link at the bottom. It was so powerful and created a community of support. 

The second incredible thing that came out of all of this was, I got sober and now I can confidently say, I am the happiest, healthiest I have ever been in my entire life. I am finally identifying and healing all the shit I was running from. Trauma, ego, flaws, pain I caused myself and other people. Like, holy shit people, I am a different human. 

Bottom line, no matter what you have been through, there is hope for healing. I’m not saying it’s easy; nor am I trying to invalidate your pain. I’m just saying, you are absolutely not alone and this movement is about recognizing that and healing.",16Apr2020,1

22,"I have seasonal cycles but explaining would take more time and effort. I also have a relationship cycle that last almost always 2 years but don't wanna talk that just yet. So I present to you my daily bi-polar cycle from  logical anxiety to delusional bliss.  

 I have been told by counselors that the more accurate, healthy, and happy thoughts are upon awakeing because of being refreshed and no stressors from the day yet. I downright disagree in my case or atleast the happy and healthy part. I have a very consistent daily fluctuation of my thoughts and moods.

I always waking up in instant rigid thoughts of my life's worst current situation and how can I fix it. Then the surging restless energy that feels like I am going to spontaneously combust if I'm not in a constant state of extreme movement making most morning task seem unfathomably slow and painfully. I started bicycling in the morning to offset the energy. By mid-morning to noon the search for the magic solution to my life's current crux is turning into bone crushing anxiety of the future if I don't fix the problem or the doubts of myself overwhelm any decent solution down to nothing but hoping the problem fixes itself.


Noon things start to level off and I can start mundane tasks of cleaning, shopping, personal hygiene and errands. I don't like to hang out with friends till after 330 especially if there newer peeps. Girls that spend the night are forewarned and can leave early, try to help, or the usually sleep late. I am a night owl and socialize best at night. It's amazing how the closer to night these feelings morph to a polarizing state of looser less abrasive thought cycles with a fluid flow of calmer energy of getting lost in details of situations and not rushing through just to be done with the burden. The only drawback is my thoughts seem to lose structural integrity and become more leaps of intuition. 

This polarized metamorphosis is complete by my favorite part of everyday which is laying down before sleep and letting my mind melt into subliminal states of thought all making sense till I focus on what I was just thinking and it turns into a spaghetti mess of logic and in trying to put the pieces together I slip back into the subliminal flow an wander off further down the rabbit hole. With wild emotions flowing through my senses I could never explain or even felt before in my day mindset. Then sleep and if I'm lucky wake up atleast 3 times to do the process over. Infact I crave this sensation so much that half my addiction to meth was not just the high/rush it was coming off a binge leaving my mind and body exhausted but still unable to fully sleep then laying down in a dark room to induce the subliminal flow state for 8-12 hours according to the clock anyways. Lol seems to be seconds to epochs to my mind. 

TL;DR - I wake up in anxiety &amp; rigid logically forced thinking and the closer to sleep I get the more calm &amp; thoughts flexible and more ""delusional"". I prefer the latter by alot. Do you have a set cycle?",16Apr2020,1

24,"I can’t take myself anymore.

can’t say much about myself but I’m basically a freshman college student who is staying with parents because of the corona. My parents keep a horde of animals in their house, and by a horde I mean 50+ animals, from companion animals to reptilian exotics. My job is to clean up some of the animals and cohabit every minute of my day with them, which is mentally and physically exhausting sometimes because of the amount of schoolwork, general stress, and other stuff.  

My mother is the hoarder of these pets, and from many circumstances that I can’t discuss, can’t leave her house. She is also stressed with taking care of my brother (toddler) and the 50+ animals, and she has mental issues. My stepfather definitely has anger management and personality issues, and also takes care of these animals because he had done a terrible thing to my mother (cheating, domestic violence, huge sum of debt worth $200,000 due to gambling, and death threats) and therefore has to comply with complete obedience. Our family has been in civil disputes and in court because of this incident that my stepfather caused.

The state of our house is honestly a mess. You leave one hour without cleaning the animals and they shit themselves everywhere and everything, tearing every furniture, walls, themselves, and some animals die because they get into fights with each other.  One room purely reeks of ammonia because of the amount of animals packed in that room. 

The sound of dogs barking and howling is a regular occurrence and my mother demands me to silence them. Most of them are not housebroken either.

I am also allergic to these animals.

I could describe the state of the environment all day long.

I’m so stressed with their fighting, and my mother taking her anger out on me verbally then shouting at me that I should leave the house immediately because I don’t do anything to help around the house (I am a full time student taking 6 classes who does some but not all chores in the house, like cleaning the dogs, cooking sometimes, and taking the dishes out). If I don’t do any of he chores, she yell at me; if I ask if I should do chores, like washing a dog, she says she is too sick to help me even dry a dog. I try when I can to help, but she just doesn’t realize that.

I also have a girlfriend who I really love and want to be committed to her, however, my mother thinks I am lazing when I am talking on the phone with her. And it is so hard to manage because I didn’t tell my gf any of this happening because I don’t want her worrying. Even then I lash out at her at times on the phone and become hysterical, to which my poor gf, without getting angry, responds by telling me that I can talk to her anytime. But it’s not that easy because of the abnormality of the situation compared to her world. We just live in two different environments it’s impossible for me to even tell. 

With the midst of corona, I can’t even go outside to work. I have little money that I received from my biological father, but I don’t have a car. And the quarantine seem to continue forever. I have no relatives living in the States, and I have nowhere to go in e moment. My mother demands absolute obedience or out of her house, and I understand. 

But it is all too much.

I have resorted to turning my anger on some of the animals as well, and I hate myself for it because it’s such an immoral act on a animal that doesnt know betterx

I can’t go on like this until August or whenever the quarantine ends.

I don’t want to kill myself, but I nearly overdosed. 

I feel selfish for having thoughts like this when my parents took me in and fed me during this crisis.

I really need help, but I don’t want to cause harm to anyone either.

I might delete this post as well.

Edit: Animal Control, CPS, everything has come to our house, and passed everything. It’s no use trying to change the house because my parents make it look good during their visits.",16Apr2020,3

27,"(im indulging myself in a nice long story of my (relatively short) life so far, to skip it's the next paragraph for the bulk of my story)
I've been struggling with undiagnosed (by my most likely terrible choice) mental health issues for roughly 2-3 years now and this last year I've had frequent thoughts and fantasies about suicide. I feel guilty because in my eyes they seem so unjustified, I manage to be in a neutral mood most of the time, I can usually enjoy myself in the company of others and the life I have is one I'm extremely thankful for. The only problems I have that I know for a fact change my mental state are physical problems including, like chronic fatigue, chronic pain and frequent injury due to scoliosis and hypermobility and weakened joints,tendons and ligaments. Due to these I often reserve myself from doing activities I've loved since I was still chewing pencils in school learning about multiplication, such as  Competing in track and field events and now even simpler things like going for a jog daily. Starting with feelings of boredom and disinterest in my hobbies and social interaction it slowly spread and mutated, boredom becoming apathy and disinterest in socialising becoming complete emotional isolation from all my 'friends and most of my loved ones'. It stayed like this for months until  eventually I started to  wonder if life was worth living. 

At this point I'm time it was about 2 years ago just at the start of Fall, I started to hurt myself but I never felt like I needed to. I kept doing this until eventual I thought about how it would impact my family, and just like that I stopped. Being around other people in my life who had openly talked about similar experiences to what I was having I felt a small dagger of guilt press itself into my stomach as I thought about how often they deeply struggled with soul crushing relapses. For the other people around me, it seemed to haunt them like an inescapable burden, yet I almost wasn't affected by my decision to stop. I felt/feel like a fraud, telling myself I did it to feel better but yet being able to get clean with almost no difficulty. It wasn't right and I feel like an attention seeking poser when I think back on it. I hid it and I only opened up to people who reciprocated the circumstances and yet I feel like my ""faking"" the need for it was nothing more than an insult to everybody else who truly struggles with staying clean and safe.

Ever since then I began to think about suicide as well. The greatest mistake of my life was the first time I seriously considered it. Except the only thought I had on it was how people would react. Convincing myself I was going to do it because I would be better off and not because I wanted to see how people would act. After once again talking to the people around me about it and having them tell me to take care of myself and that I'm loved. I made a pathetic half hearted attempt to kill myself. Only to very predictably survive and once again have people support me in my state of ' vulnerability '. During the time I felt as if it was all very real, I'd never blatantly fake something just for attention. But looking back I feel so ashamed that I worried people around me who have struggles much worse than I do and worried them over me when they could have been focusing on helping themselves. I leeched off of their empathy for me and stopped them from doing what they needed to do to be better. Since then there's been a dagger of guilt stabbed in me, slowly being pressed deeper into my body.

Since then I've gone through cycling waves of, feeling bored but fine most of the time and only sad/happy or anything other than disinterested about 10% of the time shifting into weeks and months of almost complete apathy in the company of others and sadness so bad it sends crippling waves of pain pulsing through my chest whenever I'm left alone with my own thoughts. But because of the way I used these issues in the past as a guise to let myself be convinced I was deserving of the attention, time and care given to me by people much more deserving than me. I can't trust myself that these feelings are real.
 I don't trust myself to not do this purely to get some sort of sick gratification from people worrying about my own safety and health. 

The last 6 months I've been in a state of constant sadness whenever I stop moving (figuratively and literally). With pain so bad sometimes it almost paralyzes me wherever I am, with the feeling of my insides being rotted away by guilt and pain from these episodes. Suicidal thoughts became more and more frequent until now I can't go half a day without vividly imagining killing myself. Despite everything I still have the same thoughts as I used to. Every time I think if dying my initial thought is of how would people around me react, what would they all do. Then of course my thoughts flit away to how it will make my sadness go away.
I can't trust myself enough to know whether all of this is real or if my mind forcing me to suffer just so I can stay relevant and significant to the other people around me and I guess myself. 

This is all I think about anymore and I can't believe in my own thoughts because I know how much they lie to me and persuade me things are different to how they actually are.

I don't know if this pain is real or just a sick excuse for me to continue and validate my reason to share my 'struggling' with people close to me to feel important and cared for.

I don't know what to believe. I can't trust what my mind is telling me I'm really feeling.

Maybe this is payback for all of the worry and effort I stole from people who needed it for themselves. Karma fulfilling the issues and pain I convinced myself I had and now I'm getting a taste of properly.

I don't know what to believe. I just feel so guilty that for so long I relied on people who were fighting so hard to keep themselves going, just to indulge whatever disgusting subconscious need I had to get from their attention and worry.

I'm not sure what I expect from this post, and I don't know what I really want from it either. But please respond. At the very least I need to know whether or not I really am leeching off of others. Based on what I've said please tell me if I'm as bad a person I think. I feel so guilty about making my problems out to be bad enough that I got others in worse positions than me to give me empathy and support I needed only to gratify myself by capitalising on such horrible things as committing suicide. I'm suffering so badly now. I haven't slept more than 3 hours in over a week because of my thoughts.

29,"So I'd imagine some of you here are familiar with having meltdowns and just absolutely breaking for a hot minute. What do you do? Would it be absurd to request from a psychiatrist a benzodiazepine i.e. Ativan Xanax to calm down? I'm a psych nurse, and I've worked with lots of drug seeking patients. I don’t want to be one of those. Historically, I used to cut myself when I felt that I've lost control and can't contain my emotions. I've eliminated that by smoking cigarettes on occasion. It's very rare that I do smoke, but I did tonight. And I'm just wondering if it's outlandish to request a benzo for times when you feel you can't handle yourself. I've been prescribed Buspar for anxiety, but I don’t take it regularly, as my anxiety is not regular. Cigarettes work great for me when the occasion does come. But of course, that isn't an ideal method. What are your thoughts? Thanks for reading.",16Apr2020,2
30,"I'm not sure how to put this all into words. I'm genuinely not trying to look for comments or empathy, I need to put my sadness somewhere. It has always been hard to formulate what I'm feeling but I will at least try.

I want to fall in love, it's the only thing I want in this life. I want comfort in someone else's presence, like full trusting and complete affection. I have so much love to give although it's not everyone else's description of love. I can't fall for someone, I can only become infatuated. Just for once in my life I'd like to not be the victim of obsession, and experience a real relationship.

I was in a relationship for a while, but all I saw her as was a filler and something weak. She was exceptionally nice and we had a good relationship, but I couldn't see her as anything more than someone who I could easily manipulate with a bendable will. I didn't take advantage of her feelings or her ever, but the thought crossed my mind just about every time I spoke to her. I know that if I was given the option to hurt her in a way that would benefit me I would've taken it.

I have only become possessive over two other people besides her, both whom I almost dated but I lost interest too early even though I still kept the infatuation. Even though they were my friends/""crushes,"" I didn't see them any different which kind of pains me. I don't know what I consider a ""crush"" anymore, and a relationship to me is just another warm body.

I don't want to live like this, I just want to be able to love someone without seeing them as something to use or betray. I can't stay with a person that long or else I become uninterested. I can't keep friends because I might wake up one day and find them so annoying that I'll drop out of their lives. I can't talk about my experiences or the way I feel because people will think I'm purposefully doing this and there is so much stigma around being the ""outsider.""

35,"Hi,

Since I was young, I have ""slight"" issue with my hearing. I don't really need to wear hearing aid yet, but i start to realize my problem may be related to my brain?

So the problem is, when I'm focus on something. (e.g: playing game, read a book, typing a document), other people talks to me and won't notice it most of the time ... It's not like they didn't talk loud enough, it just that it didn't catch my attention somehow)

It's like when I focus doing on something, my focus is so narrow to the point that other cannot distract me...in a bad way, many times when my manager talks to me at work I didn't notice it cuz I was working on my tasks and this is a bad thing :(

Also, I realize that I'm pretty bad in holding a conversation with others. I realize that people speak too fast and I have to put so much effort on the conversation in order to communicate. By reading their lip moving I can understand better the conversaion. When I watch TV, I always have to turn on subtitles ...I feel like I'm heavily depending on my eyes/visual things over my ear/hearing....I wonder could it be my strong dependence on visual ability that I gradually lose my hearing ability?  Or anything that is causing my 'over-focused"" situation?

Any idea why I have this issue?Please advise. Thanks",16Apr2020,1

37,"Lately there's been a lot of problems going on. My parents are not on good terms. It came out that my mother cheated on my dad. My father became an alcoholic due to the pain of knowing what my mother did. For the sake of the family, my dad decided to stay here with the family and keep the situation a secret. The only reason why I know is because I'm the only person who my father trusts. My sister is too young and would most likely hurt her to know. My mother believes that I dont know what's going on. Each day I have to look at my mother and lie to her saying that I love her. I dont see her as my mother anymore but I cant say anything because I promised my father that I would keep it a secret. Its almost like every other day I have to talk to my father and calm him down with his own rage and pain. He even told me that at one point he wanted to kill himself and I had to talk him out of it. Things seem to be better but I still see the pain in my parents eyes, mostly in my father's eyes.

I'm also currently going to college. My financial aid wasn't the say as last year and I owe the university money which us preventing me from enrolling into the next semester. My father tells me the financial problems we have and that they are living paycheck to paycheck. The possibility of losing the house is becoming more real by the day. And yet my parents try everything they can to keep me in university. Since I'm the only one out of my entire family to go to university, many family members are looking up at me. Everyone wants to see me succeed and I glad that my family is inspired to do even greater things. But it feels like I have a lot of weight on my shoulders. It feels like I'm carrying everyone. I feel like me going to university is financially hurting my family. At times I feel like I regret going to university.

There's also a lot of infighting in my father's side of the family. I havent see some of my family members in months, almost years. It all started when a couple of aunts and uncles started going to religious meeting. They became more invested in their religion and tried to get other members of the family to be part of it. However not everyone wanted to be part of it (my family included) and respectfully declined. Those who are religious aggressively tried to indoctrinate into their religion. We are not against religion and we are open-minded. But we did not like how they aggressive they were with us. This caused a schism in the family and now we cant even talk to each other without fighting. Most of young ones in the family are caught in the middle. The young ones in the family look to me because I'm the only one that both sides can listen to. I'm able to calm everyone down and promote an environment where everyone can talk freely. 

Everyone is always looking towards for me. I'm the only person who fix almost every situation. Dont get me wrong I'm happy that I can be there for my family. But this pressure keeps building and I feel like its impossible to let people know I'm strugglingly. So many people depend on me. I tell myself that ""failure is not an option"". I cant sleep. All these emotions and thoughts about the potential of losing everything is almost crippling. I tried to talk to my girlfriend about these things but she's always busy. She has a lot of school work and she's struggling too. She really tries to understand but in the end she doesn't know how it feels. I feel alone. Everyone I talk to someone, I always see the pain in their eyes. Everyday I put on a smile for other people. I tell everyone that I'm ok and I continue to be there for others. Hopefully things get better. I know things will get better. I just need to keep going. I need to keep trying.",16Apr2020,1
38,"That's what therapy was, to me.  Years of psychological torture, of having everything important and worthwhile to you ripped to shreds.  Of having your reality pulled to pieces and being told that it's all just your mental illness, and you just need to learn to think acceptably like the therapist instead.

I've been through a mother who basically tried to perform minor surgery at home with a pocketknife.  I've been through being assaulted by a boyfriend I loved.  And yet I would still name experiences in therapy - experiences that as far as I can tell were completely within what a therapist is supposed to do - as the worst pain I have ever felt in my entire life.  (Of course therapy tried repeatedly to convince me that I'd never been through any abuse in the first place, because none of what I'd had pinged on any of their stupid screenings.)

I am not exaggerating the level of pain by calling it torture.  And it was torture that was constantly reframed and downplayed.  Shoved into a little box called ""therapy is hard"" and ""sometimes it gets worse before it gets better.""

These were not, to any evidence, bad apples.  These were licensed and experienced professionals who had helped many others.  And they were engaging in what, as far as I can tell, was fairly standard treatment practice.

I have lost track of how many professionals I have seen.  I have not seen a single one who would even acknowledge that such a thing is *possible* to happen in therapy.  And yet I know that there are other people out there who've been through the same thing.

People like me are the sacrifices for our mental health system to work.  We're the stories that you're not allowed to tell.  The ones who get told it can't really have happened, or that we must have caused it somehow.  Or that we're inventing it for some sort of personal vendetta.

No one has ever been able to explain how therapy protects against this.  No one has been able to give me any safety precautions.  Just declarations that obviously no competent therapist would do that - when obviously competent therapists did.

Why is everyone ok with this?",16Apr2020,2
40,"So I recently started doing cardio consistently and I realized that it isn't impacting me mentally like many people seem to experience. While doing it, I feel kind of unhappy or agitated and I never experience that supposed rush of euphoria. Usually my PTSD symptoms gets worse after and I don't really know what to do about that. I try to combat with positive thoughts, acknowledging negative thoughts, but not lingering on them too much. Showering after tends to be the worst and I end up in a funk all day. Though my heart rate is elevated, it isn't really a feeling of anxiety, and I'm wary of using my physical state to indicate my mood.

Has anyone else experienced or heard of this issue and know what the mechanisms might be or how to deal with it? My best guess is that adrenaline has been associated with trauma for me from such a young age that I might have been classically conditioned to respond this way. Feel free to give technical terms. I've studied neuroscience and psychology, so I have some familiarity with the subject. I'm hoping to find a way to combat this that's more effective than what I do now, as I'd really like to get in shape again.",16Apr2020,1
41,"I was struggling in school before the virus. I had a 60% in biology. I've never gotten below a 75% in a course before. It felt horrible. And now? I'm doing even worse.

My best is so much worse than it used to be. The virus is taking such a huge emotional toll on me, and there's little room in my mind for schoolwork. My biology course is so much harder than I ever imagined it would be; there's such a huge leap from the 11th grade to the 12th. I'm not capable of what I used to be, and I wasn't capable of much before.

I was so lost before the virus. For the first unit test, I studied for hours. I made cue cards, and I made my friends quiz me. I did practice questions. I just didn't understand. I asked my teacher for help, and tried my hardest to understand. It just didn't work. And now, I have to build on the concepts I didn't understand in the first place. I just can't keep up.

It doesn't take any emotional or mental energy. My therapist encourages it because it's a really good outlet. It's a coping mechanism for me, but it just seems lazy.

 By the end of last year I've been really happy (I was going to sleep wanting to wake up fast so I could draw again ... I was drawing for several hours a day , everyday) for 1 month , I've never felt so energized and euphoric , after this period of more or less than 1 month I was feeling really down and when I was going to bed at that time I didn't want to wake up never again ... I feel like that type of thing (this ""boost"" in my mood) comes and goes , but after it's over , I come down to what I think it's the ""normal"" for me , being really depressed . And I feel like there's so many underlying problems , but I feel like nobody gives a damn , and I think ""but why they should give a damn when you don't give a damn about people outside of your close family ?"" As the years gone by I feel like my mental health is declining , I became bitter , envious of successful people , and besides my best efforts of doing something with the only thing I know how to do (drawing) and that still gives me some pleasure , I feel like I'll never be able to live off  of it . I'm afraid that when my mother dies I'll  die too .

And I feel like nothing can be done , since I feel like my soul already left my body ... I don't even know why I'm posting this here . I don't have any friends ...

When I was 15/16 ,  I was really active , had friends , girls , was ""popular"" in school . But all of the sudden I was feeling that my surroundings became strange , and I was thinking that I did or would do things that I would never do , like eating things you are not supposed to (rocks , coin , screws , paint , metal nails , and behaving not accordingly to my normal pattern of how I acted , so because I was so overwhelmed by all this , I decided to smoke weed for the first time (turns out it was skunk) , and that was the worst thing I've felt in my entire life , and the sensation of being trapped in dream lasted for several months ... Since then I feel like what I was before smoking died , and now feel like I'm a man without a soul and without any purpose .

60,"I have a friend (a girl who is the same age as I am) who cares about me and asks me how I am doing. I appreciate her doing this even from the way I have been treating her lately. One thing about me, is that I am struggling with some mental health issues, which have been already addressed with medical professionals alongside with a medication. The only issue is that I am not sure how to completely move on from my situation. I understand that I have to be patient in recovering and taking steps forward, but I am still not sure about what to do all in all. Going back with this friend of mine, she is such a great person to be around with that I developed feelings for her 3 times in a span of 3 years. Some backstory to this, I initially saw her in my high school as a new student, who was cute and interesting. I pursued to meet her and started talking afterwards.  In a short amount of time I became completely infatuated with her and told her how I felt towards her. She then told me she wasn't interested in going out with me and only wanted to be friends with me, I felt bummed out after getting rejected and had ignored her for a while. After having come to my senses again, I agreed to be friends with her since she seemed to ""interesting"". A year later, during the summer we met up again to hangout. We enjoyed each other's company every time we hanged out, and one day we decided to meet up and take edibles together (it would be her first time taking it while it would be my second). On the day we met up to take edibles, I had initially just thought of her still as a friend, but I later then developed to have feelings for her once again. The day we took edibles together, she seemed to have taken a little bit more than she could handle, while I was still in control. I spent the entire day taking care of her, which was having her in my arms the entire time (since she was a little paranoid after having taken edibles for the first time), feeding her, caressing her, making sure she was alright. That day, I thought I was just being a friend, but knowing how that day went, I thought to myself that maybe there was something more going on. I told her again about how I felt on that day, and she seemed to understand my decision after having told her I needed some time off with her to process my feelings. Later this year, we met up a few times to catch things up and study together (since we are both in school). We explained to me how she was hospitalized for a while, in which I already knew having been told by another friend of ours, and I felt bad about it since I wasn't able to do anything for her (and also having felt slightly guilty for her being in the hospital as I might have caused her to be there in the first place). At the time she was at the hospital, she was diagnosed with a few mental illnesses which I think are severe (she has borderline personality disorder). A few weeks later our meet up together, I started having some pretty severe thoughts of suicide (which I have had before over the years) and had told her about it, A few days later I went to the hospital by myself since I was severely overwhelmed and anxious about having to think about harming myself again. At my time at the hospital, I was diagnosed with a few mental illnesses (dysthymia, GAD, and social anxiety), and from my time at the hospital, she was there with me to support me and even came to see me. I felt so blessed to have a person like her in my life. Only then I realized, she made me feel comfortable around my life. I knew that having feelings for her again would be a mistake. Yet I still pushed myself to feel in love with someone again, hoping that this person may finally love me back. After a desperate attempt to throw a surprise date to her for her birthday (which was a few days after her actual birthday), it ended up going horribly. Everything came down like a roller coaster for me and her, and yet again we discussed about each other's feelings. She made it perfectly clear that I am only her friend, and I made it perfectly clear to her I wanted to be with someone. The only issue is that she wants to stay friends, and I do too as well, but I am not sure about how to do just that while still having feelings for her. I tried to dump my emotions and everything about her that I liked, like ripping my heart out, except it's already out to begin with. She still checks up on me every now and then, but i just keep upsetting her because of how I treat her... and I don't even know what to do with myself and her anymore...",16Apr2020,1

I’ve told my psychiatrist about most of these but she just says “okay” and moves on without another word on the topic. It doesn’t happen often enough to be a huge problem but i’m just concerned.

Out of every person in that school, she had the most stand out personality to me and I ended up desperately wanting to become friends with her. I didn't have sexual feelings towards her, but I was extremely turned on by her personality and it made me completely realize my loneliness. So I tracked down her social media and tried to talk to her. I screwed up completely and now she wants absolutely nothing to do with me. I can't get myself to stop stalking her though. She is the only person I have really tried to befriend and I can't stop thinking about it. I have been so lonely my whole life and she is the only person I have seen that clicks so hard in terms of personality for me.

basically, a lot of that typical “the world is ending but i just want a small house with my wife” stuff.
today, i sent my little panic to a group chat that i’m in. a few minutes after i’d sent all the above, i sent another message that said “yeah looking back at all my past messages i’ve decided that i’ll just kill myself early and i won’t have to deal with any of that shit :)”. when i sent it i thought we’d bond over that, yknow? i thought everyone thought like that. 
next thing i know, this guy (who’s mildly an asshole) starts asking me if i’m on something. after i’ve convinced him i’m sober, he says “Don’t say that shit [my name]. That your gonna kill yourself.” honestly i was a little surprised. i’ve always gotten the vibe that we weren’t that close, but we were? yknow like, you’re the first on my list for something funny, but the moment shit gets serious you’re not the one i think of. but he starts telling me about how he really cares about all of us and he worries about us and, honestly, i hadn’t realized how much i needed to hear that until he said it.

I was wondering if there were any free or insurance taking, legitimate online mental health or counseling services anyone knew of. 

I have a regular mental health provider right now but it's super new and I have some things I'm not comfortable addressing with him at the moment and thought finding someone online would help me remove some of that fear and help me get some of it out and processed. Honestly, a free place where I could maintain some anonymity would be wonderful, but I don't know that such a place exists. 

Thing is, a Google search gives me lots of sketch results so I figured I'd see if reddit had any recommendations. I have medicaid and am in the state of Washington, but I also could afford to pay a little bit for something like this as my issue is starting to interfere with my day to day life.

86,"This may be hard to put into words, but let me explain. 

About a year ago I went through a very difficult time. It seemed everything decided to go wrong at the exact perfect time. My second semester of school was just starting, but I had to get my wisdom teeth surgery done. It took me about two weeks to recover and everything went downhill from there. My english teacher, to be blunt, was god awful. I won't go into specifics, but she made it impossible for me to pass. Also, I had an argument with my dad at this time, which resulted in what I thought might be the moment in time he left me for good. 

All of this accumulated into 5 horrid months or so. I felt awful, every day and every hour. By the end of the semester, I had given up on basically all of my classes, barely getting by in many of them. I had no drive, no energy, no creativity. Nothing. I felt like a different person. My day consisted of waking up, going to school, not paying attention or doing any work most of the day, going home, and going on my phone until I fell asleep or ate dinner, if I could stay up that long.

This was also the closest I ever got to thoughts of self harm. I didnt actually self harm, but it was a much closer possibility than ever before. Normally, whenever my brain thinks of something like that, I immediately shut it down. But during this period, I would think for quite a few minutes at a time thoughts of self harm. 

I had practically abandoned any of my hobbies. I really enjoy video games, and I couldn't even bring myself to do such a simple thing.

Overall, I felt completely devoid of any drive. I just couldn't do anything. I was taking a graphic design class at the time, and every day in that class I pretty much just stared at the screen... I couldn't think of what to do, it was like my mind turned off and couldn't turn back on. It was like this in every class, even math-and I'm pretty good at math compared to other subjects.

Even if I am 100% sure that it’s positive or whatever, my brain just makes me look at the bad side of things. Like my brain wants me to be sad and depressed. I believe that I am an optimist because even though how bad a situation might be, I look at the good side and forget the bad side. But lately, even if I try to look on the good side of things, even after a bit my brain just starts overthinking the situation, imagining the bad side and the negative effects. 

For example, the most recent event of time doing this was today. I was just texting my girlfriend and she just casually said that I remind her a lot about her ex. I said cool and didn’t think much. Even though I know that she likes me more than him, but my brain is like overthinking what she said and basically forcing myself to be sad and think that I’m not good enough and she is only with me because I remind her of her ex. Idk why I do this but it’s annoying and ruins my day easily.",16Apr2020,1
88,"I have a severe obsession. It's over two girls who I used to talk to. They were twin sisters. Didn't work out too well in the end. I made mistakes. I liked both of them, one more than the other. 

This split between us happened about two and a half years ago. I have been obsessing over these girls for about 4 years now. My whole brain is constantly flooded by thoughts of them to the point where I can't escape them and I'm constantly panicking. 

Every single night when I try to sleep, the most dominating thought of them is the urge to have sex with one of them. I'm constantly fantasizing. Due to these thoughts, over the past four years of this obsession, I have masturbated to either pictures of them on facebook or the simple thought of them well over a thousand times.

Accompanied with this obsession and excessive masturbation to my thoughts of these girls, I've been having popping noises occurring in my right ear. My right ear literally will pop thousands of times in a single day! Apparently, it is a case of eustachian tube dysfunction caused by anxiety. Very weird and disturbing. I often see a green and yellow lights when thoughts of suicide run through my mind. There was a time when red lights would flash, but that's gone now.

I'm looking for an epiphany. Maybe by taking a psychedelic, I'll encounter a revelation. Maybe that's when I'll truly realize that my obsession is destroying my life. I actually already know it is. It's just that I'm addicted to it and fail to take action against it. I have tried to quit masturbating to them, but the longest I can go without relapsing is a week. The cuteness overwhelms me.

The medicine that has worked best for me in the past is named Olanzapine. I ran out like a month ago. I think I need it back. I used it as a crutch for those nights that were really bad. Though numbing the thoughts of the obsession and the disturbing popping in my ear is what the medicine delivered to me, it never changed my perspective about quitting this masturbation. This is why I'm considering a psychedelic or some additional therapy. I really need a big change in my mindset.",16Apr2020,1

90,"My mother has asked me why I'm not better despite seeing a therapist for the past three years and medication for the past two years. She says that I shouldn't be depressed, and that she should be the one. She says that I don't love or care about her. 

My friend died from cancer when I was 9, I don't remember much about it. I just remember my feelings, how confused I was. I know it was from that moment, friendship became a thread to me. It could break so easily, and it always did. During elementary school, my emotions were incredibly dark, something a 10 or 11 year old shouldn't feel. I was so scared of losing my friends, and I did. There was some big stupid fight that still impacts me. Not what we fought about, but my feelings. 

I would write about self-hatred. I hated myself. I dabbled into self harming, biting the skin around my nails, make it bleed. I told my counselor in middle school about it, and she said not to worry about it. That it didn't matter much. My two therapists said the same thing. My high school counselor in 9th and 10th grade said the same thing. I also told her I thought about killing myself so I went to hospital and lied my way out of there. I arrived to the hospital on Friday and left on Friday. I returned to my school on Monday and my counselor checked on me for two minutes, then let me go back to class.

I learned from that my school doesn't care. My own therapist asked me one question about my little stunt. I learned that my therapist doesn't care. I learned that my mother didn't care because now she looks at me like all I want is attention, and yes, I do. I want attention so people will notice that there is something wrong with me, that it hurts to function in the real world. I want them to notice that I truly cannot finish high school not just because it is hard, but because it is painful. I want them to notice that I am slow and weak and they are all blaming me and only piling more bricks on me. 

I am responsible for my actions, yes, but what about my emotions? Why cant i control that? There is so much more to add in this post, but I just wanted to give a ""simpler"" background to my question. From this, can someone please tell me what the missing clue is?

Hi everyone, I’m 17 year’s old and I’ll be turning 18 in June. Much like many in this thread me and my sister are victims of narcissistic parents/ mom in particular. My mother expresses all traits of a narc mom such as, emotional invalidation, gaslighting, boundary breaking, obsession with the external, public and at home shaming,  Considering us her sole care takers and the list goes on. 
        This has resulted in my sister being taken home early and a few DCF cases in the past due to physical and emotional abuse. I’m due to receive money from a lawsuit when I was younger (something she never lets me forget she fought for) and now I just am having a hard time getting over just sheer guilt if I’m being honest. I’ve previously tried involving DCF through high school and she would constantly try to paint me as a bad child to keep me in the house I believe solely to receive my money. 
       I am working on my emotional strength (I’m a water sign) however living home it isn’t very easy especially considering the fact that she is relying on this money planning on even quitting her job. The settlement is roughly 380K - considerable but not enough for me to now support her 41 year old retirement job. She isn’t entitled to any of it it’s for my pain and suffering however I know even if I were to give her the majority she’d still want to have complete control over where I allocate the rest of the expenses. She’s also a very experienced loan officer so sometime I do considering using her as a financial tool but again even if it were to by my business I feel she would usurp control and immediately deny me of any form of power. 
My mother is also now dealing with multiple health issues which just makes this issue with guilt so much worse. If anyone could offer any help, advice or a free service I could reach out to I’d really appreciate it.",16Apr2020,1
95,"Hey, uh I'm here cause I was feeling really odd and I'm noticing myself constantly with like a weight in my gut and I couldn't figure it out. Since quarantine started I've become hypersensitive to the fact that I base my life on distracting myself from any problems or anything and I don't know why or what I'm supposed to do. I seem to be doubting myself more and more every day and just a few nights ago I spent like an hour trying to figure out how someone would impersonate me because all I do is try to be someone better than whatever I may be. Some of my more iron-willed morals and personal goals seem to have flattened like wet paper recently, for example that I wouldn't watch anime (nothing to people who can watch it or anything, its just a stupid rule I've always kept) because I've understood that addiction is a very real thing with it and then I watched like 4 anime fully and just fucking broke down for like 2 hours in a pit of ""depression""? Then someone close to me recently got cheated on in a significant relationship to them and I tried to support them and by the time I sent the message I was feeling the weight in my gut again from a relationship I got cheated on during that seems to be coming back to haunt me and I am constantly feeling guilt and shame every time I show weakness to myself because I don't know what else I'm supposed to rely on if not myself. I've found myself watching a funny youtube highlight video and being chuckling to myself and then the video ends so i back out to see what's next and within the second I'm instantly thinking about why I'm happy and then i feel like dogshit again. Self doubt is something I've never allowed myself to be brought down by and now I am being plauged with it by everything i do. It legitimately feels as though I'm not the same person anymore or what i was even before now. It's starting to scare me a lot as well because I may screw something simple up and before i KNOW i'd just shrug it off or just get annoyed but now like i'll mess up and just a flash of a thought of harming myself and then I'll just find myself thinking like ""What the hell was that for?"" and then keep on going. And it's terrifying to me cause my dad killed himself, my friends family have killed themselves, people have talked about wanting to kill themselves to me and I've always considered myself to be the rock in the river that someone could hold onto so they don't go under because I'd ""never"" falter on that but I'm having to bare myself here and admit that I'm fucking terrified of changing for the worse. And the longer I go on the more this weight feels heavier and i feel guilty because maybe I'm just making a big deal out of it and i should man up like my dad told me to but then i fear of turning up like him and its just a mental stuggle against myself man. And it doesn't help that theres just that shit that you cant explain, like i wish it was something as simple as like a pornography addiction, or drinking alcohol underage because that seems common and not as shameful but theres just some flaws i've noticed in myself that i can barely even admit subconsciously, far less on my main account in front of random people. I feel weak, not like myself, like I need someone to hold onto that i can talk about this with personally face to face and we know each other and god knows ive tried to get into a relationship but it never works out. And then its just more self doubt and shame from more failures. I've taken psychology and I know what is and isn't normal depressive behavior yet I can't allow myself to even think of admitting that level of defeat because i know people are having it worse but I feel as though I still need something to confirm that i've not lost yet. I usually pride myself on being able to answer every question possible in as logical of a procedure possible but its so fucking painful to admit but i dont even know anything anymore it just seems like every time i try to remember something i was right about the answer has changed and i dont know what im supposed to do cause i hold myself to a high standard in terms of moral and unchanging ways but now i gotta change it feels and i dunno what to do. If any of you guys/gals/whatever can, please let me know what you think i should do. I already feel guilty for asking for help, but uh just yeah. Thank you for at least reading that, i suppose idk.",16Apr2020,2
96,"Dear Reddit,

My name is Caroline. Quarantine got me bored so I thought I should write to you guys. I want to share with you my thoughts, what I want to become one day, dreams, and again-- I’m bored. A heads up, I’m kind of bad at writing but I still hope you take the time to read this as I pour my heart and soul into it. 

To start off, hey! Kind of informal but that’s the person I am. I like to relax and have fun. My name is Caroline and I’m a high schooler from the west coast. To describe myself, I would say ambitious -- but only for things I’m passionate about. I guess that’s why I’m doing pretty bad academically. BUT if you don’t count grades and test scores, I’m doing pretty good in involving with my community and doing things I’m passionate about. I prefer to work things purely out of inspiration and bursts of energy, maybe that’s why I like to work things last minute haha (because I’m inspired to finish by the deadline). I like to smile a lot. I recently watched The Good Doctor (highly recommended) and one of the theories that was shown in there was smiling is contagious so I’m trying to test it out myself. So far, so true, even for people that’s crying. I want a lot of things in life. In my house, my father is the only person working so often time, we don’t get what we want. But that’s okay. I will get them myself. One day, I will become rich enough to buy myself a carriage house in New York with a treehouse in the backyard. I will also have two golden retrievers, a cat, and a chicken that will learn how to sit on command. I thought the chicken part was creative. One of my favorite things to do is to live. Yes, live. I saw a quote on Twitter and it goes along the line of living is different from surviving. I was greatly inspired by that haha. But what I mean by living is first off, buying disposable camera so I can capture the moments (not iPhone or Androids), *then* going on roadtrips, sing along to happy songs that I don’t know the lyrics to, pull an nighter and watch the sunrise, scream at the top of my lungs on rollercoasters, knows the joys of genuine laughter, and last but not least, easier said than done, relax and know how to have fun. I think the closest I’ve ever been to living was leaving my apartment for hours without telling my parents (don’t worry, I was safe and they never found out) to buy groceries with a friend and eat ice cream while watching the sunset on top of a hill. That day I cried after I got home-- not because I was sad-- but because it was the happiest moment of my life-- (so far because I know without a doubt my wedding will be the happiest day of my life). You know, one day I’m going to be the greatest trauma surgeon across the country or an OBGYN (still debating). A lot of people told me I won’t make it but that’s the thing. I also love proving people wrong. I know it’s a lot of confidence for someone who’s not doing so well academically but I’m determined to prove them wrong and make my grandpa proud. Okay, I’m going to go take a nap now!

This is up for debate if you disagree:

1. Money buys happiness
2. Pineapple belongs on pizza 

Songs Recommendation:

1. Someone New by Hozier (for me this song is like a confession to their love ones with each and every version of their partner)
2. Cherry Wine by Hozier (this song is about abuse in a relationship)
3. Mystery of Love by Sufjan Stevens (I don’t really listen to the lyrics for this song, just for the sounds but this song is so beautifully composed. I love it and the title really says all about how the song goes. It’s mysterious but a good kind that makes you just want to venture off and enjoy life.)

Also, what are your thoughts?

1. Witches or Mermaid
2. Roses or Sunflowers
3. Autumn or Spring
4. Calm Lakes or Stormy Seas
5. Sunset or Sunrise 
6. Cottage in the Forest or Apartment in the City
7. Horror or Romance",16Apr2020,30

anyways, she (dad's gf) said this happens a lot. he'll feel like shit, drink, regret it, cough up some blood and vomit and then it'll go back to normal for a while. she said she's never going to let me deal with this alone, will always provide me shelter and that she will support me no matter what. i know she gets it perfectly because both of her parents were alcoholics and they were very very abusive.

98,"*Hi, this is a not-for-profit post, hope it's allowed.*

I'm one of the co-founders of Supreme Movement (SUicide PREvention for MEn). As one of our ongoing campaign pledges, we are helping authors self-publish their mental health memoir for free. We take away the stress and worry for first time authors who have experience with mental health issues. This is UK-based only at the present time.

Our publishing campaign was developed because of vulnerable authors being taken advantage of, financially and psychologically. We provide extensive free help that includes formatting, cover design and account creation. We even hand over all publishing accounts to the author after the book has been published so that the author retains 100% control of their book, account, and royalties. It's a completely free service.

Our community interest company was set up in the UK to help raise awareness of mental health issues among boys and men in England and Wales.

The main campaign page is here: [https://www.suprememovement.co.uk/supreme-publishing](https://www.suprememovement.co.uk/supreme-publishing) and has an extensive FAQ section.

**A little bit about me.**

At the end of 2018, due to major depression among other ills, I was sectioned under section 2 of the Mental Health Act UK and remained in a psychiatric hospital for almost two months. During my recovery time, I rediscovered my love of writing and book production. Writing became a positive psychological tool that I used as a distraction and grounding technique to focus my emotions in the present.

It was then I realised that I needed to give something back and so I got to work with my partner to develop a mental health enterprise specifically focused on raising awareness of mental health problems in males.

My partner is a former school teacher who studied in design and is a campaigner for mental health awareness. We are dedicated to Supreme Movement and its campaigns. The publishing campaign is free and will remain free to all authors who wish to publish their mental health memoir.

We would love your help, not just in sending any authors with mental health issues our way but also to help us raise awareness of what we do. We have supporter logos available on the website along with a growing self-help resource.

One last thing - I hope the lock-down is going well for you and that you are all staying positive during this difficult time.

Thank you for reading!

Ben Oakley, founder of Supreme Movement.

99,"maybe so many people feel the same way, and i'm really tired of this. it's been a month since i last went out because of the quarantine rule, and i feel like spiralling.

before quarantine started, i bought 4 books because i wanted to read again. i've only finished one book, started reading the other two, but until now i can't continue it. i also like to watch films, i could watch one film a day during holiday but now i'm also slowly losing interest in it. 

i'm in college and i got online classes, and an abundance of assignments. again, i don't have the energy to do it. it's not like i'm lazy, but its really hard to keep track of the assignments and it's all messy and i don't know what to do. i really want to do it, but it seems like i can't find the motivation. i'm sick of it.

my relationship with my family isn't the best either. i'm not close with my father and two brothers, so i can only talk to my mother. but still, i don't feel any connection with her, and she keeps telling me to be 'productive', which i hate. because it's not that i don't want to, something is preventing me to do so.

tl;dr, there's something that preventing me to function properly and i don't know what that is. idk if im mentally ill or not, but i'm sure i'm not neurotypical. i can't function normally right now and everything makes me sad. i even stopped opening my social media because everyone makes me sick. i feel like my whole self is shutting down and i'm scared. my head hurts. i even self harmed once. i want to cry but i can't. it's literally getting harder to breathe every single day.",16Apr2020,1
100,"I'm in my 20's still living with my parents. About 3 year ago, my dad took all my childhood stuff that were stored in the basement, and donated them to the thrift store without asking or telling me about it. I had some old toys, vintage mega bloks, lego sets, stuffed animals and childhood keepsakes that were stored in the basement. One day, I went downstairs to search for my stuff and found out that all the stuff from my childhood are all gone! My dad is a short tempered man, I was afraid to ask him for an explanation.I remember crying for a week before I finally got the courage to ask him why he donated my stuff without asking me? He simply said, 'welll I thought you don't wan't it anymore, so I donated it. If he doesn't want my stuff to be in his basement, he could've just tell me about it, I'm more than willing to put my stuff back into my living room. He didn't even bother to ask me about it. He just assume that I didn't want the stuff anymore without even asking me. He said he didn't do it on purpose and promised that next time he will ask before getting rid of my things. This it's just a one-off incident. So I decided to let it go and move on. I thought after discussing this issue with him he won't do the same thing again but that's the that case!

Beside from my childood keepstake and there were also some boxes of items filled with my mom's personal belongings stacked in the basement. We used the basement mainly for laundry, household items and storage, because our room doesn't have enough space to store all the things. Not long afterwards, when he decided to remodel the basement, he cleared out the entire basement and gotten rid of my mother's belongings too! He donated and gave away all her clothes, shoes, household items, mugs without her consent or knowledge. When she confronted him about it, he became defensive and lashed out. Each time this happened he acted bewildered and defensive that we were upset about the loss of our possessions and my mom would have to coerce a half-assed apology out of him. I think that he lacked the ability to get attached to possessions himself and just projected that onto everyone else. Did anyone else experience this?

Update: Me and my mom have talked about this issuee with him years ago when he got rid of our stuff from the basement, plead him not to throw our things away again without any consent or knowledge on our part. But it happened again recently. My dad continue to randomly throw things away, without any disregards to what it is and who it belongs to? It seems like he doesn’t care or respect our possessions, he doesn’t see a problem with that, and it isn’t going to change. Those toys and stuffed animals had a huge sentimental value to me and were a large part of my childhood. He just got rid of them all like they were nothing. My dad continue to giveaway whatever he wants, without even considering if it means something to me or that I may have needed it. I know there's no use for me to bring up this issue with my dad again, because it's pretty clear and obvious now he just doesn’t care or respect other people’s belongings. He had a habit of going on ""de-cluttering"" sprees and throwing our stuff away without asking. He doesn’t see a problem with that, and it isn’t going to change. 3 years since this happened, the problem is still bothering me. Sometimes this whole issue doesn't bother me, but other days it eats me up inside. I understand what's done is done. I can't get my things back. I'll have to accept that. But I'm still upset about it and every time I look at my dad it's hard to pretend to be happy with him. So how do I get over it and come to terms with the fact my stuff are gone forever, and accept that I can't get any of it back?",16Apr2020,11
101,"I have a friend who I care about, she's amazing but she texts me every single day and wants to call every second day (this isn't related to lockdown she's always been like this) she doesn't live with anyone but does have other people to talk to, she has a mental health condition (I'd rather not divulge which one) that does cause her to be extremely intense a lot of the times though so other people can only be around her in small doses. I can't handle the daily texting, usually all day. I've told her this but it never usually ends well. If I take a day away from my phone I go back to a barrage of texts of her telling me about her day that then devolve into complaining about lonliness and how noone cares etc which just makes me want to avoid the conversations more. I've comforted her before because of this and she does quickly pick up after I agree to a call but it's getting really uncomfortable because it's starting to feel like I'm obligated to talk to her within certain timeframes so I don't end up with texts trying to end the friendship or annoyance or complaining of some sort. 
On top of that when I do take time to myself she assumes it's because it's because I'm struggling with my mental health or I'm not doing well but it's just because I'm introverted and don't want 24/7 contact. I've also told her this.

102,"(31/F) Sorry this is a big TL;DR but ive never really put my thoughts into words before. I'll try to highlight the important parts.  


Ive heard from lots of years of studying psychology and stuff that not liking things anymore is depression...

  
but for \~13 years or so, **ive suffered from experiencing physical pain from doing the things that I like.**   


A good example that I give to people is... I used to LOVE to read, i sucked down a lot of books, anime, video games, etc.

but the past 10-13 years... i just cant. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I lived in Seattle, I got books from the library... like the little 30 page sonic the hedgehog comics and it took me a MONTH to read them. 30 pages! When before I would have a book half done before I even got home!  


**Because when I read... it PHYSICALLY is painful. I cannot WAIT to get it over with, and I can only half ass focus for about 1/2hr before I literally have to give up and do something else because the pain is so overwhelming.**  


Its the same when I play video games or watch anime.  


When I write my ""About Me"" section on websites, i still wrote that I liked these things... but last year or so, I'm like.... do I? Do I even like these things anymore? Do I even like anything anymore?

&amp;#x200B;

**The only things that I can do that DOESNT hurt is things that i HATE...** Like talking to people. I cant stand people... but day in, day out, I just am in online chatrooms, studying people... trying to figure out why I am the way I am by looking at others to see if anyone else feels the same.  


I hate cleaning, but its the one thing I can do. I used to hate memes, but I am now a memelord and I will spend every waking moment that Im not talking to people... looking up and reposting memes. I hate being a leader and telling people what to do, but I am glued to community management.  


If my friends online tell me to do things, I can do them. If they sit me down with an anime, I will binge for 17hrs... but i could NEVER bring myself to watch more than 1 episode of anything.  


**It feels like my life is on backwards. I've never met anyone in my years of community management that has EVER felt like this....**

 I just went to a psychiatrist a couple days ago and tried explaining it to him, but im not sure he fully understood it.. He tried me on 3 meds for anxiety and sleeping (Lamictal, seroquel, and Lexipro) (and ive had lamictal and seroquel before)  


But... I just want to like things again ;\_; I dont want things to hurt anymore. **i want to be able to be by myself.**  


Does anyone have any sort of any clue at ALL about what this could be? **Any thoughts are appreciated.**",16Apr2020,3

I’m feeling really down today. My work never fails to remind me that I am nothing but a failure. Today, my boss shared to everyone that all his team member performed so well except for that one person which is me. I’m really struggling with my work now and everybody expects that you will perform well just because everybody is doing a good job. 

I honestly feel like I’m a disposable person and everyone can jusy get rid of me anytime. After all, I’m not good enough. I have been struggling with anxiety for more than 5 years and experiencing panic attack is already a common thing. I’m scared that constant feeling of rejection and worthlessness will worsen my condition. I have been talking to a counsel the past few months and she told me to try writing what I feel, maybe it can help in releasing negative emotion.

He raped me and I called the police n spent 3 days in the hospital. I was having really bad panic attacks and anxiety and missing a lot of work cause I couldn't leave my house n I couldn't stop crying so I was put on meds for that and I couldn't sleep so I got pills for that. I was put in therapy (a 90 minute session each week) for the assault and PTSD. 

I was doing my best and then my therapy place shut down cause of the virus. They offered tela sessions but those proved ineffective for me. The clinic that would drain the fluid off my back(post op care) also shut down so now I'm very swollen and in pain all the time. 

The issue is, now that my therapy is gone, I'm falling back into how it was directly after the assault. I can't sleep much even when I take the pills, I have started having panic attacks even tho I'm taking my meds and a new thing started where when I manage to sleep, I'm crying in my sleep. I will wake up with my face wet and feeling really sad. 

I don't know what to do now. I'm missing a lot of work again because the anxiety it taking over. I don't want to miss work but I feel like I can't help it. I don't wanna lose my job.

As soon as I interact with someone now, I get feelings of regret, wishing I didn't bother, just feel down, no mental energy.
Nothing much to say, unsure what to say, don't like to say much about myself or what I do for a living.

I guess a part of me knows that in real life I am insecure, socially confused and act similar to people who have autism. (Not sure if I have it myself, but probably).

No matter how hard I've tried in the past, throughout my childhood and 20s (now 31) I've been struggling yo fit in, socially anxious and confused. 
I feel ashamed of it and relatives have always been angry at me about it. (I know I should ""man up"" and stop being as they say ""shy"" ""pathetic"" but its not so easy).

I'm not as bad as I used to be, most anxiety symptoms have gone.
I just have nothing to say anymore.

When I start making a connection with someone, I then start to feel I shouldn't have bothered them, and then regret, because I feel like a fraud, a fantascist an idiot, hopeless and an sometimes useless in my life, since I've never achieved much and wasted a lot of my 20s and youth .

110,"Hi everyone. I am 16M and I am from Australia.

Around 7 months ago I started dating my now ex girlfriend who lived around 10 hours away from me. The relationship wasn't perfect (as a matter of fact it was fairly toxic), she could be quite manipulative and mean at times, calling me things such as hypocrite and liar over the smallest of disagreements. But despite that I was happy and I really cared about her. She had a few mental health issues, anxiety, depression, etc (at one point she called me late at night with a knife, idk what her intentions were). I feel as if I really tried my best for her, despite not being able to spend much time with her.

 It was a few months after we started dating that I experienced a panic attack while at school for what seemed like no reason at all. A few months went by and I was speaking to a friend of hers and she told me that, she wanted to break up (this might not seem like much to some but I had really made her the centre of my world and she meant a lot to me). After reading this message I experienced another panic attack. 

After that I started to do some research into anxiety and depression from what I had read I was experiencing many signs and symptoms of both. I decided to go to my family doctor to see what he thought the best course of action would be. I tried my best to explain what I was going through to him but I don't think that he entirely understood, he offered to prescribe me antidepressants and I declined. 

We spent a few days together at Christmas and then she went back home. This is where things started to go downhill. One day she decided to pick a fight with one of my close friends over something very small and insignificant, but it escalated. I was trying my best to diffuse the situation, I told my friend to block her. For some reason this really hurt her. It hurt her so bad that she decided to start cutting herself again. She told me that it was nothing serious and a small cut. After speaking with a friend of hers later that night, I found out that it was a lot worse and she had done several deep cuts. I don't know what was going through my mind at this point but I completely lost it and started cutting myself. This incident eventually caused us to break up a few days later (she never found out about what I did). What happened after that, I fell down a rabbit hole of depression, suicidal thoughts, self harm/cutting, etc. 

I had cut her out of my life around 8 weeks back, but around 2 weeks ago I decided that I should let her back in after numerous attempts from herself and her family to contact me. I was speaking to her for about a week then I decided that in order to properly move on I would need to cut her out, I did so with a letter then I proceeded to block her on everything. 

For about 3 weeks things had really been looking up, although I have been having trouble sleeping, lying in bed for hours thinking about her. The longer I lay there thinking about things the worse my thoughts get, a few nights ago they got to that point where I started thinking about self harm again (it had been around 5 weeks since I last did it). Last night I decided to go back and start cutting myself again, but I don't really have a reason for doing it. It was just an urge that I felt, I wanted to do it.

So yeah, that is pretty much my story and the reason why I am posting on this sub. If anybody has had a similar experience to me I'd love to hear about it.",16Apr2020,11
112,"I'm 28, lost my right eye when I was a kid and never had a normal life after that. I've been outcastes and a loner my whole life. But tonight I almost committed a crime. I guess I'm finally breaking apart.

I went to a girls place to try to vandalize her vehicle.
I've spend 4 years with this chick from taking her out, buying her food and introducing each other to each other friends and family.

I know I love the hell out of her and wanted a relationship with her but she didn't want it with me so I stood around but I just couldn't stand it. Someone i was attracted to her and later on she became one of the best friends I ever had.

But everytime I had a sense she was seeing someone I would freak out. Two months ago I ruined her dates and I wasn't able to hangout with her anymore. Contact started to stop and I started to get really out of hand by calling her everyday and just wanting to hangout even if it was for 20mins.  But no, my phone goes straight to voicemail and I can only call her on Facebook. 

Tonight I found out she is dating some dude.. my anger and emotions took over... And I couldn't stand it so at 3am I drove to her place to look for her vehicle vandalize it break Windows pop tires whatever it is but her vehicle wasn't there... 

I guess I really don't love her because I wouldn't act like this if I did. 

Now I'm at the point of ""Don't hurt anyone, if you wanna hurt someone hurt yourself"" 

So maybe I should listen and end it. The more I live the more I feel like I'm torturing myself, it's my life I think I deserve to make this decision especially when I been dealing with it for over 20 years",16Apr2020,3
113,"I've been seeing a therapist for 6 months. My main issue is a feeling of meaninglessness and discontent with life and the world that drives me to see no way for me too feel good about existing. Basically an unwillingness to participate in the world. I have no larger goal that creates a drive strong enough for me to feel that life is worth it. The only thing that makes these feelings disappear at times are my amazing friends. This fuels depression. Also I have issues with sharing my feelings and especially feeling them in front of people. I practically can't cry in front of people and I struggle to admit that I cry at all.

My therapist has focused on the latter and my relationships with people. I'm learning to be more open which has led to closer relationships than I've ever had before, which is great. I've never felt as loved as I do today, and I've never felt love for someone else the way I do for my friends.

The problem is that my feelings towards life aren't getting better, often worse. Even though I'm bettering in other areas, I still feel a deep hopelessness for myself. Even on ""good"" days I can see myself wanting to die in the future. I've explored these feelings with my therapist, but nothing makes it better. I've told him countless times that I'm frustrated because talking about it does nothing for me. It feels good having people relate to it and hearing me. My friends care about me and they want to hear, but the feeling doesn't get better.

I told my therapist that I would like to attack this problem directly, perhaps with other forms of therapy, and honestly I don't even know if it's possible. He basically told me that he couldn't provide me with any other form of therapy than what he had done already. Now I'm thinking I might be asking for something impossible here. I know that part of me is looking to ""fill the void"" so to speak, but I would think there is some other way to treat these feelings. 

Am I expecting too much from therapy? Am I looking for something nonexistent? I don't know what I need...",16Apr2020,1
114,"A lot of things have changed in me. I used to be very organized, but now...everything is all over the place. I can't stick to my schedules, i'm cramming (i never crammed before. I hate it) and the worst is i'm procrastinating. I'm a lot clumsy and careless and i hate it. This has been going on for almost a year, not just this quarantine time. I tried to do what i used to do before but i can't keep up anymore. I'm trying my best now that i have a lot of time for myself but it seems that it became my new self. I don't like this. It affects my work. I feel incompetent and inefficient and i don't know how to reset myself. 

(I feel the need to say that I am very okay now. I am off meds for almost 2 years. No more suicidal thoughts but  i do get disruptive thoughts, which comes in rare nowadays. No more panic attacks too but i get occassional anxiety. )

115,"I’m really messed up in the head and I don’t think I’ll ever be ok. All night all I could think about was how I’m always everyone’s second choice and how no one has ever really wanted me and needless to say it’s depressing but I kind of like it? I’m not sure how to word it without it sound weird buts it’s like I always want to worst the happen because it gives me an excuse to feel awful and I’m not sure why I’m like this. 

I’m a defeatist and I’m pessimistic and I don’t think I even want to change anymore, at least part of me doesn’t. I’d rather just die. 

I basically feel completely worthless and like I’m a failure, I don’t cut myself a lot of slack anymore. And for some reason the only thing that really matters to my crazy brain anymore is getting people’s sympathy and convincing everyone how hopeless and how much of a lost cause I am. 

It feels like I’d rather have pity for being the way I am than being a success story and I’m not sure why anymore. I think it’s because I tried for so long to get better and be someone and I always came up short. I truly do feel hopeless. 

I’ll be 27 this year, I think all of my problems are kind of set in stone. I still hold onto my belief that if I can somehow one day find a way to make real money that everything will be ok. I don’t think that’ll ever happen though.",16Apr2020,1
116,"Last February I saw a opening for scholarship grant for studying abroad. One of my dream is to study my masters degree abroad so I decided to apply. Although my GPA isn't that high, I think I might have a slight chance because my working experiences are connected to the degree that I am eyeing for. One of the requirements is to do a plan, stating what will you do after you finish my degree if I get accepted and how will it help my home country. 




It's been month now and I haven't finished my application yet and I feel so dumb and stupid because up until now I still haven't finish the plan requirement. There's a voice inside of me saying ""what are you thinking? you're applying for scholarship yet you can't even write a convincing plan?""

117,"Hi guys, I wanted some advice on studying with mental health issues. I (20F) was a straight A student up until I was about 15. I was bullied at school and forced to do the homework of my classmates every morning at school. 

I'm now at college and away from the bullies but every time I attempt to study or complete an assignment, I get the exact same feelings as I did when I was being bullied. I feel anxious, alone and afraid. I'll do absolutely anything to prevent studying. My procrastination is extreme and no amount of last minute pressure can make me meet deadlines or compete work. 

I also have OCD, so any work I do manage to somehow complete, I have to read over and over and over again to make sure it's perfect. Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated. I know a lot of you may say to see a therapist and I already am, nothing seems to be working.

How can I complete my work and stop procrastinating and how can I beat my OCD and stop reading everything 100 times to make sure it's perfect?

TLDR: I was forced by bullies to do their homework and now every time I try to complete my own work, I get the same feelings of anxiety and fear as I did then. I have OCD and have to read my work 100 times to make sure it's perfect. Any tips?",16Apr2020,1
118,"So I live in South Korea where my wife teaches english. We have been on stay at home orders for about 7 weeks. For a few weeks before this happened I had been hearing some small sounds. Knocks, bumps,pops, doors stuff like that. I would hear it at home or in the car picking up our kids it didnt really matter where I was. For the most part I ignored it. Figured it was just stress and whatnot. 

In the weeks since we have been home, and by home I mean we are still going out to ride bikes in the neighborhood, grocery shopping for the family, playing in our backyard. The noises have become louder to the point I was woken up a few times by what I thought was a door being slammed or something falling next to my bed. In the last week I have started hearing laughter and whispers. They sound almost cartoon like and with a speed up cadence if that makes sense. 

I have talked to my wife and sister about it and they both just think I'm stressed from being a stay at home dad being locked indoors all the time. I'm not sure they believe me and I'm not sure where to go from here. I can't get seen at a hospital near us without a negative covid test and we are not in a hotspot area so it's not as easy to get a test as some parts of Korea.

122,"I don't know where to post this, so I'm going to try a few subreddits.

I know something's wrong with me and I'd like to know what. I plan on seeking professional help after covid ends, but for now I'd really like to hear different perspectives from you all. I'm asking this because something clicked inside of me today, after remembering that my best friend once asked me ""are you sure you don't have ADHD or something?"" and my bassist sometimes jokingly (?) says I have asperger's.

It's quicker if I make a list of things I do and things that happen(ed) to me, in no particular order:

* I'm a master procrastinator. I'm currently finishing university 2 years late because of this.
* I have a deeply rooted routine and I find it super hard to break from it.
* I'm intelligent, intuitive and creative. I play two instruments and I'm learning a third.
* I have zero passion in the things I'm studying. My real dream is playing music my whole life, but I've never taken steps to enter the music world/business out of fear. A fear of failing, a fear of making a leap of faith, a fear of leaving everything behind and making sacrifices.
* I tend to dabble in pleasant activities instead of working my ass off.
* I run away from responsibilities.
* I get sidetracked and distracted easily.
* I'm fidgety and I can't seem to stand or sit still.
* I'm unreliable because I don't seem to care about the outside world.
* No man is an island, but I think I could be one, until I feel lonely. Only then I feel the need to ""connect"" with someone, but as soon as that is satisfied, I have no problems becoming an island again.
* I reply to emails and texts after weeks or months because it's like I'm afraid of something. Of a flowing conversation maybe? To be covered in responsibilities or things to do maybe? To potentially have awkward moments in the conversation maybe?
* I have little to no empathy, I suck at reading emotions and providing emotional support.
* I'm super rational, to the point where someone once compared me to a robot. Not good.
* I have like five people whom I really consider ""important"" in my life.
* My best friend once told me I'm emotionally stunted.
* I have low self-esteem and I don't think highly of myself.
* People say I'm modest, but I'm afraid it's not true modesty.
* My current girlfriend told me I'm devoid of emotions, things aren't going that well now.
* I was over-parented by my mother as a child, she was suffocating, anxious, controlling and always did things for me instead of teaching me how to do them. She was always proud of me as if I were some kind of perfect child, had enormous expectations of me, was always worried that I would engage in ""bad"" activities (""bad"" was a very loose term for her, everything was bad apparently), banned videogames and swearwords in the house, still treats me like a 6 year old child. She is passive-aggressive and always guilt-trips people. She gave me a lot of attention when I was little and was always careful not to neglect me, but at the same time lived (and lives) in her own world and it seems like she always cared about her ""reputation"" and how others would see her more than anything else.
* I never seriously confided in my parents, not because I don't trust them, but because I have a weird relationship with them, as if they were my teachers and I were their student (they're both teachers btw).
* I'm afraid of being abandoned in relationships, to the point where I blurt out promises and excuses and bend over backwards in order to take the relationship back to a ""stable"" situation. Then, when I'm comfortable, I tend to slip right back into my old behaviors.
* I'm anxious and I tend to get needy and possessive as soon as someone I care about pulls back.
* When I'm out with friends, or at a social event, or even at a family reunion, I drink a lot. I never get drunk or embarrass myself in front of others, but I keep filling up my glass, I drink more than I should (unless I'm the one who's got to drive home), to the point where I'm usually tipsy before the second course is served.
* Sometimes I get really horny and masturbate a lot of times a day, for days and days. If I don't control myself, I might find myself browsing porn websites for hours on end.
* I'm really good at adapting to new situations.
* I'm really good at breaking habits, IF my habit is out of reach. Out of sight, out of mind works really well for me. I might spend a whole day on reddit, youtube and facebook, but put me in a room without devices, and I'll gladly spend a week there without complaining. If there's no alcohol in the house for a month, I won't drink for a month and I won't crave it. Same thing for basically anything else (except music).
* I have a weird sense of humor and I'm capable of adapting to different conversations, unless the topic is football or some other boring shit. I could easily spend hours talking to a wide range of different people with different personalities.
* However, I immediately notice if someone ""resonates"" with me or not. It's rare for me to find a person that ticks all of my boxes. If they don't, I'm still nice and respectful, but it will be harder for me to ""let them in"".
* I'm a people pleaser, I find it hard to say no.
* I suck at putting up boundaries.
* I find it hard to open up to people.
* I never speak up for myself, thus building up resentment over time.
* I bottle everything up and after months and months I explode in an unpredictable way.
* I haven't cried for years.
* My best friend told me I'm aggressive and I have a hard time managing my anger.
* My girlfriend told me I sometimes get passive-aggressive.
* I lose contact with most people. I either stop replying or I don't check up on them.
* I sometimes feel empty and like a failure.
* I've never been suicidal.
* I feel like I really need to grow up and become a man, but it's easy for me to relapse.

If something else comes to mind, I'll edit the post.

To counter some of this bad stuff, I've started a daily plan. I have a bunch of actions I'm going to carry out EVERY DAY, like meditating, exercising, doing an act of kindness, studying, etc. For now it's going well and I'm feeling a sense of fulfillment and purpose after doing these activities.

Still, before I go to therapy, I'd like to hear your thoughts on this. Thanks in advance.",16Apr2020,1
123,"This could be quarantine or this could just be me being crazy, but I noticed that people pause a lot when they’re talking to me. As if they’re thinking of something to say but then they don’t say it. I’m not sure if I’m just imagining it or if it’s a real thing. I am very used to quick responses and replies because I come from a loud family of quick talkers and I could be projecting that? I’m not sure 🤔 Has anyone else here experienced that before? People taking pauses after you’ve said something and experiencing anxiety over it?",16Apr2020,1
124,"So I was voluntarily admitted for depression recently due to an increase in intense suicidal thoughts and urges. 

I was admitted to a unit specifically catered to mood disordered people, known for being the calm and quiet unit where there aren’t any triggers, and to get in there you usually have to hit a certain criteria. This is so that the unit houses the most stable patients to foster the best rehabilitative environment. Usually that just means: don’t be aggressive, and listen to the nurses. I’m averse to any form of aggression and know how to stay in my own lane, so I would say that aside from the suicidal thoughts, I would’ve been a nurse’s dream. 

But when I got into the unit, of the few days I spent in there, a lot happened. I witnessed shouting matches over the smallest issues (or sometimes no issue at all), and multiple manic meltdowns where chairs were being thrown and doors were being banged. It was all really overwhelming for me that I felt trapped in the unit in an environment that felt far more stressful and aggressive than I was told it would be. A fellow patient (repeat admission) agreed that this was a bad time to be admitted, as if something was in the water that was causing everyone to go a little out of sorts. 

I was incredibly triggered by the overloading aggression (not even towards me, but just around me) that I broke down for an hour in front of a nurse and requested a review to be discharged, and spent the rest of the day emotionally exhausted and non-operational. 

I signed myself in to take a break from life, and signed myself out against medical advice (doctors kept saying, “it’s just an adjustment period, it’s just not a good time in the unit, you just need to distract yourself and don’t get involved”) because I felt myself deteriorating more than when I went in. 

Did I make the right call leaving against the doctors’ recommendation? Was I wrong to leave?",16Apr2020,1
125,"My therapist found that I have OCD-like symptoms, and that it affected multiple parts of my life. The compulsions themselves vary. HAVING to call someone until they pick up if im distressed, HAVING to work on weekends etc etc. prior to pinpointing these symptoms, I felt like I was in an eternal cycle of anxiety. Everything I did revolves around my mood.

The therapy helped me connect my thoughts, emotions and behaviours in a way that I didn't think of earlier. I feel like I know who I am, and that makes it easier to predict my negative tendencies as well.

What are your experiences?",16Apr2020,1
126,"A few weeks ago, I was let go from my job. It was a job I extremely hated. My boss was very unfair and manipulative and was in a toxic work environment altogether.

Still, thorough-out the day I still think about past events that occurred there and it’s brings me down. I’m trying to think of ones to stop thinking about it but I cant.

I feel guilty because she's been so busy lately, doing things at home due to we all being stuck in quarantine, having to see constant annoying coronavirus news, and the thing is, a few days ago we did have a break-in attempt; a real one, but as I said, it was a few days ago--there's no one walking on the roof at night!!! We already tried to reassure her again and again, but she won't believe us! She wants to keep guard all night and she won't listen to us. She's already called the police three times at night ( nothing came of it, because there's no one walking on the roof!!!) and me and dad can't sleep either.   


What made me cry today was that she asked me not to be mad at her, and go get some sleep, and said that she'll go to the hospice. I don't want her any harm, I'm just really tired and hurt. Me and dad want her to be well but she won't listen to us. I feel angry too, because I could've helped her ou more at home and maybe she wouldn't have gotten this stressed. I'm also angry because her side of the family always asks things of her, and only her, and they definitely had a hand in causing her to get like this too.

129,"I tell this story calmly, as if a little wave shook me so I swam away, but really I was unknowingly dragged out from shore and battered by waves. Deep down inside, I felt scared, dumb, and helpless, but now I'm oddly at peace?

I swim in the ocean bay for exercise. I noticed the waves were higher than usual, but when they crash along the reef, smaller swells form. I had a body board with me, and it feels nice bobbing along the swells. Suddenly, I started to feel a small pull, which I didn't mind because I could stand and hold myself on a rock. Then the swells got bigger, and before I knew it... I was farther from shore, on my tip toes, waves just... crashing and pulling me... ^farther (I can barely type this). I felt myself panic for a minute, but I knew to stay calm, control breathing, swim parallel to shore. But that fear, being dragged away, the helplessness, no people around, being beat up by water, the possibility of hitting some rock/coral, was in the back of my mind. I yelled out ""help"" once, but knew this was on me.

I swam after each wave hit and dragging force, it felt like a slow battle against Poseidon. After a while, a huge wave came in and I braced myself, I lost my board for a moment, couldn't see, but was carried a long distance away staying afloat. I got back on my board and was hit by another wave, could barely see, carried another long distance, but my leg was scratched by some coral! I felt a little bit of relief, because the coral meant I was close to the shallow, coral filled bay. I could get my footing, and I saw another wave approach, and instead of bracing myself, I got on my board and surfed the wave peacefully. That moment felt so surreal, like time had slowed, everything was clear and quiet, and my body was numb. I moved carefully in the calmer water, just now noticing the pain from the coral scratches.

I could never tell anyone of how foolish, afraid, and helpless I felt. I never mention the fatal ""what ifs"" that could've happened but didn't... and I'd feel crazy to say life has a whole different meaning to me now.

Notes: I always have safety on call, I notify a friend when I swim and give a curfew when I'm back, and they know to call for help if I don't report back in. Luckily, I made it back 30 mins early, on time.
Please do not call me stupid, I was ignorant about being close to the swells, and I learned my lesson.

TL;DR I got stuck in a rip current and I felt like this was the end for me, but after a long battle I managed my way out with some coral scratches. I told my LDR spouse and a friend it spooked me but it was no big deal, but I cannot openly share the trauma/enlightenment from it all. Could anyone relate? Anyone felt this way before?",16Apr2020,2
130,"So basically like maybe you were fine about something all along (such as a noise maybe), you don't really think about it at all, it's kinda like you heard noise and you just let go, no thoughts, no issues. Then suddenly, one day you feel obsessed about the noise, like the noise makes you feel very annoyed. The feeling of being annoyed makes you more attached to the noise, so now you remembers it, you also associate bad feelings with the trigger, and you have a new obsession/pet peeves.

It's not necessarily a noise, it can be anything, that you didn't feel bothered, but suddenly feel bothered now.

I admit I have several mental health issues, I have an OCD that has something to do with numbers/counting, I have some anxiety issues, I have a mild depression, so maybe that's why what I described happens to me.

I think what I described is just a symptom, surely there are more fundamental reasons behind the symptom.

But I just want to know if other people experience similar things before and how you handle it.

Personally, I feel our mind is very tricky, like if you don't give a damn about something, then you don't get bothered and feel good, if you starts to feel a damn about it, then it gets worse and worse, because you kind of remember the bad feeling and associate it with the thing, and this association stays with you.

Long-time depressive here. My question is - what is the effectiveness of CBT for clinical depression? Most meta-analysis studies report the range to be between 50-85% (which, honestly, the very different range makes me question the methodology of the studies sampled). 

However, reading into what CBT actually does, it makes me think it's just a way to teach yourself to gaslight yourself more effectively? Is it wrong of me to think that?

136,"Hey guys, 

I normally don´t post much on reddit but I just don´t know who I should talk to and feel like ventig for a bit. (Please excuse any grammer or spelling mistakes I make, english isn´t my first language).

First some thins about me: I´m currently 18 and a girl, 162 cm tall and weigh around 50 kg

My story begins from my childhood on. I was always the fat kid in my family and was kinda bullied for it from my family members. When I was around 16 I decided I don´t want to deal with it any longer and changed my whole lifestyle. I went to the gym regularly and ate much healthier. Thanks to that I actually was able to lose 15 kg and I was so proud of myself. I had the confidence I never had before and my whole life changed for the better because it motivated me. 

But all of that changed. I still have lots of body fat and it shows especially on my tummy. It makes me teribly insecure. i´ve started clean eating and I really enjoy it but on some days I just feel like eating and when I begin eating I just can´t stop myself. Today for exable I ate more then a quarter of an cake my mom made and three bowls of cereal (it was made out of whole grains and oats but still...) . I didn´t eat it in one sitting (exept the bowls of cereal), but I think you can understand why it kinda upsets me. After I ate I walked in my room and saw myself in the mirror and just started crying. I feel so disguting. Why do I always do that? One piece of cke would be enough. One bowl of cereal would be enough. So why can´t i stop myself. It realy takes a lot of willpower for me to stop eating. I only stop, when I feel my stomach hurt. Like I feel that I´m full but somthing in me tells me ""no it tasts good eat more"".

One factor that makes all of that worst for me is, that clean eating and regualar excercise actually worked and on one day I had such a nice, toned stomach. I was so incredibly happy, I felt like I loved myself, what isn´t the case very often. But know all of that is gone, just because I can´t contol myself.

I really just want a healthy relationship with food and my body but I just can´t seem to find peace with it. I want food and my body to be my friend not the reason I cry myself to sleep.

I´m sorry my post is so long, thanks or reading.",16Apr2020,2

141,"My bf (33M) of 4 years and I (34F) broke up at the end of January and i was diagnosed with stage II breast cancer in March. The break up was his call, and he struggled with co-dependency issues in the relationship and has asked for no contact.

I am really struggling. I've started chemo and have my lumpectomy scheduled for the end of the month, but I live on my own and not allowed to leave the house OR take anyone to the hospital with me because of corona virus.

Also, I had lymphoma in 2015 and I can feel a distinct difference with the support (and attention, I guess) that i've received from my friends this time around. My cancer support therapist says that's not uncommon with second cancers ...although I'm sure this is also feeling amplified by being stuck in the house 24/7 with nothing to do but think. This is really hard.

I'm the most lonely I've ever been at a time where i really need to stay positive. I miss him and i miss his friendship. I have reached out to him and asked for some contact during this time. I know it's selfish. I just feel like i need *one* thing to feel ""ok"" at the moment :( Nothing feels certain like he always did.

Any advice?",16Apr2020,5

144,"I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for a few years now and been on anti-depressants for the last year or so, but typically have it managed and under control so that it doesn't affect my day to day life toooo much.

However, I feel myself falling back into the slump again. This happens every so often with no real trigger - or not one that I seem to have identified as of yet.

You know when you just feel yourself feeling more drained than normal, mentally exhausted, quiet, and have no desire to do anything? I can't even bring myself to watch TV.

I'm a people pleaser, and forcing myself into work during this pandemic. Every single ounce of energy that I seem to be able to summon is going into dragging myself into work and putting my all in. It means when I come home I physically cannot muster anything inside myself to do anything and it makes me feel really low.

My mind is just constantly unfocused and I keep feeling really emotional, and then really distant.

It comes and goes, normally I just power through stages like this, but I'm wondering:

&amp;#x200B;

When you feel yourself getting into ""the slump"", what do you do?

I want to try and be proactive with this and cope a bit better.  I just want to hear others thoughts and opinions and feel a bit more normal and reassured I guess.",16Apr2020,5

146,"Back in 2016, I started experiencing auditory hallucinations, after messing about trying to contact spirits.  I did successfully contact something, but then after some bad event with these entities, I began hearing voices.  They didn't really last long, a few days to a week at most.

Now they've come back, and it's difficult not to believe that they're some sort of demon-like entity.  They've told me things before I knew about them, and they seem more able to communicate in sophisticated language, than what I thought was possible with hallucinations.  You really can have a conversation with them, and there are a few of them.  

I can easily win them with logical argument, but they're relentless and totally evil.  Well except at least one of them, she has been nice to me, but I've had a real horrible experience with some of the others.

Their intelligence level ranges from mostly average, rarely above average, and some are totally stupid.

153," tw // suicide

I had a friend (who will be referred to as Rachel). Rachel and I had been friends for a couple of years, but at the time this incident happened, our relationship was extremely tentative (and we'd had problems in the past, most of them unfortunately caused by me). We'd stopped officially being friends, but somehow we ended up talking from time to time anyway.

Anyway, I have been struggling with my mental health recently, and a few months back I attempted suicide. While in hospital, I messaged Rachel and we had a fairly normal conversation which ended because she was going to bed. The last message she sent me included her stating that my attempted suicide was a **shitty thing to do** and that **she was annoyed about i**t. Then the next day, we had a major argument and one of the things she said was that **she didn't think I had actually intended to take my own life.**

After this, we decided that it was better if we didn't speak at all, and see if things were any better in the future. However, we eventually concluded that it was best if we went our separate ways permanently, and that's how it's been apart from a couple of occasions.

The problem is, I never confronted her about the things she said to me, despite the fact that they really affected me. I strongly believe that it would help me if I could make it clear that she'd said some unacceptable things that were negatively impacting my mental health, but I don't know if I should as she doesn't want to speak to me.

154,"Highschool was always difficult, not only for classes and getting help, but because I was too anxious to be around others. Now with Zoom and everything happening, I can't get out of bed and be able to focus on my school work because of home life. I missed a week of school online because of my parents constantly fighting, and when they weren't fighting my neighbors are making a racket (I live in a trailer park, you can hear everything.) When. I actually tried showing up for my classes and doing my work it never helped. My teachers for my college classes are counting everything as a normal grade, not taking in the fact that it's hard to learn anything at home. I ask for help, but with the groans of other students understanding everything already and just sending videos as if it will help me learn just makes me panic. They're not just participation grades, we're being forced to take tests that count as if we were in school.

 I was already anxious in school but now it's even worse. I have to have my camera on and feel embarrassed for what other students have to hear or see anything because my teacher insists that we have to have it on or makes a snide comment about it. I stopped participating and joining after what I heard about Zoom too, (I've been using my school account that's connected to my school data which has all my information about me, which is scary since the hacker problems).

I really don't know what to do, I'm getting less sleep at night then I do in school too because of chronic nightmares, so it's hard to focus on work with that alone.

He died 8 days after hospitals in my state stopped allowing visitors. He was 58 and dies of completely unrelated causes of what brought him to the hospital This has destroyed my faith in healthcare.

I am 29, I have very good health insurance and live in Ohio. I feel myself losing touch with reality, I am confusing my dreams for real life and am just very disassociated from where I was a few weeks ago. I don't feel suicidal but I have been down that path before and do not want to head there. I've never really grieved before and never lost anyone close besides aunts and uncles (which never felt this way). I always assumed I may have been a sociopath because I never cried over death until now.

Sorry to unpack all this, I don't really have friends and with all that is going on, I don't socialize much to begin with but was close with my dad.

158,"I am looking for general advice on how to move past this and be brave enough to seek help once more. 

I was in counseling for about a year and things were going really well. One day I had to meet with a different counselor than my normal one and she Baker Acted me because I USED TO BE suicidal (I haven’t been for a while but sometimes I would talk to my therapist to process those times) and she twisted my words a lot to make it seem like I still was.

For those who don’t know, the Baker Act is forced hospitalization by pretty much any means necessary. Basically I got handcuffed by police while people I knew looked on and got sent to a facility in my city which is notoriously the worst one. I spent 12 hours locked in an empty waiting room and they didn’t give me a place to sleep that night, I had to sit on a couch with all the lights on outside the patient area. They didn’t let me sleep at all because they wanted me to eat breakfast, which was meat based and I am a vegetarian. I finally got a place to sleep and slept through the next two meals, so the staff started calling me lazy and said I was faking being vegetarian to make things more complicated for them. I told them I wasn’t suicidal and a staff member said that if that was the case I should have kept my problems to myself. They ended up billing me for thousands of dollars which wiped out all my savings. A lot of other scary shit happened there and I was almost sexually assaulted but moving on ...

I didn’t want to meet with my therapist again afterwards, but she urged me to come in. She was sympathetic, but some of the stuff she said made me feel really attacked and I never went back. I later found out that the hospital I was sent to broke a lot of the requirements around the Baker Act laws while I was there, but there’s no way for me to press charges because if I do that information will become public and could wreck my future career opportunities. 

About a year has passed since then and I am still struggling with my mental health and I want to go back to therapy, but I am terrified that something like this will happen again. How can I seek mental healthcare after an experience like this? I don’t want to struggle alone anymore.",16Apr2020,2

She always looks and speaks to me like I’m an alien or something. She’s so warm and lively with everyone else but it’s like everything dies down when I’m in the room. I can never feel comfortable. 

She always says things that she forgets and acts like I’m going crazy or I’m confused when I bring something up. She gets mad at me all the time. I just can’t do anything right.

I was deeply depressed for a couple of years already and never seeked help just because of fear I guess. I had used acid only 3 times until i was around 16 and a half and thats when i really amped up my use. Going from 3 trips to 20-25 in about 3 months, i was just with a really good group of friends and had really deep conscious openings (in this span i was only taking 1 to 2 hits of 375 ugs and i knew it was good because of who i was getting it from). On my last trip I was with some good friends and took 3 hits, which i had only done one other time on my 3rd trip, putting me over my limit and it wasn't bad but extremely intense and i got stuck in a loop and i was doing some crazy shit that in reality doesn't make sense but that doesn't matter. Basically afterwards I came out of it and knew something wasn't right. The next day was spent with my ex who was already burnt out too, and i remember feeling like i was stuck in a tv screen and could see everything and hear it but i couldn't feel anything. It was as if i was wrapped in plastic and had lost all touch with any reality around me, I had forgotten my friends, how to deal with situations, anything academics related was gone and my sanity was more chaotic than ever. It took me years to find myself and had to stop smoking weed and calm down with my life, i was a kid who never had to try but could accomplish anything in great efficiency and well.

- So ashamed of my interests that when I opened up to my mom about it, I started crushing salted sticks in my hand and cringed at myself so hard

- Enormous amount of self doubt I have. 

- awful reputation. I had beef with classmates and did stupid stuff in my ""buddy retard"" phase. Now damage is already done

- I always think people talk behind my back

- I sometimes find it hard to take criticism

- I also had (still sometimes have) a lot of violent thoughts and of taking revenge. Only thing that's on my way is consequences I will face.

- I have a father who considers simple responding to what he said as talking back and disrespect

- My parents won't do anything when it comes to my butthurt brother and yet they wonder why I smack him sometimes 

- I only have one friend irl

- Words not only can hurt me, but ruin my self esteem even more

- I am lazy as fuck


I was going to a psychologist but not anymore because of a lockdown. I dont know how do I help myself with those things. Is this a ""teen phase"" or something more serious?",16Apr2020,0
186,"Hi everyone. I've never posted on here but I'm just feeling completely alone. I've been living alone for the past month and have had little to no interaction outside of my caretaking job. I live over 300 miles from home and quarantine measures have prevented me from leaving along with my job. I've fallen behind on school to the point where I don't know what to do. I've had a resurgence in my depression to the point where even getting out of bed sucks the life out of me. Whenever I try and do my schoolwork I just think, ""well if you fail you can always just end it all and then you won't fail anymore."" The only thing that kept my spirits up was talking to my boyfriend, but he cut interactions with everyone for a while in order to boost his own mental health. I don't blame him, but he also knows that I'm by myself and not doing well. I just don't want to be here anymore",16Apr2020,7
187,I’ve been struggling lately to support my best friend. I am extremely logically driven and she very emotionally driven. Her feelings are intense and deep and she will often make emotional decisions. She will also seem ‘different’ to her normal self sometimes (acting quiet/short with me) which will prompt me to ask if she’s okay. She’ll often just say ‘yeah all fine you?’  I’ll press and assure her she can talk to me etc but she’ll maintain this stance. This is where I struggle: I have no idea what could be wrong so no idea how best to support her (give her a distraction? Support? A solution?). I ask what she needs and she says it’s fine. So this makes me insecure and doubt myself hugely because I deduce that I must be shit at reading her emotions and that maybe nothing is wrong after all. Because if it is...why would she not tell me when she seems to tell me other times? Have I done something? I always ask a few days later if something was wrong and she will usually say things like ‘trust your gut more’ ‘sometimes I can’t articulate things’. But this still doesn’t help me know what to do :( I don’t get why she can’t just say ‘oh I feel a bit fed up but I don’t really want to talk about it’. I’d then just know she needs cheering up. Can anyone relate to mine or her feelings? Be good to hear other perspectives!,16Apr2020,1
188,"I'm in highschool freshman, and I really cant get along with my class I have a few friends but stick with them more because I just wanna get through day by day. I've never had that problem, always had my group of trusted friends. I feel really isolated and left behind, because I'm not fitting in the atmosphere which is in my class- which is partying till you cant drink anymore and making fun of teachers.

190,"I don't know how to effectively describe this, but I'll try my best. An issue that's been affecting me for a long time is that I don't do things on my own without a prompt or reminder. Mostly with chores around the house or basic hygiene things like brushing my teeth or showering. I don't do these things because I don't think to do them. I know that this makes me sound like I'm just lazy and don't want to put in any effort, but that's not the case. I *do* want to help out around the house, and be able to do things for myself. But I don't for some reason, and I have no idea why. I'm 16 years old and have to be reminded to brush my teeth or even eat 3 meals a day, otherwise it's likely I won't do them.

I say this is difficult to describe because it doesn't just boil down to me forgetting things. I've tried reminders, lists, and my dad having consequences for me not doing things I have to do daily. But they haven't been effective. It's not about me forgetting, it's that until something becomes a problem that's affecting me right now, I subconsciously push it aside and won't think about it.

The point I'm trying to make is that I don't care about things, but I *want* to. I, for whatever reason, won't eat lunch if nobody tells me to because it doesn't feel important in that moment. I genuinely don't know if this is an actual mental issue or if I'm just an a\*\*hole who refuses to admit that he is one,  but I don't have any ideas on how to get myself to care about this and need any help I can get.

I'm aware that this sounds almost dumb and not even something worth posting about. I am also aware that there are people who have it worse than me. Before I get yelled at for complaining about ""first world problems"" I want to clear a few things up regardless of whether or not they help explain the situation;

* I have been medically diagnosed with and ADHD and am medicated for it
* I don't *always* need to be reminded of things; I 8/10 times remember to bathe myself, but that's really the most I do without prompt
* I *am* currently seeing a therapist and have brought this up with them, however it has gotten to the point where neither of us know how to solve this
* As a sort of ""main idea"" for this; I am aware that this is a problem, and I want to be better. But for whatever reason I do not often think about it as a problem. I can be effective in doing things myself responsibly for a day or two, but there's a high chance I will end up going back to the ""unaware, unbothered"" phase.

I don't know if anything I said here made sense, or if there was any consistency in what I was saying. But if always being aware of this problem is the first step necessary to solve it, then I guess a Reddit post will have to do for now.",16Apr2020,0
191,"some background: I always talked to myself, a lot. Not because I don't have friends or anything like that, I am a weird person, people say, but I always had a handful of friends. But throughout my days I keep finding myself talking to well, myself. People notice it and at this point I gave up on saying ""I was just thinking out-loud"". Since last year or something along those lines some weird thing kept happening to me, sometimes once a week sometimes once a month. Let's say I just read a book, put the book on a coffee table next to my bed and went to sleep as I always do. When I wake up, on random, I might see the book on my lap, or on the ground alongside the ""real"" one. When I try to touch it I feel like, that thing I can't describe. And until I close my eyes for a few seconds and open them again that imagery does not disappear. 

Now the problem is:
This has turned into thinking I spill a drink only to find out I haven't even though I clearly saw it spilling and I heard it too to seeing someone walk past me just to find out noone did. Seeing imagery like me eating my own goddamned flesh just flash for a millisecond when I close my eyes for no reason or relevance and talking to myself more and more often. This night (in my country it is like midnight) I talked to myself again and got so irritated I wrote this gigantic post. I only consulted to one of my friends just to hear ""no, what, it doesn't happen to me or anyone I know, you ok?"". In my entire life nothing traumatic happened to me. I have never suffered from and mental disorder - if you don't count me talking to myself.

193,"Speaking from my own personal experiences, America doesn't care about your mental health. Do you need a new SSRI that's come out in the past 10 years that helps you a lot? How about you pay over $1,000 for it? Oops, you need that medication to save your life and don't have insurance? Sorry, here in America we don't consider mental health (or health in general) important. So I guess that just means you'll just have to go without it. Guess you'll just have to worry every day of your life about whether or not you can afford basic mental health care.

As of right now, I recommend to all of you in America to switch from your current pharmacy to Publix (or other cheap pharmacy) and get an RX card. I still can't afford Trintellix, but at least Lexapro has been around long enough to afford it. I'm so happy to have grown up in a conservative family that never got me mental health/ADHD help ever until I'm an adult so that now I can't afford it.

198,"Hey everyone,

TLDR BELOW

Please excuse me this is my first Reddit post I’m sorry if I put way too much unnecessary info
Alright well it’s been quite a life for me in terms of my mental health. Ever since junior year of high school I have had random unexplained bouts of depression and anxiety. I remember the first memorable feeling of bad anxiety I have ever felt was walking into gym class the first days of junior year and it was one of the most overwhelming feeling I have ever felt. Just hundreds of kids and after summer you haven’t seen them  for months. I just felt so out of place and just strange. Just starting to worry for no reason and having brain fog. Senior year is when depression really hit. Again not many external factors for this. Slowly I’m not having as much fun with my friends, I’m less funny, less interesting, less energetic. It shows but I just do my best to hide it. I guess my friends kinda noticed but it wasn’t just too obvious. After high school man shit just got even worse for my mental health. I had no fucking energy. I’m still depressed and don’t really have a plan for life. My grades and focus have just taken a hit because of my depression and fatigue. I forgot to mention keep in mind I am a weird but goofy fun loving person at heart. This really showed itself in middle school and high school without the mental health struggles. I go to community college for a bit but I’m just not doing too well. I struggle to make friends and my grades aren’t that good. The mental focus just isn’t there. I drop out of school and my parents are eventually fine with it. School just wasn’t for me. 2015 was the shittiest year of my life. The fatigue was just getting too much. My parents are getting a divorce. I’m working shit jobs at Walmart and Subway, Walmart I lasted one or two days and walked out. I couldn’t take it, I just felt like shit and walked out. Subway I tried my best but I’m just not good with food and I got fired. I’m losing that close bond with my friends. I don’t even hit them up anymore because I just feel like I don’t fit in anymore and that connection is just not the same. We’re always goofy and making fun of each other but their jokes are actually starting to get to me. 2016, 2017, 2018 are all gradually better years for me as I’m starting to get in a better situation with life and just accept that I was depressed. I started to eat healthy and I really think that helped. I still always felt different than everybody else. I’m a weird motherfucker. My thoughts are just weird but you know I just accept who I am. 2019 was the best year of my life ever since being depressed. I had two back surgeries but I had disc replacement surgery in October of 2018 and I’m finally getting back to playing sports, I’m feeling happier and more clear headed than I’ve ever felt since depressed. The one thing that I’m starting to really notice is a problem is my over active mind. But other than that I’m still doing well. I can have so many thoughts and in reality I’m just sitting somewhere doing nothing. Well the beginning of 2020 has been good but I would say a month ago I made a really bad decision. I took a hit of weed from a bong. Keep in mind weed has really fucked me up mentally before. All my friends (I have a very small group of friends) smoke weed and I first tried it when I was depressed and not having fun because I’m like hey I’m not having any fun on New Year’s Eve and everyone smokes weed now so I’m like let me just try this finally after being against it for so long. I got completely fucked up and I started feeling so sad. Time started to feel like it was in slow motion and I was just having bad thoughts. It like the weed was making my anxiety worse. Me and my friends go in my friends house so they can calm me down and then I all of a sudden start feeling like laughing and then I keep cycling between being sad and laughing. I try weed more times since then and I never get a good effect. So back to the time I took a bong hit. It was just one big hit and I got completely fucked up mentally. My thoughts were RACING and I started connecting all these thoughts together and I was thinking of so many moments that happened in my life. All while I’m just sitting there with my head down and my hands covering my eyes. Thought after thought after thought after thought. This was my mental health struggle just amplified and I was experiencing this terrible feeling. I can’t just stay in the moment. Too many thoughts distracting me and I just start to feel reality just being altered and like I just broke away from realty. Ok so fast forward to now, recently these nonstop thoughts have been ruining my life. I can’t be present or it’s just so hard to be present and just be in the now. I’m always in my fucking head. As I was driving home I was just thinking what would it be like if I committed suicide and just ended this. I wouldn’t have to experience these racing thoughts anymore. I cried and then told myself I am a fucking fighter and always have been. Then the thoughts started coming back and ruining my mood. Meanwhile I’m just sitting here driving a car home. What the fuck is wrong with me. I just wanna have normal mental health? I can’t take this anymore. Can anyone please give me advice on what to do next? There’s other things I’m leaving out or else this would be too long to read, it already is a really long read. I am suspecting I might have low testosterone but this can’t be the cause of all this? I’ve gotten my testosterone tested before when I was young and had the terrible fatigue and it was very low, talking 200 to 300 ng/dl somewhere around there. I mean I really just wanna find the root cause to all this and steps I can take right now to help. Thank you so much, this is my first reddit post so I thank you for any input you may have for me








TLDR

Mental health problems since junior year of high school

Depression and anxiety

Unexplained fatigue

I am a weird and goofy light hearted kid at heart

Over the years I am developing an over active mind and it’s ruining my ability to stay present.

Recently took a bong hit of weed and it just 
amplified all that for hours.

Now I am having really bad over active thoughts and it’s starting to really affect the quality of my life

I always feel like I’m not running optimally

Any suggestions for testing or next steps?

Possible health problems? Low testosterone, sleep problem? Vitamin or Mineral problem? Maybe it really just is a mental health problem idk? Please help god bless all of you",16Apr2020,0
199,"Hi!   
I am really new here, so sorry if something's not right.  
I rarely share my thoughts or opinions on the internet (or ask questions), so here it goes...  


It's been around a year, that I don't have any excuse for not moving forward, but I still can't find the strength, reason or solution how to do that. How did you push through?  
So here is the background. I am f25 and I work in creative industry. I have quit my job a year ago because of the stress, that I couldn't handle. The best part, I have created the stress my self. I am one of those perfectionist here. I have done everything ""right"" all my life. I have been bullied at school (that made me kind shy/timid. Parent really didn't know how to help with self esteem), so I have compensated my self esteem with good grades (couldn't imagine how someone could have something less than A... yup), also my parents expressed love for this behavior, so I have mistaken love and my worth with being perfect. So perfect became normal. I missed my exploration and ""finding yourself time' train, also social life kinda died. I am at this place where anything that requires my creativity (work mostly), I just freeze or panic (can't stop crying) and I can't do anything about it. Even if it is my own project. Now there is no rules, no anything to fit my self in, to be right and to be good. I am afraid to express myself, not only to be neglected by someone, but mostly by myself. I have my ideals, but I guess I am nowhere near them and I just can't accept it. It also seems that the solution would be to explore more, just let everything flow, improvise or 'Just do it'. But just how can I be 'not productive' or do stuff that is uncertain and it might or might not bear any fruits. I just don't feel I can afford that, because I am really productivity/work oriented (tho it's what I need). 

I have had my therapy for at least two years now, I have analysed my problems back and forth, but I can't still deal with them. It is closely connected with fear. I consider myself a hard worker, but when topic hits my esteem, I  just can't move a finger and the fear rises just from one little thought. This stops me from enjoying everything, because I am neither happy neither sad (something that scares me a lot. Experienced quite a lot of downs), basically just waiting for something to happen.  


Thank you...",16Apr2020,5
202,It’s late evening where I live and I haven’t gotten up. There’s no point. I’m starting to get hungry and antsy over all the work I have to do for tomorrow but I see no point. Please help please.,16Apr2020,1
203,"So basically having read some things about mental health recently, specifically with bi-polar and schizophrenia and realised I had quite a few episodes growing up as a child, which my mum always explained to me as simply being a type of nightmare that continues when you wake up.  But, that type of a nightmare doesn't exist and I was always fully concious when the bout came on, although normally at night.  I just want to know what people make of the symptoms and if you have any advice.

It would always start with me thinking about mortality and the fact I would die one day, always as I was getting ready to sleep the inevitability of death was always a major feature.  Through the whole experience I would just be thinking ""shit im gonna die, shit im gonna die"" again and again and again. 

After thinking about my mortality id start having minor visual hallucinations such as the walls warping and being too close / too far away.  If I would close my eyes to avoid looking at it I would feel an intense sensation of speed, as if I was rushing forward.  
This would then come along with a panic response, really fast heart beat and my mind moving a mile a minute, and I would become very rushed.

  I would then become convinced the only way to feel better would be to gather up soft this like blankets and towels, but no matter how many I had they always felt 'too thin', it was hard to describe but it was never enough.  Then the visual hallucinations would get worse, I'd see faces coming out of the wall, or I spent one night feeling like my room was inside of a glitch ms paint program. 

I'd normally just walk around until I felt a bit better a few hours later and just try to sleep as fast as possible.
I had the last bout when I was 16/17 and haven't had any real issues since then.  

Since then I've  smoked a fair amount of weed and used to experiment with magic mushrooms a lot and have never had any issues during or after using these drugs and even went through a simulated psychotic experience (volunteering for university research) and was fine after.

So I think I'm good, but I understand these would be fairly severe symptoms,  is there some way I should prepare myself for a potential future problem?

&gt;I have done many a foolish things in maniac episodes spending $2,000 in a single weekend in a year I only made $14,000. Which ended up causing me to live in my car for 6 months traveling the States from Cali to Colorado to a minor detour to Alabama. I was helping another vagabond found in Texas get to see his daughter for the first time in 3 years and making some more risky reckless decisions while there and befriended some gutter druggies and smoked fake weed and crack for the 1st time. I ended up running thru a Walmart parking lot naked trying to get into a middle aged couples RV. Where I was promptly flashed a firearm and swift kick to the face and landing head first on asphalt , lol, talk about a moment of clarity.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then escorted to a mental infirmary by EMS &amp; Sheriffs where I manged to escape in about 12 hours time but only had the foam happy face shoes and hospital gown from being butt naked on arrival. Mind you its freezing out cause this was in December and I spent the next 2 and half weeks wondering around Mobile, Alabama and eventually outlaying suburbs including Sims which is where my car was. Living of what I found on the streets what some people offered and eventually to the point of stealing food and warmer cloths. Walking at night to be safe and keep my body warm and sleeping at day with the poor mans blanket the sun.  
&gt;  
&gt;All this happening while missing my 1st Christmas of my youngest son conceived in a maniac attempt to save a floundering marriage of 6 years the cause of my oldest son who was the real cause of the marriage of two unbalanced individuals who went from Hello to I do in 12 days. Getting the marriage license bought by pawning my guitar and rolling up to the local Justice of the Peace, without informing any friends or family, said the state mandated vows and I do in shorts flip-flops and a short sleeve plaid button up while she sported gym shorts and a rolling stones t-shirt topped of with a facial expression of Fear and eyes screaming WTF am I doing right before stumbling over the words I do.

It’s so irrational it annoys me. It honestly is instinctive and involuntary.

I'm 26F. I have three degrees, 2 bachelors and one post grad. Unemployed. 
And yet I dont do the things in supposed to, to get a good job. I'm required to study for competitive exams. 
I've always been an average student due to lack of hard work. 
Other than that I have certain personality flaws. Extremely impulsive. Short tempered. No patience. No self control. Lazy. Insecure. Under confident. 

I feel like my life is a waste. I dont do anything. I am not good at anything. I dont have any hobbies. There isnt anything that I like to do. I am just existing. I make up stories in my head, hoping for them to come true but never working to make them come true. I always keep myself distracted, phone or laptop. 

I realise everything. In the sense I know what in required to do, I know what will happen if I dont. I know my life will be fucking difficult if I don't make something of it. Trust me, I know, see and realise everything  but still I dont ""do"" anything that I'm supposed to. I waste my time a lot.

When I do try, I always do something to sabotage my progress. 
Over the years I have taken many projects in my life, but I have never completed them ever. I leave things halfway. 
I also have a habit of sabotaging my relationships, I give my partner hell, but he sticks with me. I make issues out of nothing and we fight for hours and I feel horrible later on. And the thing is I have no control over these outbursts, sort of. I really dont know the problem.
Now the clock is really ticking, and I'm scared and I'm starting to panick which is bringing out the worst in me, I still am wasting my time. 

Can anyone please suggest something? 

Also, I have read a million things online. They tell me to set small goals, and make a schedule, etc. Didnt help.

Then we decided me and my dad should go for a bike ride on saturday (I've left the house twice in about 4 weeks both times I just went into the garden for a little bit) so we proposed it to my dad and I gave him a brief explanation of how I wasn't doing good.

Then they both prayed for me (which I'm fine with, I'm a Christian myself).

I'm so lucky to have such caring parents. Part of the reason I find it difficult to talk to them about my problems is because my family and home is like my safe space so I don't want to bring anything negative in incase it destroys the good. I have to learn that the good helps fight against the bad.",16Apr2020,4

212,"Hello, I’m a 21 year old female and let me give you some background information about my past. So high school was a living hell for me. I was a shitty person as well as a hot mess. I was really mean to a lot of my friends and I was super abusive as well. During high school I was in a relationship with a guy. We were both horrible to each other. We would break up get back together and he would sexually touch me when I didn’t ask him too. I would also verbally abuse him too. I also had horrible grades in high school I never did any of my work. I was bullied a lot all throughout school. After I graduated high school I left that all behind me. I changed a lot as a person. I got a job that I really love working with animals. I started to go to college and making really good grades. I have a 3.5 gpa now. I left the guy I was dating and 8 months later I started dating someone else. My current relationship is great we get along super well both very happy in the relationship. It feels like a real relationship. I love him very much, he’s showed me how to live a beautiful life. I also cut off my toxic friendships from high school. Their pretty pissed at me for it, but I’m really glad their gone. I feel weight lifted off of me. One of my old friends and my Ex bf are going around spreading rumors about me saying stuff that I never did/said. Not all my friendships in high school were toxic. Some of my friends we just drifted apart, because we had not a whole lot in common anymore. I still love them dearly haven’t talked to them in a really long time. I’m still really good friends with one girl. We have a lot in common and we been friends since middle school. She’s super sweet we hangout a good amount. Life has gotten better after high school. Just one thing is I can’t let the past go. I’m obsessed with thinking about the past. I think about it all the time. I get flash backs of things I did that were horrible or horrible things that happened to me. I’m so embarrassed in myself, because of it. It makes me extremely depressed, even having thoughts of hurting myself. Every time see someone from my past out in public I get really nervous, because they will remember from what I was like back then. I feel very guilty in what I have done to people in high school. I hate myself for my past I knew I was a asshole back then. I don’t know whats wrong with me. I work on myself all the time. I’m in therapy right know, but had to stop due to quarantine. I really want to work in the mental health felid in the future and help teens. I’m just scared I won’t be able to handle it, because once I hear something similar about my past I get all shaken up about it. I don’t know what to do?",16Apr2020,4
213,"As a little background information, I'm a teenager and have struggled with depression, trauma and suicidal thoughts/intents for quite a few years. It's gotten a lot better in the past 2 months due to therapy and me finding passion in things again generally, but recently everything just collapsed. I'm aware that this happens and relapses are normal so I was sort of prepared for it, but now that it actually happened I just feel awful. My boyfriend broke up with me last week which really got to me, it still does, and now this quarantine bullshit on top gave me the rest. I've had a lot of thoughts on self-harm again and even suicide, especially at night when I can't fall asleep.  I didn't do anything because I'm afraid to be sent to a mental hospital again and because I wanted to stop hurting myself, but every time the urge gets stronger and I don't know what to do anymore. I've tried all the coping mechanisms my therapist has told me but nothing seems to work. At this point I'm so mentally unstable, I can barely get myself to get out of bed anymore at all. On top of that, I'm stuck at home with my mother who treats me like shit most of the time. She's been very emotionally abusive in the past and she starts yelling at me a lot now for the smallest things. I don't know what I could do anymore, I feel helpless. I've lost my purpose in life entirely. I know it's probably just another relapse, I've had those before, but I'm tired of hearing ""It gets better."" I just want to feel okay and be able to enjoy life like everyone tells me I should.    
I don't know what to do anymore with myself. I hate turning to the internet with my problems since I feel like I'm exposing myself and everyone I know and not know will see this, but I can't take it anymore. I'm struggling more and more every day. I was hoping to find some advice or recommandations on what I could do from other people. I'd be really grateful for that and just overall, I thank anyone who took their time to even read this, it means a lot to me.",16Apr2020,1
214,"I want to get a job, but I fee like there’s something blocking me from doing it. Since this coronavirus epidemic the job market got killed and I really want to make money however I can. I’m also in college doing the online classes since we’re quarantined. 

To the outside I have a really good life! I have two loving parents a relatively big house compared to the rest of society. We go on vacations every couple months, my parents pay for my college. I’m basically coddled. I grew up in a “somewhat rich” neighborhood. Also I’m white, so I have what people call white privilege. So I can get away with a lot of things that other people that aren’t white normally don’t get away with. 

I have a beautiful, kind, and caring girlfriend who also has a job and lives a little bit less than a half hour from me and my school. I should have every reason NOT to be depressed, unmotivated, and anxious to even get out of bed, do my school work, and find a job. 

Yet here’s another thing I haven’t told you. I have a history of drug abuse and prescription drug abuse. 
I have abused marijuana, LSD, I’ve done cocaine twice, I’ve drank alcohol in excess, I regularly vape nicotine in the form of Juul / Disposables. I abused adderall in the past, and I’ve abused Klonopin. 

I also don’t have a solid sleep schedule. I never go to sleep at the same time every night and when I wake up the times I wake up varies as well. I barely eat, I barely drink enough water, I’m 5’11 152Lbs. 

I’m constantly on edge, whenever my parents try to talk to me I always feel annoyed even if I wasn’t annoyed before they started talking to me. I’m quick to anger and as of recently I’ve been having thoughts of self harm, hopelessness, lack of enjoyment of my favorite videogames etc. I’ve also been having suicidal thoughts. I thought it all out completely, like how I’d do it and all the different ways I could do it. I even thought up a suicide note and everything. Usually when those things happen, I just sit in my room, listen to sad music and further compress the problem. But I never actually go through with suicide because I know how much pain it would bring to everyone who loved me. 

But with that being said, it doesn’t stop those thoughts from ruining every day of my life. Deep down there’s a part of me that knows I don’t want to die. I just want this anguish to cease. 

How do I find the strength to pull myself out of this hole of depression before these thoughts consume me entirely ?",16Apr2020,2
216,"I'm 22M, I dont really know why this happens but it seems every year I end up getting extremely depressed like thinking my life is worthless. I feel like it's always work related too like its normally whenever I'm at a job for a year it seems I start getting tired of it and go in a spiral of depression.

I'm currently in that stage now, I recently got promoted to manager in a food chain and I actually feel like it's made me be in a bad place mentally like I'm so mentally exhausted I just dont even want to speak to anyone and people are starting to pick up on it too I feel like I've lost my whole personality and I'm just stale to everyone.

I dont even know how to explain all this tbh.",16Apr2020,1
217,"I know how this sounds, selfish, I mean people are dying and getting sick and I know that but I just need to vent about all of this. I have a number of diagnosed mental issues that I am medicated for, extremely severe ADHD, extreme anxiety/panic disorder, pretty bad depression, and a sprinkle of PTSD to top it off. I’m not here to make you feel bad about me, I’m here to talk because I have no where else to go. I’m terrified, being alone isn’t good for me, I’ve started having suicidal thoughts again, I’m having multiple panic attacks a day, I’m cutting everyone off, my episodes are getting worse and occurring more than usual. I’m scared that I’m going to become a danger to my life. I’ve attempted 3 times, each time ended in a hospitalization. But I was getting better, I was taking my meds everyday, going outside, trusting people, using my coping skills, I was getting better. Than the virus hit. I’m alone all the time, I don’t have enough money to get all of my meds, I’m to anxious to even order groceries. I don’t know what to do. My therapist office is closed and don’t have a way to do it online. I’m on my last week of meds and if it’s this bad with my meds I don’t know if I’ll be able to make it without them.

219,"I saw a spider when i was searching on google images for a photoshop (almost two days ago). Not only that i had trouble sleeping at night, but i cant do daily activities (instead of videogames) beacuse of fear. After i saw it i had some type of panic attack for 10 min, after that i played a game, then the panic attack came again (this kind of pattern was reapeted and still is, I am curently shaking while writing this) people say that the best way to get rid of a fear is to face it, but I dont think i would be able to, if im thinking about something spiders come in the thought (if i have a made up story in my mind where i talk to a person they would turn in a spider). I dont have any idea if this is relevant but i have been abused. What should i do?",16Apr2020,0
220,"After suffering from depression and anxiety, being a a lot of bad relationships including one that was codependent, and going through therapy, I have done friends who give a shit about me. 

We have been friends for a couple years now and though shit hit the fan a couple times, they are still very supportive, patient with me and forgiving. I am at the point where I am starting to believe that they are *real* friend. 

Now it is getting to the point that to really move past my insecurities I have to confront my own bad habits. Though this that part of me that feels like I am going to just be abandoned is still trying to make it to the surface. I am trying to keep in mind that it will be hard, but at the other end I will be a better person. I will have my friends through this and it will all be okay.",16Apr2020,1
