0,"I'm supposed to meet up with someone very important to me in a few days. The last time we saw each other was almost a month ago and things got super messy. I had an emotional breakdown at his place and cried there for about 4 hours. Everything just went downhill. How do I stop myself from overthinking everything and not messing things up again?

Right after I got home from the last time I saw him, I pretty much cried for a week straight when no one was home. And then every few days I would breakdown and just cry myself to sleep or hide in the bathroom and just sit with my own sadness.

I'm scared of how he's going to be when we meet. I don't want him to push me away again. But my head keeps thinking of really bad scenarios of what could happen. We haven't communicated at all throughout the month because we agreed on giving each other space. I miss him so much but I'm afraid of what will happen when I see him. I feel like I'm going to break down crying in front of his door or something.",27Jun2020,1

5,"hi all, 

I haven’t posted on anything like this before but a thought has been bugging me recently and I was curious to see if anyone else felt like this or had a similar experience. 

I’m certain that no one likes me, I’m in my early twenties and have probably 1 or 2 close friends as well as a long term partner. I’ve always struggled to maintain friends. A close friend recently said to me half seriously “ well who did like you “ when referring to a previous workplace, I knew I wasn’t popular and wasn’t trying to be but having it laid out like that was a bit of a surprise. 

What I’m trying to figure out is, does anyone else feel like they struggle to make friends because of their own faults? And if so has anyone found any good ways of altering themselves to be more personable? 

Thanks all",27Jun2020,1
6,"   I am a 15 year old male diagnosed late with autism. My symptoms were ignored most of my life. ADHD was diagnosed in 5th grade, and ODD was diagnosed quite recently.
   I take Guanfacine and Abilify. I have reason to believe that these medications are causing lack of motivation in me, as well as fatigue. I have been taking Abilify since 2018, at 13 years old. 
   I go to therapy weekly and I have work most days of the week. My therapy is not helping. Partly because I shut down and refuse to talk. I am forced to a point, and they make me furious. I have been going to the same place for over a year.
   I have had 2 psychiatrists in my life and at the moment I am not seeing anyone.

7,"She’s currently in a mental health hospital and is trying to heal, and has had a lot of ups and downs over the past few years. She had a really bad day today and has had a lot of bad days over the last few months. I’ve been messaging her a lot and I check up on her, but I don’t know how else to help. I’m not allowed to send things into the hospital, and I don’t want to overwhelm her with messages or stress her out. It’s her birthday soon and I wanted to make her a crocheted blanket in the style and colours that she likes, but I’m not sure if it’ll be allowed into the hospital. By the time I finished it her birthday would have passed, but I really want to give her something homemade, do you think i should still make and send the blanket? What’s the best thing I can do to make sure she doesn’t feel alone and to help her? If you were in a hospital, what did you wish your friends did more to help?

8,"A stranger had non consensual sex with me while I was drinking. I was 19 and he was 30. He took me off the streets, brought me back to his place, and did this:
Bit me
Photographed me
Suffocated me
Held me in the room with him for hours
Continued to have sex with me after I was bleeding 
Forced me to sing for him
Screamed at me when I tried to leave 
Smirked and looked smug the whole time
Forced me to say things to him during the sexual parts
This was my first time having sex 

I managed to get away by waiting until he fell asleep and ran to the door. 
I showered and cried. 
I dropped out of college after this and developed PTSD.

I feel like I don’t have any right to be traumatized. Like it messed me up so badly that I’m still crippled by it twelve years later. Others have had it worse, though.

I always feel guilty that this affected me so much because I was technically an adult when this happened and not a kid, even though I was still a teenager at the time. 

19 feels so young even though it isn’t a childhood trauma per se.

9,"I’m starting therapy next week and don’t know how I feel about it. I get this impression that talking about my feelings and past traumas won’t help me overcome them. I want to stop feeling irrelevant and worthless, but I can’t really see how talking about my crappy upbringing is going to help me feel better. I’ve tried therapy in the past but had to quit it after 2 sessions due to work/school. So I don’t have enough experience with it to know if it’s helpful long term. I’ve been put on SSRI’s in the past but quit them because I ended up feeling nothing instead of the roller coaster of emotions I experience daily. I feel like it’s all manageable since I’ve escaped my “triggers” but I’m starting to feel super low on a consistent basis again.

10,"today i broke up with my boyfriend of 2 years. we’ve never been a great couple but i knew i genuinely loved him. in january i found out that he cheated on me multiple times with a girl he told me i wouldn’t have to worry about. i believed him. i found out a month after he had broken it off with her. he told me he realized he had made a mistake and that our relationship meant more to him and he took it for granted.  i didn’t want to feel like all of my hard work, effort, and time that i put into our relationship was for nothing so i forgave him. he really is a great person but it took me until today to realize he’s a terrible partner. after finding out he cheated on me, he initially gave me free reign of our relationship and said he would do anything to prove to me he was serious about fixing things. it was fine at first, i believed he would change. but then every time his phone went off, i would ask who it was. if he went someone i needed to know where he was going, who he was with, and what time he’d be back. i felt like his mother. my anxiety was through the roof and my depression hit me harder than it ever had because i never felt like i was enough. i have been slowly trying to work through this but after the first few months it seemed like he was fed up with it. he didn’t want to have to report back to someone all the time and i couldn’t manage to let him do what he wanted without having a panic attack. last night i found out he lied to me so i broke up with him. i feel like it’s for the best. i can’t deal with the constant anxiety anymore and to know that i’m feeling this way while he continues to lie makes me feel incredibly defeated. i know breaks up suck and i don’t want to sound like a whiny high school girl but i’ve traded anxiety for loneliness and neither of them feel good. i’m sorry for the rant but i feel so low right now i had to share my feelings.",27Jun2020,1
11,"For starters I’m 13. (I think that information is important for context I’m not sure) My parents raised me like crying was wrong. I remember in kindergarten they were having a small Christmas sale, where you could buy little gifts to give to friends and family. I cried the whole day, because I was upset I forgot my money. My Teacher wrote on my behavior report something along the lines of a kind note to  my parents that the does the sale everyday for a week (welp) and how upset I was and that I still had a few more days to go. My Dad read this note on my behavior sheet/report as he had to sign to sign it. He gave me a stern talking to about how crying like that is unacceptable. And to quit sniffling. 

I have a mentally challenged cousin (I don’t like saying special) who kind of stressed me out. (I still love them deeply) I would cry from the stress and my Mom looked at me digested. And no not because I was “Crying about a family member.” She didn’t even ask what was wrong. She just judged me because I was crying. “No one else here is like that. We didn’t raise you like this.” I was also young here. About 2nd grade. 

Now, she slams my door open and me aggressively tells me to “fix my face” when I make a disgusted face. I asked you kindly not to whap my door open randomly like that because it scares me. But of course when I reasonably show disliking for this I have an “attitude”. 

Now to the mental health part. I’m so young but I haven’t felt like myself in about 4 years. And no one noticed. But what hurts more is that my own parents didn’t notice it. Also, they are now asking me to “open up” and get frustrated when I panic and get too scared too. Why are you angry at me for expressing what you taught me? 

They don’t understand mental health and it shows. “I get depressed too sometimes. But I just think about the Lord and try to be more grateful. You should really be more grateful as well.” WOW. NEVER THOUGHT OF TRYING THAT. ITS NOT THAT SIMPLE. They are now looking for a counselor they say. But maybe if they had listened back then, I wouldn’t need one. 

Now I just can’t help but be distant from them. They just anger me. Sorry for typing so much. I probably sound like a brat, because I don’t even deserve to be depressed. But I really need to rant and I wanted a chance to finally talk to people about this. Also, sometimes I wish bad things would happen to me... so it could somehow help justify the way I feel.",27Jun2020,1

14,"I’ve (F24) been with my bf (M23) for almost a year and I’ve know the whole time that he struggles with depression but he doesn’t talk about it unless he’s drunk, which isn’t often. The other day we were both drunk and he started opening up so I asked him if he loves me. I’ve been wanting to ask for a long time but been too scared of the answer.

He told me he’s not letting himself fall in love with me cause if it doesn’t work out he feels like it’ll break him. He’s too scared of things not working out/ being rejected. He loved a girl once, his first girlfriend, and she’s the only one he’s said ""I love you"" to, and the break up messed him up. I know he’s also had a rough childhood with a dad who was abusive.

I asked him if he wants to end our relationship and just be friends, cause I want kids and marriage in the next couple of years and don’t want to ""waste my time"". He wasn’t able to give me an answer. It seems like he wants to love me and wants the best for me, but can’t give it to me right now (or maybe never). But he also doesn’t want to lose me, probably because I’m patient and the type of person who’s willing to help and be there cause I’ve been through depression myself. 

Our relationship is everything I’ve ever wanted except for the fact that he’s not in love with me. He’s always there for me, spends his time and money on us and has made sure I’m a part of his family and friend group. He supports my goals and makes me a better person and we always have fun and feel comfortable in eachothers company. 

I don’t want to talk to my friends about this because I know he’s very private about his personal struggles and I don’t want to break his trust. I also don’t want them to automatically go ""you deserve better"" and ""you deserve someone who loves you"" because I know I do, I just hope I can get there with him.

I don’t know if I should continue the relationship and hope he can let down his walls some day, or if I should move on and just help him as a friend (which will be quite difficult cause I’m in love with him). 

Any advice would be much appreciated!",27Jun2020,1
15,"I don’t know how to cope with anything happening around me right now- not sure if this is even the sub to put this on but I need to get this off my chest.

My therapist is out of state and we’ve been doing telehealth calls but recently it’s been difficult to schedule since I’ve been back at work.
But now that I’m in quarantine because one of my coworkers tested positive for covid, she isn’t answering. I understand she has her own shit to deal with, it’s just like- timing couldn’t be worse.

My MIL is addicted to drugs— don’t ask me which ones, I don’t know the name, I know they’re opioids. She abuses them heavily and the doctor that prescribes them seems to have no qualms about it at all. She has chronic migraines (so do I btw) and since she’s been prescribed these drugs(approx 1998), she always does the same thing:

Get the drugs, stash them away, go about her business until she feels a migraine coming or wants to get fucked up, then she pops that shit like MnM’s until she runs out. Usually a 30 day supply will last her 3-5 days. This upsets my wife *immensely* for obvious reasons.

MIL has been doing this since wife was about 10 years old, wife is 32 now so this has been a 20 year struggle.

Now— I’ve come to understand that every family has like a mental hurdle they can’t seem to overcome. For mine we had to realize that some stuff is just out of our control— and that’s ok. Wife’s family’s hurdle is essentially: yes I know something is wrong but I am choosing to ignore it and actively avoiding help.

The way I coped with my hurdle growing up was lashing out, screaming, fighting, I was very stiff and would never allow anyone around me to have any flexibility or variation in routine at all; hers is to lash out by telling you all of the many reasons- increasingly angrily- that she just shouldn’t/can’t/doesn’t want to/doesn’t need to change anything, that even though everything she’s doing and everything she’s saying to me is hurtful and she’s pushing her feelings down trying to squash it and cover up that she’s in pain by being an asshole; she just refuses help.

Her father before he passed had that issue: it killed him, literally he wouldn’t go to a doctor and we don’t know exactly why he died because of it.

MIL obviously manifests that through drugs, but she also runs herself down emotionally and physically by not eating, and refusing to let anyone else do housework. If you offer her help even if she is carrying 50lbs in each hand of water buckets to try and replenish the fish tanks she will refuse and  genuinely expect you to leave her alone.

My wife, as I am coming to find, whenever she is faced with stress just refuses to acknowledge that she is a person who needs to cope with things. She doesn’t want to take any anti-depressants her doctor recommends, she doesn’t want to go to therapy, she doesn’t think she needs anything except maybe to go out with her friends which she really can’t do right now. So instead she lashes out at me, and blames everything in the world besides what the actual problem is for her being rude or just fucking mean. 

Now I know, I can tell her that is her problem all day long, I can try to comfort her, I can try to talk her down from being upset— but it’s very hard to keep calm and positive whenever the pessimism and anger are being directed at you- especially by someone who should care about your feelings. She has periods throughout the day when she gets like this that she will calm down and thank me for being patient with her and say she’s sorry and appreciates my efforts, but then will turn around and do it again and again and again—

For example: we have a Pokémon game we like to play together. We like to play it before we go to bed. I come in, I get my game started, she says very casually “I’m getting sick of this stupid game.” Literally, yesterday, was telling me she loved it. I said “ok? Well, you don’t have to play it babe.” She continues “I’m not getting any new Pokémon, like when you told me about that ability yours have I’ve never even seen that before I don’t know what you mean, it’s not there. It’s stupid. Are you sure that’s what it says? I’ve never seen it, I think you may mean this. But that doesn’t help me either, so what the fuck ever.”

I didn’t really know what to do or say, but I offered to take a look at the Pokémon she had. She looked through them for maybe 1/2 a second before she just quit her game entirely- telling me that I’m better at the game, I’m just luckier than she is, everything nice happens to me, ect,.

I told her I was sorry she was so frustrated but asked her if she’d like to watch me play for a minute and I could tell her what I do, what moves I look for, and maybe she’d have more fun if she had a path to figure out the strategy that worked for her. She agreed, but proceeded the entire time to complain about how she doesn’t have what I have, how she’s never seen that move on a Pokémon, that it’s not exact and there isn’t a single hard and fast rule to get her all of the success she wants and that it’s too much work for her even if I’m literally showing her how to win- ect,. 

So I told her I wasn’t getting anywhere with her and that I can only be positive in the face of adversity for so long. She wanted a hug, she said she was sorry, and she didn’t know what was coming over her and her emotions were just so random and she couldn’t figure it out.



Like— bruh, yes you can. I can literally play connect the dots all across today with your emotions. Please acknowledge this.

She will not.

What the fuck do I do?",27Jun2020,1

24,"TL;DR I'm pretty much only depressed first thing in the morning, which keeps me in bed until the last possible second, so I'm looking for some advice and motivation to get out of bed and do productive things that I know will make me feel better.

I've (26F) had minor struggles with mental health my whole life, mostly with my self-esteem and probably social anxiety (undiagnosed), as well as likely depression (also undiagnosed, I've never been to a mental health professional) throughout college. I got through the worst times basically by having a mantra of ""it will get better,"" and by focusing on attaining a goal that would get me a step closer to what I'm looking for in life, and then on to the next goal.

Towards the end of last year, I completed nearly every goal I could think of. All I have left is paying off the credit card debt I racked up in college (which will be done in August!) and losing weight/getting in shape and then maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I made a lot of progress with the weight loss just by counting calories and meal planning, but I've really hit a plateau, especially now that I'm working from home since I hardly move during the day.

I want to incorporate some kind of workout in the morning, whether it be a walk, run, yoga video, etc. I *know* that I'll never be able/willing to do a workout after work since I just want to unwind and relax, plus the few times that I managed to work out in the morning before work, I just felt better on those days.

But this is where I'm stuck. I just *cannot* get my ass out of bed early enough to do anything besides rush to get to work, and it's been getting worse now that I'm working from my living room with no need to look presentable. 

I *know* getting up early will lead to a better day and help me attain my goals. I hype myself up in the afternoon/evening and convince myself I'll get up early tomorrow, and yet every time I wake up, I just feel depressed, turn the alarm off and either lay in bed dreading the day or go back to sleep. The only time I'm able to get up early is if my partner gets me up or if I'm really looking forward to something that day, neither of which is reasonable or possible every day.

32,"(i have ptsd, ocd, depression &amp; gad if that matters at all. i feel like the big two affecting me in this are ocd and ptsd.)

This might sound like a stupid question but here's the jist of it. I (18f) just had my first kiss yesterday with a with a girl who I thought and still,, think I have a crush on. She's 20, and I've known her for the past 3 years platonically, and within the past month or so we started flirting. 

After we kissed I felt so so so detached and awkward. Reflecting on it I definitely dissociated. She has more experience in everything over me, and I know awhile ago before that I expressed to her I hadn't really done anything intimate with anyone, but I don't know exactly if she remembered that information or not, or if she assumed that changed. She wanted me to lead in everything and I kinda just spaced out for the rest of our date and convinced myself that I'm an awful kisser, which probably isn't far off with it being my first kiss, but I took it to the extent that that could end this whole relationship.

Looking back I don't think I fucked up too badly because we cuddled after (as much as you can in the front seats of a car) and she had me kiss her a few more times but my thoughts are also trying to grab at the fact that she might've done that to comfort me (even though the extent of me being physically upset was zoning out). 

I just felt nothing, and when she had me kiss her the few times after that it felt kinda like a chore?? But I did really enjoy the cuddling. The kissing just felt so rightfully foreign, but not in a good way, and I'm worried that that might continue?? I didn't like it, and I have high avoidance when I dislike something. And the way I usually work with that element of my mental illness is just,, eventually working up the nerve to stop or force myself through whatever I'm anxious with but obviously that's not really what you're supposed to do with intimacy. 

I don't know I'm just so confused over the entire thing and my brain is really trying to fuck it all up for me because the thought of someone being interested in me is so foreign and seems impossible. But back to my question. Can I consent?? What's the difference between just anxiety over first time intimacy, and being genuinely disinterested and forcing myself into something I might regret?",27Jun2020,1

34,"So for a few years now I believe I've had Social Anxiety disorder. It's progressed so much worse over time, but the basic kinda things apply. Being afraid to leave my house, being terrified of interaction on the street, intrusive thoughts constantly running through my head while I'm out, crossing streets and avoiding people, being in a constant fight or flight mode while I'm out, worrying about other people in my family doing basic stuff. The list goes on and you get the point, but earlier I had a panic attack and it's the absolute most noided I've ever been. I was in complete stress mode. I couldn't go near a window because I thought people could be possibly hiding outside my house looking in, I had to turn off the lights to avoid attention from the outside and so nobody could see me as a target, I let my dog out to pee while this was going on and when she started barking to get in I almost lost my shit because I thought someone would hear her and come get us. Just being in my house was the most terrifying thing.

50," 

She said that looking at me makes her scared because I remind her of a terrorist. I am extremely introverted, so I spend a lot of time on my room. She says doing this makes me a psycho because no one would spend that much time in their room. And also because of my facial expressions, mainly my eyes, or lack thereof of expression.

She also said I seem anxious and panicky when I talk to other people which is also an indicator that I am a terrorist type of person. She says that if I was given the opportunity I would probably kill my parents and take all of their money.

I had a psychotic episode around a year ago where I made false allegations of sexual abuse toward my parents so ever since then my mom has been calling me a psycho. She called me a terrorist for the first time yesterday, and it really stung.

I am not psychotic at the moment, but I admit that I am quiet and reserved but I am generally respectful and nice towards everyone.

53,"I don’t know how else to explain it. It’s like every emotion I feel is so incredibly dulled compared to how I remember it being when I was younger. My memory is terrible. I don’t remember anything from more than a year ago, only a couple specific flashes of moments and faces but no solid or cohesive scenes of anything at all. I can’t focus on anything. I used to read tons of books as a kid and now I have to read a paragraph six times to even understand it. I don’t care about anything like I used to. I do have one deep hyper-fixated passion for violin and that helps some but even that, while still stronger than everything else in my life, feels less vibrant than before. And it’s not because I enjoy it less either, like I said it’s just that everything in my life has been dulled. It’s like I see things in shades of gray now. Or like everything is foggy or something. It’s hard to explain. 

I don’t care about my friends. Reaching out to anyone is a chore. I see messages from my friends and I ignore them because it just takes too much energy for me to respond. I feel like the worst person ever because I simply don’t care if they all leave me. And I know I should care but it’s too exhausting to. I’m so tired all the time. 

My baseline emotion is just... nothing. Good emotions are so fleeting and are immediately dragged down by negative thoughts and I return to my baseline of miserable complacency. I almost feel like I’m just existing and watching myself do the same damn thing every day. (It’s weird that this bothers me though, because I’m also kind of addicted to having a routine, like when stuff doesn’t go as planned I get ridiculously upset). And yet I’ve been able to power through like this for the past three years. I’m almost able to trick myself into believing I’m fine. But the truth is, I cannot live in a world where this is the best it ever gets. I want more.

My parents won’t take me to get a diagnosis, let alone any kind of therapy or help. I don’t think I’ve told them enough to convince them I really need help because honestly, I’m afraid of scaring them or making them feel like they’re bad parents. So, they make me feel overdramatic every time I bring it up and it just makes me feel worse. 

I’m so so so private with everyone in my life so I know what I need is a person who I am allowed to dump my feelings onto without me feeling bad or like a burden. I need someone like that who doesn’t have a connection to my life. Absolutely no on I know knows that I feel this way, which is fine by me, but I’m so done being the only one carrying this burden.

I'm not sure, my Mom was kind of like probing me about it like, ""So, are you feeling good? Are you happy?"" And it's like, I haven't been happy in 20 years. Years ago I gave up on my desire for my father's love. Now I am receiving it possibly just because they feel bad? I don't really know. If it doesn't pertain to me it's pure hypothesis.

I need to elaborate on the lack of happiness.
When I had my kid, I felt so content. I felt high. I still feel that way when she talks to me or asks me to play with her. I love watching her light up when she has a potential new friend, I love her self confidence and how she tells people ""I'm already beautiful but I like getting dressed up"" and how eager she is to learn and try new things. Yeah, I need time away from her sometimes but, she is a huge beacon and tether in my life. How  this wonderful human loves me baffles me, how do we share the same DNA? It dawns on me from time to time that I get to be in this kids life, I get to hold her, hear about her dreams and watch her turn into whatever she wants. Its insane.

Interacting with my family brings me no happiness. It is like marching to the gallows. I face my punishment and I can live in peace for a few weeks. When I don't go I am questioned and rumors fly wildly about that I hate everyone and am selfish, etc. Whereas if I just go and participate in a conversation, laugh at some shit jokes, I'm home free in an hour to 90 minutes.

63,"I had a job that I loved. I worked as a Manager for a local lumber yard and i busted my ass for 7 years to get where I was. I was damn good at my job. My employees awarded me “Person of the Year” for the entire company. That job taught me that I’m a great leader when.. I never thought I was. I always thought I was a follower. 

But I had a shitty boss. Who was threatened because I did more to run our store than he did. And finally he found a way to fire me. I watched 7-8 employees quit or transfer after he fired me because they didn’t want to work with him without me there. As gratifying as that was, I still lost my job. 

It’s been almost 6 months and it still hurts me badly. It was my home and I was so incredibly proud of the work I was doing and the people I was helping. And it was taken from me. I’ve struggled with depression, ADHD, and PTSD since I was a teenager. But my uncle
told me he had never seen me as happy as I was working there. 

So i’ve been home. Covid has made it hard to find work. I’ve been lazy and depressed and have spent my days either sleeping or playing video games. 

I finally got back on track with my meds and started feeling like I could get back on my feet so I found a part time job. Just to help my wife with our bills. I started it today. 

It’s a warehouse job. sorting packages. something easy and thoughtless. But it was the worst thing i’ve ever done. I’ve never felt so... degraded. It didn’t help that my supervisor acted like he needed to over explain how to sort between odd and even numbers. But i just felt.. my ego crumble. 

I went from changing peoples lives. being part of helping a company adapt their policies and practices. and writing /executing my own curriculum for training and employee development. all on top of typical Manager tasks. And I excelled at all of that. to now just... be sorting boxes by odd and even numbers. 

I don’t know if I can go back. It feels egotistical or elitist of me but I also want to be able to feel proud of what I do. I’ve always been someone who goes for what I want and love doing, not for money. So it’s a very tough thing.

i wasn’t insecure about my body, i was intuitive eating, i was happily exercising, i was reading and writing. but that lasted at least a week before i just dragged myself back down to the level i was on before.

So recent incidents of him being a dick to me: 

I slept in today and the only reason I woke up is because he was yelling at my mom that I had left the AC on all night. I was supposed to shut it off early in the morning but I didn’t wake up on time because I was so tired. A few days ago when they got home, dad found something I did wrong. I don’t remember what it was but he was SURE I did it on purpose. WTF. The other night after dinner, I left to use the bathroom. I excused myself so they know I’m not trying to get out of doing dishes. I hear my dad complaining how I just left my dishes at the dining table and my mom told him I was in the restroom. Then he says “but she always does this!!!” which is weird because I don’t. I don’t even mind washing the dishes. When I confront her about it, she lies and tells me that isn’t what he said. She always covers it up I think coz she doesn’t want us to fight we fought before over me putting a dish in the wrong sink. The wrong sink!!! And went into a downward spiral as this was a time when my mental health was especially bad so I went to live with my sister for a while. I could have handled that better and not left my mom alone and made her more stressed.

Some past incidents of him being a dick to my siblings but most especially my mom: 

Once my sister and BIL were late to dinner with my uncle and my dad told my uncle that they do it on purpose so that people can’t ask them questions about what they do. They’re psychologists so IDK what he meant by that. And also they’re ALWAYS late to things because they’re very busy with work and have two little kids. 

He slapped my mom before in front of his nephew because his feelings got hurt because she was entertaining his nephew when he came over. Another time, he got mad at her because she talked about hiring a driver and he got jealous. And when she went to visit him when he was still a seaman, she got mad at her for helping the chef cook. He said she wasn’t allowed to go out of their room the whole time she was there. She also went home crying when she was on her way home from visiting him overseas because of something he did. Most of these incidents happened when I wasn’t around or when I was little so might have mixed them up but it doesn’t take away the fact that my dad’s always been an abusive piece of shit. 

After an incident, my dad would just make it up to my mom by being nice and sweet.

The other day mom mentioned wanting to see a counselor because she has been really stressed out because of dad (but I’m sure I play a part in this too because I have been jobless and depressed). Dad cannot function without her. He needs things when he’s repairing our cars but makes my mom come with him to buy shit because he can’t do the talking. When he does, he gets easily pissed and sometimes yells at people which embarrasses mom. He gets mad at them for things that are his fault as well. It could be that he’s actively looking for faults in shit I do because mom is really stressed out because of HIM and the stuff he complains about me (not washing dishes etc) are things mom complained to me about him. 

It’s never his fault, always someone else’s. Like when he accidentally breaks something, he’d be like “then why did you put it there?” “Why was it there in the first place?” 

I sent her a list of counselors she could talk to  the next day after she mentioned wanting to talk to one. I said maybe we could go together coz I feel like I wanna go back to therapy. She said she doesn’t want to anymore (maybe coz it’s expensive and tends to put herself low on her priority list) so now idk what to do.

Any advice on how to help mom? I can’t move out at the moment because I got laid off start of lockdown and I got rehired as freelancer three weeks ago but I’m not getting paid as much. Also my depression is starting to creep in so I’m always in bed and playing games unless my mom needs help with house work. I feel like this plays a part in him treating me like shit coz he feels like I’m a bum. He always mentions my playing games.

Right now my only options are to help my mom more with house work. Talk to a counselor now that I can afford therapy again because I don’t wanna let myself spiral down again, and tell my sis about all of this coz she is a psychologist and maybe can help my mom.

My siblings and I have told her before to leave dad but she always changes her mind. Is it a good idea to bring this up again? I don’t wanna pressure her and make her more stressed.

What else can I do to help my mom?",27Jun2020,1
73,"As of writing this post I haven’t slept since two days ago. I feel a constant sense of alertness and my thoughts are racing and unfocused. While this is a problem, I have noticed many benefits as well. I feel more confident and engaged around other people, I feel more creative, and I feel like myself. I don’t feel down and cynical anymore, I have lots of strong opinions about things, and no anxiety.

However I am very tired, and while I project a different and more stronger aura, I feel like I am losing clarity. The way time passes feels strangely different too, like everything is sped up.

I am hoping that all of this will subside and blow over as I adjust to being unmedicated. I believe that ultimately it’s the correct thing to do for my life. Even if I go out in a crashing blaze, it’s for the better. 

Are you bipolar and unmedicated? Can you please share your experience and wisdom? I would very much like to talk to someone who understands what I’m going through and how I feel. Thank you. It would mean a lot to me.",27Jun2020,1
74,"a few days ago i was scrolling through snapchat stories and i stumbled across a girls, she posted a picture of her legs which were covered in cuts most of them were very deep and wide (they were obviously self made) and well ive struggled with self harm for about almost 2 years now and i guess seeing that made me want to do it myself and just wanted to feel the pain? (that sounds super morbid wow) that day i relapsed,thankfully though i didn’t do many and was able to control myself. ever since then every time i think about it i wanted to do it myself but i’m not even sad about it? im not crying and i’m not scared or anything? this isn’t normal at all i know that, but i dunno the only thing stopping me currently is that i don’t want to make my family sad. anyways my question is what the f!ck is wrong with me? is this part of depression? or is it something else? has anyone else felt like this?",27Jun2020,1
75,"Spent a month receiving Electroshock therapy in the hospital and it did next to nothing, really not hopeful about the future

Been suffering from debilitating depression, anxiety and ptsd most of my (23 M) life, have received all sorts of medications and worked with many therapists and tried many forms of therapy but nothing has really helped me consistently.  I’ve been hospitalized (for severe apathetic depression and suicidal ideation) 4 times, been to PHP programs and an RCT, a meditation retreat, nami groups, all kinds of things...

Despite all of this I haven’t been able to get my life together and barely graduated high school. Haven’t been working or in school or doing anything with my life the past 4 years.  Right now living with a parent and barely ever leaving my room or socially interacting with others in person.  Past year I’ve been missing therapy appointments I’ve set on purpose because I really don’t see them as helpful most days.

ECT treatment was a last hope and it didn’t offer any noticeable benefits.  Just hopeless about the future and don’t see things changing.

76,"Last few months I find myself having these painful flashbacks. I don’t see the moments I think back to as trauma, but I react as if I’m In that situation again like I will physically jump. I think about the moments I freaked out in front of my friends. I struggle with anxiety and depression. There was one time I freaked out over my boyfriend at the time dancing with another girl started driving fast almost got in a wreck and started screaming and crying. Something my friend witnessed . Another time In  college  I went through a period where I thought all my friends were against me . Made dumb shady tweets and had an intervention with them where I started screaming , yelling and crying again. Looking back I know i was in the wrong on a few things. I should’ve been there for them more and shouldn’t have felt like they were always against me. I’m not really friends with them anymore, so I always look back at how terrible I was and how I ruined relationships. I also flashback to when I admitted  to my boyfriend at the time I was suicidal. It was after another dumb argument . I was upset because he said he’d dance with girls when he went out and let them twerk on him and I completely broke down. I had a panic attack after we argued (we were already in a rocky place . He was controlling and abusive ). It got so bad I told him i was scared to be alone because I was suicidal. My head wasn’t in the right place. Long story short I went to the ER because I didn’t know what to do. I just know i didn’t want to feel like I would harm myself. I went to a women’s and children’s hospital not knowing it wasn’t the right one to go too. My boyfriend was with me and saw me break down. The nursing staff literally did not care at all. I was given some kind of shot to calm me
Down. At one point they told my boyfriend how they only deal with pregnant women and kids and if something “is actually  wrong with me” the next time to go to another hospital. I felt like a huge inconvenience to them because they showed it. They had no empathy and worse of all, my boyfriend witnessed it all. He would bring up afterwards how he was the only one there for me , no one cared and how I “owed him my life” 
He was also dealing with the death of his father and I’m scaring him with suicide .
While my family tells me I shouldn’t let that ignore how abusive he was to me. I keep thinking how I caused a lot of negativity and toxic to other people’s lives and why our relationships never worked out. I flash back to these moments and constantly cry or think about how I ruined a lot of relationships. How can I move on from this. How do I make it stop? Anyone else deal with this?",27Jun2020,1

80,"24F, I have a long history of poor mental health. I was extremely suicidal during my adolescence, and when I was in early high school I tried to talk my mom and grandma about it. At this time my mom was still going to all of my doctor's appointments with me, I don't recall many details but I started going to a therapist and got a prescription to take fish oil pills. I live in a small town and the therapist was the sister of one of my teachers, and I'm from a well known family. That didn't last long. I went to a different therapist which ended the same way. A couple years ago I tried to see another therapist, who literally told me I have nothing to be sad about. I only saw her once. The only advice my family directly gave me was to distract myself and get over it.

It took me years to decide to change myself, which I purposely set my mind to in my junior year of high school. Since then I've bombed out of college, and failed at almost everything. In the last 3 years I've managed to get a full time job and move out of my parents house. Last year I went on my own health insurance and found a new PCP, specifically female because up until then every doctor I've seen has been male, which has failed miserably. She's amazing, and has helped me more in the last year than anyone prior.

Earlier this year I got severely ill for 2 weeks and couldn't even leave my bed. Long story short, despite my doctor's orders to test me for Covid19 the hospital refused. I then asked my doctor to put me on indefinite medical leave, because up until then my work had been calling me every day asking when I'd be coming in and if  they needed to fill my schedule. I couldn't talk, breathe, or move the entire time I was sick. It was absolute hell. At one point I collapsed in my kitchen, and couldn't move for about 30 minutes. I know because all I could do was stare st the clock and cry. The day after is when I went on medical leave. The hospital said the only way they'd test me was if I couldn't make it to my bathroom from my bedroom. At that point, at least in my head, I'd resigned to the belief that no one would help he unless I was in a body bag. And would I rather die in a hospital, potentially infecting countless workers, or die in my own home. I chose home.

I took a 30 day leave from work after recovering, which ended 2 months ago. I haven't been the same since I was sick. I've been wanting to leave my work over a year but have always struggled with long term goals, in my mind due to previously being extremely suicidal and not believing I'd live past high school. Everything in my life over the 4 months has been a total shit show, I haven't been able to sleep or eat. I break down crying almost every day. The years of work I did to help myself are completely destroyed, and I feel completely useless. I haven't been to work in almost 3 weeks. 

Obviously my history is more in depth than this, but there's specific details I've come to terms with and have learned to control and don't want to/feel the need to bring up. And I think this post is long enough.

My question after that rambling is, does anyone have anything specific they believe I should ask my doctor about? I have no interest in trying therapy again, thats failed miserably enough times. Earlier this year she had me try doxepin to help with my insomnia, which I want to continue, but I don't believe that will be enough anymore. I understand there's no ""miracle cure"", but I've tried every home remedy there is. At this point it's a medical issue that desperately needs to be addressed.",27Jun2020,1
81,"I have no idea where to post this, so I’d assume this is the best place. If not, please direct me to a better subreddit- I’d appreciate it!

For as long as I can remember, I’ve experienced these moments where I would simply blackout. I would stop whatever I was doing and stare blankly- I have no thoughts and I can’t process anything around me. I usually only realize they happen because I’ll miss a part of a conversation or something. They usually last a couple of seconds and seem to be brought on by stress, but they happen completely at random anyway. I can go a week or two without having one, or have 7 in a day. I can also drive perfectly fine whilst having one, so there’s obviously some form of consciousness there but I don’t realize it. If I’m not driving, I’ll stand/sit completely still and freeze up. It’s like I’m asleep but I’m fully awake, still breathing and all.

These have been disproven to be seizures and I’m soon getting tested for narcolepsy, though I have no symptoms of it and it’s more to rule it out. Some theorized they could come from childhood trauma, as I was in a terrible situation for all of my developmental years and recently lost my father to cancer (around this time the ‘blackout’ sessions would ramp up). I didn’t really consider my youth traumatic but according to other people it was.

I figured this had to be something mental, as I suffer from depression and anxiety. I’m not medicated for these as I don’t really like taking meds if I don’t have to.

Again, sorry if this isn’t the right subreddit, if someone could direct me to a better one I would very much appreciate it. If anybody has any theories please tell me so. This ‘thing’ I’m dealing with isn’t detrimental to my health, but I feel like an outcast, especially if I have a very obvious one in public.

89,"Hi everyone. First of all, I appreciate any feedback. This has been a real struggle for me. So, some background information. I am a 20 year old guy in a relationship with a soon to be 21 year old girl. The thing is, her drinking makes me super anxious. This is (I think) mostly due to her being raped before we met and alcohol was a contributing factor to that (I'm not in any blaming her. Just saying that alcohol was involved). It's so bad to the point that talking about it makes me more anxious than when I went skydiving. I went skydiving to break my fear of heights (Didn't work. Was scary). Anyway, her 21st birthday is coming up soon and I can't be with her because she's on a family vacation. We've talked about it and established ways to mitigate my anxiety while she can still have fun and enjoy her 21st to the fullest. Is there any advice you all can give on how to handle this? This will probably be by far the most anxious day of my life and previously when I've been this anxious I've turned to unhealthy ways of coping such as cutting.

91,"I'm a teenager, i broke up with my girlfriend a couple months ago after i realized things weren't working out, no screaming or arguing just sadness. About a month later i we talked because i initially wanted to be friends afterwards but that didn't work. I started to blame myself for all the stuff that went wrong and see that i was way too sexual and did stuff i shouldn't have(nothing illegal or whatever just enough to make me feel like a garbage human). I was always occupied with hormones and stuff polluting my brain but i did love her and i thought i could be myself around her and she was someone to talk to when i was upset. She did force me to text her hours apon hours a day but i was happy to completely fhange my life for her. I really felt we had something for the longest time then one day it left, i lost it she yelled at me more and became more emotionally distant and maybe even intentionally hanging with guys i was a little jealous of how well they got along together. The last days i was dating her right before quarantine i was thinking this is the end so i should just break off things off. i was sad but i wasn't crying which i usually do, i hated myself then saying to myself  in my head"" why do you not cry? Are you a sociopath or something? Wtf is wrong with you"" (tbh i still feel those ways). I tried to occupy myself and play games with my friends like usual but a couple weeks later i talked to her saying i still have feelings and i can't even remember at this point but i changed my mind immediately and she rightly got mad at me. We kept talking on and off about what happened in our day or how we should be friends but i always f'd it up and realized that we weren't supposed to be friends this is a breakup and we don't even get along together as people in the first place why did we date. Continuing to hate myself i talked to her one day and she for some reason we started arguing and she at the end she said ""btw I'm talking to 'friends name' (one of my friends I'd been hanging with to get over the breakup) and i like him. Just wanted you to hear that from me"". I lost my shit and started screaming and crying and hitting myself. I thought that guy was my friend but he had been putting on a show everytime i talked about how i felt bad and hated myself over the breakup while he was hitting it up with my ex of 1 or 2 weeks at the time. I cursed at her over text and went all out on her while having a panic attack. I talked to anyone in my family for help and my sister went off on her without me telling me to so i lost all my mutual friends with her because of that.

But of course that was only momentary. It's been a while since then i finally stopped talking to her. She tried to excuse her self saying they were barely talking and that she stopped talking with him and she's gonna be single now but i can't believe her. I honestly don't care what happens with her.

Thoughts? I feel kinda alone on this. Dling my best to handle this conflict in reminding myself that labels are just labels. But in this case BPD has a COMPLETELY different treatment style than depression.",27Jun2020,1
98,"I just can’t deal with living in my family home anymore and not having my own space. 

For as long as I can remember I been sleeping on the couch and I never had my own space till I went to college and was able to dorm there. Where ever I would come back home it just trigger bad memories and recently one of our pipes bursted through our floor so there has an infestation of very big roaches.

I sleep in the living room where the pipe busted up so every night I am dealt with big roaches and it makes me break down every time. The fact that they are so big like the length of my pointer finger makes it really hard for me to be able to sleep comfortable. I literally get panics attacks when I see them since they just remind me of how I never had control of my own space and no matter how much I try to change it I’ll never truly own this space. That makes me realize how much better I like it at my college since it’s helps me feel like I’m actually in control of something.

I’m currently hiding in the bathroom right now as I type this since I just can’t deal with the roaches anymore and it’s just breakdown after breakdown after I see them.  I don’t want to wake any of my family since I feel like I’m being a burden but I just can’t do it anymore living here. I wish I had stayed at college for the summer so I could at least be closer to my boyfriend and that would help me feel better. 

It sucks since I have been doing so much so that when I finally leave my home I can get the therapy I need since my parents don’t believe mental illness is a real thing and feel that they can pray it away. It feels like my mental health is deteriorating faster than I expected and I’m scared about how it’s gonna be when I hit rock bottom.

I would really like to go to a professional to discuss my current issues. I relate very closely to bpd symptoms, but also a couple other things, like autism. I know some symptoms overlap and I don't want to continue my self diagnosis. I truely don't know enough. So need to go to a pro.

I'm scared to go to my doctor because in the past I got help for my eating and self esteem issues. I know I've built this issue up in my head, but, if I went in there asking for help, it would just hurt and embarrass me to bring it up. I'm scared they think I'm making this up. 

I need a pro to tell me if the way that I think and navigate the world is typical.

Even when I want to do other things, I just HAVE to redo them until they're perfect or nobody can see me.

I want to share some of the insights I've gathered with you, since a few of my friends found this information to be very helpful.

I've been depressed since at least the age of 5. My parents are narcissists, and since children are always an imprint of their surroundings, I've got those issues I'm now dealing with. I've always known that something wasn't right, but only 2 years ago, at the age of 20, I've finally gotten a diagnosis. Combined Personality Disorder (schizoid, paranoid, narcissistic, anankastic) and Depression was the conclusion of multiple doctors and therapists.

In the past 2 years, I've spent 6 months in hospitals, either in psychiatric or psychosomatic wards, and with my last 6 week stay ending in January, for the first time in my life I'm in a position where I can feel emotions (though I still have to learn to interpret them correctly), I don't feel depressed and I can work towards the next low of the up-and-down cycle that is life. With that in mind, here's what I've learned:

&amp;#x200B;

**Recognize and acknowledge your strengths.**

We're good at solving problems. Somehow, we can't solve our own problems nearly as well as those of other people. The core of this issue is that when giving someone else advice, you factor in their resources, including their strengths. In today's society acknowledging our strengths counts as egoistic, while in reality we hamper our problem solving capabilities by not including all of our resources - and that isn't fair. While we ponder our problems, we always see our issues and shortcomings, we don't see our strengths. This mindset does not add to our abilities. So we should discard it.

There are several ways to train your awareness. Try to list one -any- strength of yours for every weakness or shortcoming you see in yourself. Even abstract strengths (maybe you're skilled in drawing?) have a strong foundation of multiple attributes you can add to your pool of resources you're aware of. For me, I've found a lot of value in viewing my weaknesses as strengths, just wielding them incorrectly. An example: My inability to feel emotions seems -and is- a huge shortcoming. I lack dreams and ambitions, I don't ever feel happy, just content. However, there is a reason for that: I cut off my emotions to survive my childhood. And this behavior is a strength and weakness I've trained and perfected for 17 years now. I just wield this as a blunt instrument of force, rather than applying it when necessary. I still have to learn that. The strength in this is that while I can't fly high on emotions, I also can't fall very deep. I never hit rock- bottom.

An easier example, one which I don't struggle with, but is common enough: Worrying. The constant, endless worrying, without a break, over situations that you've played out a thousand times already in your mind. A friend said to me that she didn't want to worry anymore. However, worrying has a purpose and therefore some strengths, she just wields this tool incorrectly and has to learn how and when to use it appropriately. Worrying allows you to prepare for eventualities, to have a plan handy for situations that might otherwise surprise and overwhelm you. The constant, endless worrying however immobilizes and stuns you completely. Nonetheless, there IS an underlying strength. And you're especially good at it, you've perfected this behavior over years, albeit not in a useful way. AND you can change it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Therapy and change isn't about doing a 180, it's about balance.**

Say you're suffering from this constant worrying. ""I don't want to worry anymore"" is an approach that probably won't lead you anywhere useful. You are good at it, so why discard this tool? Therapy isn't about throwing this tool away, therapy is about learning to use this tool in a balanced way that helps you as a person. To change, most of the time, you don't want to stop one behavior or thought pattern and replace it with something new. You want to understand this behavior. What are the strengths and weaknesses there are to it? Why do you slip into it? What is it about, why does it exist? How would a healthy mind use this ability/ thought pattern? And with those answers will come the understanding that the ability itself is valuable, just wielded incorrectly. Therapy is about learning how to wield those abilities of yours, how to balance them. Perhaps you find some behavior is severely lacking or not developed at all, and doing so will balance out this one behavior of yours - the one you wanted to discard.

&amp;#x200B;

**Stop accepting responsibility that isn't yours, start accepting responsibility that is yours.**

I feel like this is one of the main issues holding a lot of people back. Whenever you interact in any way with someone, there are ALWAYS at least 2 responsibilities involved. You may be afraid to change something because it might not suit somebody else. Why do you take their responsibility? It is up to them to deal with their responsibility. They have to learn how to accept things, they have to learn how to deal with their own emotions, it is not something you can or should do for them.

Interactions with parents are a fitting topic. You can consider doing something that might or will hurt them. With you even considering it, you clearly have fulfilled your responsibility: You have thought about how your decision might or will influence and effect someone else. You have done your part already! Considering how actions might influence some morals or society norms is certainly important. And in doing so, you have accepted responsibility toward yourself/ society. Your counterpart has no right to demand or force you to act in a way that will suit them. How they deal with your decision is THEIR responsibility, as your responsibility is towards yourself and the moral code you hold. You acknowledge their feelings, you might even apologize for your decision and the feelings they must now be feeling, but that's all the responsibility you can take. Don't take any more. It isn't yours.

A more structured example would be a situation I had in my most recent hospital stay. The problem solving group was a group of 4-10 people plus a therapist. A group member could elaborate on a problem and the group could add a lot of different points of view to the situation, while the therapist chimed in from time to time and gave some good feedback to think about. It was my last session before being discharged and I wanted to bring in one more topic. A group member also had a topic. We decided to choose her topic. At the end, I foresaw that she wanted to apologize to me, as she had just taken my last chance to bring in a topic. At least that's how she saw it, because she kept pulling all the responsibility that wasn't hers to herself. The responsibility for the decision on who brings in his topic lies as follows:

I had the responsibility to decide if I wanted to give way or stay my ground. I decided that her topic was a lot more immediate and a lot more important. I had had 4 topics in my 6 weeks there, a lot more than any other patient. I didn't deem my topic very important, it was a minor question. Also, her topic needed answers as soon as possible. Naturally, I decided that I'd rather discuss her topic, especially since it was a topic I could also learn a lot from (as I haven't experienced this problem myself), maybe even more than from my own topic. The decision to let her have her topic over mine is my responsibility, not hers. I decided myself and took the responsibility that was mine myself, so why should she take it?

Every member of the group is part of the decision making process. After hearing my reasoning, they also decided to discuss her topic. Also their responsibility, not hers. The therapist is naturally also part of the decision making process. His responsibility, not hers.

So, we had 8 people in that room, and she tried to take sole responsibility for the decision. A lot of people do this, to certain degrees. I urge you to think about this very carefully and be ever vigilant of this issue if you struggle with it. Being aware of this pattern can accelerate your healing process immensely.

&amp;#x200B;

**Become more self reflected, question your rules and morals: Is the game of life even winnable if you live your life with your rules stacked against yourself?**

Every behavioral pattern is rooted deeply inside you, held in place by the rules you live by. They might not even be your rules, but the rules put inside your head by your parents or the social environment you grew up in. So much of your behavior is automatic and therefore difficult to analyze. The rules however lay the groundwork for the automation, and are therefore your prime focus when healing.

This process can involve a lot of emotional pain and is very mentally draining, so I highly encourage you to work through this with a therapist. While it may look easy at first glance, it can go extremely in- depth and you can spend multiple weeks of therapy sessions on working through your rules for only one single topic. That being said, here is what it should look like:

First begin with the rules you live by. You probably may not even like them, or even hate them, yet they're still deeply rooted within you. In my case, some rules can be summarized to:

""I have to function, regardless how high a prize I have to pay for it. Otherwise, I'll be punished.""

""It's irrelevant how I feel.""

""I don't need recognition or appreciation.""

""Love is always bound to conditions and thus must be earned.""

Now ask yourself: ""If life is a game, and these are the rules the game is played by... Is this game winnable? How do the rules have to look like to make that game winnable?""

A very important thing for a lot of people to learn is that it's okay to say no. Easier said than done. Now, let's have an example of how this rule might look like:

""I feel guilty, whenever: ""

* someone is disappointed
* I can't seem to please someone
* I destroy harmony (say hello, responsibility topic)
* someone suffers/ is hurt by my actions
* I do as I want
* I do the contrary of what is expected that I do

Those might be some rules people who can't say no live by. Doesn't look fair nor winnable, does it? Let's make some small changes to make this game fair then:

""I only feel guilty, when: ""

* I treat others unfairly
* I act without compromises
* I deal in absolutes
* I hurt someone knowingly and on purpose

Looks a lot better, huh? A lot more fair, especially towards yourself, while still complying with the general code of moral society has. If you go one step further and define some more rules that follow this conclusion, you might arrive at something close to this:

""I'm allowed to consider my own needs, to have a free will to decide.""

""I'm allowed to question something/ someone.""

""I recognize the feelings of someone and I may apologize for the feelings they now have, but I don't take any further responsibility.""

&amp;#x200B;

**Use sadness and hurt as a catalyst for change: The 2x2 table**

This is my tool of choice to break behavioral patterns. All the knowledge you have gathered about yourself, all the awareness of your patterns won't do you a lot of good if you don't use this ammunition. This method is intended to hurt you emotionally, I therefore highly recommend to work on this with a therapist. The principle is simple. There are two types of motivation: towards something and away from something. Sadly, towards something usually doesn't quite cut it with issues rooted this deeply. Therefore, away from something (in this case: emotional pain and a bleak future) is what this tool uses. The 4 panels are designed to contain following information regarding your behavioral patterns (you should do a table for every behavior you want to change):

* What do you gain by keeping this behavior (advantage x keep)
* What do you lose by keeping this behavior (disadvantage x keep)
* What do you gain by changing this behavior (advantage x change)
* What do you lose by changing this behavior (disadvantage x change)

While the panels \[advantage x keep\] and \[disadvantage x change\] are stronger (or else you'd have changed something by now), you won't break this habit/ behavior. The panel \[advantage x change\] contains the motivation towards something. Therefore, you want to mostly focus on the last panel: \[disadvantage x keep\]. Once those 2 panels (\[advantage x change\] and \[disadvantage x keep\]) are stronger than the other 2 panels, you've got what it needs to change.

Bear in mind, you want to exaggerate in the \[disadvantage x keep\] panel, as you also exaggerate in the \[advantage x keep\] and \[disadvantage x change\] panels by including potential gains and losses. You should ask yourself: What would happen to me if I live my life like this for another 5/10/20 years? How would I look back at my life when I'm on my deathbed and reflect on my life and all I'd see is this issue holding me back, that behavior I never changed. The pain you'll feel there while filling the \[disadvantage x keep\] panel with this question in mind will be the motivation you need to break the behavior. And you need the self reflection and mental vigilance you've gained (as per the previous 4 insights mentioned above) to constantly be aware of what's happening in your head and to recognize the trigger for that behavior being pulled, so you can step in and break the pattern. While I don't feel proud about going through therapy at such a young age, future me will thank me big time. I can't feel it now, but I'm pretty certain that in the future, I'll be extremely thankful that I've decided to go through everything while the scars are still relatively fresh.

As an example, I want to come back to the endless worrying. This loop without a break that keeps running... To break that loop, you don't need a distraction. You need the pain of knowing what this behavior will do to you if you continue with it for the rest of your life. And you need a great deal of patience and training. And someday, you will learn how to worry in a healthy way, how to use this tool you're just too good at for your own good in a more balanced way, perhaps reserving it for only the right and according situations, where a great deal of thought and planning is actually required.",27Jun2020,1
117,"Alright, so, i really don't know if i can explain this feeling and i don't thing someone will even get it, but i'll try anyway :d

So, a little context. I am a 15 year old female, i think i may have anger issues and be depressed, and of course i don't want to self diagnose, but since my mother is telling me bs that therapists are in it only for the money and that they are scamming assholes, i won't see one in the near future. I have also been self harming for almost a year, it started with just a needle and now it's knives, lighters, sharpeners etc. 

Alright, so i'll try to explain my problem now. So, this ''THING'' can happen almost in all conditions, whether i am just sitting or lying in bed or doing something, basically it always starts with this feeling, i thing it's similar to panic attacks, but i don't know if that's it, it's like i am starting to drown in the worst thoughts possible, it's like a wave of bad thoughts that and all of my worst fears, and all of my worries that just suddenly appears in absolutely random time and it's only for like a minute long, That's why i don't think it's a panic attack, because i read that they are longer. I usually start breathing very fast and often so it can go away. Also helps to drink something very quick. And this ''wave'' isn't just random thoughts, i know these thoughts, like i was thinking about them at some point in the past, you know. It is really very hard to explain and i have this for a long time, like maybe from when i was twelve? My family isn't perfect, especially my crappy father and all of my childhood was fighting and screaming and stuff. I don't want to tell a whole story here, but i just need an explanation, is it a panic attack, or what the f is it i really don't understand.

Even abstract strengths (maybe you're skilled in drawing?) have a strong foundation of multiple attributes you can add to your pool of resources you're aware of. For me, I've found a lot of value in viewing my weaknesses as strengths, just wielding them incorrectly. An example: My inability to feel emotions seems -and is- a huge shortcoming. I lack dreams and ambitions, I don't ever feel happy, just content. However, there is a reason for that: I cut off my emotions to survive my childhood. And this behavior is a strength and weakness I've trained and perfected for 17 years now. I just wield this as a blunt instrument of force, rather than applying it when necessary. I still have to learn that. The strength in this is that while I can't fly high on emotions, I also can't fall very deep. I never hit rock- bottom.

An easier example, one which I don't struggle with, but is common enough: Worrying. The constant, endless worrying, without a break, over situations that you've played out a thousand times already in your mind. A friend said to me that she didn't want to worry anymore. However, worrying has a purpose and therefore some strengths, she just wields this tool incorrectly and has to learn how and when to use it appropriately. Worrying allows you to prepare for eventualities, to have a plan handy for situations that might otherwise surprise and overwhelm you. The constant, endless worrying however immobilizes and stuns you completely. Nonetheless, there IS an underlying strength. And you're especially good at it, you've perfected this behavior over years, albeit not in a useful way. AND you can change it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Therapy and change isn't about doing a 180, it's about balance.**

Say you're suffering from this constant worrying. ""I don't want to worry anymore"" is an approach that probably won't lead you anywhere useful. You are good at it, so why discard this tool? Therapy isn't about throwing this tool away, therapy is about learning to use this tool in a balanced way that helps you as a person. To change, most of the time, you don't want to stop one behavior or thought pattern and replace it with something new. You want to understand this behavior. What are the strengths and weaknesses there are to it? Why do you slip into it? What is it about, why does it exist? How would a healthy mind use this ability/ thought pattern? And with those answers will come the understanding that the ability itself is valuable, just wielded incorrectly. Therapy is about learning how to wield those abilities of yours, how to balance them. Perhaps you find some behavior is severely lacking or not developed at all, and doing so will balance out this one behavior of yours - the one you wanted to discard.

&amp;#x200B;

**Stop accepting responsibility that isn't yours, start accepting responsibility that is yours.**

I feel like this is one of the main issues holding a lot of people back. Whenever you interact in any way with someone, there are ALWAYS at least 2 responsibilities involved. You may be afraid to change something because it might not suit somebody else. Why do you take their responsibility? It is up to them to deal with their responsibility. They have to learn how to accept things, they have to learn how to deal with their own emotions, it is not something you can or should do for them.

Interactions with parents are a fitting topic. You can consider doing something that might or will hurt them. With you even considering it, you clearly have fulfilled your responsibility: You have thought about how your decision might or will influence and effect someone else. You have done your part already! Considering how actions might influence some morals or society norms is certainly important. And in doing so, you have accepted responsibility toward yourself/ society. Your counterpart has no right to demand or force you to act in a way that will suit them. How they deal with your decision is THEIR responsibility, as your responsibility is towards yourself and the moral code you hold. You acknowledge their feelings, you might even apologize for your decision and the feelings they must now be feeling, but that's all the responsibility you can take. Don't take any more. It isn't yours.

A more structured example would be a situation I had in my most recent hospital stay. The problem solving group was a group of 4-10 people plus a therapist. A group member could elaborate on a problem and the group could add a lot of different points of view to the situation, while the therapist chimed in from time to time and gave some good feedback to think about. It was my last session before being discharged and I wanted to bring in one more topic. A group member also had a topic. We decided to choose her topic. At the end, I foresaw that she wanted to apologize to me, as she had just taken my last chance to bring in a topic. At least that's how she saw it, because she kept pulling all the responsibility that wasn't hers to herself. The responsibility for the decision on who brings in his topic lies as follows:

I had the responsibility to decide if I wanted to give way or stay my ground. I decided that her topic was a lot more immediate and a lot more important. I had had 4 topics in my 6 weeks there, a lot more than any other patient. I didn't deem my topic very important, it was a minor question. Also, her topic needed answers as soon as possible. Naturally, I decided that I'd rather discuss her topic, especially since it was a topic I could also learn a lot from (as I haven't experienced this problem myself), maybe even more than from my own topic. The decision to let her have her topic over mine is my responsibility, not hers. I decided myself and took the responsibility that was mine myself, so why should she take it?

Every member of the group is part of the decision making process. After hearing my reasoning, they also decided to discuss her topic. Also their responsibility, not hers. The therapist is naturally also part of the decision making process. His responsibility, not hers.

So, we had 8 people in that room, and she tried to take sole responsibility for the decision. A lot of people do this, to certain degrees. I urge you to think about this very carefully and be ever vigilant of this issue if you struggle with it. Being aware of this pattern can accelerate your healing process immensely.

**Become more self reflected, question your rules and morals: Is the game of life even winnable if you live your life with your rules stacked against yourself?**

Every behavioral pattern is rooted deeply inside you, held in place by the rules you live by. They might not even be your rules, but the rules put inside your head by your parents or the social environment you grew up in. So much of your behavior is automatic and therefore difficult to analyze. The rules however lay the groundwork for the automation, and are therefore your prime focus when healing.

This process can involve a lot of emotional pain and is very mentally draining, so I highly encourage you to work through this with a therapist. While it may look easy at first glance, it can go extremely in- depth and you can spend multiple weeks of therapy sessions on working through your rules for only one single topic. That being said, here is what it should look like:

First begin with the rules you live by. You probably may not even like them, or even hate them, yet they're still deeply rooted within you. In my case, some rules can be summarized to:

""I have to function, regardless how high a prize I have to pay for it. Otherwise, I'll be punished.""

""It's irrelevant how I feel.""

""I don't need recognition or appreciation.""

""Love is always bound to conditions and thus must be earned.""

Now ask yourself: ""If life is a game, and these are the rules the game is played by... Is this game winnable? How do the rules have to look like to make that game winnable?""

A very important thing for a lot of people to learn is that it's okay to say no. Easier said than done. Now, let's have an example of how this rule might look like:

""I feel guilty, whenever: ""

* someone is disappointed
* I can't seem to please someone
* I destroy harmony (say hello, responsibility topic)
* someone suffers/ is hurt by my actions
* I do as I want
* I do the contrary of what is expected that I do

Those might be some rules people who can't say no live by. Doesn't look fair nor winnable, does it? Let's make some small changes to make this game fair then:

""I only feel guilty, when: ""

* I treat others unfairly
* I act without compromises
* I deal in absolutes
* I hurt someone knowingly and on purpose

Looks a lot better, huh? A lot more fair, especially towards yourself, while still complying with the general code of moral society has. If you go one step further and define some more rules that follow this conclusion, you might arrive at something close to this:

""I'm allowed to consider my own needs, to have a free will to decide.""

""I'm allowed to question something/ someone.""

""I recognize the feelings of someone and I may apologize for the feelings they now have, but I don't take any further responsibility.""

&amp;#x200B;

**Use sadness and hurt as a catalyst for change: The 2x2 table**

This is my tool of choice to break behavioral patterns. All the knowledge you have gathered about yourself, all the awareness of your patterns won't do you a lot of good if you don't use this ammunition. This method is intended to hurt you emotionally, I therefore highly recommend to work on this with a therapist. The principle is simple. There are two types of motivation: towards something and away from something. Sadly, towards something usually doesn't quite cut it with issues rooted this deeply. Therefore, away from something (in this case: emotional pain and a bleak future) is what this tool uses. The 4 panels are designed to contain following information regarding your behavioral patterns (you should do a table for every behavior you want to change):

* What do you gain by keeping this behavior (advantage x keep)
* What do you lose by keeping this behavior (disadvantage x keep)
* What do you gain by changing this behavior (advantage x change)
* What do you lose by changing this behavior (disadvantage x change)

While the panels \[advantage x keep\] and \[disadvantage x change\] are stronger (or else you'd have changed something by now), you won't break this habit/ behavior. The panel \[advantage x change\] contains the motivation towards something. Therefore, you want to mostly focus on the last panel: \[disadvantage x keep\]. Once those 2 panels (\[advantage x change\] and \[disadvantage x keep\]) are stronger than the other 2 panels, you've got what it needs to change.

Bear in mind, you want to exaggerate in the \[disadvantage x keep\] panel, as you also exaggerate in the \[advantage x keep\] and \[disadvantage x change\] panels by including potential gains and losses. You should ask yourself: What would happen to me if I live my life like this for another 5/10/20 years? How would I look back at my life when I'm on my deathbed and reflect on my life and all I'd see is this issue holding me back, that behavior I never changed. The pain you'll feel there while filling the \[disadvantage x keep\] panel with this question in mind will be the motivation you need to break the behavior. And you need the self reflection and mental vigilance you've gained (as per the previous 4 insights mentioned above) to constantly be aware of what's happening in your head and to recognize the trigger for that behavior being pulled, so you can step in and break the pattern. While I don't feel proud about going through therapy at such a young age, future me will thank me big time. I can't feel it now, but I'm pretty certain that in the future, I'll be extremely thankful that I've decided to go through everything while the scars are still relatively fresh.

As an example, I want to come back to the endless worrying. This loop without a break that keeps running... To break that loop, you don't need a distraction. You need the pain of knowing what this behavior will do to you if you continue with it for the rest of your life. And you need a great deal of patience and training. And someday, you will learn how to worry in a healthy way, how to use this tool you're just too good at for your own good in a more balanced way, perhaps reserving it for only the right and according situations, where a great deal of thought and planning is actually required.",27Jun2020,1

I have researched a couple things like emotional detachment, apathy, alexithymia, depersonalization, etc, but I have no clue what it is.

I’ll just list the signs that make my mom think I have autism (plus some things that I personally am adding on):

- I often become obsessed with a certain thing (usually video games, but also tv shows). It becomes something I am deeply intrigued in for months or weeks.

- I often restart sentences (I will get halfway through a sentence, stop, restart the sentence, get halfway, restart... a couple times).

- I take a lot of time to get my thoughts together in conversation, often leading to me freezing up for several minutes at a time.

- I often (or at least used to, I’ve actually managed to work on this quite a bit) talk far louder than the appropriate volume (basically shouting).

- I do repetitive behaviors (often in the form of tapping, but also in light clapping, sliding my hands together, moving my hand through my hair, and shaking/twitching my leg).

- I often laugh in inappropriate situations (I know in the moment that it is inappropriate, it’s more of uncomfortable/stress relief.

Well emotional and mental pain is inevitable and more often than not it’s going to come from someone or something is going to happen that’s going to cause you such agonising pain you have no control over. A relationship that’s ended that wasn’t you choice, a loved one getting a horrendous illness and suffering, a family member taken away from you in a violent attack or a pet you’ve had forever dying in your arms through sickness or old age. All of which and many more things may rock you to your core and none of which you have any control over. The one thing you do have control over is how you decide to feel about that bad thing that has happened to you.

You have control over the way it makes you feel and no one and nothing can take that control away from you. It’s called responsibility. Response | Ability. It is the ability to choose how you respond to a bad situation or bad thing that’s happening or happened. It is the single most powerful ability each and every human possesses because nothing can stop it. The ability to choose your response gives you control again and thus help you mentally process the pain it has caused you. Remember pain is coming whether you like it or not so having the power to control how you feel and respond to that pain is your secret weapon.

Values - so many of us don’t realise that what we value can be destructive to our mental health and we sit and wonder why we’re feeling so low. Here’s some examples... if you value what others think of you that’s a bad value. If you value being accepted socially into a group of people that’s a bad value. If you value popularity that’s also a bad value. All of these values have a similar patten... you have no control over these things. So pick values you can control. Here’s some examples... being kind to others, being honest to others and being truthful. The most interesting thing about good and bad values is that bad values are easy so we scoff them up like raiding the box of celebrations when we know we’ve probably had enough. Good values are hard they take work and constant reminding to yourself that they are good and right things to do so we avoid them for an easy life. The problem is bad values that are uncontrollable inevitably make us miserable it’s the paradox of a better life bad is easy good is hard.

Means and ends - Ask yourself if you have ever dated someone or been friends with someone because what they offer you makes you feel good, I know I have. The problem with living like this is it’s destructive to your mental health. When you are friends with someone or in a relationship you need to ask yourself what are the means to me wanting to date this person or be friends with them. Do they make the good values you have already adopted even better? Do they make the bad values you have become less and less. A key thing to remember with an relationship be it romantic, friendly or family is that the means of that relationship should never be for some other end. An example of using someone to some other end is like this. That guy or girl is really popular and hot, if I date her or him my popularity is going to go through the roof and that’s going to make me feel great! - TERRIBLE-value in action here and you’d be surprised how often people do this and don’t even realise. You are using someone to fulfil your bad values, your means are to use them and your end goal is to feel good about yourself and increase your social standing. This will end up making you feel empty inside.

Hope - Ever wondered why celebrities have killed themselves when they have loads of money, fame and success? Not always but a lot of the time it’s because they’ve hoped for the wrong things and when the pain that’s inevitable arrives, which it will, it destroys everything they have hoped for because they have hoped for the wrong things. 
Take the show Love Island more than a few contestants and one host of the show have killed them selves after being on it, why? They hoped for the wrong things. Popularity, money, success and acceptance all things many of the participants and the host of the show all hoped for in life most probably well before they entered the show. Deeply engrained in their chosen values all of which they have no control over. 
When those things got taken away through a media story or they become the latest fad to fade out and no one cares about them anymore they become hopeless and it is hopelessness that killed them in the end. 

If you hope for things you have no control over and then one day you suddenly lose everything you had no control over hopelessness comes over you like a dark cloud and it can take you to the darkest place of your mind. So dark that you feel there’s nothing left to hope for because all they have hoped for years and years has suddenly vanished and so you go down the there’s no point in living anymore path and that’s a maze you don’t want to try and find your way out of.

Hope for things you have control over. Hope for a pain you can sustain, a pain you can embrace and a pain you know you can choose to feel okay about. Hope for rejection so that you can learn from it, hope for failure so you can find a way to succeed the next time and hope to be wrong, wrong about everything so that when you figure something out your a little less wrong the next time. Hope only for things you have control over.

Choosing to live your life in this way is sustaining the pain you have chosen and by doing it and accepting it you’ll find yourself feeling happier knowing your a little bit of a better person for doing it.",27Jun2020,0

171,"I work as a laboratory technician at a small hospital in Texas. On my shift we have a processor (someone who logs in and shorts incoming samples) who I'm worried is having a sharp decline in their mental health. 

She already has a reputation for having intense mood swings and becoming so upset she has to leave work early, with no clear cause. She also seems to have some issues with anxiety and is a bit neurotic (a lot of lab workers are, me included) but overall she's very kind and personable to be around most of the time.

However, lately I've become more concerned about her behavior. The other night she came up to me and a coworker and accused us of playing beeping sounds (like from a timer or bar code scanner) when a tube comes down to the lab. So, when a tube comes down a little jingle plays from the tube station until you stop it. Meaning you can hear how long it takes for someone to get up to retrieve it, she isn't always able to get it right away, but its not solely her responsibility and shes never had a problem getting her work done on time.

She was convinced we were playing these beeping sounds to signal to each other that we were upset with how long it took for her to get the samples from the station. (At least that's what I gather, it was difficult to piece together exactly what she was saying) She was on the verge of tears as she talked, so I have no doubt that she truly believed what she was saying.

We both assured her that neither of us were intentional making any sounds and were both perfectly happy with her work. We also pointed out that in the lab sounds are almost constantly coming from one machine or another and she seemed to be fine for awhile. But, throughout the rest of the shift she kept asking me if I heard the beeping (I didn't) and if I was mad at her about how she did her job (I wasn't). I talked to a different coworker about found out that the same thing happened to her a few nights before. 

I don't want to make assumptions about another persons mental health, but I'm genuinely worried about her. Its a very stressful time to work at a hospital in Texas right now (you may have heard) and I'm scared it may worsen her mental state even further. I want to her to get help, but I don't know where to begin to approach the situation and could use some advice.

I used to love being by myself, i had no trouble with it at all. But ever since i started college (4 years ago) i slowly started feeling lonely when i was by myself.

I don't get it. How did i go from literally LOVING being by myself to not even being able to be alone for a couple of hours? I am starting to experience of loneliness more and more. it's not that i don't have any friends besides the people of my dorm, but we don't hang out a lot because they live quite far away. 

When I used to love being by myself, i'd read books, watch tv, redecorate my room, paint,... so i thought that maybe starting doing these things by myself again, would help me love being alone again but it doensn't.

I have been suffering severely with insomnia (for the last 3 months intensely, but also since I started my career set the hospital ten years so thanks to shift work) and had a left over script of Xanax I never used. Last Saturday I was up 28 hours and desperate so I took 0.5mg to crash. While I know work started my unhealthy relationship with sleep, my OCD has recently fixated on having sporadic fatal insomnia (a prion disease where you stay awake until you die) so that’s elevated things. The Xanax worked and ever since last Saturday (06/27), I’ve taken 0.5mg around 10:30 at night and get around 5.8-7 hours of sleep (compared to my normal of 3-5 hours). I have been doing CBT-I for the insomnia and part of that is getting in a strict routine. I’ve had success with this but only if I take the 0.5mg Xanax. I tried 0.25mg one night with no luck. Well the last three days I’ve slept decent but my memory is shot and I’m groggy as hell the next day. I pride myself on having the memory of an elephant. I’m normally very sharp and quick witted. Now I’m forgetting what I say mid sentence, forgot my phone number the other day, and have a hard time completing tasks. I’ve always had great deep sleep (around 40% compared to the standard 20-25%). This hasn’t changed since the Xanax, but now I’m freaking out I did permanently damage to my brain. 

I plan on getting OFF of this ASAP. I plan on doing 0.25mg tonight and tomorrow night then nothing; I am also considering possibly not using it at all and going cold turkey since it’s only been a week. 

I’m looking for any advice or similar stories of people who have gone through the same thing and can offer some hope. I’m also curious of anyone has advice on any natural substances to help support cognitive function. I am scared and am hoping I can still keep my insomnia under control.

198,"Hello guys. I'm a 16F, and I've lost my virginity to a random guy...off craigslist. We never met before the act, so I know I'm quite lucky to not have been put in any real danger (seeing as how people get raped, drugged, killed, sold into sex trade, etc). By the way, the guy is more than 2x my age. 

So, again, we met off Craigslist. We exchanged 1 photo each and our tele numbers. About 4 days went by, and we met up at his place. To be fair, the guy was chill and he had a cool place. Quite quickly, I felt comfortable. He made a drink. I think it was fruit punch mixed with vodka. I downed about 3 1/2 glasses of that. We smoked weed. He took 1 hit. I took about 5, cause im a complete idiot. And on top of that, we had edibles. Needless to say, I was quite fucked (pun not intended, but I guess it works). 

Then we had sex. He didn't realize it was my first time, thank God. I did some homework, so I seemed like I was a little experienced. He was a massive guy. Used XL condoms in rounds 1-3 (he had a high sex drive). If I'm honest, I think I enjoyed myself. Again, I don't remember too much, because I was not in a clear state.

Round four came (another unintended pun) and apparently I told him to not use a condom. I know this because the next day he text me and says I forgot to take Plan B. I was so gutted reading that text. I went to walmart to get the pill, which cost $50 for no fucking reason. I took it, and im hoping i don't conceive.

203,"I have sort of a problem, I don't know if it's a mental illness, and I'll let you guys tell me that. I push away people who try to help me. I just outright go in panic mode when I am not able to return the favour. I am not able to handle owing someone. I believe this is the reason I have difficulty making new friends and deepen a relationship. I noticed that I do most of my work/chores myself and I get unconsciously very uneasy when someone else does it for me. Anyone who ""cares"" for me gets a negative feedback from me for it. Even if some task requires more than 1 person to be executed, I try to do it alone and basically punish myself. This issue has crept up in my professional life where I being a back-end dev tries to do front end and HTML/CSS also. I have somehow accepted that I am not going to be cared for ever in my life and I believe that it is going to be a problem later in life (I'm 24, unmarried and single as of now, so it's not much of an issue). I want to change and become better, but all my attempts fail and I can't get myself to let some help myself.

Background which I think is responsible for this behaviour :

My parents never cared for me much. Now when I can ""cared"" I mean something like ""pampered"" rather than ""loved"". It's confusing, I'll explain. 

My parents loved me all right, I might even say that they loved a lot and still do. They took care of all basic necessities like food and clothing, maybe get me a toy once in a while, but nothing more. They never actually took any interest in my life. They cared about my academics only once a year, and weren't concerned about how I did at school, about sports, about my hobbies etc at all. I didn't watch a movie in a cinema hall until I completed high school. We rarely ate out, and when we did, me and my sister used to think of that day like a festival. Now we weren't poor, but I think that they did this just because they were preoccupied with dealing with their own relationship. They used to fight a lot and confide in me and my sister, and I think that was always on their mind, and not any stuff about me.

Hence, from a very young age, I started taking many of my decisions myself, for which my friends usually consulted their parents. That idea was very weird to me at that time. I defaulted to ""No"" for any optional extra curricular activities at school, for any school trips I was asked to go on and for any clubs I was asked to join, even without asking my parents because deep down I believed they won't care and probably want me or allow me to do it. I never asked my parents for stuff my friends considered common like a gameboy or any console for that matter. When I was 10 I asked my grandfather for a bicycle, and he gifted me one. I bought a PC for whole family to use with all the money I had saved since childhood at the age of 13. And when I was 15, I used money I won from a quiz contest to buy myself a smartphone.

My parents paid for my college, but I returned that as soon as I got a job, by transferring a loan from my dad's name to mine.",27Jun2020,2

but I'm very scared. i don't have any friends, so i don't have to worry that anyone will feel bad. i'm just worried for my mother, and is the only reason i'm alive.

sometimes, i go to the terrace and stare down for long, trying to find that small courage to jump and end it all. but i'm scared how it might impact my mom's life later. 

and before you ask, my problem is in my relationship. i know, it's very small and the solution is to just breakup. but i can't. trust me, i've tried a lot. but i can't she uses self victim card, and is very manipulative and i always lose to that.

as i said, i really have no friends with whom i can openly talk about my problems. and reddit is the only place i put it all. whoever has read my posts, knows more about me than anyone else. so, i just wanted to say thank you if you have made it till here. take care and stay safe!",27Jun2020,3

Hello everyone! I don't know where to start, or if it's a right subreddit for this, but I'll give it a shot. Iam currently 15 yo, when I was around age 13 I discovered some sort of ability/placebo involving my memories. I can ""forget"" or ""blur out"" my memories anytime, I didn't tell anyone yet, but im planning to. The thing is, it isn't just magically forgetting something, it's more of a ""looking through fog"". Over some time I learned something about this, I can forget certain things, but I can't forget things I see on daily basis, for example my parents. It's not complicated, I just need to concentrate and imagine the memory being torn apart, then slowly fading, and that's it. I have no idea what caused it and I have no issue with having it, but Iam concerned that this will eventually get out of control and I could forget various things.",27Jun2020,1
206,"I was drunk out of my mind after my psychotherapy session. I had hit rock bottom. I felt like nothing was helping.  I knew I was losing myself. I've had voices in my head since high school where they come and go.
I slammed my computer without saying goodbye to my psychiatrist.  I wasn't okay. When was I ever,  right? My stupid head can't contribute or think of words to express how I feel during these meetings.  Only on paper can I do that. 
I had my first mental (something) where I had a mix of voices,  new ones,  old ones all talking at once. All telling me to either do it or not do it. I was going through so many emotions in 5 minutes. I thought I was going to have to call 911. I crawled over to my spot where I had these setup and everything. Ready to go. 
The oldest voice was dominant. Managed to take hold of me. Convinced me not to. So i crawled onto my bed.

I hate that I can’t get over being used and thrown away by my father grandmother aunt and every “friend” I’ve had. I hate how I can’t trust that my girlfriend actually does love me that every time she’s too busy to talk to me I immediately go into the mindset that she’s done with me and is throwing me away as well. That I feel my mother doesn’t want me around unless I can do things for her. My mind is fucked beyond reasoning at this point and I don’t see much point in going on because I’m afraid I’ll hurt the only two people I have left in my life if I keep going that ending things now will make things worse in the short term but long term everyone will be better off. The saying mom will be sad doesn’t really matter anymore it hurts too much to go through this marathon of anxiety and depression day after day.

208,"Hello all,

I am trying to apply to MSW programs for Fall 2021 but covid threw a wrench in my plans as I’m sure you are all feeling like.

I would love to find a way to remotely provide support for people but am not sure how. Before all this started I was about to start the training for a suicide hotline but with covid it became unsafe to do so. I heard about becoming a listener on 7 cups of tea but heard some pretty awful things and I’d rather not support an organization that does not properly train and filter their listeners. I’ve also heard about blah therapy..

Anyways I would love to hear any stories or suggestions you may have of online resources that may have helped you or that you can suggest I can join to offer people support during this very difficult time.

Thanks and have a great day:)",27Jun2020,1
209,"I'm 19, in my sophomore year of college and I'm wanting to change my major but I don't even want to do anything. I have extensive job experience in cooking and catering and that's it. I don't know what makes me happy and I just wasted a year studying something I hate because i thought it sounded fun. My dad laughed at me when he realized I don't know what I want to do and my mom got mad when I told her I didn't feel like doing anything. I'm going to, i of course have to work, but I don't know what i would like and i hate the idea of working 5 days a week for the majority of my life. There's so much outside of work i want to do and find much more important, traveling, eventually having a family, hobbies, art. I don't have a car or my license, my parents didn't allow me to and suddenly I was 18 and they were upset with me for not having my license. I can't work right now because of the virus, my grandparents have an old car they want to give me but I feel like they don't like the person I am and that they're going to have a lot of rules along with it (reasonably) that i wouldn't have to follow if I could just buy my own. I sometimes wish i were like the majority of the kids i went to high school with and that my parents had the money to buy me a car, i know it's so much more rewarding to but your own but my life would be a lot easier if i already had one. I'm engaged to someone i love but i can't even tell my family because I'm scared they're going to say I'm too young. I really understand why they feel i am, they've said I'm too young in conversations before, but I'm not stupid and i know that this is one of the only things in life I'm sure of. I love him and he's enlisting and leaving, I hate what he's doing and I'm so scared he's going to get hurt. He's the only person I really open myself up to and he's going to be gone soon. I can't see my only close friend because of her working and the virus, i only really talk to her once a week. I miss people so much. I'm having to go back to college in less than 2 months, I'm scared that I'm just going to feel really alone the whole time. I really just want to live with my fiance and marry him. He's saying i don't want to get married now too because i got really scared the other day about what would happen if my parents found out, i really want to but he's scared too that i don't. Marriage is huge and I don't want my family to dislike me because I'm planning on it soon and that I am younger. I feel like a bad person. I don't want to be in the state I'm in but I'm not going to be able to leave until my fiance's contract is over in 4 years. I know people tend to have more control over their lives than they think but there's really nothing i can do. I've tried so hard being happy in the situation I'm in and i can't. I wish i could see my old therapist here but I'd have to ask my parents to take me, I haven't been fully open with them about how bad i feel in 9 years and it really didn't go how i wanted to, i don't want to again. I don't know what to do. I know there are people so much worse off than me and i feel so selfish for being as unhappy as I am.",27Jun2020,2

TL;DR: I (15F) was feeling bad before quarantine and now I’m a hundred times worse. My anxiety has never been this bad and now I feel depressed. I’m scared to go to a therapist. I want relief but I don’t know what to do

__

I’ve (15F) felt so badly during these last couple of months (quarantine), but it keeps getting worse and worse. I didn’t feel well before anyways. I’ve always dealt with anxiety, but now it’s out of control. I’ve also been feeling really down and empty lately. I’ve just been sitting in my room, rarely moving from the spot, waiting for the day to be over. I’m just on my phone mindlessly scrolling through social media or watching videos or typing out my issues but then doing nothing about them. Getting up and doing anything takes so much energy. I feel so lazy but I just want to be active. I want to do stuff but I feel like I can’t. I want to be productive but I feel like I’m just wasting space in this world. I’ve never been super active but I’m not normally this bad. Never thought I’d want to exercise so badly but here I am. I don’t know what to do

There are a billion things that are bothering me but I can’t bring myself to talk about most of them to anyone. The times I do talk about them, I feel better for a bit but then they come back. If they don’t come back, they get replaced by another worry. I’ve always been like this but it normally doesn’t take over my mind, it’s normally in the back.

I went to the doctor's office yesterday for a yearly checkup and they gave me a depression test to take. They do this with everyone my age. When the nurse left the room I broke down crying. This is exactly what I was afraid of. My doctor came in and saw me crying and she said that everyone is like this right now and that I’m not alone. I understand that but how do I help this? I can’t imagine being like this forever. She told me that my main issue is probably that I haven’t seen my friends in a while. She told me to get them together to do something. We’ve already been trying to do that but it never goes anywhere. Also, for the last couple of summers, I haven’t hung out with friends. I hated those summers so much and thought this would finally be different but NOPE. The difference between them and now is, back then, I still had stuff to look forward to. My family would do a couple of things during the summer (including a vacation). We weren’t super busy but busy enough to distract myself from the fact that I was all alone. I couldn’t muster up the strength to tell her it’s more than just not seeing my friends and it’s lasted longer than just quarantine 

I have a hard time texting friends, even though I know that would probably help me a little. I can’t push myself to text my friend group to find a date to hangout. I’m just crossing my fingers that one of them texts some time. I’ve tried to play guitar but, with these last couple days, I’ve lost all skill I had with the instrument. My list of stuff to do has sat in the corner collecting dust. My brain has been reduced to fuzz. I can’t focus anymore. I can barely write all of this. I want to do stuff so badly but I can’t. I’ve related this a billion times but I don’t know what else to say

It’s nearly July. I haven’t had anything remotely normal since March 23rd— the day I got out of school for eLearning. I want to have some fun in my summer but I only have a month left. I’ve never wanted to go to school so badly, but I’m also scared to. I just want a normal summer, but I know that’s not going to happen. At the same time, I’m scared of doing everything I once did. Coronavirus is a truly serious issue. If people were respectful I would be comfortable with going to the mall with my friends and maybe even going on vacation, but, from where I live, no one ever wears a mask or cares about the 6 feet rule. If they see you with a mask they will cough on you— not even joking. Numbers have been increasing and I’m afraid that this is going to last even longer than expected. I’m not trying to sound selfish but I am being selfish right now. I want something to look forward to. I’m at the point where I look forwards to leaving the house to go to the mailbox 5 minutes away. I never thought I’d say this, but the highlights of my week are leaving my room to help organize the house. It’s pathetic and I hate it

I’m also worried because my summers are limited anymore. I just finished my freshman year of high school. I have 2-3 summers left. Is it embarrassing to go on vacation with family at 16? I just remember my best summers. Even the summers I didn’t like I miss. Is there any way for me to feel like I’m actually having a summer? 

I’m scared to go to a therapist. The idea of sitting in front of someone and telling them about my problems terrifies me. I can’t even do that in front of close friends or family. I think I would end up feeling worse after I would talk. I mean, look at me now, I’ve felt ten times worse now that I broke down in front of my doctor. Online/Texting therapy doesn’t sound as scary but I’m still really terrified to make the first step. I was really close to signing up about a month ago but then I started getting better. I’ve fallen back into the hole now

I don’t know what to do. Reading this back I sound like an annoying teen girl complaint about something pointless but I don’t know. I want to feel normal again (well, as normal as I normally am), but I don’t see that happening in a long, long time.",27Jun2020,3
211,"my sibling's father (not mine) has been verbally abusing me and my mom for the past 8 years. my two siblings have also been verbally abused but not as much (they still saw him be a complete scumbag to me and my mom). Ivew been holding everything back for 8 years and i'm at my limit. i can't see my mom go through this and i can't let my siblings get traumatized even further.  i sleep with a knife near me in case he ever dares to hurt my mom. he has hurt her physically before but i found out 5 years later. i try so hard to not literally murder someone but everyday he just nakes me angrier and angrier. i've talked my mom about leaving and that i could plan everything out but she's so forgiving and idk if it's because she's scared of him. i feel so bad for her and my brothers. at this point i'll only feel happy and relieved if he killed himself or someone killed him. not even moving to a different country with my mom and siblings will make me feel better. the day i see him dead will be the day i'll be genuinely happy. i've been trying everything to keep my mind off the intrusive thoughts but it's so difficult i can't handle it. i need to go to sleep blasting music or i simply won't be able to sleep. this year has already been bad enough and the situation my mom, my siblings and me are in just makes it even worse. the only good thing is that i haven't considered offing myself. i just can't abandon my mom and siblings like that i'd be a bigger piece of shit of a human if i were to do that. it's so fucking hard to go a day without feeling overwhelming anxiety. i just want to timeskip to next year and pray to god that it's a better year",27Jun2020,3
212,"Ever since since the pandemic had really started to go up I've been stuck at home. I'm not allowed to go outside nor see any of my friends in the next 2 months. I haven't been able to properly outside since March. This entire situation has completely wrecked my mental state. This past month I've been feeling the worst I've ever felt. 

I feel bad because I skipped a bunch of online classes and it felt like I was letting my teachers down. Truth is I couldn't find the motivation to do it, I couldn't get out of bed and walk over to my desk and do some work. I felt worthless, I couldn't even be productive and do some work my teachers gave me. It wasn't even a lot, I just couldn't do it.

I love socialising with people, I thrive when I'm surrounded by friends because those are the only times I feel happy and a part of something. All of that has been taken away from me. I understand the importance of keeping every one safe but I just want to be able to at least go out to see one friend. My parents won't allow me to go outside or even out of the apartment. My little sister is great but sometimes she can't do things I can or we both don't want to do things the other wants to. I just want to stop feeling so lonely anymore.

214,"I don't know what I am doing here, but I needed something, anything. I feel stuck within these four walls and the state of my mind.

In 2018 my mother was arrested for attempted manslaughter and kidnapping, it's like a key unlocked every door to all the source of my problems that started when I was very young. I've always been depressed, in many ways. Even before my diagnosis. I would go silent for days as little kid because I felt depressed, unable to speak or feel; or feeling too much. I realised my mother's constant absence and pathological lying caused me to delve deep into my bad mental state. I never had someone, no one. And despite her being gone for years at a time, she had a saviour complex, as if she was the one who caused me to always somehow raise back to my feet, when it was her who put me there in the first place.   
I wish I could hate her. For all her lies. For all the news articles that will follow my name for the rest of my life, for all the shame. I wish I could spit in your face, but you praised yourself as a mother, and thus, manipulated me into doing just the same.

I am working through some old trauma (prior to the divorce) with my current therapist and was wondering if it was considered acceptable to see if she could disclose her records. I‘m realizing I was exhibiting so many serious red flags and I feel like nothing was done about it beyond sending me to a therapist, basically as a check box to wipe their hands clean and say “see, we did everything we could” this was two decades ago, so I don’t even know if those records still exist, but I’m really curious to know if those red flags were observed, noted and if anything was done behind to scenes that I either wasn’t aware of or didn’t know about.",27Jun2020,1
216,"I've accomplished things in my life that a lot of people don't, but I have never felt proud, excited, or happy about them. Every time I do something that I know I should be proud of, I feel like it could have gone better or I could have done more.

I started a business and made decent money, only felt stress and anxiety. Seven years later, I'm selling it because I don't want to deal with it anymore. It never brought me joy or happiness. But, now what? Find something else that seems difficult to prove that I can do it, only to resent it later?

I keep trying things and doing well, but I never find what I'm after. No pride, happiness, or joy. No amount of professional ""success"" does anything to change my mindset. Now, it just feels like I'm incapable of feeling those things. Even things that I should find fun, like hanging out with friends or playing video games, just seem like chores.

226,"Disclaimer that I am not medically diagnosed with anything nor am I a professional with regards to mental health (other than a few workshops from a psychiatrist). I'm not sure if this will be helpful to anyone other than me, but I do wish that none of you suffer from things like suicidal thoughts or giving up on this world. I was in a pretty bad place in 2017/2018/2019 which I've learned now wasn't my fault, but the environment I couldn't escape from. I did not want to kill myself but I wanted to leave to another world, the world I wrote in my head. As a way to express myself when no one would listen, I got into story writing on wattpad (yeah I know the website doesn't have an entirely great reputation), it was nice seeing the traction my story got, but it wasn't really correcting what my life was like nor did it mean because my protagonist was on cloud 9, so was I. It helped a bit though. Following this, I started keeping a diary in which I'd write how my day went, if I felt like crying one day I'd mark the page with an umbrella and if I had a great day I'd mark it with a sun and tally it at the end, to see how my month went and see patterns in why I may have been feeling as I did. I also joined several wellbeing discord communities to be able to seek advice, but sometimes people can be judgemental so I'm not sure if I can entirely vouch for it. I desperately wanted to escape from where I was but the biggest change happened when I started keeping what I called a 'dream journal'. I started writing everything I wanted in it but wrote it as if I already had it, and believed it too. It felt things weren't getting better and I forgot about it, but now in 2020 I read the journal and everything I asked for I have. Good friends, appreciation from my teachers, good grades, a family I can talk to, moving homes... To name a few.

I searched what this was and supposedly it is a manifestation technique, maybe a bit unorthodox to some. Once again I'm not a licensed professional and maybe this won't be able to cater to your situation, but I hope it helps even a tiny bit.",27Jun2020,4

First time poster in this subreddit 
(FYI I know I am talking to a therapist I just want a third party pov perspective/opinion)

I’ve gone through a lot recently (two deaths in two weeks, work stress, breakup) and today I woke up with 4h sleep, and I couldn’t sit still. I was so energetic and I was paranoid. I felt very de attached from reality and often found myself confused as to where I am and what I was doing there. 
I started thinking about paranoid thoughts (friends talking about me when they weren’t, the person behind me walking close to me trying to stab me). And I even blacked out? A bit of the time I was in that state. I felt out of body and I felt numb.

I’ve never felt this way before even in anxiety and depression and I’m not sure what it is.

238,"Not too long ago I made a post talking about trauma and I was thinking if I could have it and someone in the comments pointed out to me that yes, I possibly have trauma, but I still don't know about it.. I'm thinking if something traumatic would happen it would be a very clear memory, I feel like I'd remember something, but honestly I remember barely anything about my childhood, the few things I remember are either from what other people told me, or just other random stuff..
I also feel like me being depressed or anxious is fake, because a couple days I'll be EXTREMELY energetic and happy the other days I'll be just numb, not really caring about anything nor feeling anything. I CONSTANTLY put up an act that I'm happy, that it becomes hard to distinguish if I'm actually happy or not and if I'm faking everything or not. I don't know if I even feel bad emotions anymore and if I'm just sub-consiously bottling anything that's negative. I rarely understand what I'm feeling. I feel like I fake all this and I deserve to suffer, all I want to do is put a blade to my arm and cut, I want to see blood gushing out my arm, I want to feel pain, but I never manage to go through with it, the closest I've gotten is making a shallow cut on my ankle and I barely felt anything, but other than that I'm not brave enough to do it. I also feel fake, because I don't really seek for help, I guess I just go with the flow, and whatever life throws at me I just take it. I've considered ending everything so this whole loop of ""Feel happy - feel sad - feel guilty for being sad - thinking I'm faking everything - feeling happy"" loop would end, but at the same time, I don't even really know if I'm sad or forcing myself to be sad. I have no idea if I have low self esteem or am egotistical, I have no idea what I like or dislike, I have no idea who I am as a person in general. I feel like life isn't worth it, we as humans will go extinct at some point and all the progress we've made as a species will go to waste and even if we DON'T go extinct, I'm still just one meaningless person who'll never accomplish/do anything with their life. I just need help figuring out what I'm feeling.. I haven't gone to therapy or talked to a counselor, because I don't have access to them and I feel like I'd be taking up their time when they could be talking to someone who actually needs help. I feel like if I talk to people about what I'm feeling I would ruin their mood, so I continued bottling feelings for years, and now I don't even KNOW what I feel.. I have no idea what I can do to have any clue as to what's going on with me, but if someone could help me, it'd be extremely nice of you..",27Jun2020,2
