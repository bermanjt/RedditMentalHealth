0,"Okay, so here’s an example of what I’m talking about. I’ve struggled with what I’d describe as depression and thoughts about suicide. In one odd state of mind, I once wrote a “hypothetical suicide note.” I have another memory from around that time of lying, curled up on the floor of my shower, crying “I don’t want to do this anymore.” However, I’ve never once tried to take my own life.

I know people who have attempted suicided or who have come very close to doing so. Now, here’s where the mind fuckery comes in. When these stories come up, it makes me feel like I’m unjustified in feeling the way I do; like I shouldn’t be allowing myself to feel so bad about my own struggles, because I’m my mind I think “well, if I haven’t tried to kill myself, my problems can’t be as bad as theirs.” And that’s how the guilt kicks in, which of course makes me feel worse, which makes me feel guilty... You get the idea.

Anyone else experience feelings like this?",29Jul2020,1
1,"First and foremost, I know it's best to go see a professional. With the state of the world and my own worries about seeing a professional, I was hoping for maybe some peer to peer insight.

I've always kind of been middle of the pack when it comes to popularity. Not popular, not unpopular. Just aloof. I was never really picked on or bullied, and I didn't bother anyone else either. I was happy ""just existing."" As an adult, I find that I don't really have a solid friend group. I'll hang out with one group for a bit, then just ghost and hang out with another. There's no trigger that causes this. It just naturally happens. And I'll come back around eventually. I considered, and still do, myself to be introverted. But is there something else underlying?

In my interactions with other people I find I'm either cold or overshare. It's caused me issues because I've been short and dismissive when I genuinely didn't mean to. 

I find that if I don't have a ""purpose"" some sort of project to throw myself into, I become extremely restless, even depressed.

When I do have a project. I exceed at it with inhuman discipline. Every waking moment is dedicated to that thing and I genuinely feel like I excel at that ONE thing.

For example: When I was writing a novelette taking place in a Greco-Roman setting. I'd fully-immerse myself in concepts revolving around the setting. I'd watch Rome, Troy, 300 etc. I'd play God of War. I'd listen to period music. I was visiting Greek restaurants several times a week.

Same situation with the story I'm writing now, except it revolves around Feudal Japan. 

Everyone who's read my writing generally has good things to say about it. The world building. The character interactions. The plot and subplots. They ask the questions I want them to ask, etc.

It seems I have two speeds. Nothing or GO!

And it doesn't even apply to just my writing. After my divorce, I dropped 70lbs in 4 months. Fitness was all I could do. I didn't starve myself, I was eating three times a day and if I got hungry outside of meals, I ate an apple. I just ran. And when I was tired of running. I lifted. And when I was tired of lifting, I did calisthenics. 

I guess what I'm trying to say in this word-vomit is that... I pick something. I excel at it. But my mind focuses on that one thing to the point of where I don't accomplish anything else.

My emotions are weird. I feel like I experience things differently. I don't display a noticeable/normal reaction to them. I'm really bad at faking them too. This makes me feel like I'm horrible with kids because I don't know how to interact with them. And, luckily, I learned to just not respond with what I consider reason/logic to other things people are emotional about at a younger age.

There are things that sort of set me off. I don't show it. But little things stress me out, bad. I'm restless until I'm no longer exposed to it. When my wife (who works at home) is frustrated with work and complaining, I feel her frustration with it too (the situation, not her). Really, it's like that with everyone. If they're agitated, I feel it too. I just don't know how to express it. I don't know what to say to make things better. It's like someone up gave my windows a critical error... I just bluescreen, lol. 

Then there's things like loud noises and dim light (I want it either pitch black or blinding. As ridiculous as it sounds. They just frustrate me to all hell.

Hoping some of you can give me some sort of push in the right direction, other than ""to a professional"" for now. I'd like to think I'm just not a piece of shit. That maybe I have something I can work with.

Thanks for your time.",29Jul2020,1
2,"After months of tests for my health, I have been referred to a psychiatrist. I know mentally there is something wrong. But in my head I keep playing it over in my head.
""What brings you in to see me?""
""I don't know.""
How do you tell someone there's something wrong with you when you don't know what's wrong with you? I keep thinking I'm overreacting. It's normal for adults to go through these things. But another part of me is urging myself to get mental help because I feel all kinds of fucked up. I guess that in itself is my problem.",29Jul2020,1
3,"I dont know if this is the correct place to ask this question so please remove it if its not..

A work at a liquor store, its not difficult and I can hold my own against rude customers, no issue. But last week a fight broke out on the store, a lot of yelling and threats but no hitting, eventually it moved to the parking lot, still no actual physical hitting but I couldn't break it up. (I didn't get in the middle, just let them know I'd call police if it escalated)

Eventually I just went inside but I was shaking and it got to the point that I had a panic attack in the stock room. I was crying and I felt like I couldn't breath, I had to close alone so I did what I could to suck it up until I got to my car.

I cried and felt like I was hyperventilating he next few hours.. 

I dont have any history of violence or abuse. I cant figure out where my reaction came from and I don't have access to a therapist atm.. 

I'm closing the store alone again tonight and I feel like I'm going to cry.. i don't know what to do.",29Jul2020,1
4,"This isn't the first time she's had such an episode; she went through something like this when she found my cousin dead in his bedroom (overdosed on Fentanyl), and another seemingly innocuous time when she hit her chin, working in her gazebo.

When the dog was having a stroke, my mom sent a text to me and my brothers, and called the vet to have them take a look. When one of my brothers arrived to the house, she apparently had already forgotten having texted us and having called the vet, and kept asking what was wrong with the dog. When the vet finally arrived, put the dog down, and took her away, my mom apparently couldn't process what was happening (even though she was the one who let us know of the situation to begin with), and one of my other brothers gave her what appeared to be Lorazepam (albeit expired pills), to attempt to bring her back to normal. She also appeared better after she ate later in the day, having apparently skipped breakfast.


Having done some Googling, this either appears to be Transient Global Amnesia, or Psychogenic Amnesia; having a TGA episode described as lasting between 2-8 hours is especially telling.


This is a very scary prospect for my brothers and I, as none of us know how she is going to react when another event like this happens, or if a more immediate member of the family passes away. We are planning to encourage her to see a family doctor, and see if she needs to see a psychiatrist as well. While the descriptions of both mental conditions I've listed above don't seem to imply any physiological reasoning for her episode, I had suggested that she go through an MRI as well. 

Has anyone here experienced a similar situation? Any insight would be greatly appreciated.",29Jul2020,1

7,"I'm seriously at a loss of what to do with myself anymore, I take care of myself, I have proper hygiene, I accomplish all my daily tasks, I help around the house, I go to work everyday and get the job done. 

Yet every night, I lay awake staring at my ceiling worrying for hours over little insignificant odds and ends. All my free time is spent over thinking and doubting myself. I constantly nitpick at small details that I think could he a red flag in my current relationship despite it being that whenever I spend time with my significant other I'm reassured and all my worries fade. 

Everyday, my heart beats a million miles an hour during my free time and I am constantly nervous/anxious. I lose motivation in my interests, I spend my whole free time bored and worried, trying to play video games or reading books or walking my dog but I quickly become unmotivated and uninterested. I never wake up well rested and my whole family thinks I'm an asshole who doesn't care about anything and who spends his time rotting his soul in his room watching YouTube. 

I'm tired of being like this, I wish I was normal, I wish I could break free from this vicious cycle of self-loathing and hate. I've been like this for years and I fear that I'll always be like this. I'm terrified of talking to people I know about these things because I'm afraid they'll treat me differently. I'm afraid of seeing a mental health professional because I don't want to be diagnosed with anything or be stuck to live on pills or some other medication to function.

Many people who have mental illnesses are given funny looks or judged by others, treated as second class citizens. Sometimes I wish I could be free of my own thoughts and just spend a day brain dead. I feel trapped inside my own mind, my emotions, my actions. I'm a passenger of my own life.",29Jul2020,1
8,"My entire life all I’ve known has been arguments, anger, fighting, yelling. From the minute I was born, I was born into a family where the people on my dads side did not want me or love me. I was just accepted because there was no other option. 

At home, there were never moments of peace. The moments that were good never lasted long because someone would say something that would anger somebody else which would cause a fight. My parents argue over pretty much anything. My dad has major anger issues that have never been addressed and he loses it over anything small. Since I was little, the very thought of a man yelling at me or anyone raising their voice at me would make me tense, give me anxiety, I’d panic and not know what to do. Until recently I haven’t realized the extent of it. I get told by my mom not to make it into something bigger than it is despite the fact that she’s seen me breakdown due to their many arguments many, many times. 

I’ve had dreams of them fighting, although I can never really recall details, and I’ll even dream about fights that have never happen but I feel like will happen eventually. I avoided going home this summer and stayed at my college town. Anytime I’ve gone home I’ve planned it around my dad being out of town due to work. There have been moments when I’ve been home at the same time as dad and I’ve heard his voice while in my room cause he has a deep voice and I’ve panicked and expected the worst. My view on religion has changed completely because he has such a horrible way of living despite believing in God and he lives a life that I don’t believe a godly man would live. 

I don’t know what I have. I’ve been told by my psychiatrist that I have symptoms of PTSD but because I take antidepressants for anxiety we don’t know if I actually have severe symptoms of it because the meds could be masking it. 

I have to go home next year for at least 6 months and the thought of my parents exploding and fighting at any point puts me at a point of a nervous breakdown. They’re currently fine, but I’m almost putting myself in a place where they’re already fighting so I don’t have to live with the anticipation of something happening",29Jul2020,1

10,"Hi all,

Long story, but basically I have been struggling with mental health issues since childhood, and experience the symptoms associated with growing up in a neglecting, invalidating, physically abusive family.  The feeling of never being good enough is one I know too well.

With all that said, I managed to get through undergrad and finished a master’s degree program right around the 2008 financial collapse.  I struggled to find employment and slid into a horrible depression which eventually culminated with me being hospitalized in 2018.  Slowly, I have been getting my life back on track, and I did it! I got a job in my field, no less. I started at the beginning of July.

But now that I have a job, I seem to be regressing and I feel incredibly anxious, and I feel slow and tired all the time. I feel nervous around my supervisor, and it feels incredibly awkward.  I keep trying to breathe and not be too hard on myself, but I feel really overwhelmed.  Today after a meeting with her, I had to leave the building and cry.  

I feel like my depression and anxiety are threatening to take everything away from me again.  I feel like I should be grateful to get a job when so many are out of work, and I feel like an unworthy, unloveable loser.  I feel like it would be easier if my supervisor knew what I have been through and where I am coming from, but I don’t feel like I can trust her...",29Jul2020,1

13,"Okay, so this is kind of off topic, but kind of on topic, but since the FFXIV 5.3 release trailer, I was excited to see the Exarch potentially die. I know that's off topic, but ever since I could remember I got excited when a character was stabbed or shot. Not in the serial-type way where I want to see that pain myself, but more as in the sense where it's the drama that's built up and how everyone reacts to the main character or side character is injured and that obsessive draw to watch them bleed out on the floor and struggle to live. 

I know this isn't considered normal and possibly psychopathic, but am I the only one who gets excited by seeing a character die? I have dealt with death irl, but seeing it in a movie just is...different. I don't feel sad, I feel excited, like going down a rollercoaster hill.",29Jul2020,1
14,"So I'm currently in trauma processing therapy, mainly to deal with trauma my mom gave me. Well my dad's gf is toxic af and thinks I'm not even traumatized so she has no idea of this. What ties the bow o. This situation is that she is so much like my mom, just less crazy and dumber. So over all manageable even in her attempts to manipulate and gaslight. What isn't manageable is hat when she's stressed/ angry she sounds just like my mom. So I'm over here literally unpacking trauma (my therapist said it might be a good idea to look at things from the past cause my memory is blank) and she is having a mild breakdown in the other room and suddenly I'll be on the verge of a panic attack, about to run out of the house and spend the night at a hotel or just cry in my car. I'm fine when she is acting normal but I feel like she is one freak out away from sending me into an episode that'll put me in a mental hospital again and honestly I have no clue what I'm supposed to do about it. I wanna talk to my dad about it but he already learned his lesson with her and from what I can tell even feels bad about putting me back in a situation with someone like my mom. But I'm an adult now so I don't want him to do anything for my sake when it gets to this stuff. So yeah.

Recently I have been getting stronger and more vivid intrusive thoughts of doing something drastic to either make me feel more alive or just because I no longer care about the consequences. Specifically robbing a bank. For months I have thought and planned about how I would do it. I wrote this off as fantasy, I am sure many people think about robbing a bank, but never actually do it.

16,"I don’t know how to stop it.
Without going into too much detail because it’s not relevant, I was abused a lot as a kid and I still am so that’s probably why I have said nightmares.

I frequently have horrific nightmares/night terrors depending on how cruel my brain feels where I relive various incidents or see extreme graphic violence. I watch a lot of gore but I’m desensitised to it now.

I mostly hate them because I wake up screaming or crying or both and my body is shaking all over and sweating and it ruins the whole rest of the day. Even worse I wake up to being yelled at or hit with pillows (I know that’s nothing but when you’re barely conscious, already panicking and confused it’s terrifying) by my parents to “shut up” and “stop being so sad”.

The worst incident was when I went into a panic attack after a night terror and my dad just threw his coffee over me and said “cry about that instead”. So that was fun.

How do I stop these horrible things?? I’m terrified to go to sleep because I know I’ll wake up petrified. It’s gotten so bad I’ve forced myself awake to the point of hallucinating from sleep deprivation.",29Jul2020,1

For a while now (can’t really remember when it started) one of the last thoughts I have before I fall asleep is that of killing myself. Not in a “I’m going to get out of bed and do it” way, more of a “if I ever were to, here is how I would do it.”

18,"So for me sleeping at night can be a real challenge for two reasons.

1. This one is the less weird of the two. Whenever I’m in silence any noise the house makes I get really scared at. I’m my head the noises are robbers or murderers coming to kidnap or kill me. In the morning know this is irrational as I live in England and in the countryside where the crime rate is really low. However it can still leave me in bed at night fearing for my life.

2. This second reason is weirder and something I’ve never been able to understand and explain it to people makes me feel like I’m a crazy person. When I shut my eyes I see faces each face doesn’t stay for long before sort of morphing into another. None of the faces I see are ones I’ve ever seen before nor do I ever recognise any of them. Some of them are fine but most of them just creep me out for some reason meaning I can only keep my eyes shut for so long before I have to open them again. 

Does anyone experience either of these tow things? Does anyone have any advice for dealing with them? They’re really starting to effect my sleep schedule and causing me to be tired most days.",29Jul2020,1
19,"I have Schizophrenia, PTSD, Depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Autism Spectrum Disorder. I get medical insurance from the government disability program. I survived a very bad situation involving involuntary servitude, abuse, and occasional torture. Don't ask about that. I don't think it's too much to ask right? But the government sent me a questionnaire where if I didn't answer every question they would take away my insurance, which pays for my psychotherapy, medicines, dr, etc... And if I lie on a question I go to prison. So, I go through and start answering the questions and they ask why I don't do household chores. It's important to note here that they know full well why, every therapist and psychologist I ever had has submitted those notes to the government. So this pointed and specific question right when I'm finally starting to heal after 20 years of hell on earth is infuriating. First off, I went from cheerful and optimistic to not caring if most of my family survives the compounded dumpster fire that is corona and political unrest (some of these fuckers deserve to get it tbh).

27,"I come from a very conservative Asian background, though I was born in North America and I'm almost 17. All my life it's been about getting good marks and staying 'safe' at all times. That means no seeing friends outside of school for fun (if I have a project I can't go to other people's houses), no getting to use my OWN money on things I like that cost less than $5, constantly getting told I don't study enough (even in summer break) when I study for more than 6 hours with limited breaks and literally no social media. I get some of these rules are because they love me so much and they want what's best for me but everyday it's so hard to put on a smile and pretend everything is fine. 

They've put high expectations on me like getting jobs that pay over $100,000 a year, getting to the highest level in my field of choice, having kids (something I'm not sure I'll ever do) and more. On top of this, I feel ugly sometimes and other times okay with myself. When I look in a mirror I think things like how I don't like my nose or how I'm overweight (My BMI is just over 24).

What hurts the most though is watching other kids have a life I could only dream of. A year ago, we went to a family friends house with a girl my age from the same background. I know that each family is different but I was shocked when her friend texted her right before we were about to leave at midnight to have a sleepover. She only asked once and her parents already agreed to take her there in 20 minutes whereas, even arranging to do a project with someone in a public area or at my house requires a long explanation and a reasoning as to why I didn't finish it at school.

31,"So, I’m a messy person. No matter how much I want to keep everything clean and orderly I just can’t seem to get motivated enough to keep my apartment clean. My car suffers the same neglect. Every so often, maybe once every couple of weeks I can’t stand it anymore and I clean everything up and make my home a nice relaxing place to live in. I put up lights and art on my walls and rearrange things to be as aesthetically pleasing as possible. The issue goes further than just being messy though. I leave cupboards and drawers wide open, I leave lights on all day and night... most of the time i leave everything how it is even though it’s incredibly easy to do something about it. I have even been known to leave the oven on for hours after I make food. The ability to turn off the oven is right there, all I have to do is reach out and turn it off when I get my food out. It always feels like I really have to force myself to do anything about it. I don’t know how to explain it. I prefer living in an organized state and it decreases anxiety immensely being able to sit in my clean room, but I just can’t seem to keep anything in order after the initial cleaning. Take cupboards for example. Such an easy thing to close but it almost feels like a waste of time or makes me feel anxious thinking about taking the step to do it. When I was a kid my dad was very angry all the time. Loud noises set him off and I think I developed the habit at home. I used to close drawers and cupboards slowly and never all the way. I always left them open an inch or two I guess to make sure no noises happened. Somehow this mindset followed me into my adult life... at least I think so. I can’t just blame my dad for all that because maybe I would have turned out this way regardless of the way my childhood went. I know that what I’m about to say is gross but I feel I shouldn’t leave it out so as to demonstrate the extent of this problem. Usually after I piss, not only do I not close the seat but I don’t flush until much later. Usually after the second or third time using it. It’s so easy to do and yet here I am avoiding it like the plague. Last week I dropped a glass on the floor of my kitchen and left the mess there all day and simply walked around it. Then a day later I swept it into a pile and it’s been just sitting there for a week in a pile in the middle of the floor. The broom and dustpan are only a few feet away. Right now I’m wearing one sock and I have been for 5 hours now. One came off at some point and all I have to do is remove the other but something inside me feels like that’s just a bother and a waste of time or something. These are all examples that are just popping into my head but it’s an all day everyday thing and I feel like I live in chaos. But whatever it is preventing me from making organized habits stick just overwhelms the ability to do it. I know this probably all sounds weird and I panic sometimes when I talk to friends and realize how this is a non issue for most people. I do have a strange ocd type thing where I line the side of the tip of my finger up with any straight line where I think it will line up perfectly. And I line the rounded top of my thumb or finger up with the inside of circles and adjust it until it fits the shape perfectly. I know it’s a compulsion and I usually go through my day doing it silently and nobody ever seems to notice. This has been happening for at least as far back as middle school and I’m 30 now. I’m also completely uninterested in any type of job and so I’ve become complacent at my job as a laborer and it pays the bills fine. Older folks tell me to get a better job all the time and I just don’t see the point. I don’t want to work until I die and waste my life. I want to be an artist and make art for a living so I am doing the best I can to get better but I know I have years and years of practice ahead of me before I could ever dream of making a living doing art. I’m very introverted and have lost most of my friends because I refuse to go anywhere anymore. I just sit inside or leave the house by myself and avoid everyone as much as possible. All these problems make me feel pretty hopeless and for someone living life normally it’s so easy to say just change my ways, but i just can’t seem to do it. I could talk to a professional but it seems like a waste of hours out of my free time to do that too. What do I do? Everything I do is half assed and incomplete. U must be wondering by now how I even wrote this long post if I am so unmotivated. The truth is I have no idea but I think these thoughts have been bothering me for so long that right now it feels cathartic to get it all out here. I’m not sure what I’m even trying to achieve by posting this, maybe I just want to know if anyone else is like this and if you found a way to manage it. Maybe I’m hoping someone can tell me I have some sort of mental problem and they know how to fix it. Whatever is holding me back is a complete mystery to me and I think the feelings I get from the ocd issues feel somewhat similar to things like not being able to shit drawers all the way. Anyway, please give me an opinion or something. I’m not asking for sympathy because this seems to be an issue with laziness mostly. A lot of times shit just pours out of me and there’s no real rhyme, reason, or structure and I feel as if I’ve been rambling horribly. The end.",29Jul2020,1

One day I woke up and felt no motivation to do anything. I thought doing anything was pointless. It got to the point where I would start considering suicide. Closest I got was when I was driving to school one morning and thought about driving it into the lake. Nothing happened prior to this phase and it only lasted about a month. Eventually I was just better and I have been since, but thinking back I don’t get where that all came from? Am I repressing a memory or something?

About a 2 years ago it got really bad to the point that I couldn’t work, obviously at this point there was no hiding the fact that I was having a mental breakdown from those closest to me. It took awhile but I pulled myself out of it and got back on my feet with a brand new amazing job. Everyone’s very happy for me but the sad truth is I still have depression. It takes all my energy to get out of bed and go to work. So I don’t have any extra energy for friendships. I’ve been avoiding going to see people and hanging out with anyone. Everyone’s taking it personally they can’t understand that it has nothing to do with them I just don’t have any energy to act like I’m having fun when I’m around people. I just need to be at home where I can cry if I need to and not have to explain myself. They all get mad. I don’t want to tell them I’m depressed again because they’ll try to help. I appreciate the thought but they don’t understand  that they make things worse when they try to help me.

42,"Hey all, just wanted to share something I wrote, I know it’s a bit dramatic, but it’s about something that I don’t know how I could exclude drama from writing about I guess. Feel free to judge my role in any of it how you will, it’s not something I’m overly sensitive about anymore. Not going to get into specifically how I joined in, but know I was never involved in anything physical... not that that makes it any better.

I grew up with a lot of pain, and while I learned how to deal with that pain... it became anger. This anger led me to follow a terrible example, and hurt the people I love, the people who should have been able to look to me for protection... even at the time. I take responsibility for my behavior at the time, I was immature, and wanted to be like someone whose example was nothing short of terrible. That was my mistake, and I own it. I’m not proud of it, and alongside one other act I did, It is one of the deepest sources of shame in my past. 
I’m older now though, and I’ve grown. That pain is no longer a crutch, and it doesn’t hold me back anymore. Now it is a source of fuel, one that drives me. A warning I look back on, as inspiration to be the kind of man I want to be. I know I would never disrespect the people I love in that way because of it. I know it helped me find compassion, and made me more empathetic to the things that are hurting others. That pain is no longer a burden, in a way, despite the fact that myself and my family never should have had to endure it... I am grateful for it. I’m grateful because through that fire, the man I’ve become was born. I like who I am now, and despite the hurt in my past, I wouldn’t change it. Because that pain made me, and for that, I am grateful.
That gratefulness however does not extend to the source of those years of hurt. I don’t know that I’ll ever be able to forget what I went through, even as I try to forgive it. I thing to forget though, there must be a change, and as of now that change has yet to come in the source of the pain that was inflicted on myself and my family. I’m grateful for the fire that made me, but the source of that fire, the one who hurt myself, my sisters, and my mom? That source has done nothing to earn gratefulness, and is as far from growing from the past as any person has ever been.
So I’m sorry dad, I may forgive you, but I’ll be damned if I ever forget the lessons you’ve taught me about who you are, before you finally grow up enough to become a man.",29Jul2020,1

44," 

The world is strange, isn't it? You find something that you never really saw in the first place. You wonder if the world knows that you’ve been missing this big piece of information your whole life. But deep in your mind, you know that the world doesn’t know and also doesn’t care. That no one cares. That you’ll descend deeper into the world of tomorrow worrying about this without ever placing yourself in the present. Your existence won’t matter after a certain point in time because you’ve placed yourself into a reality where nothing matters. You throw yourself into a world of fire where everything burns except you and you tell yourself everything is fine because you can’t admit to yourself what you just experienced. And then as you finally realize everything around you is not fine, your thrown by a mysterious hand down to the earth and are suddenly sitting in a seat that has your name on it.

Someone moves across the aisle of seats and as people complain and curse at him as he comes up to you and he asks to get up out of your seat and let him take it. You refuse to give up your seat in life and instead put a mask on your chair as a reminder that a piece of you is still there. Even if it’s artificial and it's not you. The real you. Even if it’s produced by someone else. You won’t give in to the voice that tells you to give up your seat. Instead, you go to the bathroom and watch yourself fade away from the crowd of people sitting in the dark room, staring at nothing.

You remember how when you first arrived in this wonderful world, there were people everywhere sitting in all the seats around you. But when you return from your venture to the bathroom, you come to find that people are getting up and leaving their seats with no trace that they were ever there. As if they were never there. Not even a mask. Some people are forcefully taken and being thrown out of the room, only for someone else to take their seat. But you, (being a “wonderful” person) you find your mask still sitting on your seat and you question whether you pick up the mask and sit down, you throw the mask and smash it and sit down on the seat, or just walk away. But you want to be unique. You want to think that everyone is boring except you. You want to think that no else in this room can understand how much better you are than them. You want to be the rainbow in a world of black and white.

But that’s not going to happen.

The rainbow is already there. The stories are already being told as you speak. And as you lean in to hear these stories, you find something you never thought to be even possible. These stories aren't about you. It’s not you. You don’t tell stories. You never have because your life has no meaning. You're not a rainbow because you don’t have a life. You aren’t a colorful person nonetheless a rainbow. If you looked a little closer at yourself you would see the reflection of yourself. The sad version of the life you’ve created for yourself. You know you're smiling, you know it deep inside. Very deep. But it isn’t. The reflection isn’t. It’s frowning as it looks at you. There’s no hint of happiness or any actual recognition that this reflection has ever truly smiled in its entire life. It tells you to pick up your mask and leave the building. And you do it.

You don’t question your future decisions because you sense what you are about to do. You're going to leave the building but not pick up your mask. And you do. You walk out of the building but tell no one else. But somehow, someway you cant wrap your head around, everyone else knows that you are going to leave. Everyone else sees that you're leaving the building. They scream at you not to go and pull your clothes and your hair back but it only makes you question your motive for barley a second. You leave the building expecting to leave and walk out. But what you see or visualize in your head is how blind you are.

As you don't look what the stairs you walk down lead you to, you fall. You plummet to the ground and as you look up you can see the building phasing in and out of your vision. And then you hit the ground, unable to know what happens. Your mask is shattered into tiny little pieces as it lands on the earth a second after you. You look at your legs and see that they are twisted in obscene directions. Your right arm is broken and your hand is lying 5 feet away from its socket. Your left eye lies smashed under a rock that fell along with you. You sob and cry uncontrollably screaming that you want your mask back. You want the soul that you gave up when jumped back. You want your arm back, you want your legs back, you want your eye to be back in its bleeding socket. You cry because you know what you are. What you’ve turned yourself into. You are the living version of a dead piece of meat. You cry and cry and cry wishing that you were yourself again. But then. What's this?

As you look up and see something out of the ordinary. A ladder being dropped down towards you. It falls through the air for so long. 5 minutes. 10 minutes. 30 minutes. An hour. Once you are finally ready to accept that the ladder will never really come down, it hits the earth with a loud clang. You grip the side of the ladder with the hand you have left and then the first rung with the tiny amount of strength remaining inside your body. You grip it with your life. And you climb. And climb. And climb and climb and climb and climb and climb. And as you slowly go up the ladder you can see the building you dropped from. And then suddenly you feel your hand start twisting back into place. It slowly reforms all the connections to the muscles and veins and to your heart which has somehow stayed intact during this whole extravaganza. It hurts. Your legs slowly twist back to the direction of the ladder. It is agonizing pain. You feel the air that hits your eye as it glides through the air slowly up towards where it belongs. It makes you want to jump off the ladder. But you won't let go because you know what will happen if you do.

Instead, you climb through the torture and pain as the power of the ladder glues your entire body back together. It feels like you climb the ladder forever and multiple times you feel like you should jump off. Like climbing to the top is meaningless. But you don’t. And then just when you feel like you can’t do it anymore, you reach the building that you first left. You get on the safe stoop that leads up to the doors and as you do this you realize that you don’t feel pain. Instead, you feel accomplished and happy and ready to re-enter the building and return to your seat. You feel ready to go home.

You throw open the door and run back to your seat as everyone watches in disbelief. They can’t believe the thought that you are back. You push past all the people in your supposed row that you sat in when you were here. But when you finally make it to your seat and feel like everything will be fine, someone else is already sitting in your seat. The nameplate that used to contain your name now says a different name. You stand there in awe that the building can replace you not caring how you would feel. It tossed you out of its room not caring that you might ever come back.

You walk begrudgingly back outside and walk down the stairs of the building, thinking about the atrocity that you just witnessed. You stand on the edge of the platform wondering what you should do. And then you know what you have to do. You take a final step off the platform and don’t look back up at the building as you fall through the air, knowing that when you hit the ground, there won’t be a ladder that falls through the air to pick you from the sad puddle of death. You won’t pick yourself up...knowing that you chose to leave. That you are truly gone from the world. Truly gone from the world. Truly gone.

48,"I just graduated from college. Depression is ruining my quality of life and i need help. 

The past few months have been some of the hardest in my entire life. I feel like I’m suffocating. I have no energy; constantly exhausted and feel like sleeping. I’m sad all the time. I have no motivation to do anything. Just complete dread and pain all day long. It never stops. It never goes away. I had a lot of bad stuff happen this past year but wont go into detail. 

This past year, I’ve struggled with severe suicidal thoughts. Now, im constantly depressed, tired, and anhedonic: nothing i used to enjoy is fun at all anymore. 

I keep getting rejected from job apps, don’t have any real social oppurtunities, and I’ve never had a significant other or been on a date. Worst of all, I can’t do my tutoring job at college anymore since i graduated and that hurts the most. I loved doing that and it was the only thing that made me feel like i had some kind of worth or purpose in life. Now its gone. 

Here is what is compounding everything, though: still live w/ my parents. I can’t get help and really dont wanr to tell my family about the gravity of the situation bc my younger sister also has depression and is on antidepressants. She is bulimic, sees a psychiatrist, and its been VERY hard for my mom and dad. I nevet had the courage/was always too embarrassed to tell them but now that my sister’s issues are a big deal im our house, i would feel so terrible to reveal mine. Who wants BOTH their kids to be suicidal?  

I have no purpose. I feel so alone and empty. I feel like I’m at the end of my life and i wasted all the potential i had left. Pissed it away. Nothing. I feel completely worthless and I’m in excruciating pain from the moment i wake up to the momenti fall asleep.  

I don’t know what to do. I’ve talked to a suicide hotline chat but they were useless. I dont want to tell my parents i need therapy and im scared to try to find a therapist. What if they’re nasty? What if they don’t understand me? What if they try to get me committed bc of my suicidal thoughts?

in the past, i was very good about taking it, but in the recent months, i have been skipping doses for sometimes up to 2-5 days before i start taking it again, for 2-3 days, and then continue this cycle. i’m wondering if this is the reason for my sporadic anxiety and depression, or if it is more so from the fact that i haven’t seen my therapist for over a month due to Covid-19.

52,"I have been to many different therapists over the past decade and done online therapy through Betterhelp. I couldn't help but notice a stark contrast between the in-person therapists and the online ones. The in-person therapists have always felt like they are genuinely trying to help me. Every single one of them. But the online ones tended to be cold and distant and the majority of them gave off the vibe that they had no interest in helping me. One of them actually dropped me as a client because she said she didn't feel like we were getting anywhere and another one, whom I only messaged back and forth with a few times, I actually felt was purposely being negligent replying with short messages asking questions about things I just addressed in an attempt to get rid of me.

Recently as I started doing video appointments with my latest in-person therapist and I have noticed an increased effort to schedule more appointments and a concern with how my health insurance plan will change after I started my new job. So I've started to think about the possibility that she(and other therapists) may be primarily motivated by a financial need to keep clients coming back and are just telling me what I want to hear. The therapists on Betterhelp, I do get to rate them but in the end it doesn't matter they lose me as a client, because they are getting clients through the site. So maybe they do not feel obligated to try to help me and are showing how they really feel about me and about the things I am telling them by reacting the way they do?

55,"Just want to start and say that I'm not talking about coronavirus. I mean that I hate American culture and politics, and this was long before coronavirus.

I have always hated the excessively greedy, and entitled culture and right wing politics. I'm not looking for a political debate in any way. I just want to express my beliefs, and why American culture and politics has an effect on my mental health.

America has a history of inequality and oppression, and has more recently changed to put on a facade of equality for all, but fails to deliver. Working hours have increased, but wages have stagnated during times of increased productivity. Cost of living, education, and health care have all increased. Impoverished communities in this country have trouble putting food on the table. Food is thrown away for cosmetic reasons instead of giving it away to people who need it. Meanwhile there is also an obesity problem that people say is all from people needing self discipline. They ignore all societal factors such as the government heavily subsidizing the corn industry and corn syrup being used in everything because it's dirt cheap. Systemic racism, climate change, and neoliberalism continue to this day after the side effects are apparently obvious. Meanwhile no one does anything to actually help the people. Businesses intentionally screw over employees to make a profit. The government doesn't care about the people. They only care about lining their own pockets and increasing their power.

All that said, I feel hopeless. I feel like I have no control over my life, and am too exhausted to do anything for myself. I can't individually make a difference and can't vote for anyone one who can make a difference. I have to work a meaningless exhausting job or I couldn't afford food and housing. On a broader scale, I feel that there is no compassion for others and people only care about issues that help them.

60,"Certain events in my life have generated a severe feeling of worthlessness inside me. My ex girlfriend hangs out with people who are more social and better than me, while I don't have much of a social structure (I'm in introvert). People who go out and enjoy all day score better marks than me in school, while I sit at home constantly trying to figure out how to study. People seem to leave me after a while just when I would start getting emotionally closer to them, and for this reason I don't have a single true friend since childhood. I have been verbally bullied since childhood because I was super immature and playful with others all the way till 9th grade, which has now caused me to act very seriously and sternly in public places. It's next to impossible for me to do certain activities in public (figuring out how to open a door, going to a clothing store and trying on new clothes, going to the gym for the first time) without having serious anxiety of being judged by others.

Not to mention the fact that I feel I'm very ugly, I have several health problems such as my elevated shoulder due to bad posture, or my skin having too many acne scars (on my back too). I don't think I have any good qualities within me apart from acting nice towards other people, but that generates from the fact that they deserve way better than me. I sincerely want to fix myself and my life, I don't want to live like this anymore.",29Jul2020,1
61,"So I'm definitely over reacting but I just want to put this somewhere. I have tried, before this whole pandemic, talking to a therapist, but I choked and didn't tell them anything. I just sheltered myself in, gave some generic answers to her questions, and apologized for wasting her time. I went back to my room and was kicking myself the whole way back as when I got back I wrote 2 pages worth of things I wish I had talked about and cried a little. I'm not looking to self diagnose or get diagnosed as if I am diagnosed with anything there will be major problems and my entire life might be upended, I thought about this as I was walking there and got scared and that combined with just not being that good at communicating my true feelings make me feel like I'm going to feel this way my whole life. I feel like I will never belong and never be loved. I am not objectively ugly but I'm no looker, my personality fluctuates and when I get close to someone I always end up teasing them and going to far because I think I'm boring and to most people I am weird so I don't have many friends. I'm a total loser and I'm self aware enough to know this, but I'm also self aware enough to know that I'm self aware so I have a weird inferiority/superiority thing going on. Whenever I make friends I always don't feel comfortable with them and try to distance myself even if I really enjoy them. I feel like a walking contradiction in all parts of my life. I'm lazy but also work hard, I know what I like but when I'm doing what I like I feel shame and embarrassment and force myself to stop, I hate myself but I am smug, I am writing this for help but I will probably delete it 5 minutes after posting as I always get into these funks and go really low and then suddenly I will be really content and confident and think everything is not just OK but great. This happens and then I go back, seemingly out of nowhere into a mode where I can't do anything, I just sit there and think about 5 or 6 regrets I have and am just immobilized with helplessness and apathy. I want help but I won't let myself get it. Even now I ramble in a way no one will understand and go back into my silence until my confident self breaks free so I can do anything again.",29Jul2020,1
62,"Hey guys. Back story, I was extremely anxious for years, ever since freshman yr of college. I then went through a period of bad bad depression last fall (2019) after losing my grandmother. Simultaneously, there was a cluster of suicides at the school I went to. Because of the state I was in these went to my head and started becoming a massive fear of mine. Luckily since then my anxiety and depression has almost completely gone, if not gone completely. But the idea of suicide is still a passive thought that always seems to flash, even though I confidently say that I love myself and am very happy with my life. Could it be OCD, or just another way anxiety manifests itself?? 
I’m grateful to be mentally stable and able to lead a good life but these thoughts are properly scary.",29Jul2020,1

64," I never woke up in my dads balls and said ''dad you need a vagina so you can let me out'' lmao. I didn't ask to be born. ESPECIALLY when people be having kids in the worse scenarios possible. I didn't choose to be born in a shitty country. The real lottery is the lottery of birth. elon musks baby doesn't know he won the lottery yet he won the lottery. You can be born ugly so no one will ever love you OR you can be born hot asf and not have to even move a finger to get rich, just exist.

Point is You didn't choose to be born or the conditions to be born then why the fuck the concept of assisted suicide is so taboo? I want to die already, I hate every moment yet I can't have a medically proven dignified death? even dogs have the right to euthanasia which drives me insane.

Theres people who genuinly hate living but don't have that things that pushes them over the edge to do it themselves. For example a couple months back y decided to run my mitsubishi eclipse through a metal pole at 80-100 mph. I literally came out the car ''FUCCCCCKKKKK WHY AM I NOT DEAD YET'' literally not even the airbags opened because they don't work.

you got people like me crashing through poles risking others peoples lives and risking peoples cars when a doctor could kill me in one second with an injection",29Jul2020,1
65,"Hello , so for a good while I felt like I had intrusive thoughts. I mean it's hard to explain but in my case I feel like if I start to  imagine hurting someone I get this weird feeling in my body.

  I really don't know how to explain that feeling, but I just don't know if that deals with anger issues but on the other hand I've never had a  problem with my anger so it's weird to me. Also I never acted upon any of these thoughts but I just keep them in my head and I have tried to find a therapist but don't know what to look for. I remember one told me to look for personality disorder .

66,"So. I’ll make this as brief as possible. Basically, I am a 33 yr old woman. I have a bit of a rocky past with men and romance. That said, I have one ex in particular who seemed to really destroy me. We broke up in 2015 but since then, I have struggled to trust, accept love, and not fucking RUN for the hills at the first sign of issues in a relationship. I’d rather set the dynamite off in a relationship at my own whim then wait around again to be destroyed. 

Shitty part is I’m conscious of how destructive my behavior is. I just don’t know how to change. I’ve tried to look up resources but haven’t found much. 

So, my ex was super evil. Controlling, held me hostage once for three days, he was controlling, physically abusive, he constantly berated me for my weight, my looks, my personality. Not to mention a cheater. Don’t get me wrong. I’m a super strong, successful woman, I’m not typically someone who would tolerate this kind of thing. But, it just slowly got worse and worse. And at first I thought he was amazing. Then he turned into Satan. The worst part is, he’s beautiful. Charming. Etc. 

Flash forward to now. I’m actually married now. I LOVE my husband. He’s incredible. But, no matter how much he worships me, spoils me with affection, showers me with love. I. Don’t. Fucking. Believe. Him. 

He’s never done or said anything to make me feel this. It’s my ex. My ex’s words still echo through my ears. I’ve conditioned myself (unfortunately) that my ex is the only person in my life who has ever given me the courtesy of the truth. I believe him, with everything in me, that I am disgusting. Unlovable. Unworthy.  

Of course my rational brain understands that this is incorrect. But my rational brain is constantly at odds with my internal voice. My internal voice reaffirms daily that I am in fact unworthy. I’m a good looking, intelligent, interesting, enterprising individual. I know that I “shouldn’t” feel as I do. But I can’t help it and I don’t know how to change. 

I’m worried I will eventually drive my husband away. I push him away. And it’s just because I have no idea how to believe him. How to be loved. How to trust or feel secure. I thought after 5 years I would have been in a better place mentally. But I’m not. I am extremely mean to myself in my head. Any advice or blogs or podcast suggestions are much appreciated.",29Jul2020,1

71,"Maybe this post will inspire someone. About a month ago, I committed myself to a psych ward when I felt as though I couldn’t stop myself from self harming anymore. Here’s how I had the worst day of my life, and then learned to love myself for the first time ever. 



Written July 28, 2020

There is a moment from my childhood that I will always remember. 

After a few moments of tense silence, my mom turned to me in motherly frustration, and finally breathed out, “we are in what is supposed to be the happiest place on earth. how can you still be miserable?”

We were at Disney World. And she was right, I was miserable, and I didn’t know why. 

——

Kids often say the whole “my parents just don’t understand me”. But the truth was, my mom and dad didn’t understand me. I didn’t understand me. And two years after that moment, it would take a confession of suicidal plans and several therapy appointments later for us to begin the long and endless process of truly understanding me. 

I was a depressed child. I was a depressed teenager. And I am a depressed adult (who, if you’re wondering, still files under the technical title of “teenager”, as well). 

Eight years after Disney World, I made a call to my dad that I knew I’d never forget. My voice broke when I heard him answer my call. “Daddy, I need to go to the hospital. I need help. Please take me, I am committing myself to the psych ward.”

I was eighteen, sitting in my car alone, which I had been living in for about a week after my then fiancé left me and my parents and I had gotten into a fight. A lot happened, and my entire world had shattered before me that day. I was afraid of myself and what I might do to myself, so I made that call. I cannot imagine the horror my dad felt. 

But I went to the hospital psych ward. And it was the hardest, bravest, and best decision of my entire life. I had wonderful, supportive nurses and lovely people around me getting treatment as well. But more than anything, I had a self revelation. 

You see, my entire life, I have been the first to reach out if I think someone is hurting. I will reach out and tell them how much they mean to me and how I want them to stay here on this earth. Yet, I had always been my number one bully within myself- when I felt urges, my Self said “do it. youre worthless. this world would be better off without you. you’re a burden and will never be enough.”

That second night in the psych ward, I found myself alone in my room unable to sleep. Seeking comfort, I looked at my Self in the mirror and separated us for a moment. The girl in the mirror was now my friend who was hurting. She was my friend who swore her life held no meaning, who had not a drop of hope left in her cup. And I cried. I cried seeing her hurting. I cried when I realized how much she truly hated herself. I sobbed. Then, I looked her in the face, and I examined how she was actually really beautiful, and I told her that. I hadn’t noticed her beauty before, not really. Even crying, she held a beauty about her that she never allowed herself to see through her real and imagined flaws. Then I told her that this life is worth it and that she is going to do big things, even if they seem small at the time. I told her how important she was to me. I told her to cling on to my belief in her until she found it within herself. I told her that as impossible as it may seem right now, she will live on. 

And she has. She has lived on, and she will keep living on. Because this life is worth it. I am worth it. I am enough, just as I am. 

So I look back on my childhood in a very different light than I once did. My relationship with my family as a child was not always the best. We argued and fought, and those memories are the ones that most often come to mind when I think of my childhood. But I am able to look back now and realize that my parents did the best they knew how. I mean, how do you care for a chronically depressed child that you don’t even realize is depressed at all? There was always a wall between the rest of the world and me, and how could I or my parents know that??

I am now slowly working to bring down those nineteen years worth of wall I have built around me. And with every brick I dismantle from that wall, I become a little more of my Self. 

... If you read my story this far through, thank you. Please know that I love you and want you all to stay here. I promise you’ll thank yourself later. 💖",29Jul2020,1
72,"People often think I'm on drugs or something, cause why else you would be homeless. Nah, I'm just lost.

I know I'm lacking a deeper human connection. I can't let myself or old wounds show. I can talk about my experiences if I detach myself from the moment. But when it comes to genuinely opening up, either to myself or another, I'm incredibly scared of that.

If things go on this way, I think I'll never improve myself and be full of regret at the end.

When I'm feeling in a low place, I'll imagine someone is rubbing my back or something like that, as if to say, ""It's alright, I'm here now."" But who the hell would accept such a thing anyways???

I seriously want to be coddled. I think it's a problem. People would think they're my temporary support. And even though I could see how it would end, I would pull both of us over the edge.

And now I'm too scared of myself. For 5+ years. 

I just want to let myself make friends and make happy memories again. That's a truly embarrassing thing.",29Jul2020,1
73,"so i (F14) lie.. a lot and it took me a while to come out about it. its very comforting because i think it helps me lie to myself. my whole life ive had a horrible case of self hate and doubt. my grandparents of which i live with are VERY formal in public, and only care about public appearance. its been forced on me. i lie to make other people happy, and make myself feel better. i just see me lying as an escape. i am an awful person and it makes me hate myself more and more. now i have more relationships with other people... it just makes everything harder because i know i should be honest but something makes me feel unsafe about it. so i lie. it really is hard. i know this is a disgusting personality trait, not even a trait, a flaw. i need to just say this and i think its best to take small steps and post it here. thanks y'all. :)",29Jul2020,1
74,"I’ve been in a couple toxic/abusive relationships in my life, but for the most part I have good people in my life now, discounting the complicated relationships I have with most of them. But I just find myself looking for bad people? I try to keep myself away but it always comes full circle, sometimes with the same people. It’s like I don’t want to, but for some reason I keep coming back (that’s what an addiction is? Idk)  I’ve heard this sentiment from other people but theyve always been kinda vague, so I don’t know if they apply to my situation.

i so want to fix this, it’s kinda gotten to the point where me and my mental health can’t afford any more hits, if that makes any sense. does anyone have any, like, tips? (Idk what’s the appropriate term in this situation)",29Jul2020,1
75,"So I already know I have GAD and/or social anxiety but I honest to god feel like there is something else wrong with me. 
Like, I have times where I'm down and everything feels like shit, but it doesn't last long enough to be counted as depression or a depressive episode (it's usually two/three days MAX)
Sometimes I feel like nothing is real and everything I see is fake, but I know it's just my brain being stupid, but I don't like see stuff that actually isn't real.  (if I stare at shadows or pictures they move a little bit but im like 99% sure thats a normal thing.
My mood is a fricking mess. I know some of it is anxiety but sometimes I get so frustrated that I feel a strong urge to bang my head against a wall (the only reason I haven't is because I'll do breathing exercises). I also go between super sensitive to I couldn't care less. 
I have had thoughs of killing myself (I've never said that before, not even to my therapist bc??? I'm scared??) but I'd never actually go through with it. 

Does this sound like something else? I've been trying to bring it up to my therapist but I feel like I'm making it up or making a big deal out of nothing. So I'd like the opinion of strangers online bc somehow that's comforting to me.",29Jul2020,1
76,"I'm so happy I could cry, truly. As a kid I loved to read, I used to devour books one after the other. Every night I would read out loud to my cat, because my parents used to read to me but they just...just didn't after a point. It was my solace, my escape from bullies and emotional neglect, a habit that fed my mind and gave my young anxiety some fuel to burn.

But then, slowly, as my life grew chaotic and the trauma stacked up like some shitty game of Jenga, I couldn't anymore. I couldn't focus, couldn't immerse myself without feeling compelled to check my phone. My hypervigilance would have me jump at every noise--it always felt like I was doing something I shouldn't.

I don't know how I made it through college. It was much harder than it had to be because of this, I did well but I think the strain contributed to my burnout in the last year.

Falling apart may have been the best thing to ever happen to me though. I gritted my teeth and did the work to get extensive therap. My insurance tried to buck me off it a couple times but I dug in. Some days it physically pained me to sit through the Zoom groups. But I took notes, I participated, I gave it my all. After years of therapists and doctors scratching their heads and doing their best just to keep me afloat, I finally made some breakthroughs.

I had hoped it would give me back my life. My momentum, my career, my future--it all stalled out just before the pandemic hit. I am far from secure and I'm scared shitless I still do won't make it.

But I have this. It feels like finding my baby blanket after thinking it was long lost. I've devoured three books in 2 weeks, over 1000 pages down. I haven't even watched TV in three days. I have a huge wish list with my local library and a fat stack of my new favorite murder mysteries on their way.

77,"I'm tiered of seeing and feeling things. I'm tired of hear thoughts. Why is my life filled with things I don't want? I'm sorry, it's all my fault. If my mind was healthy it wouldn't happen. It's all my fault.",29Jul2020,1
78,"I should start this off with some background, I am a 17 year old guy in high school who has Christian beliefs but in a way doesn't relate. I have had many interactions with people who use drugs even dated a girl who did, mostly ""weed""/marijuana. I mean no REAL hate, it feels almost subconscious to me, like I have no control

For some reason, when I hear that someone does drugs, smokes or whatever. I get this somewhat natural feeling of absolute abhor hatred toward that person. None of family have been harmed by drugs and I don't think much about the people who have so it seems almost random, not even religious reason. I just hate them.

Most of my experiences around people who use drugs or smoke weed or whatever seem to be completely self absorbed, pitiful people. I have yet to get one experience where I don't hear them complain. Even the little things bother them. I have never been one to not take pride in my work (I go to a trade school for sheet metal/metal fab). So if I fail, I try again and again. Yet when they fail, they give up stop working and be lazy. And that feels like it fuels an immense fire of hate.

I know not everyone is like that, but the emotion is merely tied to the idea of drugs. I live an okay life, moderately strict parents but I do live in relative poverty. Most of them are actually better off than my family, but I still pity them. 

This is going to sound horrible, but I find them extremely weak, and this feeling doesn't come from my brain but my gut. A deep, burning hatred.

Does anyone at all know the reason behind this, psychology wise.

Lastly, I mean no hatred at all toward people who struggle with addiction or have to use drugs to prevent pain. The feeling is pretty much not even under my control it just happens. I mean only love not hate I honestly got no clue why, I want to better myself and understand them.",29Jul2020,1
79,"Legitimate question free of judgment.

My sister is married with 2 kids, they are very wealthy, she is a stay at home mom, her kids are all teenagers but she has been doing this since before the oldest was born.

She pushes anything new shes tried and liked on everyone. Recently, it's been Burger Kings Impossible Whopper. At least 1 text a day with her pushing everyone to go buy one, ""you will never want meat again!"" She raves. Prior it was the Scattergories app. She pushes whatever shes into until she finds something new. She started taking Prozac in 2018 and she advertises that like a cure all and genuinely believes everyone in our family just needs a little prozac. She is also very competitive about everything, for example, regarding Prozac, I told her I take 80mg and have been for a long time. She said she takes 100mg but when I saw her med bottle at her house, its 20mg once a day. I was really confused by that but I didn't have a chance to ask for clarification.

The most concerning thing to me is her hobby jumping. Every 2 to 3 months, she has a new one. She buys everything she will need for her new hobby, for every stage or variation, does it a couple times then doesn't ever try it again. She has recently gotten into mason jar sand art. She bought 2 pallets of mason jars from a website and a bunch of sand and other bits and bob's and she said shes spent over $3000. Her husband is getting more and more angry when I see him. This evening I drove out to her house to drop something off and I heard them in the garage yelling about her spending and apparently it's getting worse every year. Her kids do the same thing, too.

I am really afraid that she might have an addiction. I know my brother in law loves her and will get her help but I am also afraid he might overlook some things. This isn't how she was before marriage and kids. Does she need help? If so, how do I encourage her to seek help?

Thank you for reading this, I appreciate any assistance and advice I receive. This is not meant at all to sound judgemental or hateful and I apologize if it comes across as so.",29Jul2020,1
80,"I am in love with someone from high school. For the sake of privacy, I'll call her ""Charlotte""

I first met Charlotte during an orientation-type event in high school at the beginning of my senior year (Fall 2018). I had seen her around school in my Junior year and thought she was incredibly pretty, but to be entirely honest she seemed really scary at the same time so I kept my distance. We were in a computer lab, and she was sitting in the row in front of me. I started talking about how I wanted to do Air Force ROTC in college to pay off all of my debt, and how I have family members who were in the Air Force. She overheard, and talked about her dad, who was also a veteran. From there we hit it off pretty well. 

For the next few weeks, we would hang out around school often. We would sit outside, and just talk and relax under the sun. We would always really enjoy each other's company, and I began to realize that we had a lot in common. I would joke with her and it always made me feel really good to make her laugh. The more I talked to her, the more I got to understand her and the more beautiful she was to me. Obviously, I started to develop some serious feelings for her. And to be honest, I had an inkling that she had some for me, considering how much we had in common.

Something important to understand is the fact that at this point in my life I had never asked a girl out, or confessed my feelings. I lived under the assumption that it could ruin potential friendships and it was best just unsaid.  Charlotte was going to be the one to change that, though. I remember it vividly. It was the week before Labor Day. I had made up my mind. I had built up the courage to ask Charlotte out. But the day that I was going to take the plunge I learned that not only did she have a boyfriend, but she had been dating him for 5 years.

Labor Day Weekend was miserable. I tried to think out every possibility. Do I ask her anyway? What if she isn't happy? Do I want to be a homewrecker though? Do I want to do that to her and her boyfriend? I eventually somewhat moved on but the feelings were still there. Seeing her was really painful, because it brought up those emotions, but it was nothing I wasn't used to so I kept being her friend. She ended up joining my robotics team and she, our programmer, and I formed a tight friend trio, and we still talk often to this day. At the end of that fall semester, I had figured I had moved on. I had even gotten a girlfriend. But come the end of the school year, those feelings started rushing back, and they never went away. 

Fast forward over a year later, to present day, and I'm still struggling. We all went to our respective universities. I went to an engineering school in Missouri, and she went to study anthropology in North Carolina. Her boyfriend went to school in Iowa, and they didn't want to do long-distance so they broke up. Every now and then, though, we will all converge on our hometown for a couple of days and we will get to hang out together again. Each time we are together, I get reminded of how much I like her and how I never let it go. I never told her about my feelings. I talked to the other guy in our trio during that semester, but I never spoke to him about it after that. I never talked to anyone about it ever again.

Something that has crossed my mind, and something that I have seen in the comments on similar posts to this, is the possibility that she could like me back. And, I concede, that could be very true, since I never really asked her. But the way I see it, there are four potential outcomes to this scenario:

1. I tell her, she doesn't like me back, and I have to awkwardly deal with these unrequited feelings forever and she distances herself from our friend group and the group crumbles to the ground,
2. I tell her, she doesn't like me back, and I end up leaving the friend group because I can't handle the pain of being around her like that anymore,
3. She DOES like me back, but if we want to have a relationship it will have to be done long-distance across the country, which she is not willing to do (I have this on good authority), or
4. I don't do anything and I slowly drift away from the friend group because of the discomfort of being around her.

My biggest issue with all of this is that I want to to be in a happy relationship eventually, and I don't think I can fully devote myself to someone else if I'm still hung up on Charlotte. I think what I need to do is let go. My issue is that I don't know how to do that. I have tried everything I can think of to try to let go of my feelings, but I have failed every time I tried. Could anyone offer any guidance? If you were in a similar scenario and came out the other end, what did you do and what was the outcome?

&amp;#x200B;

81,"I've had a longstanding history with depression, suicidal ideation and anxiety, and as a result of a traumatic event last year I was recently diagnosed with PTSD. I am a college student currently living at home, and things have been rough. My parents are both suffering from depression (and my dad is also battling alcoholism) and my mom recently lost her job she's had over a decade due to the pandemic. 

I feel as if I have been trying to keep the peace between everyone in my household and have been trying my hardest to emotionally support my parents. I worry extremely for their physical and mental health. But my depression and suicidal thoughts have returned, which I believe is because of a combination of things. 

My best friend of 7 years and I recently broke up, my boyfriend is long distance and we've been fighting constantly as a result, and I am nearing the first anniversary of that traumatic event previously mentioned.

Because my parents currently have nearly no income, we're having issues with our health insurance, and I would not be able to see my previous therapist whom I adore. I spoke to her recently and she cannot help me financially besides lowering my visits to $50 a session.

I feel as if I am drowning. I do not know how to help myself. I have not had issues with my depression for about two years, and it has hit me full force now. I long for my old self and I feel as if my relationship with my boyfriend is on the verge of breaking. How can I get out of this hole? I want to be able to be there for everyone in my life and I cannot afford a breakdown like this. Any motivation or guidance would mean the world to me.

TL;DR I am going through a really rough time, my depression is back, and I cannot afford therapy. How do I help myself?

Edit: I have told my boyfriend about my current problems, and while he has been sympathetic, he has had a whirlwind of issues himself he is currently facing. And because we can't meet in person, it has been extremely difficult for me to express my feelings adequately without a fight errupting.

TW: p*dophila

When I was 15/16 at my summer camp basically everyone was crushing on this counselor. I’m terrified she’ll see this so we’ll just call her F. For context, this was a Girl Scout camp. Fun fact, the vast majority of teenagers still in Girl Scouts are some form of gay. Or at least in my experience. 

Anyway, F was basically a stereotypical butch lesbian so of course us idiot teens were falling over ourselves for her attention. I’m on the shyer side so I wasn’t so upfront about it with her, but with my fellow campers I wouldn’t shut up. Like embarrassingly wouldn’t shut up. Like,, constantly testing shitty pick up lines and jokingly calling her daddy like the cringy 16 year old attention starved  hormonal teenage I was.

Of course eventually my counselor got wind of this and shut it down. Mortifying conversation at the time but it was whatever. 

Cut to a year later and one of my best friends confides in me that her and several of her friends had been hit on or otherwise touched by her. At this point we’d grown up enough to realize that that was,,, not ideal considering she was about 26 if not older. 

My heart and stomach pretty much fell into my ass and I literally just, threw up. My mind was just racing with all the signs I should’ve seen and over analyzing everything I did. Like a specific memory of me laughing at a six year old girl who was trying to hit on her (thinking she was a guy) just churns my stomach. 

So, whatever right? Gross news but nothing happened to me, thank god. But then I started having really vivid nightmares, but not very often. I decided to work in the kitchen at the camp the next year knowing she wouldn’t be there as she was fired because of the allegations. 

Well, just my luck, the kitchen staff decides to meet her for dinner on our day off. Without letting me know because they were clueless. I swear I entered the restaurant and saw her sitting there and nearly pissed myself. I tried to sit as far away from her as I could but I knew that she knew that I had crushed on her as a kid and could feel her glancing at me no matter how hard I stayed silent and stared at the menu. 

I think I was honestly so shocked I didn’t process it until the next day where I just started violently crying out of nowhere. Like, worst panic attack of my life. 

Since then, the nightmares have gotten way worse. There are nights I literally wake up screaming like a character in a movie or something.  The strangest things are making me remember everything at random. It’s contributing to my anxiety depression and self harm and I don’t know what to do. 

It isn’t trauma because nothing actually happened to me. Does anyone have any suggestions? Anything I can do to make it stop?? I feel like it’s getting worse and worse each day. 


TLDR: Popular camp counselor who spawned a million crushes from campers including turns out to be a pedophile. Feels bad man. A year later we have dinner against my will. Feels really bad man. Nightmares and “flashbacks” ensue.  I’m constantly on edge. Please help me.",29Jul2020,1

85,"So i’ve been trying to figure out what’s wrong with me for the longest, because at this point it’s effecting my everyday life and my relationships. 

Feeling emotion for me is a complicated thing. I can never fully tell how i’m feeling or express how i’m feeling. And if i am feeling something such as happiness, i become hyper aware of how i’m feeling and it makes me uncomfortable. Emotions are just so complicated for me. Its kinda like i can’t fully feel emotions? It’s really hard to explain. I tend to base my emotions off how other people are feeling, and adapt to my s/o and what he does, the slang he uses etc... i’ve never truly been able to find myself, and figure myself out which sucks, because it’s like a constant loop hole of who am i? and i’m constantly adapting to people and situations instead of just doing me. 

I also get into fights because i don’t understand why i made someone upset by saying something , or by approaching a situation wrong. but i can’t ever realize that. The other person will be so upset, or mad and the situation will escalate so quickly and in the end i can never understand how i made that happen. Most of my fights with my mother and s/o start that way. and i’m constantly trying to fix myself but it feels like i can’t because i have a hard to understanding. I feel like it’s a mental thing, or maybe i’m crazy and i just need to fix myself lol.",29Jul2020,1

My sophomore year of high school, I was friends with this guy who abused me. I eventually told my therapist at the time about it. One of the things she told me was that I was enabling him. At the time I guess that helped me finally come to the decision to stop being friends with him. But looking back on it now, it feels kinda messed up to me. Enabling him, as though I was just allowing him to abuse me? Maybe I'm wrong, but it kinda sounds like victim-blaming.

93,"Marriages ask for a great deal of responsibility, love and a will to make it work, especially on days when everything around you are slowly slipping away and falling apart. It takes monumental efforts to keep a relationship at its peak and ensure that it doesn’t become stagnant. Marriage has its ups and downs and good and bad days – sometimes they can appear to be slipping away – a product of many years and in times like these the couple doesn’t necessarily want their marriage to end but a way to fix it. Attending [marriage counseling](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/family-therapy/) is one of the best ways to save a struggling marriage – but what else? Read on to find out more ways to fix problems within your marriage in a simple yet effective way. 

1. **Talk to marriage experts -** No, we don’t mean marriage counselors, we mean couples who are in healthy unions, unconditional marriages and have healthy bonds with their spouse. There must be something they must do to keep their marriage alive and kicking – try to understand what they do differently that you can weave into your marriage to bring about the same positive effects. 

2. **Put their happiness at par with yours** \- After many years of marriage, we sometimes tend to neglect our partner’s choices and happiness. Sometimes, we get carried away with making yourself happy and ensuring we feel comfortable, at the cost of their unhappiness and sacrifice. Putting your spouse’s happiness at par with yours will make them feel relevant and important and reassure them that you care about them. They will surely return the favor, and this can-do wonders for your marriage. 

3. **Love is the way to go** \- Love sure makes the world a better place, and it has the same effect on **your** marriage. Sometimes, all that is missing between a couple after many years of marriage is love. After a long haul, love becomes more of a choice than an emotion – and if both partners choose to love, they can save their marriage. Every [relationship advisor](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/family-therapy/) first recommends being kind, being understanding and most importantly loving your spouse unconditionally. 

4. **Put your marriage before everything else -** Jobs, children, families, lifestyles, chores – all these things can wait, especially when your marriage is suffering. In the mayhem of routines and sprinting across life to have it all, sometimes, you may leave your spouse behind. Take a break and rekindle your love and romance with your partner. Everything else will magically fall into place when you and your partner are in a happy place emotionally. 

5. **Start over -** Yes, we’re serious. Wouldn’t we all love to go back to being teenagers? We’re certain your spouse will be thrilled! Go on dates, kiss in public, binge watch movies together, hold hands, talk for hours – starting your relationship over can remind both you and your partner of the bond y’all shared back when life was simpler and this could rekindle your relationship better than you’d expect. 

6. **Take care of yourself -** Sometimes, an internal sense of unhappiness can pour into your marriage. If you’re experiencing an internal conflict that has nothing to do with your spouse, try overcoming that hurdle first so that it doesn’t sabotage your marriage. Seek the help of a counselor, attend [group counseling](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/group-therapy/), go to therapy – do whatever it may take for you to feel better within yourself, so that everything around you automatically becomes better – including your marriage.",29Jul2020,1
94,"Yesterday morning I just watched somebody blow half their fucking head off with a shotgun and I'm having some trouble coping. It's not bad when I'm focusing on something, maybe it pops into my head for a split second and then it's gone. When I'm just lying there by myself though I just keep seeing it over and over. I'm not sure if I need help since it's not completely taken over my thoughts. I might just still be in shock I don't know.",29Jul2020,1
95,"Hi Reddit. I’m reaching out for some help and support right now. I (25/F) want to help my boyfriend (29/m) so much. Obviously big trigger warning for mental health, PTSD, suicidal tendencies etc. For reference we live in the UK, we’ve been together 7 years. He’s always suffered bad with mental health but it’s getting to the point where I don’t know how to help anymore. 

Backstory is he’s had a shit start to life. He’s always suffered with mental health but when he was younger he was in the army and had a really bad car crash. A truck driver crashed into him head on and thankfully the worse he came out with was a broken jaw and bruises. But due to this, he lost his job and career with the army, as he couldn’t wear a helmet with a chinstrap, health and safety stuff etc. The crash went to court as it wasn’t his fault and he got a hefty pay out. He bought a house outright, and a car and helped his family out with some money and paid off debts, but he has no savings left what so ever. This was around 5 years ago. His family history isn’t great either (whos is?!) so he has also had to deal with family divorce, broken marriages, break ups, and catching his own dad with another woman as a kid. Lots of lovely traumatic things, huh. 

After his crash, he was diagnosed with PTSD, Depression and Anxiety. The army were awful with a lot of his recovery, he didn’t get much support etc. He had a course of CBT therapy for 2 weeks which he says was pretty useless and over the years he’s been on a few different anti-depressants but due to being on addictive pain killers through his recovery, he has a really bad relationship with medication, and because of this, he is addicted to smoking weed/marijuana. I don’t honestly mind him smoking as it helps him so much, but he has such a love hate relationship with it, and it is putting him into debt massively. But so far, it’s the only thing that helps him. But it’s sad that the only time he is truly calm and okay is when he is stoned. 

He works full time and gets a decent wage and although we are lucky enough to not have to pay any rent or a mortgage, he is in debt a lot due to some past unpaid bills and mainly due to his smoking habit. This leads to a LOT of stress and anxiety, obviously. After he has paid all his bills and debts off, sometimes his £1.3k paycheck has gone in 2 weeks and we are scraping by waiting for my pay day (and I’m still on furlough atm due to COVID) 

The main thing is, he cannot process stress at all. His mental health is a constant rollercoaster of doing okay, keeping on track, and then one stressful or small thing happens and he hits rock bottom again. He has absolutely no help, other than smoking weed. He is terrified of meds I think, as the ones he’s tried before have made him feel “like a zombie” and he has no patience to give them enough time. These meds have impacted his previous jobs too where he’s had to have time off, and has lost jobs or quit as they have treated him like shit, and he is in a decent job he likes right now, so he scared of that losing that too. He refused outright therapy when I asked him if he’d consider it. I assume it was from his bad experience of CBT in the past. His mindset is very “no one cares, everyone just leaves me to rot” etc. He’s a very angry, hurt person. 😔 He also suffers with incredibly bad sleep, doctors think he has sleep apnea but due to COVID he can’t get a sleep study until it’s safe to stay in hospital, which obviously also massively affects his MH. 

I think he wants help but I just don’t where to start. He hasn’t seen a mental health doctor for years. People have said “he will accept help when he is ready” but he’s hit rock bottom so many times it’s terrifying me. Where is the line? When does it get so bad that he finally accepts help? Is this not bad enough?! He has never self harmed or hurt himself but he has done things like drove to bridges and just stood there and then left again. He is suicidal, but he wouldn’t hurt himself, if that makes sense? He doesn’t want to die. But he’s so fed up. He gets so angry sometimes he just smashes stuff up at home - putting his fist through doors and his computer desk and has thrown and smashed his phone more time’s than I can count - and he’s never had a full on fight but his road rage and anger scares me too. Sometimes I think he’s gonna get into fights or be arrested or something crazy due to his rage. I’ve never felt scared of him and he’s never ever been violent towards me or anyone close to him. I know his anger is mostly hurt and pain that he just doesn’t know how to process. He constantly just expects bad things to happen and sometimes he cannot see anything positive in any situation. 

He’s such a complex being and other than trying to get him to a doctor or therapist (which he won’t - even though he cries out for help every day) I honestly do not know what to do anymore. 

Aside from this, he is a funny, amazing, passionate, incredible human being who I want to spend the rest of my life with and I’m not giving up on him any time soon. On his good days, life is so fun and we make plans and go out and have a great time together. We’ve built a little life for ourselves and his issues make him sound like a terrible person but he’s not. He’s just stuck in a system. We are only young and I want him to see that life is full of great things and it isn’t just a ball of stress, finances and bad things. He is more than just his mental health but he needs a helping hand so so bad. He has a lot of trauma that has never been addressed that impacts a lot of him day to day life. If I’m honest, it does affect my own mental health and I suffer bad with anxiety but not solely due to him. I’m just an anxious bean haha. But again, he isn’t a lost cause and I refuse to give up on him just because he has some mental health issues. Who hasn’t these days, I guess. 

I think I just wanted to rant but also, I’ve tried to contact local mental health services but without his permission (which I have verbally) or help or him being there they can’t do much. They obviously can’t discuss his health history with me due to patient confidentiality even tho I know it all. Our local doctors surgery are always so busy and they aren’t very ‘clued up’ on mental health. He’s made appointments before in the past and they’ve been changed, cancelled and this obviously massively disappoints him and he just never wants to make another appointment. Going private is expensive and hard. His family don’t really help much at all. They support us and are there to chat but sometimes they just don’t understand much. 

Please, what the hell can I do? Where do I start? Is it even worth me reaching out to therapists etc if he’s not even ready to speak to them? He won’t accept meds for very good reasons mentioned above but i just wish he would try some others, as they may help? Would they? He doesn’t have many stress outlets at all. He plays PC games and chats to his friends and takes our dog for a walk and that’s about it on the hobby side of things, he used to do music and be in bands and that was a great outlet but he doesn’t do that any more either. He doesn’t go to the gym, as he has a physical job and he doesn’t meditate or do anything like that. 

Please, any suggestions are fully welcome and I’ll answer any questions. If you read it all, thank you for listening.",29Jul2020,1
96,"Boyfriend is experiencing an intense psychotic episode, his first one. His main delusion is that this reality isn't real and his mind is trapped in a simulation. These thoughts have been going on for around 3 weeks, getting more intense every day. He knows logically this probably isn't a simulation, but today it intensified to the point I'm not sure he could tell the difference. His main symptom is terror and panic. I couldn't talk him down and I'm the only one he trusts and the only one he thinks is maybe real.

Tonight is the worst it's ever been and he agreed to go to the ER. They took him back though and wouldn't let me come. Once he found out I couldn't come he was even more panicked but at that point they weren't just going to let him leave. Now I feel incredibly guilty that he is all alone in there and I, the only person he thinks is real, can't talk to him AND I'm the one who suggested he go in the first place.

I'm feeling incredibly guilty, scared in exacerbating his condition, and really worried I broke his trust. Was this the wrong decision? Will he be OK?",29Jul2020,1
97,"Hi. if anyone is in or around my area (stl, MO) i need help finding reliable inpatient units. my last hospitalization has given me serious trust issues with inpatient facilities. i'm scared to reach out to them for help nowadays.

I've been hospitalized inpatient 3 times, but i self mutilated today during an anxiety attack and i feel unstable. I'm in st. louis, missouri. i've only ever been to the St. Joseph Wentzville facility. 

my first 2 times i was adolescent unit, and the staff cared a lot more about the patients and helped me learn to somewhat work through my flashbacks, panic attacks, nightmares, etc on my own. once i turned 18, i ended up going inpatient a month after my 18th and ended up in the adult unit. 

I had a HORRIBLE experience in the adult unit. the techs talked about me to other staff about my past in the adolescent unit and my self harm and breakdowns, the techs were breaking my confidentiality by yelling and scolding me about decisions i made outside the hospital (information they got from my family) whilst in the main area with all the other patients and when I asked the actual nurses if i could tell someone in charge about it, they brushed it off and didn't care. i left the unit feeling the way i felt when i went in.

98,"Pleas excuse my wording, I'm not native. 

So, I'm fairly young. I'm 22 years old and have been diagnosed with Burnout back in 2016.

My family is very success-focused and my mom pushed me in such an unhealthy way. It already started in kindergarten. I attended pre-school since I was 3, went to elementaryschool at 5 years old and honestly, it's been hell.

I have many memories of myself learning for hours on end at home. My mom made me write around 4 book pages and if I did a single mistake, I had to start from the beginning. Every day. I once brought a friend because her mom knew of my success in school and wanted my mom to tutor her. The day ended with my friend crying hysterically and wanting to go home.

(Disclaimer: I'm not holding a grudge against my mom. I know her history and she just wanted for her children to not live the life that she had to live through. Although she did it in all the wrong ways, I see where she was coming from and decided to accept what has happened and let it go.)

So, I was a really smart kid, teachers called me gifted, which motivated my mom to go harder and harder. That's when I started struggling in school, because I was so exhausted, I just couldn't use my potential. I had a lot of breakdowns from all the pressure and my mental health began crumbling. My mom didn't notice, thought I was slacking and went harder on me.

At age 17 I had to move out. Not gonna talk about the circumstances, but yeah. I lived on my own, had to work after school until 1 am and that went on for months. 

Cue to me dropping out of high school and checking myself into a psychiatric clinic. I couldn't do it anymore. I was so exhausted. The littlest piece of work made me break down.

For the last 4 years, I tried working but wasn't able to keep a job. I just got so overwhelmed. Almost 2 years ago, I met a psychologist that helped me big time. She didn't try to explain to me what happened inside of me, but made me discover it with her help. I believe I wouldn't be this far mentally, if it wasn't for her.

Yesterday, I got a job. I have to work 5 days a week, but only 4 hours a day. I can work more hours later on, if I feel like I can do it mentally. If not, the 4 hours are totally okay for the company.

And for the first time I am not scared and don't even feel near a breakdown only thinking about it.

I feel ready. And I'm so happy about that, I just needed to share.

I'm gonna take it slow, but I hope I can finally go to work and live a normal life :')",29Jul2020,1
99,"To start off, I'm a good lucking, very smart and kind guy, pretty much what people always want out of a person, the problem? I suffer from anxiety, depression, and may be even in for schizophrenia, since a very close cousin has it.
 
I'm a nice guy and I know it but I've always hated myself for everything, to the point of just wanting to be normal and not being smart, nice, or anything. I'm someone that is just disconnected, in a way. I am always anxious for what people think of me, it's all I have since I hate myself, even if I know most people like me, and it gets worse since I usually have a lot of trouble making myself clear. Always saying stuff that needs too much insight or that people just won't understand because it is made in the way that my mind and my mind only works. 

As you might see, all I can think about is myself, somehow, and I realize that. I have always been too needful for attention, and my girlfriend, she gives all she's got to me, and I really appreciate it. I love her, but we've been a little disconnected for unrelated reasons. She's the person I can say I love the most, and I want to keep it that way, the only thing is that I really need to love myself, instead of keeping the selfhatred, but it's too hard.

Ever since I was a kid I was a cast out, born and raised in Colombia, I've always been the smartest everywhere I go, and my ego is built on it but it's worthless. I was promoted to grades when I was very little, and had to go through school with people two years older than me. That and my innate problem for communication made it very rough. Now, it's pretty much the same, just that age ain't an excuse no more. I wish I could talk to someone and they could understand what I mean when I say it, yet I'm very bad at doing exactly that, and I know there's no way someone will be able to do it either, but I feel extremely lonely because of that. I have always wanted to commit suicide, ever since I was a kid, but I know I won't do it because somehow I still hope, but it is so lonely here, I have someone I love, I truly do, but I hate myself and can't fathom a single moment of silence being alone, without something to distract me, take me away from my thoughts. I get scared thinking of how without something technical or entertaining my brain goes away into a dark well full of sadness and despair, that just keeps going down, into the abyss. I genuinely don't want to be alone, I am terrified of my own mind, and don't want to be alone, but there's no one that can understand that and stay with me all the time, it's not like claustrophobia where you just stay out of enclosed spaces and are okay, I am scared of myself and I can't escape, but everyone has their own burden, and all I can express is dumb gibberish in the ocean, waiting for a boat that no one has, holding on for mere hope, knowing that staying with my mouth over the water is just gonna make me suffer more. 

I know this is probably hard to read, or confusing, I usually get lost in my mind before I finish even a sentence sometimes. If you read this, thanks for paying attention to me. I just wish I could stop acting as if I was Atlas carrying the weight of the world and for once seeing a way to drop some of the things I bear consciously as if to punish myself for not being what I wish I was.

Again, thanks for reading.",29Jul2020,1

101,"So this happened about 15 minutes ago. I'm a 20 year old male. I had just parked the car at home (after visiting my father's home) and was in a rush to work. As I got out of the car and was walking between the apartments, I saw a group of kids (about 12-14 year olds) throwing the cap of one very upset looking kid at one another baiting him to run for it as they pass it between one another. I felt this strength to do something so I walk directly into the middle and put my hand out for the cap as they in a state of fear give it to me. I grab it and give it back to the kid and as I begin walking away, I turned around and sorta scolded them to never bully anyone again as they reply that they weren't bullying. I turn around in anger and walk off and begin to start crying but silently so nobody notices. After this event unfolded I felt disappointed in myself for not approaching them in a calm manner and telling themselves to better themselves and that they are good kids and can be even better.

104,"For my whole life I've been very antisocial. ASPD levels of antisocial imo. I have no real need for human contact and in fact I prefer solitude. I have legitimately zero motivation to do anything. Hell, I've been meaning to post this for literal months but I just don't. I also think that my mental age has stunted. I'm 18 but I feel that in some ways I'm mentally where a 14 year old should be. This is most obvious in my ""hobbies"", which consists mostly of video games, netflix, youtube and doing literally nothing. I also experience a lot of unusual and repetitive thoughts, and sometimes I can't do anything to stop them. Ive gotten so desperate before that I started slamming my head with a book. Other times it's as simple as saying ""No, stop that"" to myself. While the thoughts aren't necessarily dangerous, the conclusions they lead to often are. The best way I can describe them is heady or psychedelic. To clarify, I've never taken a psychedelic but the things psychonauts talk about realizing while tripping are just every day thoughts for me. I will regularly sit there for 10, 20 minutes, hell even an hour sometimes and just think about why I'm alive, how my body is nust a meat suit, how reality is obviously what our bodies present to us, how odd and completely ridiculous our behaviors, rules and a lot of society is. Just very out there stuff. Another thing that I find odd is my lack of ""self"". I often (50-75% of the time) have full conversations in my head, where I refer to myself as we. In fact I use the pronoun ""we"" as often or more than I say ""I"", at least when I'm in my own head. I've talked about all of this to therapists before and I've even been to a mental ward once, but everyone so far has said it's just depression and anxiety. I do have an uncle with schizophrenia and my family as a whole is mentally unstable, with problems ranging from extreme drug addiction, OCD and Bipolar to narcissism, pedophilia and debatably sadism.

My family has been quite optimistic about the choice I have made. But recently, I felt burdened by what's going to come next. I am afraid that I may not be physically and emotionally ready for a rigorous training. I only seem to update my parents about what I accomplished each day, but I refuse to air out negative feelings because I don't want them to worry about me. I also have kind of lost contact with close friends because they are now busy with their individual lives. It has been two days since I have been holding on to this feeling. I have been oversleeping lately, probably as a coping mechanism. I'm just scared how long I will be able to do this.",29Jul2020,1

Hello everyone I hope everyone is doing well because all of y'all are lovely people who deserve it :) As you might've already guessed I come from a family that doesn't believe in mental illnesses and everytime I listen to them and see how they persuade me into not believing in it too I feel like I'm rotting on the inside and have to face all my pain and suffering alone because no one ever listens to me let alone have the slightest bit of respect to what I say. I try to save up money but my allowance is only enough for my college life and I'm already someone who doesn't party and shit and all my money goes to food, stationary for classes and occasionally some clothes but I haven't bought anything new for a while now since I'm trying to save up money.

I'm planning on speaking to school therapists since they are free at least in the hope that they might direct me to someone. But honestly, I don't have much money. I'm unable to work because of school (which is one of the main reasons why I'm utterly miserable but that's a whole another long post) and I can't ask for more money because my parents are already paying my tuition. I can't even imagine telling them I spent it on therapy they'd disown me or smth. Also one of the reasons why it seriously gets to me is when they have to audacity to tell me that ""I don't tell my serious problems to them and then I will paying for a complete stranger to tell them to? That's stupis"" (not exact quote but yea you get the gist). Not that I come from a poor family we're almost middle class and I never had to worry about finances when I was little, I had a almost decent childhood. I don't understand why it is so hard for them to understand that:

I AM NOT MAKING THIS UP. NO IT IS NOT ONLY IN MY HEAD AND NO I CANNOT SOLVE IT ON MY OWN. AND FOR LAST FUCKING TIME NO IM NOT FUCKING DOING THIS TO MYSELF OR RESTRICTING MYSELF ON PURPOSE.

I would really appreciate some advice on how to break this cycle and am wondering whether others experience this too

Things can effect my emotions, but without much external stimuli, I feel nothing. Most people seem happy without reason. They just seem happy without anything making them happy. If something isn't making me happy or sad, I'm neither of those things. Some people seem naturally happy, I am naturally blank. Is this an issue? Is this normal? Is this depression or anxiety?

119,"A few months ago I got very scared because I turned 15, I know it might sound stupid but hear me out. I got very, very worried of living a life of working till I’m dead. I tried to figure something out. I ultimately decided on trying producing music and maybe one day having it as a career, better than going down a career path I don’t care for (I am still open to other options). I got into it and I learned a lot. A bit frustration for me was I was focused on money and fame for a little. I constantly fought myself. I have dealt with ocd in the past and it’s like my mind was saying “you are only in it for the Money and for an easy life”. That’s where some of the initial frustration came from. I felt an impending sense of doom over me for the last month or two since I came to the realization that one day I’m going to be old or one day working a job I don’t care for. A part of the fear come from seeing my dad who works a ton, and doesn’t seem very content with his life. But maybe I am judging him too much. I did enjoy producing tho. I’m starting to consider the fact though that maybe my fear of living a work until retirement life just sounded horrible and I wanted to find a hobby I could turn into a career. Another things came up which had me worried maybe I do have some sort of mentos problem. A week ago I was cool making beats and stuff. But recently I started eating way more.  Lay in bed all day and browse YouTube. I can’t even open the producing app, it feels like a chore, if I push myself a little I can go on a walk but I really just can’t produce. I tried making. A beat today, it fell flat. I’m pretty sure creating music would be my thing. But why am I not enjoying it? Maybe my sleep schedule? Any Input is appreciated.",29Jul2020,1
120,"For context I’m on the autism spectrum, and I absolutely detest being touched, even by my family. There are about 3 people allowed to loosely grab my arm, and one person who can just grab me casually without too much care. I’ve had a history of randomly punching/ elbowing people who have decided to hug me without warning. Usually you need to have a very close emotional bond to be allowed.

So, as I was trying to get to sleep (3:00am ish) I was suddenly met with the feeling of every incidence of being accidentally touched. It felt horrible. I kept going back to every single moment, and feeling the hands on my skin, and it absolutely terrified me. I would’ve gone on my phone for stimulation of some sort, but in was in the other room, so I turned my lamp on, and sat there, for four hours, biting me nails. Eventually I fell asleep but was plagued by nightmares and only got around 5 hours worth.

This morning, I feel absolutely sick, as though I was really touched and hugged by all those people once again, and I’ve stopped eating, and just zoned out generally. Whenever somebody has put there arm too close to me, I jerk away, and they get very offended.

122,"So, I am a 21F, currently a third year student of a Pharmacy school. Last few years, I have been dealing with several issues that is hunting me down 

- I don't have any friend at University. (Not even had many at school but was little bit more social than now) I mostly sit alone in the corner.

- I talked to few people but things get awkward. (I have a sense that I might have severe social anxiety, but I am not really scared of the people to communicate with, it might be that I have a social reluctant behavior)

- I had a best friend of four years, but recently I have partially cut ties with her which was only based on texting). Because, it seemed like she was behaving to be the guardian of solving my issues+ flooding her own way of solving, refuting what I wanted to say. In summary, I was done with her toxic positivity trait which made me felt dismissed. However, that's another story. 

- I am growing a withdrawal attitude from people, from my everyday work sometimes.

- however, my energy curve is like the action potential graph. Sometimes I can study for hours after hours, deeply absorbed into books and stuff. And sometimes I can't move myself to check my emails.

- I feel very scared all the time for no reason.

- I have lost 9 kg in last two years.

- I have a problem of fainting for no reason and when I wake up I find myself screaming to get myself back. Then my head hurt for days. This happened nine times in last three years.

- My little sister died 10 years ago and I can't still get over it.

- Five years ago, I had a narcissistic best friend who destroyed me every way possible. But I cut tied from her four years ago, however, she still tried to contact eg my birthday on April but I didn't reply. Guess, I am over her for good.

- I was never been loved 

- I am a disappointment to my family for not being able to enter a top University but still I am trying to cope up with the academic.

- I can't concentrate on class. I can't sit for a long class without hurting my brain.

- I belong to the high performers in my class but I have low self esteem and maybe two bottles of imposter syndrome.

- I thought of meeting a counselor or therapist but in my country they don't have a very positive reputation rather infamous for misdiagnosis and prescribing medications for profit!

I don't know if these are hinting any mental issues or not. Or neither I know if I am breaking any laws here. But it would be highly appreciated if I am shown any direction or anything. Have a nice day.",29Jul2020,1

129,"I've been to several doctors and tried to explain what my issue is in between fentanyl/crack binges (which end up as a kind of last resort) and they just act like they don't know what I'm talking about...

they say ""are you depressed?""... well how am I supposed to know?

I become more and more obsessed with suicide until I can sublimate that in huge life-changing fentanyl binges (which I've somehow survived practically against my will) because I've basically promised my mom not to actually suicide (while she's alive anyway)

after these binges, I go through obviously the intense withdrawal phase, then after the ""low month"" I get about 3-5 months of a grace period where I feel fine (which is an absolute blessing! the only thing that I want!)

and then it returns, this overwhelming feeling of almost like a pain all over my body, an aggressively low self esteem (meaning while I recognize that I should have at least realistically low self esteem about many things, the ""facts"" seem to hit me a lot harder than anyone else, for example if I see my reflection when I look at my phone it can literally ruin a whole day for me, the ""pain"" that I mentioned kind of fills my ugly face, if I can describe it that way)

I also find it impossible to focus on anything and often end up just lying in my bed staring at the roof waiting for the day to pass...

I tell them this and they just seem puzzled or even slightly annoyed with me for not knowing all the lingo (""depressed"" ""anxiety"" etc, sorry I don't have a copy of the DSM-V!)

does anyone else have a similar experience? I'm about two weeks past my ""grace period"" and am trying to avoid another cycle (which I literally cannot afford this time, and therefore things are going to get really bleak really quickly)

I get so focused on trying to breath and get back to my car as quickly as possible so I can take it off, that I start getting tunnel vision and can’t focus on what people are saying. My city has now implemented the ordinance and my work has as well. I have been constantly anxious and stressed at work and sneak maskless breaths whenever possible. Any time I tell anyone that I can’t breath, I get told, “oh that’s bs. Masks don’t reduce oxygen enough to cause problems” or “you’re just trying to make excuses” I’ve also tried 4 different masks now of various thicknesses. It seems the thickness doesn’t matter as much. It’s more about something covering my face. I’m seriously wondering If I have some degree of claustrophobia or something. I don’t know. I also get anxiety in heavy traffic and busy stores, if that can help pinpoint what the issue is.

I’m also very much a personal freedom type of person and so I don’t like mandates. You might say I don’t like constraints in general. When the government mandates something like this it makes me feel like I am not trusted to do the right thing on my own and so I am threatened with being locked in a cage for not complying. That alone causes anxiety and makes me feel spiteful. Yesterday, I went to get my girlfriend coffee at the gas station and didn’t realize I wasn’t supposed to enter a certain area of the store. (They won’t let you fill up coffee yourself and didn’t want anyone but employees in the drink area) And was apparently asked to move outside of that area, But I couldn’t hear what the lady was saying as I was just trying to get my stuff and get out as quick as possible so I could breath, so this lady ended up snapping at me. I got home and had an emotional breakdown. This is now the third time I’ve had a breakdown and I am so exhausted from this whole ordeal and there is no escape or support from any of it.

134,"I find people generally quite annoying, I'm not the most sociable guy unless you get to know me . So to be driving around or sitting parked in lay bys, the things people do always kind of confuse distract and annoy me . Holding eye contact the entire time you drive past each other that's a weird one . constantly gazing at you while your preoccupied parked up and making a phone call, 

I don't have social anxiety but it gets a point people need to relax and show some respect. I don't want to sit and have a staring contest Everytime I look up 

I'm weird about these things personally I like my space , and other people's anxieties and need to control there environment  , is exhausting. I'm quite comfortable in mine , I'm quite comfortable to  drive straight past vehicle in motion and looking straight ahead without any acknowledgement. parking up, taking a glance at my surroundings  and then leaving this person alone. 

I don't have social anxiety or anti social personality but I like things to be chill .

One pet peeve is when your driving towards someone there going round a bend they speed up out of anxiety and become territorial almost crossing the road markings.

 all anxiety riddled behaviours people do, its exhausting. They play it off the exact way there personality is, some people will drive to the edge of the road in a jeep and giggle , there actually anxious and there giggle is another self defense mechanism.

People are exhausting.

wastes so much of my energy, because I'm easily distracted but generally comfortable in my environment, I could drive past a bunch of stone faced dead pans all day long and be generally pretty happy. Because there calm collected and deal with there own rather than trying to manipulate there environment 

Call me antisocial but I like solitude even on the road . Some people are so caught up in anxiety or trying to cause anxiety, To feel better on the road.

144,"I (23f) have an abusivo mother. I’ve been drinking everyday for two weeks (Sober yesterday) since that situation happened. I almost left and signed a lease but had a huge emotional night with my mom where we decided I’d move into the garage (she’s ask her drunk brother to leave) and I can have my space. 

No. 

My sister (24f) never addressed her daddy issues or opened up in therapy. She tried to get pregnant in her last few relationships so no surprise she ran off with a man she knew for a couple months and ghosted my mom for weeks while fighting with the entire family. For some reason my mom doesn’t see any of that and when my sister asked to move back in, pregnant and with her boyfriend who also has a preteen son, I was pissed to hear that my mom and I would share downstairs and I’d have no space. I lost it. I spiraled yesterday’s and Sunday and I got really drunk and almost fucked these guys I never ever wanted to speak to again and just acting out of character. 

Luckily I have a psychiatry appointment so that I can get a diagnosis and treatment but I hate my life. I can’t leave. My mom made me feel so guilt for almost signing that lease so when I showed up the next day- I was looking for reasons to bail. The deposit changed last minute and the landlord was acting very weird (asking me to pay for that weeks rent- someone’s clothes were in the room with pillows and blankets) so it’s good I didn’t sign but man- I hate my life.

146,"Since having kids, my mental state has deteriorated significantly. I am consumed by depression, anxiety, apathy, a sense of being out of control, and overall feeling dead inside. I don't believe these feelings have anything to do with my kids themselves, but the weight of parenting with mental illness and raising children in this God forsaken world. 

Everything upsets me. Everything takes a toll on me. Even when things are ""distant"" or not directly affecting me or my family, I feel them wholeheartedly and cannot cope with the fact that there's nothing I can do to change things. Ignoring my triggers seems irresponsible (ignorance is not bliss when you're talking about removing yourself from certain things like understanding politics, social issues, etc). I have removed myself from social media and do not consume mainstream news, so my exposure is relatively low, but I'm still highly affected. 

It's been 16+ years since I've been diagnosed with major depression and generalized anxiety, a year since my diagnosis of POTS, fibromyalgia, CFE, and bipolar 2. I have yet to find any regimen to help me manage my symptoms, in fact, they are getting worse. That alone is incredibly disheartening. I cannot continue knowing that I may not ever achieve recovery. I feel like I'm drowning, seeing other people enjoy the waters while I'm gasping for air. 

Sometimes I feel like I should have never gotten married or had kids. I am a complete burden and am single handedly ruining our family (the relationship between my husband and I is more like one between friends, and my kids are getting old enough to pick up on my instability). Looking back, I have always broken off relationships after 1-3 years at which point I felt like I could no longer keep up a positive, healthy facade. 

Also in the past few years, I'm realizing more and more how much of a lie I have lived. I never lived for myself, always staying inside the lines so I wouldn't disappoint my parents, even when they would have no idea what I was up to. In college, I studied what I pledged to as a freshman, even though my heart wasn't in it - I didn't want to upset my parents with major changes and additional tuition. I ended up with a degree I will never use with completely untransferable ""skills"". The jobs (3 in 4 years) I had before becoming a stay at home mom proved that painfully - constantly failing at projects and duties because I had no idea what I was doing (I could BS through interviews like a pro to land the jobs). When I have the opportunity to return to the workforce, I'll be starting from the very bottom, along with high school graduates, trying to learn skills I should have learned in college. 

Trying to keep myself busy and find a sense of independence as a SAHM, I fell victim to an MLM, which I said I would never do. It was justified because the product was educational, I promised I wouldn't be an annoying hun, and I could feel some worth by bringing in some cash. In the process, I lost myself further, damaged relationships, and ghosted out without one fellow ""boss babe BFF"" to reach out to check on me. Fuck MLMs and their toxic practices. 

I feel like I'm going crazy. I can't deal with the amount of emptiness I feel. I don't know who I am or what I want. I don't even have the luxury of finding out. Life makes me feel like a prisoner. I feel manipulated, tossed around, taken advantage of, disconnected. I'm afraid of one day leaving my family, or my family leaving me, but either one would be justified. Things feel meaningless and hopeless.",29Jul2020,1
147,"I hate it to go to bed and sleep, because I know I will be dreaming like everyday.

The dreams are usually a bit weird, but all in all positive. I dream about 2-5 times a night, depending how often I wake up during the night. I remember some parts of the dream I just woke up and somehow I want to remember everything and need to write it down. That happens 2-5 times a night, and I am so pissed off if I can't remember the dream.

That is also my problem, I don't want to get through this each night :(

I would like to just sleep without waking up during the night and remember nothing, so I have nothing to write down. Interestingly on vacation I had this every single day. I was walking about 11km each day and doing interesting stuff all day. At night I just fell into the bed and slept instantly and never woke up during the night. Since I am back everything is again monotonic. Nothing interesting happens and I maybe walk 1-3km a day. 

Is there a word for that what I am suffering from?",29Jul2020,1
148," It's really hard for me to feel emotions. There are some that I feel really easily and quite often, like anxiousness. Then there are other emotions that I don't really feel much at all, like happiness. Usually I'm in a mood of ""I'm okay. Not in a bad mood, not in a good mood. Just okay."" Until something happens or until someone says something that sets off a switch for a specific emotion. Most of the time it's something that a person will say to me that immediately gives me a feeling of anxiety in my stomach. But then there are times that I question how true all of this is. Because sometimes I can't tell if I'm actually happy or not. Like when I'm in a situation that should make me happy, but I can't quite tell if I just don't understand what it feels like when I'm happy or if I don't feel happy at all in that moment. I don't know how much sense that makes, but I can't think of another way to describe it... 

 Then there's the problem of me lying about my emotions to people. I'll lie about being sad or having panic attacks just for the attention from my best friend. Even when she already gives me so much attention to begin with. While I do have panic attacks every now and then, I don't have them as often as I tell her I do. It feels weird to say what I think is wrong with me when it comes to getting attention because I'm scared to blame others for my problems, but I have a feeling it has to do with my parents kind of ignoring me for my niece. I'm 16 so I still live with my parents. Nothing is wrong with our relationship, it's just that I feel like they care more for their grandchild than they do their own son. They give all of their attention to her and end up replacing their attention to me with buying me things and taking me places. They would literally do anything for this little 3 year old girl, but when it comes to doing things for me, they do some things and act like it's the biggest inconvenience. I do so many things around the house (i.e. clean, take complete care of our 3 dogs, 20 chickens, and 2 goats, cook dinner some nights, and a lot of other random chores), but they still act like I don't do anything for them. They just helped me buy my first car and I already know that they're going to hold it against me for so long, like they have before when helping me with bigger purchases. But I know if my niece was my age and they did that for her, they wouldn't give her a rough time about it at all. 

 I can't tell if that is the reason why I have such a big thirst for attention or if it's just my personality that is causing all of this. I don't want to be so clingy and needy for attention from my best friend because I know it gets annoying. I don't know what I should do to fill that hole of needing someone to talk to me or notice me though. I just wish my parents would actually take me to a therapist instead of saying they will and never doing it.

152,"I run, exercise, eat healthy, I have a routine. As a result, I'm still feel nothing. I watch comedy shows and laugh in the moment but when it's over the emptiness crawls back in. I have an Ace score of 5. Not as bad but not good either. I think this emptiness is a result from the struggles I endured. I can't remember being happy even as a kid. I have constant suicidal thoughts, self-harm all which have been non-stop for years. I try to mask it but I'm led to question "" when does temporary meet forever?"" When all I've known was sadness and emptiness. I really try to hold on and tell myself that I can beat this but it seems like a pointless war in which I'm bound to lose.

154,"I’m naturally tall-ish and slim, and put some effort into my appearance (gym, food, clothing, hair, skincare, etc). — I must note, I eat a good amount of food, 2500-3000 cal a day to keep some feminine look while I work out, I don’t look skinny or eating-disordered, just slim. 

My best friend, who has a lot of issues with her appearance, cut me off a few months ago in a really bad (mean) way. She is self proclaimed “short, fat and ugly” even though I don’t see this fatness or ugliness and always always try to make her feel confident and good about herself in every way I can. And she always told me that I’m the most supportive friend to her. 

Around 6 months ago, she completely cut me out of her life and started saying kinda rude things about me to our other friends but in this weirdly manipulative self-victimizing way. I think what really “triggered” her is that she thought that other people were friendlier with me because I’m ‘“prettier than her’”.

At the end she told me that my body triggered her to become severely bulimic. 

I am seriously lost as to what to do. She was the only person in my life I could call a friend and now she has just cut me off forever. I can’t control the things trigger her about me and I am between feeling so guilty and feeling pissed that I gave her an ED. 

What can I do to make things better between us?? I miss her so much and I just want her to be ok.",29Jul2020,1
155,"Hi! This is my first post here. I’m 16 and diagnosed with severe depression at 15. I take meds and have therapy every week. Even still, it’s been very difficult taking care of myself. More specifically getting out of bed and brushing my teeth. I’m so ashamed to admit this but I can go so long without doing it. I used to brush my teeth twice a day every night but as my depression has been worsening I go days without brushing or flossing. I’m so scared to go to a dentist because I’m so ashamed. I have nice teeth so I don’t have any cavities or missing teeth but I do have plaque and tarter build up from lack of care and possibly gingivitis. I’m so scared of walking in there and being belittled and shamed by my dentist for the state my mouth is in that part of me would rather not even go but I know they’ll just get worse if I don’t. Should I try and get rid of plaque and tarter by myself before my appointment? I have no idea how to but I’ll try if it saves myself the shame. What should I do?

I've started despising my work which I used to like. Even entertainment options which used to rejuvenate me in the past after work have started failing now.

159,"I'm not saying wanting to live isn't worthwhile. But yesterday was the day I planned to kill myself... And my mom made it a great day. She knew what I was planning and looked in my eyes before she went to bed, told me to wake her up if I decided to sneak out during the night, and told me that we'd have another great day tomorrow. 

And so I decided to live, and I don't have another set plan to kill myself. I'm in a unique type of pain today... The pain of knowing that I'm going to have to wait this out rather than escape it. But you know what? I could kill myself any day, but I don't, because that'd be a waste of potential experiences I could have. 

What's helping me today is to put off suicide. I want to see my girlfriend when the lock down ends, I want to go to Ottawa with my mom in a few weeks, I want to go back to me and my best friend's favourite bubble tea joint. Why commit to not living anymore when there's still potential to have happy moments?

165,For some background I have been suicidal at various points in my life. I struggle to cope with even minor stress. So about 6 months ago my than pregnant wife went to a car dealership for a service and were aproached by a salesman about trade in. We initially declined but eventually caved because of the pressure they put on us. Our fault but it doesnt end there. Several weeks later it really started to set in what happened and I began to panic. I was about to have a baby and just stupidly bought this car. I couldnt sleep. I couldnt eat. I was crying screaming breaking things. After my daughter was born I sunk even further into depression. My wife had lost her job to covid and we were living in my sister's bedroom to ease the financial strain. We were constantly fighting. I was having constant panic attacks and became even more depressed and threatened suicide. It scared my wife to the point she sent me to a behavioral hospital for a week. I keep looking back and wondering how somthing so stupid like a bad car loan could snowball so out of control so quickly. Im so ashamed and embarrassed of how I acted and what happened. Its a strange story for sure but Im really just looking for perspective. Does anyone have any similar experiences or thoughts?,29Jul2020,1
166,"Wow, the health care system is truly screwed up. I spent five hours today calling every psychiatrist on my insurance list and not a single one has been accepting patients for multiple reasons.

I am so fed up with trying to find a psychiatrist for my anxiety. I have dealt with some severe life changes in the past couple years and have realized that my mental health is worse than I thought, and subsequently tried to find a psychiatrist after talking to multiple counselors. 

Finally, when I did get through to someone, they told me that my mental illness “wasn’t severe enough” for them to help me with. It’s like it’s either severe depression or nothing, there’s no in between. I am starting to see how people can feel so hopeless in trying to find help that they give up and it gets worse from there.

I’m sure there are plenty of others dealing with this and all I can say is wow. This is screwed up.",29Jul2020,1
167,"So, I started seeing my social worker about 4 months ago. At the beginning I felt like it could help me, but more the time pass more I feel like it's just making my depression and anxiety worst. I feel like garbage for over a week after every appointment, I feel like I can't talk because she's the only one talking when we are together and when I try to say something, she interrupts me and she's rude.
I'm kind of annoyed by that because I waiting over 6 months to have one, and I would have probably waited longer if I didn't go to the emergency room and told them that I couldn't deal with my mental health anymore and wanted to die. I don't know what to do honestly, can someone help",29Jul2020,1
168,"Yesterday, my sister came all the way from California to stay with my family (me, my two brothers, and my m and d) for a few months. This is the first time our whole family's been together since winter break. I was really excited about her coming home because, after a few months of socially distancing with the same 4 people, I was pretty much sick of them. But when she came home, and I don't know if this was a coincidence, I just had a major mood swing. I don't know why. Sure the coronavirus has been hard on me, but the past few days were pretty ok. Now I was feeling completely hopeless, could barely speak as to not cry in front of everybody, and couldn't see an end in sight. I eventually walked away to a dark area of our backyard and deep breathed to not cry (I know, you shouldn't swallow tears, but I didn't want the attention they would've given me) With the help of alcohol I was feeling much better later. But it was pretty scary because this sort of thing's never happened to me. I felt mopey, and sad, and awkward, and I just wanted to get away and scream, or cry, or punch a wall, or whatever. I should've been happy. My sister was here for God's sake. It doesn't help that I'm a newly graduated, hormone-filled teen who's had his life flipped upside down. But I don't know what happened. I don't think it can be depression, because though I've been depressed before, I've been the most motivated I've ever been my life recently. But at the same time, I've been hanging out less with my friends because I just don't feel like it. I want to, but I also don't? Everything's so confusing right now.",29Jul2020,1
169,"So I've (21f) been with him (21m) for like 3 years and 1 year in HS. We've pretty much had the same issues repeatedly. I only recently started to consider that it was never going to get better. 

Background:
-In HS he got me pregnant and before I even knew, I had a miscarriage. I assume because I had PCOS and was on like 6 different meds like mood stabilizers, SSRIs, ativan, zoloft n some more. I didn't tell him at first because I tend to suppress and ignore things that really traumatized me. When I did, he told me I was just making it up to make him feel guilty. He later broke up with me because I tried to commit suicide and had been pysch hospitalized 3 times in a year. In anger I posted some pretty angry rants and embarrassing photos of him on social media which he didn't like and I know now wasn't right. I've always felt guilty for it and have never been like that since. almost to a fault, all the stuff I'll mention below, I never complained about because I felt it was me being abusive again. I would never do it to that extent, but I stopped even talking about what he does to me. Even now, we rarely talk about my pregnancy. Only once when he pretended to cum inside me and I cried. 
-I'm no longer on medications, because I honestly felt like I didn't need them. My mom would call the police on me for not wanting to go HS. I was raped and my abuser would harass me. Yell whore in the halls. Throw coffee at me as I walked home. Leave open condoms in my yard, or thrown at my windows. The police would hospitalize me and I'd be medicated to the point of feeling like a zombie. When I got older I just wanted to have healthy coping mechanisms. Not a bunch of tranquilizers I didn't think I needed, but my mom told them to give me. When my bf and I get into fights, he uses words like ""you're delusional"" And ""you need help/meds"" Which I get. But he says it in such an upsetting way for me. Mostly when we have fights about HIM going to therapy for porn addiction. I mean in HS AND living with him in college, I'd catch him watching porn all night or looking on Reddit for people to share nudes with. I'd catch him, cry, ask him to stop, he'd promise, and I'd catch him again. So I always felt he was just upset I wanted him to go to therapy, he never suggested it otherwise. I'd cry myself to sleep some night and it never happened then. 
-we fought a lot towards the end of our lease the last month. We were both now unemployed and stressed about COVID. But I excused it as just stress. He didn't mean to. 
-I have PTSD from sexual assault and he often yells at me for not wanting to have sex. I tell him it's not him, it's me. He still gets angry. If not angry, he cries until I do it anyways. 
-sometimes when I cry he threatens to punch me or choke me until I stop. He's physically held me down when I try to lock myself in another room. Once he said he hated me and would look at me while I slept and think about strangling me. He's once choked me (at first Consentually) during sex and when I tapped him to stop, he went so hard I had broken blood vessels in my cheeks and eyes. 
-I have nightmares about him often. How he yells at me. Threatens me. The times I've had to threaten to call 911 because he won't leave me alone when I feel unsafe around me. I'll leave the house and he chases me out. 

Now we've moved back home. And he convinced me to go on vacation with him to the FL Keys. I didn't want to at first because his brother is an alcoholic who often yells at his parents, me, anyone. Once we caught a bunch of lobster (6 I did myself) and my bfs brother is cooking dinner. I have TMJ from grinding my teeth when anxious which gets worse after snorkeling. So I couldnt open my mouth more than half an inch. I asked his brother to leave my catch aside since he's making hoagies rolls I would be able to eat. And he ignored me, and after I showered it was all gone. I asked and my bfs brother says ""well if you don't fucking like it you can starve"". Loud and mean and drunk. I cried in front of the whole family. No one stood up for me. 

I asked that if I went this year, that my bf stand up for me. I don't think it's my place to be angry at his brother. But instead, I realized my bf was just like his brother now that he's 21. He got wasted and screamed at me for everything. Making me drive the boat without showing me how, I got confused with all the "" Left, right, now left, now right, hard right! "" I'm dyslexic I obviously messed up. But he just screamed at me like I was stupid and belittled me. I sobbed and he just got angrier. So I messed up more. And he yelled more until I just froze. Sobbing. So I make him take me back and he's angry that I don't wanna have fun in the sun after that. I just want to lay down and cry. So he gets shit faced. I spent 3 hours cleaning all the fish his family got. I mean until 2 am while they all slept. No thank you. The next day I made a meal from scratch, no help, no thank you. I do all the dishes and cleaning. When plateing it up, my boyfriend made a mistake. I just politely told him how I do it, I just wanted to show him. He yelled again and got shit faced and ignored me for hours. Leaving me locked out of the house. 

Then he fought with me while slurring. I refused to do that. He just tells me it's my fault he yelled, because I did this or that. I said no, it's not my fault. And he'll back track and say ""it's not your fault, but I was angry I was so and so"" To which I said, ""if it's not my fault why do you take it out on me"" And he just denies it. Saying I'm delusional. 

He'll scream and yell and when I ask him to leave. That I don't want to have this argument right now. He'll back track to ""I love you, I care"" It's been this way for years. And I didn't accept it this time. I've finally realized he'll just do anything for me to admit it's all my fault and forgive him. I didn't. I said I didn't want to do this anymore, I wasn't happy. He said ""then why don't you leave?"" And I said ""fine, I will"". And we broke up. He left me alone for the night and the next morning comes back, expecting me to change my mind like always. Say I'm sorry, I was upset, I don't want to break up. But I didn't this time. So he got angry again. Screamed about how I was delusional and I had to leave. He drove me here but I said okay. I'll find a way. But I didn't fast enough. An hour later he's angry I'm still here. I'm trying to call my parents to help me get a bus or something. But not fast enough so he yells about how I'm a cheating whore. I asked how. He brings up once of the times I was assaulted. We weren't dating and a guy tried to put his dick in me while I was passed out drunk. I woke up, pushed him out and made him leave. My bf says it's my fault because I'm a "" Slut who let some guy put their dick inside me"". I sobbed and told him to leave. That he can't flip flop between kindness and cruelty and expect me to forgive him. He yelled all the way out the door. 5 minutes later he's texting me that he loves me and he didn't mean it. I'm trying my hardest to stay away and my parents are coming to get me. But can't until tomorrow night. I'm staying at his families place. I made all this food for them and all they left me with is ramen and a coffee maker that spits hot water in the door I'm stuck in. 

I know I should never go back to him but all I can do is sob and cry and I just.. Am so suicidal and self pitying. I have no friends and I never left him before because I always felt it was my fault and I asked for it. I didn't deserve someone who was kind to me no matter what. That no one would love me but him. I guess I just need some encouraging words to get me through the next 36 hours. I have no one. Even my parents kind of think it's my fault. Yes they're helping me but my mom always says ""maybe you could say sorry and go to couples therapy. Your dad and I got over a lot of stuff"" That was a wake up call for me. I don't want my parents type of love either. 

I don't know, I'm just ranting at this point. Ranting and sobbing. I keep thinking about how he thinks I'm a cheating slut for being assaulted when I wasn't even dating him... I just don't know how I'll get through until tomorrow...",29Jul2020,1
170,"Imagine being trapped in a box all by yourselves floating away in nothingness, nothing to see except the view from a window which shows empty streets outside. This is a sight to cause goose-bumps for the most anti-social introvert as well. Such is the situation for almost all of us during these trying times of COVID-19 lockdowns.

All of us have been trying extremely hard to cope up with the sudden surge of extra time that seems to be hanging over us. Be it cooking, crafts, an entire day of Netflix, we have reached a point where there are no more recipes to make, nothing exciting to watch, AND… lo and behold. Here come the unavoidable introspection and self-assessment. With this introspection comes forth anxiety and inferiority from what someone said to you many moons ago and all your failed relationships. Those who are already suffering from some mental disorder are experiencing hikes in the symptoms. The untimely and unfortunate death of the Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput can’t be ignored here. 

However, in India, mental health is still not given priority. Many times we overlook the symptoms; we shift blames. We are a culture of comparing pains. We have all had conversations with our parents with something along the lines of “mujhe yeh pareshaani hai” and received replies like “Toh kya hua, yeh sab bas tumhari soch hai”. Our parents and grandparents tend to run away from mental pains and discomforts and preach to bottle everything up. It is not their fault; they grew up seeing the same and are adamant about not changing their views.

People often forget that just like a person suffering from an injury or some disorder has happy and normal moments; just like that a person suffering from depression also has some good days. Depression manifests itself differently in different individuals.

Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone has spoken vividly about her battle with clinical depression and has founded the “Live Love Laugh” foundation to provide help and raise awareness regarding depression. She says, “People talk about physical fitness, but mental health is equally important. I see people suffering, and their families feel a sense of shame about it, which doesn’t help. One needs support and understanding. I am now working on an initiative to create awareness about anxiety and depression and help people.”

172,"I do not know where to begin, honestly because I am aware that this is a super complicated issue.

I'll start with the basics.

I struggle with loneliness and had struggled with it for a very long time. 

I also struggle with mental issues but I luckily have a psychology degree and go through therapy and I have pretty much whatever strategy I can think of to keep myself afloat. But I will say that it is not easy to deal with them because I can be very mentally taxing sometimes. 

Because of these, I do not admit that I am not very adept when it comes to social skills. I have been slowly and slowly learning bit by bit about interacting with other human beings and most of the time, I had to learn them the hard way - heartbreaks, rejections, ghosting, you name it.

At first, I thought that the fault was me because I had been rejected, neglected and bullied and abused all my life that the only reasoning that I could think of is that I am the problem. 

Truth to be told, there is some truth to that because I know that I am always sure how to approach another person, let alone not knowing the millions of ways that the person might react. 

But I kept on pushing through and realised that the problem was not me but the other person because they do not have the stomach to be open or geniune.

Yet, I persist and persist and persist.

But .... it hurts. A lot.

And this is where I really want to rant and be pissed off.

I feel that people have no gratitude or dignity at all and I feel that the social media that we rely on today makes it too easy. Funny how we are supposed to connected with the technology of today but in reality, it pushes us away and alienates us.

Too many times, I have tried and tried and tried again to approach other people on social media. I use Instagram to post photos (i like photography) and approach others whenever i see a good photo and 80% of the time, they give only a seen or simply a like and a gentle thank you which I know that it means that they do not want to talk.

I have used dating apps (mostly Tinder) and no matter what approach I use, whether the conventional and geniune hello or the creative approach, 70% of the time we get no reply at all.

Or the worst part is when you think you are going so well, the communication feels geniune and real and all of a sudden ... the other person disappears. 

It hurts so bad when that happens and it makes me paranoid and scared of what to say next. 

Sometimes I ended up double texting just to see if everything is ok.

Sometimes I simply give an honest message (yes, I am that kind of person. I'm sorry but I refuse to simply walk away from something without being deserved an explanation or at least speaking from the heart about how I feel or to genuinely ask if everything is all right). This is the part where I mostly get blocked or still get a seen and no reply. 

Sometimes I ended up cancelling my Tinder account but ended up restarting it, hoping for another try. And again, again and again.


This perpetual cycle of me trying to best that I can to have a decent human connection is tiring and is seriously impacting on my entire soul, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. 

Too many times I felt less than human becuase of this when I try to approach myself in the most geniune way possible and treat the other person as an equal.

Interacting with another human being has become the same as walking on egg shells or a complicated game of chess where every move feels paranoid because you do not want to risk a bad outcome.

 Most days, when I feel continuously alone, depressed and hopeless, as much as I have my own strategies to counter these, I feel tempted to look on my phone, aimlessly scrolling or waiting, hoping to get a notification or something.

Too many times I feel like I am being the instigator of a conversation and not the other way around.

I do the best I can to not appear needy or desperate yet in these situations where things feel so bad, that I have every compulsion to be needy and desperate which I know pushes people away. 

So this is where I stand most of the time.

In many cases, it feels like I am going around in circles or stuck in a complicated maze where every path is an elaborate puzzle that needs to be solved. 

If I approach myself in a non genoune way, i might risk being rejected for it

If I approach myself as honest and geniune (which is the approach that I use), people can still potentially reject me because not everyone has the courage to do the same.

Be funny. Be geniune. Be open minded. Be whatever ... you still get rejected, ghosted or blocked for whatever reason that the other person can think of but never have the stomach to tell you why.

It feels a lot like I am being bullied yet I keep coming back, hoping to try again and hoping to achieve a decent and geniune human connection.

It is exhausting really. It is laughable too on how we are in this position and we are the ones who put ourselves in this situation. I keep doing my best to avoid doing the same thing or fall the same trap. I dont want to ghost others if I do not feel a connection but I aim to walk away or walk our own paths in good terms. I aim to be honest, genuine and sincere. Still for some reason, people can reject you for it.

It makes you feel petty, little, embarrassed and really frustrated but you do not know why to whom you want to be frustrated to.

It is a heavy burden to carry and a big toll for the sake of genuinely wanting a decent human connection, whether friendship or possibly a relationship of whatever kind. 

I can potentially rant about a hundred of other things that I had to endure over the years all because I do not want to feel invisible (and yes, I am aware that loneliness is also in my head. I try to keep that in mind).

I feel that most people are not appreciative of how much effort it takes to just feel like you are treated like a human being, no matter how geniune you try to be",29Jul2020,1
173,"Alrighty then, picture this if you will. I was mentally ill in high school and college. I’d give into anger, leading to some belligerent episodes. I’d do stuff for attention,  pretend to be more mentally ill than I was. In college, real stuff happened. I took recreational drugs occasionally, leading to some psychosis, strange behavior etc that was completely legitimate. Now, I’m in my mid 20’s, and I’m more serious about my mental health than ever. I have strong opinions about mental health. For instance, since mental illness is born in your mind, I don’t believe that mental illnesses are lasting. Yeah, I believe that if you work out your issues in your head, learn to control your behavior, or learn to cope with your problems, these so called illness can be overcome. So yeah, that being said, I’m not going to take pills for symptoms that I believe I have under control. It’s my mind, my life, my body, my choice. Well, argue with me if you will but hear me out. My problem begins with the fact that I was depressed af in my last relationship. The relationship itself was the problem. I was engaged to a man I didn’t love, who drank and abused me, and I had two people in my life basically tell me that my depression was due to me not taking any meds. I DID for a fact take my meds at the time, but they wouldn’t believe me and would make me take more, and every time I got upset, humanely upset, they’d blame it on mental illness. You guys, someone, please understand. Imagine me crying over being punched in the back of the head, and two men going, “HAVE YOU TAKEN YOUR MEDICINE???” It was... Disgusting. I fully blame these episodes for not shedding good light on medication. While I believe it’s situationally optional, it can be a very positive thing in someone’s life. It wasn’t it mine. My human emotions were being blamed on something being wrong with me. Anger is human. And it’s completely normal. With me at least. I’m positive of it. I get PO appropriately, if that makes sense. But anyway, back to the moment. So I haven’t taken my Lithium or Vraylar since March. I didn’t think I needed it. I believe some doctors are in cahoots with pharmacies. And I had one of them. The person prescribing me these two medicines would tell me that she could hear “bipolar in my voice” and other BS, just to make me take meds when I felt perfectly fine. And just now I called my father to tell him about my bruised ribs, and he felt the need to digress to how I was “upset the other day.” Yeah, I sure was upset. I cried and told them the story of how my mother was yelling at me in public, so I did get upset, and I did call him, but instead of validating my emotions, he was basically like, “Have you taken your medicine?” And it makes me sick. I can appreciate some solidarity or talk.",29Jul2020,1

177,"I think I have been living with an eating disorder for the past 10 years or more. I am 29 now and I've had weight issues since I was in high school. I haven't really had myself checked by a professional except for that one time I seeked help from an online therapist. 

I was going through a major breakdown. Reasons were from a lot of different things like my grandfather passing away, too much work pressure, family pressure and maybe from myself because I always keep on pushing myself especially when it comes to weight.

 It was the darkest days of my life. It felt like I was drowning and can't really pull myself up. I cried and cried and cried and was never feeling better. What used to be just a good cry to get by wasn't enough anymore. I could not even stop myself from crying. Talking to a friend did not help anymore. It felt like I wanted to get out of that dark hole but I also couldn't because I won't let myself to. 

I went to different doctors - OBGYN cause maybe I had problems with my ovaries bec I was gaining weight and feeling bloated all the time, Endocrinologist cause it could be from my hormones and maybe it's hypothyroidism or hyper bec of too much stress. Just to see that it was not anything idiopathic or something that rooted from a mental health crisis. 

I am a flight attendant and lived overseas before the pandemic and I did not live a normal life. I worked different and long hours. I enjoyed it. But bec of this pandemic I haven't flown for months. I feel stuck with nowhere to go. I feel like my wings were clipped by this virus.

During those dark days of drowning, I felt like I needed break from living that life - of flying of having a far from normal routine. But now that I am on that break, the feeling is haunting me again. Like I'm on the edge of that black hole.

Not doing anything for months makes me eat and not eat. I have weird eating habits and right now all I can think of is I am getting fat, ugly, old and insane.

Venting out about how I really felt inside makes me guilty too. I know that there are people who have it worse than I do. Way worse. I should even be thankful of the life that I am living right now. And I am truly sorry I'm doing this now

But right now, I feel stuck, useless, fat and ugly. I want to push myself to become better but I just don't have the energy. Idk anymore.... Idk... 😔",29Jul2020,1

But no matter how much quality time i spent with them i feel no connection. As a result i don’t keep up with them after some times. Like i didn’t keep up with my school friends after finishing school. They sometimes message to meet me but i keep ignoring them. It’s not like i don’t like them but somehow i don’t meet them. Moreover i don’t feel sadness or happiness. I am not depressed and extremely motivated towards my study and work. Is that a mental problem?,29Jul2020,1
180,If I look at blinds for more than a couple seconds they start to look wavy and distorted. I can’t see in the dark because my vision is clouded by little colorful distortions that are brighter than what I can see. I see people out of the corner of my eye sometimes that aren’t there. I’ll get caught off guard sometimes by flashes of light or like a wall moving like it’s behind waves of heat. Faces distort to show somebody I’m familiar with from certain angles then when I see them straight on they look nothing like that person. If I hold my phone above me in the dark and face the screen towards myself and move it in a circle I can see a tracer behind the phone. I’m a little paranoid about people trying to get one over on me so I’m sometimes really suspicious of others’ motives behind what they do but I don’t have any delusions that everyone’s out to get me. I wonder if I’m just experiencing after effects from doing lsd like 50 times in 10 months or if that triggered something and I’m experiencing some sort of mental health issue or if they’re totally unrelated and I’m just going crazy.,29Jul2020,2

184,"I’m a 21 year old female. Last year I went into the hospital after a miscarriage caused me to develop sepsis. I almost died during that ordeal. And after that I developed anxiety. I’ve always struggled with depression but losing my child, almost dying, being cheated on and getting addicted to my pain meds (diluadid) in 2/3 months, made my mental health way worse. 


Recently I decided to buy my first car, but my family was against it. So it was hard to get support from them. So I was stressed trying to get my car on my own before I leave for school in 2 weeks. Finally, I found a car I was in love with and I thought that would stop the anxiety because I get it on Friday, it’s so close! But now everytime I think of the car, my heart rate starts to go up, I can’t breathe well, and I get chest pains. I’ve lost my appetite, and can’t sleep well. “What if I’m driving it home and someone hits me?” “What if the owner tries to bump up the price?” “What if my cousin (who’s a mechanic) finds something wrong with it, and I have to start my car search all over?” 

I want a good nights sleep without relying on NyQuil or Tylenol PMs. It seems like these “attacks” just start out of no where. And then I’m worried I might have a heart attack and end up in the hospital. Thinking of it makes me want to cry. What does this sound like to you all?",29Jul2020,1
185,"Hello Everyone.

I'm a psychologist, and I used to provide a significant amount of therapy.  I can't tell you how many stories I would hear from clients about the bad therapy and care they received in the past.  

These stories would run the gamut from ridiculous boundary intrusions, therapists speaking more than their clients, therapists suggesting their clients not bring up their trauma, and even a therapist who would cry whenever the client brought up sad material.  

My point is, there are many, many great therapists out there; but there are a lot of bad therapists, as well.  Also, there are many good therapists who simply don't match well with clients, through no fault of either party.  

Research shows that the two most important factors to successful therapy are the relationship between the therapist and client and the client's expectations (hopes) for success.  If you don't have (or are not building towards) a strong relationship with your therapist, or you simply don't have the expectation that they can help you, it may be time to consider finding a new therapist.

When switching therapists, this is not the time to worry too much about your therapist's feelings.  Yes, this is a relationship; but it's not a friendship.  They will not feel abandoned.  Remember, they're there to help you.  

While you could simply ghost your current therapist and ignore all future calls, I'd recommend you don't do that.  For one, you miss out of crucial referrals for good therapists in the area.  Secondly, you miss out on possibly approaching in a collaborative fashion what did not work in the therapy relationship, which can be very beneficial.  

So, please, become comfortable trying different therapists.  Don't let one bad experience scare you away from future therapy, which might be absolutely fantastic for you in the future.  Keep putting in the work, just like you'd do with any other disorder or disease.  Choose to live in hope.",29Jul2020,1

Even before quarantine and now, I constantly am paranoid my friends hate me, that I’ll never have a real friend, that I can’t accomplish anything.

And sometimes I do go down the path of desperately and rather embarrassingly trying to open up to someone when they weren’t even aware I thought they didn’t like me.

\-Cheap therapists. - I couldn't find any accredited/recommended therapists for a price that I can afford right now and I am really unsure as to whether or not I should risk getting a ""community"" therapist or something along those lines. I haven't been to a really dark place recently as I have been before and I know from experience that an unprofessional/unqualified therapist can drive a person to start writing goodbye letters, especially in a critical point.

\-Talking to friends - Just because I don't have any. (I mean, people that I could open up about intimate issues).

203,"I (28F) broke things off with my ex fiancé (29M) about 4 months ago. I was severely anxious and depressed and thought leaving would fix everything. I’ve had time to process everything, and I mean EVERYTHING. 

Basically, I was going through a very bad depressive episode. We were living 2.5 hours away from my hometown so I didn’t have my family close by as a support system. I wasn’t happy in the town we were living in and I basically convinced myself we were incompatible. I just really needed to work on myself and be closer to my family so I left.

Having all this time to reflect, I feel nothing but guilt and disgust with myself for treating him like shit. I’d nit pick things he did, make rude comments, answer him with a snooty tone. I remember him telling me on several occasions that I wasn’t in love with him. I was too fucking stupid and depressed to listen to him. I took him for granted. 

I now realize that I was unhappy with myself, not him. I had so much unresolved childhood trauma to work through. I had so many insecurities that went unaddressed for far too long. He was a damn good partner and I’m drowning in guilt and shame for how I treated him. I miss him with every ounce of my being and he will forever be the one that got away, but I know we will never ever be together again. He told me he’s in love with his new girlfriend and that we should’ve never gotten engaged in the first place. He says he doesn’t hate me and that he’s just simply “over it” which IMO is 100x worse. 

I’m doing so much better. I’m stable (other than this extreme guilt lingering). Of course I’m not perfect, I still struggle here and there but I don’t let myself get “bad” again. I’m doing really well for the first time in a long time. I just miss him so much. 

How am I supposed to forgive myself? Why did I allow myself to self-sabotage the relationship? Why didn’t I listen to him when he tried to tell me things? I feel sick to my stomach knowing I was willing to throw away everything we had.",29Jul2020,1

I don’t know if this is the place to ask, but it was the first forum to come up when I looked up mental health. I need some direction.

Bit of context. I’ve ‘suffered’ from what I think is poor mental health for a very long time, but could never pin point it. And any self examination would only reveal that I was over reacting and in over my head. The only indication that something was wrong was by looking at myself externally, my habits and choices. I.E; isolation, pushing away people, not letting people in, always in a bad mood. 

I need to know why I have this feeling in my gut and in my chest. When I think about having to move out, feeling in my chest. When I think about my banking account, feeling in my chest. When I wake up, feeling in my chest. When I see my self in the mirror, there it is again. When people message me, I leave them on read or don’t open it to save myself from the hurt. Work helps, friends are better, alcohol is best to subdue this ever present gnawing. I’m beginning to think my ‘problems’ are narcissism disguised as self pity. 

And yet, even know when I try to express it to you fine folk it seems to dissipate, almost subdue and seem trivial. It’s been a hard go, and whatever this is won’t allow me to cope with it. 

I want to know what’s wrong with me, so I can get better. I want to be with people and not feel like I’m wrong at some fundamental level. I want to feel accepted by myself, I want to strive towards happiness. All the time it feels like I’m rowing a little boat in a storm, my arms hurt and I’m ready to let it take me, but I just got to keep rowing. I just need directions to the port.

My impulse control is everything but gone completely when I’m in one of my semi manic/manic states and I do things that I regret and am embarrassed about. 

I looked at a message on my boyfriends phone against my better judgement and what I would normally do because I had a bad idea in my mind that he was talking about me behind my back. That idea stewed for weeks and weeks until during one of my manic episodes I looked. I was honest with him about it but I am beyond embarrassed and after I did it I was instantly regretful.

218,"Yeah, I'm a real loser for sure. I dropped out of high school twice and I'm now 20. I got bullied a lot in high school which made me quit and lose interest in education. I was beaten up, choked, lonely, verbally bullied, and often mocked on which made me paranoid at the time. My mother even forced me back after I escaped high school once which ensued more bullying. I don't want to elaborate now because there was an overwhelming number of incidents that dehumanized me. You can only imagine how it was for me to get bullied regularly in boarding school by boys who not only had a father but were more privileged than me. I spent most of my life playing videogames as a cope and my mom does not understand that. She thinks that its completely my fault that I play videogames and hence she never tried to fix my addiction. She often pulled the plug which only enraged and frustrated me. She neglected me a lot during my life by alienating me and sometimes starving me. All my life, I have been blaming myself for my pathetic life. But after contemplating about my past, I understand that its mother's fault. She was cheating on my dad with a well off man ever since I was born and it glooms me to be a son of a whore.

Fade out, into bedroom, morning...

---

He woke with a sharp breath, eyes wide open as a sudden shock of adrenaline flooded warmly from his abdomen, igniting his senses.  

He wasn’t dreaming before he woke, nor did he remember where or when he fell asleep; this would dawn on him soon. For a minute at least, he had no idea where, or even who he was.  

Muffled sounds of the television floated into the room from beyond. To his side, a grey wall confronted him, virtually featureless save for a deep, dark gouge that penetrated the plaster, chiselled at least an inch deep into the breeze block beneath by some strong, angular object.  

A visceral instinct clutched at the rapidly fading vestiges of oblivion, steeling his slowly awakening mind against the inevitable clarity of day.  

His eyes drifted downward, almost by their own will. A trail of colourful debris spread across the grey carpeted floor. He recognised these objects as his own junk: Empty wrappers, an unfinished book (still intact), a scattering of coins, some old shopping receipts, his glasses, some odd socks, and a small handful of odds and ends.   

This was stuff that he usually stashed out of sight and mind in the drawers beside his bed.  

Drawers that were oddly absent from their familiar place beside his head.  

Propping himself up unsteadily on his elbow, he took a more sweeping view of the room. He groaned and sighed as his gaze finally came to rest on the object of destruction.
The heavy wooden bedside table lay near the foot of the bed, its draws spewed haphazardly across the floor, beneath what must have been a spectacular flight path the previous evening.  

Like a series of lead weights, pieces of the puzzle dropped into place, flashes of memories yanking his mind to sobriety.  

The drinking.  

The casino.  

The staircase.  

The plastic bag.  

The wall.  

The screaming.  

He quickly packed these images away, but they lay in wait beneath the surface of his awareness, poised to strike at any moment.  

Rolling again onto his back, he pulled the blankets over his head and tried in vain to retreat to the safety of oblivion. Sweet, peaceful nothingness was all he desired right then and there. If some spirit had entered the room and whisked his soul off into the beyond, he’d have welcomed it without a second thought.  

His body shook with tremors, and the dull ache of injuries began to throb gently across his body. “Too much alcohol” he thought. “Too much fucking alcohol.”   

As he lay in the dimly lit room more scraps of the previous night assailed him, little more than still images in random order. Everything else was a blackout. He felt the bruises along his arms, his head ached, his fists were swollen. Probably had a serious concussion, hence the memory loss. That and the drinking.  

In his fugue state, hours passed, it seemed, before eventually his wife entered the room with a soft click of the door handle.  

He held his breath.  

“You awake sweetie?” she asked in a soothing, caring voice. Such kindness only served to deepen his self loathing.  

He exhaled. “Mmm.”  

Wordlessly, she walked over to her side of the bed and lay down, laying her soft arm across his shoulders. He winced slightly from contact with some bruises on his back that he hadn't noticed yet.  

He sighed deeply again.  

“Oh, lovely...” she whispered, squeezing him gently.  

“I’m sorry.” He whispered back, still unsure of the exact thing he was sorry for, but he knew it was pretty bad. “I’m so sorry...”  

She squeezed again, the seemingly undeserved love in her touch flooding him with a rough mix of self-hatred and a tiny spark of hope.  

“The wall...” he said, groggily.  

“And the stairs. And your computer...” she sighed.  

He struggled to visualise the relevance of these words. “The computer?”  

“You punched the screen. It just shows colourful patterns now.” She giggled, an odd counterpoint that sliced through the sombre atmosphere like breaking glass.  

_Why does she accept this?_ He thought. _I’m a fucking monster._  

“Oh...” he said, wondering idly what the bill of damages would be. “Are you... okay?”  

She hesitated. “You didn’t hurt us. Just... broke things. And you were screaming, just screaming. The neighbours must have heard...”  

Like a wild animal. A fucking monster.  

She continued. “You were pretty hard on the girls too, you were yelling at them. They hid in their rooms.”  

_Like I used to, when dad used to..._  

“We just got out of the way. They hid their stuff. You were wrecking everything.”  

“Again...” he said dejectedly.  

She squeezed him with her gentle arms, and kissed the back of his neck.   

“You kept hitting the walls, and punching yourself in the head. You were pulling things out of drawers looking for plastic bags. Good thing I hid those last time.”  

_To suffocate myself with. Like last time. I wonder if there’s any around now._  

“I’m sorry.” He whispered again. “I don’t know why...”  

“It’s ok...” she said, with another reassuring squeeze.  

They lay in silence for a while. He couldn’t understand why he deserved her affection. How could anyone love such a beast, such a monster? Wasn’t she afraid? What if he’d turned on her? He’s a big man, slightly out of shape but still strong enough to throw a 50kg bed into a wall in a fit of rage. All he could think was that he should be locked away immediately for other people’s safety, or humanely put out of his misery as a failed experiment in evolution.  

But nonetheless he felt her love recharging him, her soft breathing warm against his shoulder, chest rising and falling behind him, her gentle squeezes soothing, all of which seemed to say that everything would be okay.  

While his guilt and shame seemed infinite, her love pierced through his darkness like a javelin of light, fracturing an iron curtain of self-hatred, planting a small seed of hope.  

Hope.  

Was hope a blessing or a curse? Was there a point to hope when it just rekindled the cycle, kept him moving on thinking life would be okay, right up until the point where he tore it all apart again? Was there any chance of things being different this time around?   

Or would he just continue to spiral around the rim like a shit in a blocked toilet, waiting for death’s plunger to set him free unto the depths below?  

The feeling made him uncomfortable. Hope seemed like a venomous snake slithering in the grass waiting to strike.  

He turned to her and embraced her, briefly. “I love you. I’m sorry.” He said, before slowly rolling to the side of the bed and planting his feet on the plaster-strewn carpet, seeking escape from these unnerving thoughts. But a shock of pain stabbed though his foot. “Ugh! God damn it. I think I broke a toe.”  

“The bathroom door...” she said.  

“Really?” he sighed, testing his weight on the outside of his foot, and, figuring it would hold, rising unsteadily to his feet. The sudden change in altitude caused his head to spin, and he immediately sat back down on the bed.  

_Why did I kick the bathroom door? Was she in there? Why can’t I remember anything?_  

“So, uh...” He said, laying back down. “Why are you still with me?”  

“Because I love you.” She said, resting her arm across his chest.  

“I’m scared. I don’t know if it will happen again. I thought after the therapy I would be okay, but this feels worse. I don't remember anything. And the kids... I don’t want to do this to them. This is why I moved away, I wanted to give you guys a chance to be normal.”  

“But then you’d be alone over there, and I’d worry.”  

“But it wouldn’t be your problem.”  

“I’d still care.”  

“You wouldn’t have to.” He said, matter of factly. But the way she said it, he knew she was sincere.  

“You’ll get help. We’ll figure it out. We’ll get through this.”  

_I don’t want to always be figuring it out. I don’t want to have to “get through this” and I don’t want to fuck up other people with my shit. I don't want to be that stereotype abusive husband guilting his wife into staying through suicidal threats. They deserve so much better than me, can’t she see she’d be happier without me,_ he thought.  

“But I don’t think I can handle too much more of what happened last night.” She concluded. “It was scary.”  

He remained in bed for a few more hours, before cautiously emerging from the bedroom. The TV was still on downstairs, and he saw his wife sat on the couch.  The kids were still at school.  

As he descended, he took mental note of the damages. The stair rail was badly damaged, bent and twisted. Scuff marks at head and fist height marked the wall at each painful step. Downstairs came into view, and he saw the Ikea chair, frame snapped in half, and his computer monitor, vivid lines and swirls of colour radiating from a fist-sized oval of shattered glass in the centre. His laptop though was curiously still working, save for a slightly bent case that he twisted back into shape.  

He noticed the poker chips on the hallstand. $1300 worth. He checked his bank account, he’d only spent $400 at the casino. “Big deal.” He thought. “What does it matter now?”  

In total, he figured about a thousand dollars to replace everything he’d destroyed, taking care of his “winnings”, plus some paint and plaster to fix up the walls. The stair rails though, they might need some professional work, he decided to take a look at those last.  

Wordlessly, he went to the laundry. As he passed through the kitchen, he got a vivid flashback of laying there on the tiles, repeatedly smashing the back of his head at full force into the ground while his wife, or was it his daughter, begged him to stop. He shook away the thought quickly, and fetched the plaster.  

_We have plaster on hand._ He thought wryly. This happens too often.  

Going through the motions, he filled the holes and gouges in the bedroom, the bathroom door, down the stairwell, and the living room walls. Next, he fetched an allen key and dismantled the Ikea chair, stowing the pieces in the shed out the back, to be surreptitiously deposited in the garbage over the coming weeks. The monitor, too, he dropped in the large green bin outside for the next week’s collection.  

After placing the bedside table back in its rightful place and a quick run around with the vacuum cleaner, only a keen eye would spot any signs of trouble the night before.  

He sat beside his wife on the couch and snuggled his head into her lap. She gently stroked his hair as the TV droned on in the background.  

One by one, the kids came home from school. He asked them to come over for a hug, and apologised and explained that they did nothing wrong, that he was sick in the brain and needed help. He told them he loved them dearly. They hugged him back and said they loved him too. His eldest asked if he needed an icepack for his hand.  

Perhaps a dark joke about the night before was made, nervous laughter broke the tension. They ate dinner and watched TV together, all on the one couch since the Ikea chair was gone. His kids snuggled in while they sat watching a movie on Netflix, and those earlier dark thoughts of ending it all seemed to fade away.  

His shame remained, as did his guilt. But each step he took to piece things back together made the shame easier to bear. He managed to repair the stair rail with some tools and elbow grease. He replaced the broken monitor. The chair could wait, it was time to get something nicer anyway. Something too heavy to lift, preferably, his wife joked at him. He saw the humour, but he didn’t laugh.   

He had a beast inside of him, always reminding him of its presence, and the man and father he tried to be every day felt like a fraud. But to their minds the beast was the interloper, it was the fraud that clawed its way out from time to time, and the real man and father was the guy who spent every day fighting to hold it in. They didn’t see the daily struggle, just the man who was husband and father.  

He wanted to stop fighting the beast and just be himself, no more beast, so the next day he called a psychologist and spoke with them about what happened, his fears, his history. They didn’t judge him, they said they could help, and invited him in for his first session. Screw the cost, his shit needed to be dealt with properly, by a trained professional.  

Then, he emailed work, who he’d ghosted for a whole day. This was the first time he felt that couldn't make some dumb excuse and get away with it. No more ""I dropped my phone in the toilet"" or ""I forgot about it, gosh darn I'm so busy!"" So, for the first time he opened up and explained (sans the gory details) what had happened, that he had mental health issues and had had a breakdown and needed some space to recover. He dreaded the response, surely he’d be out of a job. But instead, they replied saying they would support him in any way they could, that they loved working with him, and he could take as much time as he needed to get back on track.  

The world that had looked so dark and terminal 48 hours prior suddenly again seemed normal, manageable. These weren’t life-ending events. They were serious, but they could be dealt with. Life would go on, there was literally no purpose to dying over this. Maybe some real therapy would help this time, and maybe the whole family should join in at some point.  

Without his wife and kids, he feared what he might have done next. Maybe the shred of hope was a lie, but it was all he had to go by, and it had to be enough to see him through to the next day.  

---

On a direct note - I am blessed to have a wife and kids that have put up with so much and yet still support me, and I know that I have a lot of work not just to fix myself but to support my family who have witnessed me doing some truly horrible things, especially my children who should not have to grow up knowing people are capable of such levels of unbridled fury. I have arranged professional therapy with a psychologist, and hope to work towards healing myself and my family. If she decides this is too much for her and wants to leave, then I will not stop her, at the same time I will not push her to do so. I have also suggested to her that she should consider counselling with the kids if she feels she needs it. I don't know how she deals with it, honestly. I am not proud and don't glorify what I did, but I can take steps to do something about it so I hope to never have to repeat this story again.",29Jul2020,1
226,"I am questioning my gender since 3 years and still not sure about being trans. I visited several therapists and got the diagnosis trans sexualism, since I wanted, so I can start HRT even several therapists wasn't sure and wanted more time, etc.

I have several problems, (social anxiety, ocd, transsexualism, anorexia, depression, depersonalisation) and could also be on the autism spectrum. But I think it will end the same way it did with being trans. Visiting several therapists, everyone has a different opinion and in the end I get the diagnose I want. So if I say, yes, I have autism and I am not trans, they will tell me that and vice versa..

I also saw a therapist that told me, I am psychological a very interesting person and she would love to see how I would act on antidepressants or similar. She also told me I have plenty of problems, but none of them are really heavy. She said she believes me I have those problems, but they are not that highly developed.

I’ll just continue to lay in my bed all day opening and closing every social media app on a cycle hoping I will get a notification because I’m lonely and I need dopamine and validation for the rest of my life.

228,"A very close friend lost his job a few months back and has been reclusive/quiet ever since. Talking to him is like talking to a wall. I've made progress when I avoid 'triggering' topics like work/keeping busy, but he's been getting worse over time.

Today I spotted him sitting by himself at the park, he saw me and looked confused. When I approached him to say hello he literally ran away (sprinted in the other direction and didn't look back). What the heck is going on?

He never seemed like he had any underlying mental health conditions. I'm urging him to talk to a therapist but its hard enough to have a conversation with him. Anyone have experience with this kind of thing? Is the running away indicative of anything?",29Jul2020,1
229,"This is really hard to explain, When my ex and I broke up he went into a mental health spiral and started ""splitting"" into other personalities more often. 
He had previously told me he had ""people in his head"" and on occasion one of them would sort of ""take over"" for him (this never happened while we were together, I never formally met this other version of him). It sounds similar to DID but neither of us think that is actuall what it is. (My therapist seems to think it's a combination of personality disorders and possibly manipulation tactics that he may or may not be aware that he is doing, that or that he needs serious psychiatric help to address it since he never did in the past and it's becoming more apparent of a thing now) anyway after the initial break up we were working on fixing things and while in the process of doing that he ended up finding someone new he wanted to date instead but assured me he wanted to be my friend..after he started dating this new person we went mostly no contact because I was crushed and I had nothing nice to say and I started spiraling back into depression. 

Well the few times we HAVE had contact whether I reached out or he did, more times than not, he's claimed to be one of the other ""people"" (who I finally ""talked"" to and sort of got to know before we went no contact).  He claims that he is ""letting them out"" more because his family now knows about it now (we're both adults btw). But he's claiming to be this one specific ""other"" most of the times we've talked after the breakup (no face to face contact yet though) but I'm not sure this is the case because he already moved in with his new partner and from knowing him personally I just have a hard time believing he is switching that quickly or not being ""himself"" with the new partner. I am not trying to say he is lying I'm really not, just looking for insight because he originally only let this one ""take over"" when he's not doing well because it's a ""protector"".
It's been super weird because it's like my ex but not my ex. But he also says that he (and the rest of them) misses me and wishes we could have watched movies and did art and stuff(which I did with my ex a lot when we were together)..has anyone else ever dealt with ANYTHING like this? Is there validity to it, does it seem like manipulation? I'm not trying to be mean or insensitive I struggle with my own mental health and this has gotten me so confused. I'm genuinely curious and am interested in other's perspectives.

I personally got a weird feeling that it might be an excuse he can use with his new partner that ""he's not talking to his ex, 'so-and so' was""..because when he talked to me as my ex he seemed a bit more cold and stand off-ish...this is so hard to explain..I hope it's even slightly possible to follow.

232,"Dear reddit,

This is going to be all over the place but I just wish to pen my thoughts somewhere.

Initially deciding otherwise, I joined my university's orientation programme in fear of missing out on making friends. Orientation programmes where I live are always full of cheers, dances and activities that get you to show your weird and quirky (?) side (e.g. taking and sharing unglam pictures of yourself). I've always avoided these programmes as much as I could.

I was added into a chat group, where there were daily ""bonding"" activities. These activities required us to video ourselves completing certain tasks and came with forfeits if you didn't complete it in a timely fashion. I was outside with my mother and I found myself growing frustrated because I couldn't complete the daily task and was at risk of being given the forfeit, which was again, something included to have people show their supposedly fun side.

I remember having lunch in a food court and my mood suddenly dropped drastically. The more I thought about having to perform the forfeit, the more I panicked. I started being impatient and rude to my poor mother because I wanted to go home as soon as possible to complete the task.

Once I reached home, I went around the house looking for good lighting and experimented with different angles of recording myself completing the task so that I could minimise my flaws and look okay. And then when I sent the video, all I could think of is how I looked in the video and wonder what my school-mates are thinking about me. 

I felt so uneasy for the rest of the day. My phone kept buzzing as my school-mates chatted away in the group chat and I couldn't keep up. Honestly, I have zero interest in what they're saying because it's nothing substantial (not to be mean because they're really just casual comments and replies) and constant social interaction overwhelms me.

I don't know if it's because of COVID-19, where I'm at home most of the time that I lost my socialising touch. I might be an introvert but I've never struggled this much with confidence and socialising, to the point where I care so much about what other people would think of me.

Or perhaps being thrown into such a high-energy environment didn't help me, it's like I have to turn on a socialising switch in my body and run at full capacity suddenly. Hopefully soon, I can look back at this post and have a laugh at my silliness.

Take care and have a good day, everyone.",29Jul2020,1
233,"I've always had these thoughts, ever since I learned anyone can die just like that. I used to stay up as long as I could so I heard my parents go upstairs and if anything were to happen to them, I would hear.

And the last few years, whenever I think about how my parents will die, I have to cry. I don't see myself as a grownup. I need to ask reassurance for everything and am never sure what to say or do or how to so things, and it's my parents I turn to when I need help. 

And one day they won't be there anymore. I won't be able to ask them anything, but more importantly I won't be able to hug them or talk to them or just spend time with them. I never want that to happen. I often hope I'll die before they do, but then I think about how that's even sadder because I don't want them to be sad.

And I just don't know how to get over the fact that one day they will die, and to just accept that",29Jul2020,1
234,"Hello everyone. Upfront, I’ll warn you that I’m not very well versed in this stuff at all, so forgive me if my terminology is poor.

Really having a rough go at it these past few days. Due to going back to work and a few minor stressors in my life, I felt myself really feeling down and lacking all motivation. So due to Covid, I reached out to one of the online resources that connects you with a doctor who can diagnose and work with you digitally. He officially diagnosed me with extreme depression, anxiety, and I’m bipolar. To the point that he said he couldn’t do much for me over the phone and I would have to meet in person with a psychiatrist for any medications and general help. Well, I can’t get an appointment till end of September and I feel things just piling on me.

The labels of what exactly is wrong has really done worse for me and I don’t know why. I’m not embarrassed or anything, but it just validated the feelings if that makes sense...

I’ve been really struggling with my parents lately. I moved out years ago but they aren’t taking the pandemic seriously and risking themselves and others.

Old wounds opened today when an old close friend reached out mad about something (I am purposely being vague, since he’s on reddit). Long story short, he left a joint effort of ours and so I removed him as admin on the Facebook page and turned it private. It stayed dormant for 4 years and now I went in and rebranded it. He didn’t like that I retained all the likes. And that’s when he reached out. Though I kept my answers short and did not engage in his baiting, he took it to Facebook which lead to a handful of death threats and harassment coming my way by his friend group. I ended up deleting the page because the situation was more than I could handle.

I feel hopeless, defeated, and I just want to run away from all of this. My wife tries to help but she’s stressed about me dealing with all of this too and it’s a lot for her to handle.

236,"(tl;dr below)

A friend of mine and I were talking sometime last week. We both have gone through our internal struggles and we share it with each other, and it felt good to have a support system.

A couple weeks ago, we were talking late at night and she said, “I’ve been getting a lot of DMs on Instagram recently. But it’s probably not genuine. They are only contacting me because I lost weight and dyed my hair.” I tried to convince her otherwise, and told her that that she made changes to have a new lifestyle and to accept that it’s a good problem to have. Previously, she said she never thinks she’s going to find love, but she’s been in a 2 year long relationship, and after that ended, she dated other people for a little while.

Due to how late it was, I was starting to snap and told her that she could either accept the things she’s done for herself or gain her weight back and go back to her old self. 

This conversation made me tired and mad (it was slightly triggering) and I needed a break so I ignored her for the first half of the next day. She kept spamming me asking why I’m ignoring her, and after a little while, I told her I needed some time to myself. She responded that it was unfair on her why I don’t tell her what’s going on in my mind. 

I needed another couple days, then I told her, “It’s unfair on *me* to not be able to do what is good for me without judgment or rebuke.” She responded to that, “Do not treat me like a cheap toy you can kick around.”

I just cut her off at that point. It was too much for me and I couldn’t take it. I would have been completely fine if she had just let me me, because it’s often not comfortable telling someone they’re the reason why I am not talking.

237,"Hi everyone. I’m (F20) new in this group and desperately need help. I recently got a new job (month ago working as a inside sales assistant) and I’m having problems with my memory and ADHD while at work. My ADHD makes it difficult for me to fully focus on what I’m doing or what someone is saying and then my memory issues cause me to forget whatever I did hear them say. This is causing me to fill orders out wrong, give people the wrong parts and generally have a hard time every other day. It’s really stressing me out and makes me have a lot of anxiety. It doesn’t help that with how my and my SO’s jobs are I don’t see him during the week at all. Only on weekends because I don’t work on weekends do I get to see him before he leaves for work. I know I’m depressed right now but it’s not the worst I’ve ever been through. Suicide has never been something I’ve had to fight btw so for me it’s not something to worry about for myself. I want to start working on my memory capabilities and maybe take some ADHD medicine? I’ve never taken medicine for anything except birth control and the occasional sickness. I’m scared if I take ADHD medication that none of my friends will like me anymore because I won’t be myself. My SO has reassured me that he’ll be there for me no matter what and I know he’s being truthful but I don’t want to have to change.

Hello I am a young adult, and I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I go through a lot of ups and down emotionally, and I feel more “down” than I ever feel good. But today I just tried to end all my closest relationships. I almost ended it with my best friend, almost cut all ties with my sister, and broke up with my boyfriend. And it’s not like I was thinking it, because I began conversations with all three of them pretty lightheartedly (except my boyfriend), but then it ended up with me saying, “I’m terrible you should cut me from your life” or saying “I’m toxic to you.” 

In my sister’s case it’s true, I constantly bring up the past and throw events or actions she’s done that hurt me in the past, and that wasn’t healthy. I began with saying I should cut her from my life, but ending with me saying she should cut me. She didn’t say yes, she said we’re family and we stick together, and I was sobbing prior so I cried harder at that. I ended up saying we should start again, start new, and I’ll never bring up the past again. 

We ended the call, and then I call my boyfriend (he asked if we could talk since he could tell I was feeling off by the way I was responding in messages), but I started to say he didn’t deserve this, the emotional roller coaster of me. I went down this way of thinking where I thought I should break up with him because I’m making him worse. He listened to me patiently as I tore myself apart, and pushed back against my self-hate (I’m summarizing the event, I don’t want to get into more detail). 

He meets with me in real life and we talk and I just continue breaking down. He had to drive me because I didn’t trust myself to drive (neither did he), and we were right, when I got in the car I immediately thought of how to die and if I were driving myself I would probably try to kill myself. 

I’m better now, I got to talk it out with him, but I’m wondering what just happened to me? I never felt so self-destructive before and wanting to cut my friends off from me or have my friends cut me out of their lives. I tried to commit suicide before, but it never had this type of buildup. I also just never acted on my thoughts like this before. It was so visceral. And I’m just worried about what that means.

I get these brief moments when I feel alive again like my soul has returned to my body and I feel real. I can smell, feel and think normally again, but these moments dont last long, usually a few minutes.

The very first set of medications he prescribed had the most profound impact on my life I've ever had. Within a month, my depression went from a daily 10/10 to a 2/10. He completely changed my life for the better. My mood is completely stable, and I am so happy to be alive and well.

These thoughts usually come about when bored or doing mundane things. One of the earliest examples I can remember was after the first time I watched the second x-men film. 

The villain I forget their name say his wife tried to bore images out of their head with a drill so next time I was doing some DIY at home I kind of thought about it, how would you go about it, how long it would take and see myself in 3rd person doing it.

Another more recent one was when Epstein was in the news, the next time I was changing my sheets I visualised what it would be like to hang from my bed. Now I would call myself a fairly curious person in general, so I’ve always put this down to just some sort of morbid curiosity. For the most part they are kind of like daydreams and cold I don’t think there is much emotion in it but as they’ve been going on since at least my teenage years so normally I pay it no mind.

I'm always the tough and rude girl to everyone, but I just don't want to be that anymore. I haven't done anything to make myself more healthy, I don't do anything. My grades are dropping so badly, I can't just do anything.

There's just nothing I can take my feelings out on or tell anyone, I feel like I have nothing that's the real me. I just have created myself to something that's just so wrong and I don't know how to fix it. I know i sound so dramatic, and that's what I am scared of, because I really don't want to have attention. I just really need some help or advise anyone to even just listen. I'm so sorry that I put myself down, I don't want anyone to think I seek just pity from you, I'm sorry.",29Jul2020,1
257,"My favourite aunt used to be like a third parent to me, we used to talk all the time and she homeschooled me when I was unable to go to school because of my mental illness (she was a teacher.)

Now she has cancer and is at death's door. And I don't care. I suppose I haven't seen her for a while so she is no longer part of my life, but I really don't feel sad at all.

Am I numb or just a horrible person? Will I feel sad when she does pass away? Is it normal to react like this? I've never really lost anyone before and I don't know what's wrong with me.",29Jul2020,1
258,"Ever since 2 days ago I woke up and it felt like I had switched realities, almost like I astral projected and traveled through a mirror. I've been really anxious lately and this happened after I woke up from a vivid nightmare where I watched my dead dog come back to life. Now nothing feels familiar, it feels like everyone and everything is a clone and nothing feels real. It's almost like someone sculpted an exact replica of the reality I knew and all of my friends and family are look alikes who are playing roles. What is wrong with me?",29Jul2020,1
259,"I'm 16 year old guy and I have a lot of trouble expressing my emotions.

It's not because of toxic masculinity but it's more from school trauma where keeping a pokerface and keeping calm when taking insults or arguing was something I was taught to do.

The last time I cried was a month ago (before that it was at least 5 years ago) when I was having an argument with my parents about something (we had these multiple times before) and I couldn't take it anymore so my face sort of melted into a crying face and I cried somewhat properly.

I tried to suppress it soo much by not weeping and hiding my face because my mum was comforting me and I don't want other people to cry because of me. (parents are divorced and she cried a lot back then).

I keep trying to cry through watching sad media and songs but I can't get the same effect. I don't want to fall into any part of toxic masculinity as I despise it.

Thank you.",29Jul2020,1
260,"I'm Autisitc, you'd likely not be able to tell if you met me and I seem to get on with people...I just lack whatever it is that's needed to make and maintain friendships. I'm long-term unemployed, which also means no disposable income for hobbies, so I'm incredibly socially isolated. I have no family either. 

I have a boyfriend, we've been together for a year and we knew each other previously too. But I still get anxious with him, he's not into messaging so I guess I don't get enough validation from him and so that triggers insecurities I haven't had with other partners. This also means that I still get anxious around him sometimes, plus in general when we message I never know what to say as it's not like I have a life and he doesn't really ask me questions either. 

Therapy isn't an option for me - I live in the UK so it would be about a year before I was able to see a therapist, even then you only get 12 one hour sessions which are little more than chatting (I've tried therapy before and it just doesn't work). 

I don't think there's anything my boyfriend can do to help, this is definitely a me thing. What could I do to try to ease my anxiety when talking to him?",29Jul2020,1
261,"I think most people have come across the 'I can't like things in a chill way' tiktok audio by now. I was wondering how normal that is. For as long as I can remember I would be obsessed with something and then just.. jump to the next one? As you can probably tell I'm not the best at explaining either lmao

I remember /loving/ dinosaurs, and wanting books and toys etc. Then horses, pokemon, drawing, undertale,, etc. Those are older examples, but lately I've finally began to 'take notice'. I watched all marvel movies and became /obsessed/. All box sets, an online shopping list of merch, theories, wattpad books, and so on. Lately it's been plants.

Not worried, just really curious.",29Jul2020,1
262,"So my roommate speaks a foreign language, and I often hear him talking in 2 different voices.

like one voice he sounds normally, and another voice he's talking like a jolly old man. Hard to describe it, but I at first thought he had a guest or family member over, but it's just him in his room. I hear him talking like this all of the time. I've lived with people who spoke other languages before, and they've never had 2 different voices. So what could this be? I'm guessing multiple personality disorder? I don't actually know what he's saying though.",29Jul2020,1
263,Hi I’m 13 and sometimes I jerk off about taboo things like my mom. I would never do anything sexual to her but I think about it when I do it. Maybe it’s because of teenage years but could anyone help?,29Jul2020,1
264,"I know I probably dont have room to complain but all I see on social media, on TV, and just about every where else I get news and information from usually says something along these lines.


White people - bad. Straight people - bad. Men - bad. Religious groups - bad. [My opinion] - bad. 


I've been exposed to so much of people saying that people like me are inherently bad just because of who I am and the values I have. I'm seriously starting to feel like there isn't a place for me in this world anymore.


But hey, I'm just a straight white man, so who cares what I feel.",29Jul2020,1

267,"Fuck I’ve been depressed long before I moved to the states in 2012. I’m 19. I’ve been so fucking depressed it’s honestly fucking insane. The only reason why I haven’t od is because I want to go into the special forces field and because my mother would also die from the pain. I just can’t handle this man. Everyday it gets worse and worse but I find a way to push on and get through it. I signed a contract and I’m not backing away from my promises. But holy shit, if I go and get help, then I would be denied orders, if I stay and keep pushing like I am still, id make my life a living hell but I get to achieve my dream. I don’t know man, is it my thyroid enlarged or is it my fucking head. I just fucking can’t man. I try and try to make my day better by going in to help others but it only does so much. I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. Fuck this this post is retarded I’m done",29Jul2020,1
