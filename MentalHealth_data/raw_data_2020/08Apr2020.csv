0,"I’ve been in a bad mental state for a long time but I bottle everything up because if I try to talk to family members or friends they don’t believe me or get mad at me. I don’t even know what to do anymore because if I look down or act a little distant they just say things like, “Are you moody?” or “Why are you so down? Just get over it.” And if I’m watching or reading something that’s slightly depressing or anything like that they’ll just say, “Oh... is that where you get your depression stuff from?” If I try and talk to anyone they always say I’m pretending so I can please people or that what I’m feeling is just being a teenager. But I swear on my life it feels much worse. What can I do and does anyone deal with this too?",08Apr2020,1
1,"So we’re all living in this difficult time. But for some it’s even more difficult. I hate feeling like I’m in a worse position than anyone else, but it’s getting hard now. I’m a 31 year old make.

I’ve always struggled with anxiety and panic attacks. I’m also a hypochondriac to an extent. I spent most of my life living at home, having weekly therapy sessions to overcome more social problems and depression and operate like a normal adult. And I got so far. Finally bought my own house with my life savings last year and began living alone. 

It was difficult, and I relied on trips to see my mother for support. Home being a place I truly felt safe probably because I spent 30 years living there. With therapy my social anxiety pretty much left me. And I could now go shopping and do normal things with my friends. But that anxiety seemed to evolve into health anxieties. 

I’d have panic attacks and for so long thought I had heart problems. I had chest pains and difficulty breathing and thought it was lung problems. I spent a lot of time visiting the doctor, getting tests. Only to be told there’s nothing. I’ve also always worried I have DVT due to leg aches. Pretty much most of it all in my head.

My therapist narrowed it down to me finding out my mother had breast cancer in my teens. Which after being given a low chance of survival she beat. I coped terribly with it at the time and it maybe has evolved into me having my own health anxieties. That and witnessing a horrific death of a child (no relation). Or even nearly losing my healthy sister when she was giving birth to my niece, who did die being premature. Just lots of random deaths and sudden illnesses. 

It’s odd, because my depression and the pain of anxiety I had through my life. Left me feeling like I just didn’t want to wake up in this world, to live this life anymore. Which also made me feel guilty. But I was scared of dying also. Not really death itself. But how it would happen. How it would effect the people I love. So was never really suicidal, though sometimes I longed to just not wake up. 

So now, I find myself in a situation. Where I’m isolating alone with a deadly virus spreading around. That seems to be killing more and more in my country. Most of my family being in the vulnerable category. I keep having panic attacks but I can’t seek comfort. I keep thinking I’m spending too much time sat down and I’ll get DVT and die. I’m sat here alone, waiting until someone in my family catches this shit. Or I catch it. If they do catch it, the possibility I’ll never see them again.

Constantly on edge, can’t sleep. I’m a fucking mess. My family call to see how I am. And I tell them I’m fine as cheerily as I can because I don’t want them worrying or risking anything for me. I can’t tell what pains are in my head or what’s real. And I can’t be wasting the time of the NHS. So I just struggle on and cry through it.

Everyday it seems to get worse, more pains. I had such a panic attack out of nowhere last night, I thought it was a heart attack. Honestly, I usually drink a lot and smoke a lot of weed to take my mind off shit. But that’s become counter productive now and adds to the problems and emotions so I’ve been pretty clean for awhile which also adds to the problems. Can’t fucking win.

I yearn for previous times when things were still shit but not like this. When my mum had cancer, at least I could be with her. At least I could be with the people that made me feel safe and keep me grounded and save me from my own thoughts and mental spirals.

Sorry, this is so many words but I just wanted to right them down. I feel like a scumbag feeling this way and knowing people are losing family right now. I’ve always felt at war with my own mind that seems to torment me relentlessly.

Tl;dr

It’s really difficult right now being isolated alone. With anxiety, hypochondria, depression, ptsd, alcohol problems. When I rely on the people I love and their company to keep my head above water.",08Apr2020,1
2,"I know everyone is dealing with the effects of the covid shutdowns. I feel like I'm having an especially hard time.
My mood keeps swinging from angry, to apathetic, to scared, flipping through all the negative emotions, but never anything positive.
I want to feel better, I hate this, but I don't know how.
In 25, and I've had depression (and recognized it) for about a decade, and been on antidepressants for a few years less than that. But that never prepared me for this.
I desperately want to hang out with friends, but can't. I want the company of my family, but then they just annoy me and I end up leaving the room frustrated and feeling like a jackass.
Nothing I used to enjoy and take pride in doing/making interests me anymore so I have no outlet.
My brain won't stop, and it just keeps telling me how useless and lazy and pathetic I am. It's just an echo chamber.
I can't talk to my friends or family because they can't help, they are going through the same stuff (if not worse) and I don't want to add.
Both my parents still have their jobs and are working from home, my sister has been unemployed for around a year, and I still have my job too, but I'm essential and have to go into the vet clinic I work at.
I'm so sick of hearing that I'm in a privileged position, and this is all for the best, and that we don't have any choice. I KNOW ALL OF THAT, BUT GUESS WHAT, DEPRESSION, TRAUMA AND ANXIETY DONT CARE.
Those are not the sentances I need to hear, but I don't know what I do need.
I don't know how to fix this. I know I'm worrying my family and friends, which just makes things worse. 

All the way back in December, I requested a 4 day weekend in March because I knew by that point I would be heading towards burnout and compassion fatigue, and guess what? That's when my state decided to lock everything down. I had no time to decompress before I had to start right back into my job. With even less support than before.
I'm constantly worried I'm going to get sick, which is just a self fulfilling prophecy, because stress breaks down your immune system. But I'm more worried about my family getting sick. All three of the people I live with are compromised in some way. Not majorly, but enough that I'm extra worried for them.
Even in posting this, I don't know what I'm hoping for. Advice? Somewhere to anonymously scream my fears? Commiseration? I have no idea. I'm not even certian I'm in the right place for this.",08Apr2020,1
3,"It's definitely less now than before but I feel like a lot of concepts to me feel more like abstract concepts in my mind rather than a visceral, emotional understanding from experience.

4,"Like, just weird. I was diagnosed today, and I can't focus even more now. I constantly think about ADHD. That's ironic haha xD I constantly observe my symptoms, how I act, speak, if I am paying attention etc. 

I feel like I am completely different from everyone around me now. Is it normal? I have many thoughts like, it will be lasting my whole life. Should I tell about it to close people or better keep it to myself? My mother knows already and she loves to spread the news, so probably most of the people know already. I feel like family will be looking at me thinking ADHD ADHD ADHD.

Maybe it's better, because people think I am stupid. I came across as a retard 1000 times. I thought I was normal my whole life, hm... maybe only a bit weird and different, but not that much. I think my reaction is normal, like it's a serious neurological condition affecting my whole life, so I guess it's normal that I feel a bit weird. 

I will not talk about it too much, because some people don't even believe it exists. When I was seeking the diagnosis, one person said I am just lazy and if I would work more I would not have time to be bored. 

My mother was annoyed saying, if you are bored go do some work! After the diagnosis, she said, because you constantly move like crazy. They literally don't know anything about it. 

If you struggle with something, go seek help and don't listen what family says. They might say that you are making this up, you don't know what real problems are etc. But I didn't care what they were saying, because I was just feeling bad and I knew there was something wrong.",08Apr2020,1
5,"I know that many of us tend to isolate when we’re feeling anxious/depressed, but for me one of the main things that helps me come out on the other side of a depressive episode is getting out more &amp; being around more &amp; more people until I’m feeling more comfortable &amp; confident again. Right now I’m unable to do that due to this quarantine stuff &amp; everything being closed. I’m doing a little better on new meds &amp; with a new therapist, but I feel like not being able to socialize in person &amp; be out in public &amp; in different environments is keeping me from getting my anxiety under control. 

Is anyone else experiencing this? Any tips on how to deal?",08Apr2020,1
6,"Hey guys, this is my first post on Reddit, not really sure how to frame it. But I have major depression, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive traits and PTSD. I have a lot of anxiety when it comes to experimenting with medications that my psych prescribed to me as I’m frankly terrified of serious adverse effects and that puts me off from trying other treatments. Even if my current one isn’t working.

7,"When I got cancer at 18 everything stopped. I stopped cutting and stopped starving or purging. It saved me for some time. Now at 20 I am starting to cut again.

9,"Apologies for the bad grammar and run on sentences. I have no excuse I just suck at English haha 

For a bit of background, I was married to an emotionally abusive and incredibly controlling man for 12 years. I've been divorced for a few years now, but I am still dealing with the PTSD from him and other things. I've also had PTSD most of my life and because of that, I struggle with depression and anxiety. When I am in a bad mental spot, it manifests as physical pain... headaches being the most common. The last week or so, I've been struggling with these headaches, on top of some gnarly cramps. Needless to say I've been a miserable kitty. 

Now that there's some background, I want to talk about the trigger I had this morning with my partner. He's very sweet and takes care of me really well, sometimes though, he reminds me of my exhusband. Not his doing, my ex just still has too much of a hold on my life. This morning the pain wasn't bad but I am severely fatigued right now. My partner asked me ""what is wrong with you today"" now my ex used to say this all the time to me. My brain instantly went to thinking I am burden. He didn't have a tone that indicated that it was a bad thing but the words them self just hit hard. Its extra difficult with those thoughts, since I've not been working our whole relationship and he's been taking care of me financially while we wait on SSI. 

However, this is where the happy part of my story comes in. I tend to dwell in things and was trying to get the courage up to ask him if I was being a burden. Logically, I know I am not, as he tells me all the time, but in those moments it can be hard to not think it. After his shower, my chicken ass asked him, guys, the look on his face made my heartache. He told me no and that he asked because he doesn't like seeing me in pain. Guys, I wanted to cry. I never thought I'd be in a happy and healthy relationship. We have our issues but we work through them. It's weird and sometimes it scares me but in a good way.

Anyway, I just needed to share how he handled my trigger and that I didn't have a breakdown over it. WOOO small wins! haha Anyway, stay safe loves",08Apr2020,1

12,"So I am a male autistic adult, and I like to consider myself fairly informed when it comes to politics. However, it takes a big mental toll on me to have to constantly read about this sort of stuff, and sometimes I get very angry about it and I end up self-harming (cutting myself, hitting myself with shit like books and even a pan, etc.) I don’t do it to the extent where I severely harm myself, and thankfully I’ve never had to go to the hospital, but it still sucks. A lot. I know this seems fucking absurd, but that’s just how I am, and I don’t like it. 

I know I have to be involved, and I don’t want to sit by by idly as other people suffer from things like poverty, racism, etc. especially during Covid-19. However, self-harming is not productive, and it honestly hurts a lot. However, I don’t really have funds for mental health services right now, and I don’t have access to medication. I still want to do my best, though How can I balance my politics with my mental health? Thank you. 

This pandemic has been a nightmare for my mental health. I can’t even imagine what it’s like for people that are homeless, minorities, etc. My heart goes out to all of you during this time. I mean that from the bottom of my heart, and if you ever want to talk, please let me know.",08Apr2020,1

I am from the United States.  I am a 32 year old  male who has been clninically diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder, as well as Social Anxiety Disorder with Obsessive Compulsive Tendencies. 

I have just gotten permanently banned from r/politics for the second time in about 6 months for ""advocating for violence.""   In  both my  bannable offenses, I acknowledge guilt over intrusive thoughts regarding conservative politicians.

I keep on having these intrusive thoughts about conservative political figures. I know they're wrong. How can I deal with them constructively when I get shamed and punished for acknowledging them on social media?

I will never act on them. I don't want to. I don't have the stomach to. But I don't want to keep them bottled up inside. Yet, I feel like the world is pressuring me to act like they don't exist, and I know that isn't healthy.

I'm frightened, scared, and I feel like the world is telling me to keep quiet. I'm starting to have a panic attack as I type this. How can I deal with these emotions when no one will let me acknowledge them?

I'm sick of people being cruel, and of being told to act like everything is okay, and to lie to myself.

I don't know how to manage this. I feel like venting is supposed to be helpful, but I'm told not to do it wherever I turn. Am I wrong?

My parents tell me daily that I'm a failure and I don't do anything, that I only play those stupid video games even though my grades are perfect and that I actually like what I chose to do. For the past 6 months, I tried to fake my happiness. I tried to hide that I'm miserable until today when I got into a fight with my family. Now I don't even know what to think. I tried to make them understand that I need some professional help, but for them, it is a shame that their only son needs some help with his mental health. Everybody told me this is just because I'm a teenager and that it is normal, but after 3 years of humiliation, I believe it's not the case.

19,"My whole life, I have been mistreated, abused, bullied, by everyone in grade school, and even up to know, my own family.

I am 24 now, and not at a 24 year old functioning level.

I have been on medications pretty much my whole life, the most recent being for the last 8 and a half years (Oxcarbazepine \[Trileptal\] 600 MG twice a day, and Sertraline \[Zoloft\] 200 MG a day) which was originally prescribed to me for OCD. I was in a psychiatric facility when put on these, so if I refused, it could have been injected by physical force, plus I was completely unaware of any serious risks (especially the potentially long-term/permanent ones even after withdrawal) and just desperate for relief, but I know that doctors don't tell anyone about the withdrawal risks, regardless of the age of the patient. 

I just learned about the risks of PSSD, loss of emotions, loss of pleasure of any kind, impaired cognitive functioning, even loss of dreams (I've actually already experienced extents of all of these, even a complete loss of dreams for some years, it suddenly came back one day and I'll never know why, my meds were consistent as I remember).

The real serious (and long lasting, if not permanent) damage is from withdrawal of SSRIs (Sertraline/Zoloft is an SSRI, and Oxcarbazepine/Trileptal could interfere for all I know, like any other medication, there are interactions).

Back in January of this year, I was put on Bupropion SR 100 MG a day, for my rage outbursts (I still remember when they started, it was like a switch flipped overnight, I literally had a sequence of disturbing, vivid dreams, and then I just felt so full of hatred and wanted to be hurtful, and had my first rage explosion, and had a lot after too, all the way up until getting on Bupropio SR, which actually turned that rage shit off. 

My doctor asked me if I still had any amount of depression, anger, anxiety, and when I said yes (who the hell doesn't, unless they suffer that SSRI withdrawal, that is) and he immediately doubled the dose.

After a few days I was plagued with anxiety and my penis completely lost all feeling (only for a day) and my orgasms had even less feeling than before. 

I told the doctor about the anxiety (but not the sexual stuff) and he said I could go back to 100 MG. I still had very low libido (which was previously super high) for 2-3 weeks, and weirdly, super strong orgasms, that I just couldn't feel.

However, last night, I masturbated, and it felt INCREDIBLE. The stroking, and the orgasm, I never thought I'd feel sexual pleasure like that. I just wish I could actually have sex with a woman(en).

I've never had a girlfriend or sex, not even kiss, I was never a ""Chad"", nor do I want to be, I feel disgusted just from imaging myself having abs or muscles (I don't want to be OBESE, but something about the idea of being muscular makes me feel disgust, maybe it's related to my gentlefemdom fetish, I do not know).

I've thought about trying to chemically castrate myself, to rid of the urges I can not fulfill, and will not be able to anytime in the near future, if ever. But, I still feel the desire inside me, not just for sex, but love as well, a very special, what I assume to be non-mainstream, relationship (a MDLB dynamic, not strictly fetish-based of course, but it's a very important part of the relationship for me).

I have failed at ""basic"" things, I do not even have my driver license, and while I got over the fear (really it was deciding I might as well risk dying since the alternative is being physically stranded) it is still not a smooth or natural thing for me, I do not know if my confusion and uncertainty is related to the medicines or not, but I do know that just getting off of them is not an option (and in the case that it happens to me against my will, I may become severely disabled for life, I would prefer to kill myself before that can happen, which would be at most when I turn 26 and get kicked off of my parents health insurance, goddamn US health insurance reliant healthcare).

SSRI withdrawal basically strips the sense of being a HUMAN BEING away from people, for some people it's decades, or even the rest of their lives. I'm 24 and still haven't lived life, I'm unwilling to go through even a year of that SSRI PSSD and other withdrawal bullshit, not to mention my OCD probably re-surging in full severity.

I'm really starting to hate humanity as a whole, everyone bullying me my entire grade school life, my negative family, the government, politics, alt-right capitalism, doctors, ""Big Pharma"", and just wanting to completely withdraw myself from other people, nobody really talks to me anyway, and I don't feel I'm on the same level as anybody, like I'm just on a different plane of existence. 

Being a 24 year old virgin who can't drive (goddamn meme) and really don't even WANT to drive, living with my parents, just started community college, STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT AS A CAREER 100% CERTAIN, having the job of a 16 year old who's never worked or a disabled adult, I am completely insecure, have no sense of self-worth, and do not feel like I even have any business trying to interact with other people, sure as hell ain't getting a girlfriend, but not even friends. That's why I'm kind of relieved that the CV shut down everything and forced school to move online, I was socially isolated anyway, might as well be socially isolated in my own home, and not spend $10-$20 for Uber.

My family just makes me feel worse, everybody does, but I guess I deserve it, because it's somehow morally wrong to fail in life, and I'm not entitled to anything, and lack the skills or confidence to earn anything (or the motivation to feel like the effort is worth it).

I legitimately feel like most people are bad, mean, selfish, intolerant, impatient, or maybe I am really the problem, but that's still a problem.

I am still too scared to kill myself, I don't know why, I guess because I can't be 100% certain what may or may not exist after death. 

Thank You if you read my entire post (that helps provide more useful comments) I really appreciate it, if you just read the title or a small part of the details, hey, I'm not entitled to having everything I typed read. Somebody literally told me before that I am not entitled to getting replies/comments.",08Apr2020,1
20,"Sorry my title sucks. I would like to say that I would not consider myself suicidal. Even on the worst days I can still acknowledge that I have a pretty good life all things considered. Having said that though, I do have diagnosed depression and definitely a lot of unresolved mental health affairs. 

My problem is this. Any time I am upset in any way (anger, sadness, etc.) my immediate instinct is to kill myself? I know it doesn't make sense. And it isn't even out of revenge or to make the person feel guilty for upsetting me. I would never never never name names or purposefully make someone think it's their fault. 

Usually I can distract myself out of it, but there have been other times i was able. For example, there was an incident at work, and like a zombie on pilot mode I just started downing a bottle of prescription I had in my purse without even thinking and nearly landed myself in a coma. Another time I started bashing my head against the wall over and over, and it was like I couldn't feel anything at all while I was doing it. It's just all very ""automatic"".

Obviously this action is over the top and no situation warrants this. I am not suicidal but I have experienced how my brain works and I am afraid that I'll end up impulsively killing myself.",08Apr2020,1

I don't know if this is related but I recently moved to a new school and I just isolate myself like I have friends who get on the train home with me but I just go sit by myself and it's not because I don't like them I just kind of have a drive to not want to. Similar thing with talking to people I'd just say it was social anxiety but when Im actually there and talking to people I'm fine and I know id be fine so idk why I just don't want to.

26," Not good at introductions so I'll skip that. I know this is selfish but I just want someone to listen, or more so read. I'm a bit scared, but not scared like startled, it's just this looming sense of fear all the time. 
I put up covers over my windows, even though I'm on the second floor, that tall woman still sees me. I needed to write this down to calm myself down. My perception of time is sort of wonky, on account that I barely leave my room and I only have my phone as a clock. I keep hearing screaming in the woods around 9PM. It always lasts for a while. I'm not sure who it is, but it's a little kid. No one else ever seems to notice it. Maybe everyone notices but I don't knowsince I'm on quarantine. The pestilence has mostly happened in a pattern, 1720, 1820, 1920, now it's 2020. Maybe I should go out and help that kid tonight. They seem to be screaming from the woods. Sometimes there's faces on the ground who try to bite my feet. There's a person in the mirror. I don't know who it is, they're definitely not me, they appear randomly, it usually startles me too much to scream. There's a thing on the ceiling. It's nice but I don't trust it. I can't tell it's gender since it speaks with the voice of a man and a woman at the same time.

29,"First of all I know I probably sound really selfish right now, but I've been kinda bothered lately so here we go I don't even know where this will lead :/ 

All of my friends from school are able to afford going out to eat, or going shopping and buying new things. I'm way too cheap because I'm terrified my money will run out.. but lately it got to the point where I will often only eat once or twice a day and it's mostly cereal or bread... I know it's not healthy but  I have a hard time buying things $10 or over...even when I can ""afford"" things I've always been money conscious because I have 6 siblings (I'm the middle child), + we had foster kids in the house (I loved them all). Pretty much everything I got growing up was second hand... we were like the Weasley family in Harry potter... most of my clothes had gone through my 3 older sisters and often some of my cousins. 

I have had various jobs over the years and so thankfully I could get new clothes (I would still get them at times growing up, but it was fairly rare), but because Uni has been such a struggle I couldn't do both, and I'm not even sure if I'll be able to get a job this summer due to the Covid pandemic.. so I will eventually run out of the little money I have from student loans I'm not sure I'll even be able to afford food by the end of the summer if things don't change... I don't think I could bare to ask my parents for help because I've been on my own for years and they already work so hard. I don't know what to do...  on top of that I know it's silly and superficial but I like to draw and I've been really wanting to get a drawing tablet to connect to my computer but I'd feel really guilty because buying one would just be stupid at this point... even if its just $30...and my laptop has been falling apart so I don't know how much longer that will last anyways... I fixed it but I'm not sure if it will hold together aha...  

TRIGGER WARNING: AND here is my life story rant... you don't have to read it I just kept going cause I'm feeling kinda done right now.

Also I definitely need therapy and needed it for a long time due to various and serious traumas, and an anxiety disorder... but I can't afford it right now. The Uni does provide a few sessions, but due to the pandemic they were cancelled, and I think I'm going to go crazy because my flashbacks, depression and anxiety have gotten worse recently. Of course I never told any of my family about my mental struggles because A. my mum and dad had way too much on their plate and B. I was the good independent middle child who was also emotionally left out growing up. My mum says I was the happiest, quietest and easiest to raise... in hindsight I had depression and anxiety, but I didn't feel like anyone was approachable enough to talk with, so I spent the majority of my time in the upstairs closet where i could be alone with a book or when I finally got my own room holed up there... 

  I only really remember my mum and dad hugging me when my friends would die... I have had  7 pass away over the years, and although the first died in grade 5 it wasn't until grade 10 that they actually started hugging me more... I guess it was because 4 of them died at once and they knew their parents well too... when I was in grade 5 my little sister got into an accident (kinda my fault) her Achilles tendons were both severed and she was millimetres away from hitting an artery. The surgeon said that if it had gone any deeper she would have died before we made it to the hospital... miraculously she was able to recover. We were also in the middle of a move so my parents had a lot on their plates at the time, and some of my foster siblings who lived with me for years got to go back to their grandparents... I never really got to see them again, but tbh this happened a lot, but that was one of the first times it did... and NO ONE else in my family seemed to care! I was heartbroken, but  I never felt like I could show my parents or my siblings because they just continued as if nothing happened... this ended up being a pattern, but there was just a lot going on back then. 

Then throughout jr. high/high school my mum's friend got hit by a car while jogging and died, my other friend's dad had a heart attack and died, my cousin was in a coma because the his heart had stopped for a bit and they didn't know what was wrong with him ( later discovered it was Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) and my bff's grandparents who I also knew died in a car crash, my sisters bff/my friend died the year I graduated in January 2014. Then on a happy note my little brother's adoption went through and my sister's wedding was happening. My mum was pretty overwhelmed by these events when we got an emergency call to take a baby (there was no where else they could place her so we agreed to take her in)... so I took her during the days, my mum took her at night. I loved that baby... when she left I felt that my own baby was taken away. Those months were so precious, but I'll never see her again. I hope she is okay. There was a break in incidents thankfully... 

Things were finally looking up I left home in September 2015 and went on a 19 month full-time volunteer mission trip.. had crazy experiences, got back then started going to UNI...got my first and only boyfriend, he cheated on me after a year of dating. Then I had a guy friend who ended up moving in with me for four months ... without my permission... it was hell. I now can say I've seen the devil, he was so manipulative and abusive... I hate that I didn't just call the police in the first place, I was terrified of him though, but I sympathized with him at the same time. I stupidly didn't think it was an option. Thankfully another friend became suspicious, and got help... I don't know where I would be without his support. Then in April 2019 another one of my old high school friends died from a blood clot... she just dropped at work, they didn't know she had it. It was scary because 2 weeks prior I was scrolling through FB and wondering who would be next to die ... I'm at the point where if someone doesn't die every few years I am on edge because I just get this ominous feeling that someone is going to die... the scary thing was is I stopped on her photo and I just had the strongest impression it would be her... we hadn't even hardly talked since high school so it's not like she would have popped up for any reason... but two weeks later she died... 

This year was the first in a while that I felt I could start to breathe but then I realized that I am not okay... I have a tremor in my hands and it gets so bad when I'm anxious that I drop things. Most people I know don't know anything really about me, and when I tell them I just feel like they don't understand anything, and I can't connect! There's too much! I guess I hurt too much, but I don't let them know, lots of them think we are great friends, and I'm funny. The more they get to know me the more morbid my humour tends to get... my movie tastes are extremely dark now and often emotionally disturbing. My friends often won't even watch stuff with me anymore... I get it, but I just wish someone could without bias... but sometimes I disgust myself when I think about it too much, One time I was at a party and we were talking about movie suggestions so I mentioned a few of mine... my friend laughed that the reason why I watched dark things was because it was the only way I could feel... she was just joking, and I just laughed along with her but she was actually correct... that is what happened, although she will never know that. I wish I had just kept my mouth shut. I worry that God is sad when I watch dark things and constantly make mistakes... I've been around death, and miracles enough to know he exists, but it makes me anxious when I feel like I'm disappointing him... often I hate myself, although I know he loves me... he's the only one that gets me, and I know I'm priceless to him. I pray a lot and I feel that he hears and actually understands, he is the only reason I've managed to continue living, I owe him everything, but I hate that I constantly mess up... I wish I could just live to make him proud without breaking his heart in the process. I honestly don't know if there is anyone in the physical world who would actually get what I went through... even my siblings don't relate to me because most of the incidents happened to people I knew and they didn't... or they just didn't seem to care that much most of the time. I am sick of crying alone, but I hate the attention when I try to share and people just pity me, but I also long for it, I don't know why maybe because I think that somehow we may connect... and I may find someone who actually understands and then maybe I can cry in front of someone and not feel humiliated... If anyone did read this thank you, I know it sounds like I'm whining but I just needed someone to hear me... even though u don't know me... I'm not like this in person I swear aha.. I mean ya I'm awkward, but I'm pretty and upbeat lol... you were just the victim of my hidden self...sorry. I had finally gotten up the courage to go to therapy,  :/ but stupid covid :(... Anyways Sorry that I ranted so much... Thanks again for listening.",08Apr2020,1

This is my first post, but I have seen some really encouraging stuff in this community so far. I'm really hoping for some advice from anyone who feels they can help.

I'm 33 years old and have suffered from anxiety and depression for most of my life. I'm in ciprolex and a low dosage of seroquel. Even on the medication I feel the following everyday:

- anxiety
- no desire to do anything
- no interest in anything
- can't maintain focus on any specific task
- constantly worrying about everything

Socially I enjoy seeing friends and engaging in conversation for the most part, but only after my wife forces me to go out. I feel like I'm gradually getting worse and I can't seem to figure out what the answer is. I've been on SSRI's for years and I can't shake this.

36,"Envy is a new emotion to me, and I don’t know how to handle it

My situation is kinda fucked. Very fucked compared to the situations that my “friends” (they are the closest I have to friends right now) come to me with as the source of their problems and worries. But I’ve always been a very empathetic and caring person, and in turn have always been very sympathetic and supportive. I’ve always been big on the idea that pain is relative, and no matter how small someone’s issue is, if that’s the worst they’ve been through then it hurts them in a similar way that the worst pain I went through hurt me. I’m sure I acted like it was the end of the world when I went through my worst pain just like they are.

However, lately, I’ve only felt annoyed and frustrated when people come to me with their problems. Maybe it’s because I’m coming off of all of my medications for the first time in years and my emotions are very different now because of it, but whatever the cause, this is a very new and sudden emotion to me, and I feel guilty for feeling it. I don’t show it to them because I know it’s wrong to dismiss and invalidate their emotions, but honestly I’ve been getting pissed off when they come to me with their stupid and fickle issues, saying how horrible it is for them. They need to just suck it up and get the fuck over it. I don’t pity them; I envy them. I wish so much to be in their situation, that my worst problem has such a small impact on my whole life. 

And now I feel completely hypocritical and all woe-is-me, because am I in the worst situation? Fuck no, it could definitely be so much worse. I’m sure a lot of you could tell me to suck it up and get the fuck over it. And I feel guilty for being so harsh to people in my head, when I’ve always been so kind and understanding.

Sorry this is so unorganized and unprocessed. I’m just very confused and overwhelmed with my strange new emotions. I don’t even know what I’m looking for from posting this. Validation? Help understanding it? Just what do you think of this? Am I turning into an asshole? Idk. Thanks.",08Apr2020,1
37,"So before my mom was with my father she was married to a horribly abusive man. I mean, truly horrible. From what she’s shared with me over my life he used to hold a gun to her head, and wake her up at night by plugging her nose and holding his hand over her mouth to almost smother her because he was a monster and thought it was fun. Luckily she got out of that situation and hopefully that man is dead or in prison forever. Growing up we couldn’t have balloons because if they popped they terrified my mother, and she has never been able to wear a scarf or have anything over her face.

My mom has gotten around her issues with things on her face with minimal issue for the most part. She just gets a lot colder in the winter. She does have pretty bad undiagnosed sleep apnea that she can’t get treatment for though. She did a sleep study and when they tried to fit the cpap to her she absolutely wigged and left the sleep clinic. She knows apnea is bad for her health and increases her risk of other issues but refused to see a therapist to try to work through it at that point because it didn’t seem worth it to her.

So now we are at the point with covid where it looks like mask wearing is going to become necessary and maybe even required in some places and she is panicking. She said she tried to practice with a bandana at home and started tearing up when telling me about it. I did not ask for details but she said it did not go well.

I don’t know what to do for her. I know she should see a therapist, but with everything going on getting anything other than telehealth appointments isn’t possible or even a good idea and I don’t know if those would be as effective. She says she almost wishes she would have done the therapy for the cpap in the past now, but we obviously didn’t foresee this in the future. She is in her late 60s and I want to keep her safe during all of this. Does anyone have any creative mask alternatives that are looser/ don’t need to tie or fit as snugly? Any therapy recommendations? How can I support her?

TLDR; my mom probably has undiagnosed ptsd from past trauma that makes her unable to have things over her face. How can I help her acclimate to wearing a mask?",08Apr2020,1

Over the course of 7 months i have had an almost ''Autistic'' obsession with sunrise and sunsets, i've been so obsessed with the transition from night to daylight, that engaging in timelapse videos gave me intense pleasure and i would ''Stim'' when engaging in this, it is important to note i have a condition (Mild Intellectual disability but suspected autism). I've become so obsessed with this interest to the point it turned into an impairing OCD obsession.

During the night time, i wait for the sunrise like a child waiting the night before Christmas, and i get so caught up about what the time is, which paradoxically makes the time go much slower. This wasn't really an issue when the sun would set around 8:00-9:00 PM in summer (although i still obsessed), 2 days ago here in Australia the clock changed back and it now gets dark at 6:00 PM, i spend all that time from sunset to bedtime obsessing about the next ''Sunrise'' and this obsession causes me to feel unreal, disconnected, numb, down, and like i am in a alternate time portal,my time perception goes much slower. The clock changed as i am in the south and it is going to be Winter in June. I have never experienced seasonal obsessions before so it is very unlikely that this is Seasonal affective depression. I've been diagnosed with OCD, MID, BPD, and DP/DR traits.

I don't expect anyone to understand (Including my therapist) as i am a dumb disabled fuck but please respond and try to read my post and spare a minute.

Also wanted to mention that i have had DP/DR about other things in the past too but it is mostly a side effect of OCD, so the goal here is to stop obsessing = stop DPDR",08Apr2020,1
44,"**Background:**

I was diagnosed 3 years ago with bipolar, after a mental break that had me hospitalised for over a month. A year later I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder having a second episode - not similar to the last - and another hospitalisation. 

For 3 years I have been slowly gaining my personality, social capabilities and motivations back. It was a long recovery and many times I didn't think I would see the end of it but somehow I have come back healthier and am back on solid ground with a rational mindset.

**Current:**

Throughout my recovery I was volunteering full time for a charity. This was the closest option available to me for work purposes. This did not disturb my mental health conditions and I have stayed well during this time.

January of this year I got a full time job. I work for a government base call centre and offer welfare advise and support. Until last week I was in good spirits and felt mentally well. 

As of last Tuesday I no longer feel that way. I have had two panic attacks whilst at work, am dissociating from my surroundings and have days at a time where I feel disconnected. I have spoken to my case manager who has advised that I decrease my hours to half, take extra breaks (at approval of management), bring some things to help me feel grounded like stress balls or similar items.

  
Anyway I guess what I want to know is do any of your have techniques to help you stay mentally healthy whilst working? I am wanting to keep my job I do not want to be out of work. Any strategies and tips I would love to have them. At this point I am feeling very disheartened and worried that my health conditions are going to have me giving up work.

Note: as my diagnosis is quite new I am still learning what my triggers are, what my conditions may present as and what affects my every day life. Prior to my original diagnosis 3 years ago I had no previous mental heath conditions, worked full time, completed school and had normal social interests.",08Apr2020,1
45,"All things happen bad to me, I always don't win something and have to experience the bad side of life.. While my friends just win everything. I went on a break down when I was playing a game (self-isolated)  because I used to be good until my mood came along, and this happens when I start getting into what I like. 

And what happened while I was on a breakdown was  


* When I spilled a little water, I spilled it all over my pants on purpose because life **loves** me.  

* Whenever I just started being bad at something I took 5 seconds off to hit my head with a spoon and saying ""will this stop making me dumb?""
* I started thinking about how I would live with nonstop failure.

I also had this moment like a year ago.

I feel like it's my mindset that is causing me to feel bad and get worse at activities. For example, when I was doing some art course, I nearly ripped my paper in half because I just couldn't stop finding bad things and nothing positive. And this could be a different condition but I did a test on stress, anxiety, and depression... and my depression was severe-extreme (I redid the test 3 times)  


I just don't know how to describe it... it's like life just sent me into a pit of failure and envy while I get to look at people living the good life. In conclusion, I just need to change my mindset and figure out what stabs my heart emotionally at random times as well as stop my anger.

We are in no way, shape, or form a licensed therapist group, or psychiatrist. This is just  a spot where you can feel safe, let us know you are having a bad day, and have others around you who are probably going through the same thing. I may have suggestions and opinions but I am not a professional. I'm just a guy with a community who likes to stay pretty positive and open the stigma around discussing mental health.

54,"I've noticed that theres been multiple instances where I get unreasonably angry at my BF. He'll say something that is at most mildly annoying yet I feel this intense hot anger inside of me where I want to retort by saying really really hurtful things. I've been trying to deal with it by ""cooling off"" for a minute before speaking but often times it doesn't help and I'll end up saying something regrettable. We've been together for over two years and I love him to death. I'm terrified of messing up the relationship by saying something I don't mean. 

I have thought a lot about why I feel like this and I think it stems from how my parents and I communicate. Dinners together often end in a fight because in my family the smallest conflict is blown out of proportion. I notice that my parents get into fights this way as well. Often times casual conversations with my mom will escalate so quickly that looking back on it I'm unsure of who even started the fight or why we were fighting. 

I don't think I can afford therapy and even if I could I'm not sure that my issues are bad enough to be worth it. Its not something that necessarily effects my life every single day but I really hate this angry, hurtful side of me. And I'm starting to resent my parents because I feel like they raised me to be like this through the way they communicate with each other.",08Apr2020,1
55,"Last year I was in a really deep state of depression and I was extremely suicidal. Every night I would want to kms, but this one person helped me every night. At one point I tried and failed, ended up in the hospital. When the doctor asked me why I responded with ""Household, constant screaming and mean jokes when talking to me, also because I'm trans"". They took the last part of that and worked on it. Even now I don't feel like I belong in my house. The screaming calmed down a little but I still get very bad panic attacks and/or it trigger my fight, flight, freeze response. Everytime I talk about my depression or anxiety my parents have brought up excuses: ""you just cant control your emotion"", ""your just unstable"". It was never their fault. I was bullied and one of the things they deny saying is that I deserved it. They told me this as a kid, no wonder I have BPD like symptoms since I was a child. Also a few year back I was fine with hugs and people touching me out of nowhere. I dont recall what happened but I know something did and now everytime someone touches me I jump and I can feel the exact spot where someone touched me.

56,"Within the last couple of weeks being completely quarantined inside of my home with my immediate family, I have realized that I never truly found a way to work through my depression and anxiety but rather suppress it through my daily routines and life goals. 

I’m very career driven and I tend to associate my lack of “happiness” due to not being where I want to in my life. becoming a workaholic and staying busy has given me tools to distract myself and learn how to “get over” things quickly rather than work through them. I’ve realized these moments in quarantine have not only become my quietest hours but my darkest... I don’t know how get myself out of a headspace of hopelessness and uncertainty. I feel suffocated, my anxiety has become so stressful it has been making me nauseous. 

If anyone is experiencing a heightened sense of depression and anxiety and would like to share their experience and or some advise,  I’m all ears.

58,"I just want to start off by saying that because of the home I am being raised in and because of cultural beliefs, I have not been able to speak to a profesional about this meaning that I have not been diagnosed but I still feel like what my mind goes through isn’t right. At the same time I don’t want to seem like an edgy teenager self diagnosing themself so I truly do not mean to offend anyone.
I’ve tried so hard to find an escape. A year ago I was abusing substances that would numb me and take me away from my problems. I got  caught and my parents, specifically my mom, say it’s my fault and she won’t ever let me live it down. It wasn’t anything extremely bad, but they had found out I was juuling and that was bad enough for them. Had they known what the other thing was, their reaction would have been undeniably worse. I don’t think I would have ever turned to those habits had I not been wanting to escape the life I live for the past five years. Everyday for that last five years I’ve wanted to leave this place. Go somewhere where I can actually live. My only escape now is sleep. My dreams obviously are the illusions I’ll never have but they’re not real. Waking up is fine but only for that split second where I don’t know where I am or who I am. For that split second I’m actually glad to be awake but then I remember. I remember who I am and where I am. I remember that I have to repeat the same cycle every single day. Maybe it’s not right to call it a cycle because she might be in a good mood for once but I always manage to ruin it. I don’t mean to but she just makes it so hard to keep everything right. She is the cause of almost all my problems. I hate talking about what started it all because it’s so stupid and any other normal parent wouldn’t have overreacted the way she did. It’s only because of the cultural and traditional upbringing she and my dad were brought up with and the same one she’s trying bringing us up with that make any situation worse. The situation was basically in the fifth grade when I had a close friend who happened to be a boy and of the same background as us. He and I were very close because we were best friends. We were children. And one day he happened to be in the same room as my parents and told them that I had written him love letters. I never did that but my parents, more specifically my mom, didn’t believe me. That friendship was ruined but that’s something for another day. Anyways, my mom reacted like I committed a crime and basically said that she was ashamed to have had me and regretted even having me as a daughter. All because of something she assumed to be true no matter how many times I tried telling her that it never happened. The words that came out of her mouth five years ago were the same words that made me want to end my life. At twelve years old. Not once but twice. I wanted to end my life so I could stop hurting inside. But I didn’t because that would be too easy. She would just manage to blame it all on me. And it seems like my dad is the only light I have in my life. I have tried talking to him about what I feel and he tries his best to help but his best is sitting me down in a room with my mom and telling us that we need to sort things out and they always end up worse. I would feel horrible hurting him but sometimes that feeling isn’t enough. She would continue for the next few years saying she wished I was never born or that I would be better off dead for mistakes that anyone does. I tried to reason with myself saying that she probably didn’t mean it in the moment but even if she didn’t say it with meaning it, how is that better? How am I supposed when she does and doesn’t mean something? How am I supposed to deal with it? What makes hurting inside worse is no one knowing what you’re feeling. My mind was always in a dark place and only recently had I started feeling like I was finally over it. For five years I carried a constant weight in my mind and when I finally decided to let everything out to them and tell them that it was really her that was the cause of my problems I was ignored. My problems and thoughts were brushed off as “normal teenager behavior” and “it’s all a part of being a woman”. What is normal about wanting to take your life twice because of the words and attitudes your mother radiates? What’s normal about turning to drugs as a way to escape your thoughts that have been following and torturing you? I just wish my mind was normal and didn’t feel suffocated.",08Apr2020,1
59,"worst of all, it was my mom who said it. I'm used to hearing this very thing, but not from here. I've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and depression by 4 different doctors and a sleep disorder by two. she's been there for almost all of them, but today when she and my dad were berating me for sleeping too much and i reminded them that i have GAD/depression and its exhausting to have these, she just shrugged it off. then my dad proceeded to go on and on about how i need to taper off my meds because they were a crutch and i was weak for needing them. 

&amp;#x200B;

it hurt. MY brother has bipolar disorder and my parents never tease him about his symptoms or meds. they never tell him to get off his meds. just because im semi-functional i should be invalidated? 

&amp;#x200B;

Worse, when i told them they were hurting my feelings they got all mock offended and pretended i was being too sensitive. im sorry i sleep a lot. im sorry i need a nap to get through the day. you don't tease someone for needing an inhaler or glasses without being a dick. teasing someone for needing to do things differently to function is just rude. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's so hurtful when they berate me for needing a nap. I have a diagnosed sleep disorder! exhaustion is a prime symptom of GAD/Depression! i do my work. i clean the barns for my mom every morning and muck stalls and do my college work and work on my writing but just because i need a 2 hour nap to function and sleep longer on my days off, im lazy. they barge into my room and wake me up and give me a hard time when i have difficulty waking up early and always laugh at me when i say it's nap time and excuse myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Like i figured out a schedule that lets me function. i figured out how to work without being so tired i cry or needing to sleep every hour of the weekend to recover. then my mom gets on to me about how i'll never function in normal society and how am i going to get ""a real job"" if i have to nap all the time and i get it, she's saying this because she's worried about me, but i'll figure it out! hopefully i can get flexible work hours or work from home. or i can push my sleep schedule to where i nap as soon as i get off work instead of around 2 pm. i'm not incapable, but she makes me feel that way. i feel weak and like a failure. i try to hard to work with my mental illness, not against it, but they just want me to be ""normal"". 

I can't be my version of happy, I have to be their version. 

&amp;#x200B;

They're good parents on almost everything else and they just are acting out of my best interest, but i've tried to explain a million times by now what its like for me and how hurtful they are being and they just don't seem to be able to understand. how can they take my brother's mental illness seriously and my sister's depression seriously but not mine? i'm just very sad today and frustrated. the quarantine is making me feel especially trapped and lonely. 

&amp;#x200B;

61,"hi so i know this prob belongs in relationship advice but i think you guys can help me out too.

so my girlfriend is sort of an ""influencer"" on social media and she tends to get a lot of attention from other guys due to her being really pretty. sometimes when she posts stuff it tends to come off as shes looking for attention. i know that not everything a girl posts is for attention but when she changes her outfits in order to take these pictures/videos for social media while when shes with me she constantly wears baggy clothes and even when we go out, she doesnt wear anything remotely similar to what she does when shes taking these pictures/videos for social media. and yes we have talked about it, and her explanation is always that shes doing it for herself and i can understand that bc again shes a pretty girl.

maybe im looking too far into this with how insecure i am that shes really out of my league but sometimes it hurts. bc it even gets to the point of her not responding to my texts but shed post on social media and that kinda triggers me.

any advice on how to cope with a significant other being liked and hit on by everyone that knows her or just sees her. slowly losing my mind. and yes again we have talked about this too and she always reassures me that shes not gonna leave me for anyone else but when i see the small little actions that she does it triggers tf out of me.",08Apr2020,1

64,"[M 19] I have always been a quiet person, ever since I was young. When people talk to my through text or in person I normally don't feel the need to verbally respond. A few days ago my father told me about how I tested borderline on the autism spectrum, and I am not to certain on what that means in terms of my mental understanding of certain things. I have always been horrible with social queues, and have never been the conversationalist. I have never struggled with social anxiety out of the normal (like talking to a crush). But I never really felt like it was worth it to put myself in those situations. I noticed that I tend to 'scope out' someones personality to determine if I can click with them. Also, over the past year or two I have had strong interests in having a person I connect with in my life, but in reality I don't know how to start to get to know someone, or rarely have the ambition to get to know someone. I have a few friends, two that I talk to semi-normally. However, I feel like those relationships are not that strong even though I care about my friends, I just don't feel like they are a necessary part of my life. And to be honest I have felt that way about family members as well.

I've had this terrible trait that is lying often times uncontrollably and generally without even having a reason. This has been going on for as long as I can remember (one of my earliest childhood stories I can think of contains a horrible lie \[granted at the time, I had no idea the scale of what I was claiming, but I also really had no reason to be saying it\].)

It's a trait that I truthfully do hate about myself, I will often times find myself telling somebody a completely fictional story and catch myself half way through the story and think ""WTF am I even doing or saying?"", as if I've got zero control over it.

It's honestly at a point where I've been finding myself laying in bed more and more just thinking WTF is wrong with me, I've got a whole life time of spun webs and pointless fibs that served zero purpose and, well quite frankly it scares me a little.

The funny thing is, I don't like being lied to which also just makes me feel like a larger piece of shit.

&amp;#x200B;

Apologies for what may be a wall of text, but could real use some input here as I've not really spoken to anybody about this.",08Apr2020,1
85,"Writing in simple sentences and poor grammar because I'm tired.

I only ask teachers and school staff questions or anything similar to that. I force myself to speak to other students when I have to. There has been no school for almost a month.

I usually talk to my family a little but I talk to them less as the months go by. 

Because of covid-19, I started to have abnormal sleeping pattern. I usually wake up around 4-6 pm now and this made me talk to them less.

Im aware this is extremely unhealthy of me to shut myself from the world like that. But I kind of feel trapped isolating myself. 

I would like to get help but covid-19, lack of transportation, being part of the lower middle class, and being underage is preventing me. And I don't have a lot of people to talk to about this.

I never talked to anyone about this until now.

Again, sorry for the poor grammar. This post might be confusing to some people.

Edit: I forgot to mention I mostly talk to people online though. But those aren't good replacements. Just replies.

Honestly I try my best not to end up like r/justlegbeardthings (like having schizophrenic relationships with fictional characters). But not taking a very Legbeard™ trait I have and I feel ashamed of it. This makes sound vain but I just don't want to have more unhealthy behaviors, like using celebrities and/or fictional characters as an replacements to real people, than this. I don't need more problems.",08Apr2020,1
86,"We've been friends for two years. We play games every night and he's my best friend. The only one in fact.

What makes me so uncertain is because he never asks if I'm ok. I don't *really* hide that I'm depressed. But I don't say it either. It's kind of me just being dead silent when we play games, barely laugh at jokes and just exist. But he sometimes crack a dumb joke that just makes me laugh and he brings the mood back up ~~until he goes to bed and I'm just sat alone again~~. And I don't know what to make of it. 

I'm terrified what will happen if I open up. If he just says ""well this is awkward, I don't really care"", how do I just transition from my position of vulnerability to just being casual friends again? I guess I'm just scared if my best friend doesn't think I'm his either.

I’m a hip-hop manager, i have things to do even with this pandemic going on, and it makes me so much less productive. Because i need to be high 24/7. That isnt a way to live. 

Today, i woke up and felt terrible, as i did the night before, except worse. I went on my snapchat and posted 5 snaps, and i don’t really remember what i was talking about cause my mind was going so fast. But they were rants that obviously showed how ill i was becoming, they were cries for help and i realize that cause i’m high. I deleted snapchat though, and deleted those snaps i posted to save myself from embarrassment. I just really want somebody to care, because i have so many friends but all of them seem to know how ill i am and rather not be involved. 

I wish i could get diagnosed and get my medication. I genuinely have so much hopes for my future, i’m passionate. I love what i do and i wanna do this for the rest of my life. But it feels like there will be nothing for me if i can’t get this dealt with.

I was watching a movie and went to bed. I fell asleep but woke up a short time after. 
I was awake but I didn‘t really know what my situation was or who I really was. I didn‘t realize I was just lying in my bed and that everything was ok. I was convinced that I was in danger and that I had to solve a problem. I was feeling like a different person in a different situation. I had to solve the problem that was also appearing in the film I watched. This state lasted around 2 minutes. 

I tried to calm myself down and looked around my bedroom to convince myself that there was nothing to worry about and I tried to go back to sleep. I figured that would solve the problem.

""Can you repeat what you just said"" was even at school - often to the surprise of teachers - answered by "" no sorry , just lost it"".  Its so odd that this didnt show in the tests. 

My question is how i could tackle this problem outside atypical neuroleptics. My physician said that due to my concurrenr treatment of autoimmunity, these meds right now are ""out of the question"".

I always am terribly paranoid that everyone in the world can hear my thoughts and then once I start thinking about it I subconsciously begin thinking terrible and offensive things without meaning to, this sometimes also happens when I look at some one(this also makes me think I have thought insertion) and then I get more anxious and panicky because if they can hear my thoughts, then they’re hearing these terrible things running through my head. This then makes my brain think more like that and it just spirals out of control. I’ve always been super paranoid cos I swear I whisper when I speak or speak under my breath when I don't want to, I have heard people laugh right after my thought and sometimes say shit on purpose to get a reaction out of them and I have done sometimes

Hello, I’m 15 going on 16 and here’s a problem that’s haunted me the entirety of my life at this point.

Some background, I grew up in an old town in New York. My mother has raised me right and taught me right from wrong which translates how I treat people with respect to this day. I have one sister that has a mental disability that can’t care for herself and doesn’t have the development past 2 years old. My biological father left me at a young age but I know true to myself that didn’t have any effect on me. I have known my, now, stepdad since 2012-13 so about when I was 8-9.

Around the age of 6, maybe 7, I noticed that I wouldn’t enjoy childhood activities like other kids would. I’d have negative thoughts of reality and the dark truth of the world didn’t seem to effect my friends. I’d always put it away and just act like they would but whenever family or friends would bring me somewhere, there’d always be someone there or something there that would make me feel bad. I was observant so that could stem out to present-day where I can find a motive for a good majority of what everyone does. I’d cry myself to sleep over these bad thoughts and I unknowingly taught myself the first few years to occupy myself to distract my isolated mind. Again, due to not having a sibling that I could necessarily interact with at my age, I’d have some time to myself. I got attention from my parents and received normal care. This time to myself would be nightmarish. Total isolation in my mind and I’d be stuck on things that had happened days, weeks, months ago and think; “why did this person act like this?” or “Why can’t I be happy like everyone else?”. Again, I’d counter this by occupying myself.

A few years pass and I move to California when I was a few months away from turning 10 and I still have this issues. Around this time, to me it was like “alright, these thoughts will go away when I’m older”. Nothing new for the next few years. When I got into 7th grade is when it was different, except I realized the thoughts were something everyone would have if they were idiotic enough to overthink things like myself. But now it was something different, I realized so many were so distanced from reality. Here I am, 10th grade spending half of it in quarantine having these godawful thoughts more and more with time to myself. I still feel now that people don’t have the same sense of reality as I do but I don’t speak of it to anyone because it feels as if it’s a curse. I am a sympathetic person and that would explain why I’d feel gloomy if I’d think about something bad happening. I feel so much more awake then everyone else, I know other people are intelligent but I don’t know what my issue is that I am more aware of everything around me. Everything including personality, ways people respond to events, etc. Any help or recommendation to another subreddit would be great. Thanks for your time.",08Apr2020,1
106,"I almost never felt like i am a part of humanity. I do not understand them, no matter how hard i try.

For me life is neverending nightmare, and it will never become better, only worse. Everything i love dies or about to die in the future, and i myself will feel worse and worse, awaiting my death sentence. I could not imagine a worse torture than understanding of this, but seems like most of the people do not care. They do not want to scream for help, they do not want to wake up from this nightmare in a sane, rational world.

Instead of focusing world's efforts to defeat death, or find the ways to explore the universe and find out it's secrets, or at least on making fine art to make their lives better they mostly spending money on creating weapons to kill each other, or tools to spy on each other, to control each other. They saving insane amount of resourses that they won't spend in thousand lifes while other people starve and live in extreme poverty. They wasting money on various types of dick measurings, trying to show who has more expencive trousers or yacht. They are worshiping on money, thinking that the person who has more money are automaticly better than someone who has none. If you want to create something beautiful and meaningful - it does not matter, but if you want to create a complete shit, but also have a buisness plan that says it will bring giant profits - you will have their support. Many people doing completley meaningless work that serves nobody, just because they are getting paid for it. Even more people are constantly abiding to some made-up norms and social rituals that do not make any sense, everyone understands that, but they still complete them like a robots without even trying to ask why they should do this. 

They also worship on authorities, believing that the president and a homeless dude life's aren't equal, and eager to believe anything that people with authority saying to them, even if it's an obvious lies. Talent does not matter, only money and connections, and that is why there are so many horrible art being made. Humanity even  allows people who took away their basic freedoms to rule them. Evil has won - world is ruled by soulless corporations, and criminals becoming mass media heroes. People making scandals because somebody assumed someone's gender, but turning the blind eye on countries where people are brutally murdered for being somehow different from the others or not abiding stupid laws. 

The world feels like... hell. Everything and everyone around doing something that does no make sense, hurting each other instead of trying to make our lives a bit less intolerable, so we all could forget about impending doom and spent our last time in this world on doing something meaningful or at least enjoyable. It feels like entire society are carefully planned to torture it's inhabitants. 

But as if that wasn't enough, i also never saw people like me, who would believe in same things as i do, who would like same things as i do - everything from beauty standards and fashion, and up to the rites and laws that's a common standard in society feels wrong to me, because i like the very different things and have different standards. In my 32 years of life i never had long converstions with someone even on the internet, simply because there is nothing to talk about, everyone feels very distant and alien, like they are from another species. I always envied people who somehow find common interests, and band together to create magnificent things, sharing a common vision and passion. Meanwhile, in almost 20 years of trying people from the art industry i want to get in never even wanted to look at the results of my work, simply assuming that a person without big name or connections cannot do anything good. And i am so tired from those thousands failed attmepts to find my place in this world, to at least do something i enjoy (and in process share my thougts and messages with humanity) while waiting for my sentence, that i simply lost the spark. I never saw the point of anything in my life, but before i at least had hope that one day i will put my talent to work. Now i can just sit there and wait until life will be finally over - i cannot end it myself because nobody will take care of my cats. I do not have anything else in life because i am not ambitious and have very limited list of interests, so right now i am just... existing, trying to not think about... everything. But constant pain from physical disability makes even that task a hard one. Why my brain just can't be like everyone's else, like normal things, live a simple life, and do not care about anything?",08Apr2020,1
107,"Hi, I’m (F) (17) and I was diagnosed with severe depression, panic disorder and generalised anxiety in early December. 

It was a massive step to be able to actually get a diagnosis, after having friends become angry with me for isolating myself when it is all I knew how to do in order to hide how I was feeling from them. I was consistently told by them I needed help, so I went and got the diagnosis. 

When I was diagnosed with severe depression, I remember feeling relieved that I knew but also shocked because I’d never actually thought that I was that bad. The truth is, I was bad. My thoughts are and were constantly intrusive and I was constantly trying to think of ways to end my life. The doctor told me he was so glad I didn’t and told me I reminded him of a princess (: 

Part of this, I believe, stems from my one year physically and emotionally abusive relationship with my ex boyfriend. He controlled every aspect of my life. Once we broke up, I would not leave my bed. I refused to eat. I refused to go anywhere. I would only sit and cry. I knew these to be typical symptoms of heartbreak, so it couldn’t possibly be depression. I let it hurt. 

Once these types of episodes became more often, I knew something wasn’t right with me. I think I was left traumatised from that relationship, the anxiety and panic attacks all began when I was 13. It is safe to say I had been struggling for some time but considering the stigma around mental health for that age, I pushed it off as I thought I would be seen as attention-seeking.

One of my worst triggers is actually the mentioning of mental health AT ALL. I don’t know why. I don’t know what it is. When my school would have mental health conferences I would be sent into panic attacks. Unable to breathe, blurred vision, racing heart, all in that tiny hall with my peers around me. Counselling is another massive trigger, having tried it and bawling every time I was in there I figured it wasn’t for me. 

This virus has been good in some aspects. I’ve been able to focus on self-care, I’ve even started working out.. but it is so important that I’m able to be out, distract myself from this constant pain and wanting to stay in bed which obviously isn’t possible. But I’d like to note particularly during this time I am becoming quite irritable. Not sure why or what it is, but it seems that even those closest to me are angering me. 

I just wondered why is everything so hard? I’ve really only ever had obstacles thrown my way, and forgive me for my negative outlook but I really am doing my best to try and look at this positively through what I am doing about my self-care and such. 

I just wanted to let anyone who is struggling during this difficult time of isolation that you are being thought of and I know exactly how you’re feeling. Please, hang in there. You’re needed more than anything even if you don’t think so. I hope we all can move past this together. Thank you for reading (:",08Apr2020,1
108," ""What is my purpose in life, what is the purpose of being alive?"" 
  
  Purpose is a product of the imagination. When you look into the void of what is and of what has been you won't see purpose, you won't see wonder, truth or any sign of life at all. All that exists within the void is the void. When you step away from the form you inhabit and the intrusive cognitive conditioning that keeps you true to form, what is there? What there is, is a formation. A crystilne structure that reverberates with energy and frequency. What exists is existence itself. There was nothing before us, it was our eyes that gave the world form, it was our lungs that gave the world air, it was our feet that gave the world a foundation. And only life was ever capable of giving the world a purpose. So the real question is ""What is the meaning of purpose to me?""
Is it feeling comfortable or fulfilled? Is it being satisfied or gratefull for the lives we have? Is it understanding what makes the world spin or what makes us tick?

 To me. Purpose is what we create. It is how we immortalize ourselves. We were born a million times and we have lived millions of lives. Before we were blood we were light. Every being that has ever shared our blood has struggled to do what we are struggling to do now...they struggled to create a life.

  And here we are, true to form. Beings created by billions of tiny decisions and accidental precision. The next step in the grand journey is to recognize that we are not alone on our paths. We are not alone within this form.

  There is a river running beneath the skin of every living being. A river of blood that flows with an incredible amount of energy. The river is connected completely. Though smiles and laughs, through fear and pain, through a text or a virus, through a connection of any kind. If you can swim against the current and swim upstream, you can create purpose for the ground beneath your feet.",08Apr2020,1

There are more “symptoms” than this, but this is the one that’s causing most distress lately. For the last year or so, I get very frustrated before I sleep. The duvet has to be a certain way. The blanket has to be even. The pillows have to be the right height and flat. My teddies (don’t judge) have to be organized to both fit in the bed and not get in the way. Then, if my hair feels wrong I have to tie it up. And then, I might be starting to sleep, and suddenly my teeth feel dirty so I have to get up and brush them (&amp; in returning to bed, repeat the first few things!).

So it all started back in 2015 when I had a minor stomach cramp , and it gave me all sorts of irrational thoughts about having different debilitating diseases . And I was so scared that I had a large anxiety attack and my parents gave me some stomach cramp pills in an effort to calm me down . And I did , temporarily but those thoughts came back and tho I had comparably low anxiety than before , those thoughts still scared me but I couldn't get myself to research the disease at that time because I was afraid that I might find out that I have some serious problem . So I avoided that but that made the situation of my intrusive thoughts worse , and eventually I started having intrusive thoughts about this being God's doings , and that I was being tested .... And that I'd go to hell etc .. it really scared me and I was really anxious almost all the time . Eventually those thoughts became lesser and lesser , now fast forward I had scary intrusive thoughts about being falsely accused of a crime based on a show etc which escalated to being obsessed that I might actually be a criminal which also escalated to this being my downfall because I had a dream a while ago that my life would crumble down and I would be subject to hell . Which is my current obsession ..... I've been witnessing multiple signs of these being true because I saw anime like death note , hell girl and Babylon 

And my dream was similar to all 3 anime combined ..... It really scared me to no end because I saw Babylon and hell girl after the dream . I've also been noticing multiple other signs here and there and things I perceive as signs here and there but they all seem real ... For example writings , ads , word suggestions on my keyboard and other Coincidences ......I'm scared shitless and if I really am a criminal them I'm really sorry for everything I swear ....",08Apr2020,1

I’m not sure what to do, i can’t turn off these feelings from 9-5 and i also can’t lose my job without having another quickly. My therapist has been helpful and suggested I look for less stressful and more meaningful employment. I’ve been looking for new employment (100 applications to date) and nothing’s stuck yet. A few virtual interviews but i know a lot of things are uncertain for companies. Just needed to vent, maybe get some feed back.",08Apr2020,1

115,"This lockdown  has been hell on my mental health.

I am a single person who is now working from home during the lockdown and when I'm cooped up is when I start going into bad habits that make it worse. 

I miss going out and seeing people, when I'm not around people I start to overthink things and get into a spiral of anxiety that makes things worse. 

I miss human interactions. 

A high five, a handshake and most of all I miss hugs. There is comfort and a recharging effect from a hug that i miss. Especially from my parents. My mum calls me every day to talk and it's not the same. 

It's my birthday on Sunday and I can't see them. 

I miss my friends and our weekly pub quiz night. I miss my weekly anime session with my cousin. I miss dropping in on my parents for a coffee. I miss going into work and joking around with my colleagues. 

This sucks and I hate it. Im on the edge of tears most of the time with only my cat for comfort but it's not the same as a person.  

Sorry for the long post but I needed to get this off my chest before I explode.",08Apr2020,1
116,"So ever since Monday night I've been having issues with feeling sick, I was taking antibiotics for a uti I thought I had, and since taking those antibiotics I've been dealing with a lot of the side effects (abdominal pain, joint pain, dizziness, etc) 

Last night I ended up with a fever of almost 103 and it didn't break until I got to urgent care. They did a bunch of tests on me to make sure it wasn't a kidney infection or sepsis, but everything has come back normal except for my white blood cell count, which was a tad high. 

The dr. told me that a lot of the covid 19 cases she's seen in my area haven't had respiratory issues, but abdominal pain and all the symptoms I had. She took a swab culture and I won't know my results til tomorrow.


I've been very lucky up until this point, both my parents are essential workers and haven't lost their jobs. And to help out I've been taking care of my brother, who is six years old.

If I'm positive they will both lose their jobs and my brother wouldn't be able to really leave the house. plus my boyfriend may also be positive and will not be able to go to work (He's in medical school and they still have to do clinical hours even with what's going on)

I still have all the symptoms I mentioned before, and the antibiotics only stay in the body for 12 hrs at most. I'm not very hopeful my results will come back negative. I feel like everything that could potentially happen will be my fault if I come back positive. Idk what to do to make myself not feel responsible for all the hardships that can possibly come",08Apr2020,1

[https://youtu.be/8RaWDD5zS4w](https://youtu.be/8RaWDD5zS4w)

Today we look at how we can stop the habit of over-thinking or excessive thinking. We look at our addiction to thinking and how we can choose to live in the present moment rather than living with such busy minds. To learn how to control the mind in this way is a real path to happiness.

I try to find anything to motivate me to go on but there is nothing, since I'm on quarantine I should have all the time in the world to write my thesis but I can't get around to do it, so I try to do the things I denied myself prior to university like drawing, painting, playing an instrument, watching TV shows, exercising, but everything feels like a task, I can't have fun, I don't feel happy. All I want to do is bang my head against the wall and scream (which I can't do since I'm at home with my family and don't want to draw attention to me). Really wondering if there's anything for me in life besides death, I don't seem to have a purpose, I don't want to be alive. I've never harmed myself (at least not anything serious, just a couple of punches or scratches here and there) but I find myself constantly fantasizing about death, I have a sturdy rope I know would do the work and constantly think about being choked, as if it was the only way to get rid of the angst I feel in my throat.

119,"My partner has intense bouts with anxiety and depression. They are not seeking care because it's not financially possible for them. We are both in our 30s.

We do not live together and have been in this relationship about a year. 

When their anxiety ratchets up it looks a lot like anger and frustration. I know that I do not give them the support and responses they want/need because later they will describe what was needed at that time and how I could have stopped the spiral. 

I do not have anxiety (outside average stress response) or depression. I do not often recognize what is going on until they are extremely agitated and I am not very nurturing, so when they get agitated over what I see as small, uncontrollable or insignificant and I try to calm them and they get more agitated. I often become frustrated and irritated at this seemingly outlandish response. 

Since the covid outbreak they lost their job and are even more financially insecure which has made the anxiety significantly more difficult. Recently during one of these episodes they became physically aggressive towards me. Grabbed, spun, held down. It is not the first time, but it was the most aggressive and scariest.

I have a child who was in the home when this took place. They were not present, but that to me, just adds a whole other layer of problem to this. 

I do not know how to help.

Their suggestion they they need hugs and physical affection when they get that way, is counterintuitive to the aggressive, angry, frustrated person I'm dealing with in that moment. 

I dont know what to do.

TLDR: my partners anxiety is escalating into physical aggression and I dont know how to stop it.",08Apr2020,1
120,"I am really into a guy..we once had a really strong connection, but did not really date. I unintentionally pushed away because of high anxiety and depression due to a personal situation. I still really wanted to be with him, but whenever he made a move, those things got in the way of me getting closer to him. So I understood when he started dating someone else. I knew I had missed my chance and I accepted that.

Over the year or so that he’s been with this girlfriend, he’s still tried to make a move on me. The last time he did was about three months ago and I was extremely caught off guard. He tried to make a move and there was a really strong feeling with it (serious feelings, not just looking for fun), but again my depression won. I sat back and didn’t take the bait. (For context, years of verbal abuse have made it extremely difficult to get close to anyone, but I’m working hard to get better). He obviously wouldn’t know why I acted the way I did, so I assume he felt rejected.

I’m wondering if it’s now too late to reach out and show my interest, because I’ve never stopped wanting him. And I’m pretty certain that at least as of a few months ago, there was still some interest on his part. I don’t want to miss a chance with someone great and I feel like its on me now to show more effort. I just don’t know the best way to go about it and if he’ll want to give it another chance after being rejected. It’s tough for me because I never wanted to reject him but I also don’t know how to express that. And yes, he’s still with the same girlfriend.

My choices for today are drive to the sea and sit there for a while, or get drunk again.

4/6 of the last days I have had some drink to try and help, it doesn't, nothing helps, but at least I get a long sleep out of it.

If I travel to the sea (1 hour drive) there's the risk of being stopped and asked questions because apparently leaving your house to go and relax somewhere solitary is a shit thing to do right now.

For me it feels like I can't truly relax and enjoy the things I have right now in my life, which by the way are more than enough. I got my own apartment, my car, my family is okay everything seems normal, but then there is this anxiety in me about the future. What will it happen if I don't continue to improve myself... if I ""settle down"" and take it easy.

Do you have similar thoughts? It's like I'm always looking towards the things I don't have, rather than appreciating the ones I do, and it's always competition about me, always trying to do more and more and at the same time I realized... life is kind of passing me by while I pursue things I'm not sure I truly want, but that are ""supposed"" to be wanted.

I have many great friends, loads to do as everything I want to do is basically on my doorstep, constant nights out were so fun etc. One of the best aspects is the fact the gym is a 5 min walk away as it's my main hobby and passion doing resistance training. I was in the best shape I had ever been in and I was more motivated than ever to train harder. Life wasn't perfect but the positives definitely outweigh the negatives. Since it's my last year I was always worried about the end looming, so I was more determined than ever to make the most of it for the last few months. Now due to everything that's happened the end has just arrived out of nowhere and more abrupt than ever. I've not even had the chance to give a proper goodbye to most people.

Now I'm at home my life has just taken a nosedive in every single aspect. I can't see any friends and there is literally nothing to do. It's nice being surrounded by my family for once but now I'm 21, approaching 22 its made me realise that I need to leave the nest for good. I'm way more productive and fulfilled just getting on with my own life at uni. This whole ordeal has put me in such a low mindset as I'm struggling to accept how dire this whole situation really is. I don't even have the motivation to get on with my assignments and do home workouts because it's just not the same.

127,"There is a person I started speaking to online recently because I saw they were struggling: self-harm, suicidal thoughts, and living in an abusive and unaccepting household.

Even after a particularly bad case of self-harm that landed this person in the hospital to get stitches, the next day, this person's family said they should have just died.

This person is living on the brink every day and only feels worse as time goes on. I want to help them in some way, but there are a lot of road blocks:

- This person lives in Belgium (I'm in the US)
- This person is a minor (not even 16)
- This person has no family or friends in their country they can live with as an alternative
- This person has issues making calls to the suicide hotline and services of their country and just can't because of the state they're in
- The school they attend is unhelpful and they can't turn to the school for any assistance for their living situation or mental health issues
- Because of their parent, they don't have access to any therapy and mental help services
- Their family would never, ever consider family therapy
- Lastly, whatever complications are created due to the coronavirus and lockdowns across the world

What can I do? They need help. They need to be treated and live in a safer environment than they are now. I don't speak Dutch or any language other than English, so I'm having issues even looking up what potential help is even out there for this person.

The only thing that make me feel something are music and self pleasure (and drawing maybe, since I cant play videogames for now due to the cut). In school I feel like I'm not myself, as If I had a mask, pretending to be the version of me that everyone expects from me. I've been struggling with anxiety my whole life, now more than ever. 
I dont enjoy phone calls, going out with ""friends"" I barely talked to, speaking in class and new people, Im scared of taking new classes although I'd like to...

I went to a therapist, we worked on how to approach people and go outside more often and then I stopped going since for the majority of the sessions I'd had to speak to some people (as if we were acquaintances) that the therapist would bring to see how I'do. Then I stopped going because I felt uncomfortable doing so, and, after time I realized that, in order to cope with my anxiety, I had to work on my self esteem. I never did and still haven't, idk how.

129,"I think I have found a great place to speak about my struggles, as well as the fact that I have just came out of therapy, which I feel as made a positive impact on my mental health. 

My trouble started when I was 14. At school I suffered verbal abuse, constantly. These were very personal attacks that really hurt. This hit my really hard and it went on for years before I feel I started to crack. That is when I first started to feel that my thoughts were taking over. This made me feel hollow, like I didn't have a personality and that I was just on this Earth for people to say horrible things to me. This is when I started to feel self loathing and worthlessness and I fell through the cracks. I gave up at school and I wouldn't go outside once I got home. My coping mechanism was to try and act like someone else so that people might respect me. However, this really took over my life and continued until I finally got therapy in my late 20s.

As life went on I felt more and more worthless and that I was a waste of space. I felt so hollow and that I didn't have a personality. The thoughts about who I was got more and more intense to the point where I have punched walls. I was really struggling with these thoughts because they were making me think I didn't have a personality and the I had to act like something else to feel whole. This was making the thoughts more and more intense. Even after leaving school, in college and in the work place, I have had people making fun of me and saying things that made me uncomfortable. My working life basically fell apart because I could not cope. The worst experience that I had with this was at Christmas 2007, during a new job I got two employees were staring at me and laughing at me. I couldn't cope been there anymore and walked out of the job. The next day, standing for a bus a drunken man assaulted me and broke my ribs. This sent me over the edge and I my mental health problems really took over. from the end of 2007 to mid 2008 I became a recluse and self harmed at home. When my confidence to go out slowly returned I went back into society, but the thoughts were getting worse. This continued for many years.

However, in 2015 I decided I had to try and do something and got to therapy. In and out of therapy for four years, at the end of last year I found a therapist that really connected with me. She enabled me to realize that the thoughts I was having were nothing more than just thoughts. She described to me that when I was been bullied I used the excuse to act like someone else as a coping strategy. She enabled me to see that my minds way of coping with the trauma of bullying was to act like someone I am not. This would make me think I was been respected.

In February I ended my therapy. A few weeks later, despite what is going on in the world I live my day just been myself. Whenever I get a thought that I know is intrusive I take the balcony view. I just let it be there and realize that it is just a thought.

After years of holding back I also know that I am capable now of achieving. When this situation is over that we are all facing that the moment, I am going to go to college and learn something that interests me. And most importantly of all I am going to keep my therapy techniques in place and work towards the light I can now see at the end of the tunnel.

132,"This is a bit of a vent, as I feel like I’m ready to pop. Apologies in advance if this is jumbled, the brain is racing, lack of sleep, mobile user, etc etc. 

Times are tough for all of us, and I’m hoping that I’m not breaking any rules with this vent. If not allowed, please delete. 

I have a hx of anxiety, depression and PTSD, and “anxiety induced insomnia” (this is how the pulmonologist explained it to me). I’ve lived in Wisconsin most of my life, but my fiancé was given an amazing opportunity in Las Vegas, so he and I made a choice to move here. We’ve been since October, and it was great until recently. 

I’ve been compliant in all of my MH care, and actually had an intensive inpatient stay followed by IOP after, in June. I add this as context for the severity of my symptoms, I guess. I did a LOT of work and genuinely felt better about myself than I have in 15 years.

When I informed my psych and therapist that we were indeed going to take this plunge, they were supportive, and my psychiatrist gave me a script with 6 refills for all of my meds. 

I didn’t have a job lined up by the time we got out here, and it was tight for a little while, which we expected. We were able to make ends meet while I found a job. I was able to finally get an opportunity at the end of December, but it would take 90 days for my insurance to kick in. I wasn’t able to afford refills regularly, but used GoodRX when I could. I could feel myself backsliding on some of the things I’ve worked my butt off to achieve, but I figured I was close to the finish line, and just tried my best to use the skills I’d learned to cope.

My insurance became active on March 1st, and I’m sure you can all guess where this is heading. ...

I attempted to refill my meds, excited to be able to maintain them regularly. Apparently NV laws for controlled substances are different than WI, in that they apparently expire after 6 months here. So I just lost out on 3 refills for the two meds I’ve been most worried about. I sent a message to my therapist, who I’d been meaning to catch up with anyway. My old office is closed due to the pandemic, although he stated that he would try to get in touch with my Dr to see what he could do, as he was “concerned” that I was without meds. That was last week, and I know things are crazy everywhere, I’m just panicking. 

Since the pandemic fears were already in full swing, I haven’t been able to contact a new psych to try and establish care yet. I know that meds like these aren’t prescribed without a solid hx in med records, and we all know how trying to establish care will go: no openings until August? Sure. In addition, 2 weeks ago, my fiancé and I both came down with symptoms that fit the Covid requirements for testing. We weren’t able to get an appointment until yesterday. (The test sucks, btw). I’ve also been furloughed until May 1st, and have made dozens of phone calls to try to start unemployment benefits. Since I am from out of state, I am *required* to call in and have someone review my case before it can be processed online.  The phones don’t become available until after 11, and they have limit on their voicemail telling you to call back the next day, then it disconnects. Obviously, going anywhere is not ideal, and going to the ER is a waste of resources especially since Drs do not like to write scripts for something that is easily abused. I understand that. I don’t know if a televisit would help me in the interim, but sight unseen, I dunno. 

I’ve been out of my sleep aid for a few weeks now, and have been awake today for 24 hours. I have one emergency med left that I am saving for, well.. the apocalypse. So I’ve just been sitting in our tiny 1 bed apartment, ruminating about lack of meds, lack of money, no immediate family near me and a lack of professional support (especially since my therapist was probably one of the most positive male influences in my life, so there was a sense of security having a great provider in my corner. 

My anxiety is through the roof, and I’m slipping in to the hole I crawled out of. I just don’t know how to get my mind to stop racing. I know things will turn out alright in the end, but in the meantime there seems to be no end in sight. 

I’m sorry, I realize this is a massive post, I just needed to write these fears out, and I thought that maybe this sub would be understanding (especially with my med concerns) and remind me that it’ll get better.

135,"So, for a long time since I started middle school, I've been having flashbacks to various moments of my past, especially my childhood. I grew up in a prejudiced household a d family, and my parents' marriage wasn't the best. Here's a list of all that's happened to me growing up, that still affects me to this day. 

•My parents fought a lot, heard my dad call and accuse my mother of awful things. He's broken furniture, and the way they yelled was ugly. His insecurity and jealousy has put her in a spot where she's not allowed to go shopping alone or talk to any male friends. Even to this day as they're still married. 

•My father is very prejudiced against gay people and mixed marriages that don't involve white or Hispanic people only. I am gay (he doesn't know), and I'm in love with a African American girl. Growing up, I was brainwashed into hating all the things I was. Gays, other races and acceptance. My mom says she's not homophobic, but she likes to slander them all the time whenever they're mentioned. (Btw, did I mention  that he one time made her cry on her birthday because he got mad after seeing a lesbian couple at the mall we were at?) 

•Religion was always forced down my throat. My family is Catholic, and are against any religion that's not theirs, and they hate atheists as well as agnostics. Even Christianity. I was shamed for if I refused to partake in anything religious, and yelled at as well. One time, they forced me to go to the church I was baptized in, and I didn't want to go. They didn't care, and just yelled at me and to not ""ruin this trip"". I didn't feel like I belonged there,and was given dirty looks by the nuns. I refused to get on my knees to pray, and was almost feeling like passing out. Lastly, when I was first getting therapy, I'm pretty sure they purposely signed me up for a religious kind because the therapist guy kept asking me, "" Why don't you love yourself? God does, why not you?"". (They also labeled me as Roman Catholic in my parents, without my knowledge.) Of course though, they didn't acknowledge it. Now everytime I see crucifixes, nuns, or a church building, I get all those memories in an instant and experience a near panic attack. 

•I often experience negative thoughts when I'm around my parents or in their house. I still live with them, but I want to move out after I graduate high school in a month. I'm trying to save up as much as I can, but my boss cut my hours because of this pandemic. It's hard finding a second job, and I don't even have a running car or license because my dad doesn't make an effort to fix my car and no one is teaching me how to drive. 

• I want to actually go to college in a city four hours away from where I live for a change of scenery and to restart my life. My friend offered for me to be her roommate since she's going to the same college as well. However, my mother is against this, and said that I'm going to be forced to go to college in my city, even though I don't feel comfortable here and I don't want to feel like I'm just living in the past. All of my friends are going to different places, and I'll be alone. My ex offered for me to stay with him when he gets his own place, but I'm not so sure about that because I feel my presence just reminds him of the breakup (where it turned out I was actually a lesbian and him saying that it hurt him). I don't want to hurt anyone. 

So in summary, I'm fucked. I have had so many flashbacks and nightmares relating to my upbringing, and being in the house just escalates them more. Anywhere else, I'm fine. I can actually be me. If anything, my friends have been there for me mental health wise, then my own parents. Anything that reminds me of the first two above, I get a dry mouth, my heart starts to race, and I start to sweat. My severe anxiety and depression most likely stemmed from growing up here, as well as my flashbacks. I suffer from mild insomnia because of these traits. 

If I want to go this alone, my parents will most likely cut never off financially out of anger. My friend said that I'll most likely not be able to move out this summer, but said she can most likely get me on the weekends. I said that's too much trouble, but she insisted.  I have to make at least three times the rent (which is fairly cheap), and I know my parents won't be a grantor. It's difficult right now to do that. 

So yeah that's all I have to do now. I've been applying for scholarships to make it easier on my tuition and applied for financial aid. I want to be a BSN nurse and help people in any way that I can. 

All I ask is to be free. And start over. Relish in the things I never got to do growing up. This house is hurting my mental health and I need help. I just don't know what to do....",08Apr2020,1
136,"My brother has been having hallucinations for the past year. They have progressively gotten worse and I fear for our safety. He is accusing of family members coming into his room and poking him and running away. His episodes become verbally abusive, going on rants and yelling with anger that can last up to 40 minutes. Except, he is talking to no one but it seems to be directly at family members. He mainly accused of my dad for doing things he doesn’t. He has accused all of us for doing things we haven’t and we’ve tried explaining to him that we don’t do those things but he doesn’t believe us. 

We try to explain to him that he’s having hallucinations but he won’t believe them. He doesn’t believe he needs help and doesn’t want to get help. How can my family and I better support him? We registered him to a mental health clinic but it will take a year to process. How do we explain to him to get the help he needs. He also is diagnosed with a mild intellectual disability which he is also denying he has. 

His hallucinations has been happening frequently and it’s taking a toll on the family. It’s hard to deal with a loved one who is hostile towards you and doesn’t realize his actions. His hallucinations can occur up to 3 times a day at any time of the day so it leaves us with uneasiness because we don’t know how to help.",08Apr2020,1

139,"**Sorry about the length of the post. I am grateful if someone actually manages to read through it, but I just needed to let it out. Maybe a good samaritan bored of the quarantine will decide to help. If so, I would be endlessly grateful**

&amp;nbsp;

I am having a serious issue and I am scared no one will take me seriously because the reason for my suffering is seemingly insignificant but I assure you that I wouldn't be posting this if it didn't affect me the way it does. I don't know the reason it affects me so much, I have a few theories but...hear me out.

A few years ago I fell in love with a band. Deeply in love. I couldn't go one day without listening to their music. It felt as if their music became the soundtrack for my life and this band has helped me cope with some of the most painful times in my life. I am not a teenage anymore either, so my attachment to this band might seem a bit bizzare, but I've always had kind of an obsessive personality and I have a long history of obsessing over things. But this one was the strongest I've ever experienced.

I am depressed. Sometimes life is bearable. Sometimes it's not. When life is no longer bearable, I need something to keep me busy and to make me want to continue living. It just happens so that, during this time in my life, listening to my favorite band was the only thing that made me want to get up in the morning. Every time I felt sad and empty, I would just turn up one of their songs and become overwhelmed by the rush of feelings that the music made me feel. I am sure it was not a good coping mechanism and now I'm suffering the consequences of that.

&amp;nbsp;

Long story short, a few weeks ago, I felt like something was 'off'. I no longer felt the urge to listen to my favorite band. Now, this should be expected considering the fact that burnout is a real thing and that this band hasn't released anything new in decades. You can grow tired of doing the same thing, especially in my situation. Still, I hoped it would be temporary and that my love for my favorite music would eventually return. I tried to ignore it as much as I could. The days and weeks went by, and I started becoming more and more empty and sad. I felt (and still do feel) like something was missing and that I was growing more distant from the one thing that I once loved so much. The memory of their music started to fade. The memories associated with their music started to slowly dissipate. I could no longer remember what their music made me feel and why I even loved it so much in the first place. This realization has been stuck in my mind ever since.

Here I am now. It's been three months since I last felt enthusiastic about my favorite band. During these three months I couldn't take my mind off it. I would randomly break into tears during the day, in the middle of an important event, during family gatherings, while I was at work, ect. It doesn't matter where I am or what I am doing, the reminder (of me not being passionate anymore about the only thing that I loved) would creep in on me and steal all of my joy. I've been grieving it the same way one would grieve the death of a loved one. Because the music was, to me, like the best friend that I've never had. I wake up in the morning and it's the first thing I think about. I go to bed at night and it's the only thing I think about before I fall asleep (especially since I used to fall asleep to their music every night). It's so bad that I just can't escape the thoughts.

&amp;nbsp;

Then there's the triggers. Hearing one of their songs on the radio is enough to give me a panic attack. Seeing this band pop up in my recommended on Youtube makes me physically nauseous. There's people talking about the band and discussing their music on social media, since they are a popular band with tons of fans. Even seeing their name mentioned somewhere drives me nuts and makes me cry for an hour (just one hour if i'm lucky). I tried to unfollow all the fanpages, all the groups, subreddits, youtube channels dedicated to the band and so on. But there's always some other source for the trigger. Unfollowed the band's official Facebook page? No problem, Rolling Stone and SPIN have just posted an article about them! Want to spend less time online to avoid mentions of said band? I go outside and see people wearing band T-shirts. Want to hear other bands and listen to the radio? Boom, the radio station decides to play one of their songs. There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. I hate that such a silly matter is taking up so much space in my life and making me unable to function normally. I'm in my 20s, I have a job, a loving family, a wonderful pet, money and everything yet here I am struggling with this bizarre issue that I can't understand at all.

&amp;nbsp;

I have already written more than I should have and again, I'm really sorry about the whole novel. I just want to be heard and understood and maybe receive some helpful advice. Due to the nature of my issue, I have never said a word about it to anyone except Reddit. There's people out there dying of starvation, losing a kid, going through a divorce or something and I'm here in agony because of a fucking BAND. I wish I could understand why I'm in such agony but I don't. Maybe it's because their music was all I had. It was my only source of happiness for the past few years so losing them meant, to me, losing my only source of happiness. I'm still trying to understand and come to terms with the situation. But as far as I am concerned, nothing has worked. I am already taking treatment for my depression (Cymbalta and Abilify) and I'm currently tapering because they aren't helping (I've tried countless treatments before). I eat healthy foods (I'm currently cutting out the sugar), I sleep well, I exercise, I have other hobbies and interests (painting, drawing, cooking, playing guitar, video games, reptiles) but I'm not seeing a difference. I am in therapy but I haven't brought it up with my therapist because I am so ashamed of being judged. I don't even know how to explain. Maybe if I do decide to open up about it, I'll just show my therapist this Reddit post, because it would be just so difficult to talk about it. I really need help and since Reddit is such a big community, I am thinking that maybe someone has been through a (somewhat) similar experience and can give me some insight. I would really appreciate some help.",08Apr2020,1
140,"So, I (20F) am having a really hard time with my mental health. I have always had issues, but I am getting to the point where its constant, and I really don't know what to do. I also don't know if I'm overreacting, but I feel crazy. I'm listing my symptoms below to see if anyone experiences similar things: 

- I can't sit quietly. I need something entertaining me... I keep Netflix running all of the time just to have something in the background. I think its because I hate being alone, but idk. I do it when other people are around too, and cant function well without it. This is not just down times, its always... during chores, meals, in the shower, driving, etc. I watch/listen to the same shows on repeat. On the other hand, I can't focus on 2 things at once even though I need the sound. Like I cant read with the sound on, but without it I get frustrated that its not there.

- I often dissociate (this started last year). Im not sure if thats the right word, but I get really aware of my periphrial vision and everything looks like its moving too fast and isnt real. It scares me. 

- I have trouble focusing on what people say directly to me (when they talk a while, like lectures). I hear them for a little bit and then I start thinking about the fact I need to pay attention to them, and then I lose whatever they were saying. Has happened since I was younger, but my parents always coached me to stare at people's forheads when they're talking so it looks like I'm paying attention. Has been a problem in class for me... I look like I'm paying hard attention, the prof then calls on me bc Im looking at them, and I have no idea whats happening and I have to bs my way through.

- I struggle with procrastination incredibly, but I WANT to do the work. Its hard to explain. But like I spend more time thinking that I need to do stuff, and that makes me anxious, and so I take longer to do what I need to. Ive taken trig three times now bc of this, and I havent read 1 book I've been assigned all the way through since high school (at least when theyre assigned -- I can read stuff that I want to no problem... I read at a 10th grade reading level in 3rd grade, and by 6th I was reading at a college level). Ive not read one book I've been assigned this semester at college, like not even a chapter, and I'm an English major! I read summaries to get by bc I have to read things over and over in assigned books to understand them. Im just good at b.s.ing things, but Im scared for the future/my career bc I dont really know anything. However, I had a 3.9 GPA in high school and a 3.6 now. 

- I'm struggling horribly with my self esteem. I truly do not like myself. People think I'm annoying/mean/ too forward. My boyfriend says that I present as ""too eager."" This is frustrating, but I tend to fixate more on my weight/appearance. I can barely get dressed w/o breaking down. 

- I cant stop forgetting things, especially due dates, even when theyre regular assignments. Ive missed several assisgnments in one of my English classes now, bc she has discussion posts due every Sunday and I always forget. I have to keep a calendar and check it every day, multiple times for assignments, and I still forget. I also pay almost every bill that I get late, even though I have all of the money on hand bc I pay things w loans. Oh, also, I dont respond to texts/snapchats on an extremely regular basis bc I forget that I got them, which I think affects my ability to make friends &amp; keep them. However, I never forget big stuff, really, like due dates for a midterm or something.

- Im having more frequent mood swings, and my mom talks about how Ive been very prone to anger always. These mood swings make my emotions feel like theyre amplified by 10... I get sad and think of s****de, and I get angry and want to be violent. This is a recent development.

- Im worried Im pushing people away. I find myself monopolizong conversations and interrupting people (while not being able to stand that happening to me). I feel hypocritical, and I never really notice it happening unless someone points it out. Also, I struggle having more than like 2 friends... I fixate on them, basically, and cant handle the responsibility of having aquaintences.

- I dont eat all day long. Like every day. I just dont feel hungry. Im too busy, I feel like I dont have enough time, but then I dont really do anything. Then, I eat dinner, and then snack for the rest of the evening... I cant break this habit and its horrible. Its affecting my weight. My boyfriend wants me to mention that I dont drink fluids either (he estimates maybe 2 glasses of water a day, with him making me). I dont notice the water thing -- I just drink when Im thristy.

- Boyfriend wants me to mention my nail biting, and my picking at pimples and lips. Also, he says I grind my teeth. 

- I struggle with sleep quite a bit, but melatonin stops working too quickly and I don't want to use smoking as a crutch.

For background info, both father and paternal grandfather have been diagnosed with OCD, and anxiety/depression runs on my mom's side (though it's never been formally diagnosed on my mother's side because they ""don't believe"" in taking medicine for that stuff).

Am I crazy? What should I do? Does anyone have any suggestions on what I could be experiencing? 

I have an appt with a psychiatrist set up later this month, but I just want to see if I'm overreacting. I'm just so nervous and upset and I feel so alone. Help, please. 

TL;DR Cant focus w/o background stimulation (Netflix-- same shows on repeat) &amp; cant focus w it, dissociation, I zone out frequently, procrastination, self esteem problems, rapid mood swings, forgetfulness, monopolizing conversations, nail biting &amp; picking at lips/pimples/skin, sleep struggles.

144,"Today I learnt that a friend of mine committed suicide a few days ago. I was trying to text him and call him, but his phone numbers were dead.

I can't process the news of his death. There were no signs, but he was always sad about his breakup from 2 years ago. He recently moved to my city, and wanted to stay with him at his new place but I was reluctant because it meant longer commute to my work and I like my privacy. Now I feel that if I had moved in with him, things might've ended differently. May be he would've told me his problems, may be I could've helped him. Now I feel numb. The guilt comes in bouts.

145,"My whole life, I have been mistreated, abused, bullied, by everyone in grade school, and even up to know, my own family.

I am 24 now, and not at a 24 year old functioning level.

I have been on medications pretty much my whole life, the most recent being for the last 8 and a half years (Oxcarbazepine \[Trileptal\] 600 MG twice a day, and Sertraline \[Zoloft\] 200 MG a day) which was originally prescribed to me for OCD. I was in a psychiatric facility when put on these, so if I refused, it could have been injected by physical force, plus I was completely unaware of any serious risks (especially the potentially long-term/permanent ones even after withdrawal) and just desperate for relief, but I know that doctors don't tell anyone about the withdrawal risks, regardless of the age of the patient. 

I just learned about the risks of PSSD, loss of emotions, loss of pleasure of any kind, impaired cognitive functioning, even loss of dreams (I've actually already experienced extents of all of these, even a complete loss of dreams for some years, it suddenly came back one day and I'll never know why, my meds were consistent as I remember).

The real serious (and long lasting, if not permanent) damage is from withdrawal of SSRIs (Sertraline/Zoloft is an SSRI, and Oxcarbazepine/Trileptal could interfere for all I know, like any other medication, there are interactions).

Back in January of this year, I was put on Bupropion SR 100 MG a day, for my rage outbursts (I still remember when they started, it was like a switch flipped overnight, I literally had a sequence of disturbing, vivid dreams, and then I just felt so full of hatred and wanted to be hurtful, and had my first rage explosion, and had a lot after too, all the way up until getting on Bupropio SR, which actually turned that rage shit off. 

My doctor asked me if I still had any amount of depression, anger, anxiety, and when I said yes (who the hell doesn't, unless they suffer that SSRI withdrawal, that is) and he immediately doubled the dose.

After a few days I was plagued with anxiety and my penis completely lost all feeling (only for a day) and my orgasms had even less feeling than before. 

I told the doctor about the anxiety (but not the sexual stuff) and he said I could go back to 100 MG. I still had very low libido (which was previously super high) for 2-3 weeks, and weirdly, super strong orgasms, that I just couldn't feel.

However, last night, I masturbated, and it felt INCREDIBLE. The stroking, and the orgasm, I never thought I'd feel sexual pleasure like that. I just wish I could actually have sex with a woman(en).

I've never had a girlfriend or sex, not even kiss, I was never a ""Chad"", nor do I want to be, I feel disgusted just from imaging myself having abs or muscles (I don't want to be OBESE, but something about the idea of being muscular makes me feel disgust, maybe it's related to my gentlefemdom fetish, I do not know).

I've thought about trying to chemically castrate myself, to rid of the urges I can not fulfill, and will not be able to anytime in the near future, if ever. But, I still feel the desire inside me, not just for sex, but love as well, a very special, what I assume to be non-mainstream, relationship (a MDLB dynamic, not strictly fetish-based of course, but it's a very important part of the relationship for me).

I have failed at ""basic"" things, I do not even have my driver license, and while I got over the fear (really it was deciding I might as well risk dying since the alternative is being physically stranded) it is still not a smooth or natural thing for me, I do not know if my confusion and uncertainty is related to the medicines or not, but I do know that just getting off of them is not an option (and in the case that it happens to me against my will, I may become severely disabled for life, I would prefer to kill myself before that can happen, which would be at most when I turn 26 and get kicked off of my parents health insurance, goddamn US health insurance reliant healthcare).

SSRI withdrawal basically strips the sense of being a HUMAN BEING away from people, for some people it's decades, or even the rest of their lives. I'm 24 and still haven't lived life, I'm unwilling to go through even a year of that SSRI PSSD and other withdrawal bullshit, not to mention my OCD probably re-surging in full severity.

I'm really starting to hate humanity as a whole, everyone bullying me my entire grade school life, my negative family, the government, politics, alt-right capitalism, doctors, ""Big Pharma"", and just wanting to completely withdraw myself from other people, nobody really talks to me anyway, and I don't feel I'm on the same level as anybody, like I'm just on a different plane of existence. 

Being a 24 year old virgin who can't drive (goddamn meme) and really don't even WANT to drive, living with my parents, just started community college, STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT AS A CAREER 100% CERTAIN, having the job of a 16 year old who's never worked or a disabled adult, I am completely insecure, have no sense of self-worth, and do not feel like I even have any business trying to interact with other people, sure as hell ain't getting a girlfriend, but not even friends. That's why I'm kind of relieved that the CV shut down everything and forced school to move online, I was socially isolated anyway, might as well be socially isolated in my own home, and not spend $10-$20 for Uber.

My family just makes me feel worse, everybody does, but I guess I deserve it, because it's somehow morally wrong to fail in life, and I'm not entitled to anything, and lack the skills or confidence to earn anything (or the motivation to feel like the effort is worth it).

I legitimately feel like most people are bad, mean, selfish, intolerant, impatient, or maybe I am really the problem, but that's still a problem.

I am still too scared to kill myself, I don't know why, I guess because I can't be 100% certain what may or may not exist after death. 

Thank You if you read my entire post (that helps provide more useful comments) I really appreciate it, if you just read the title or a small part of the details, hey, I'm not entitled to having everything I typed read. Somebody literally told me before that I am not entitled to getting replies/comments.",08Apr2020,1
146,"I know everyone has been struggling with their mental health recently, and I’ve definitely been feeling heightened anxiety, but overall I was doing pretty okay. I had less motivation than usual but in general I was still functioning and capable of doing my schoolwork and basic things like eating and showering. But today I kind of hit the end of my rope. 

As some of you may have seen, Bernie Sanders dropped out of the race. Please don’t criticize me for my political views because that’s not what I’m here for. I’m just saying that his dropping out was my tipping point. I think anyone would be upset when you put so much faith in someone and you feel like the system failed you. I just feel like there’s no escape from all the craziness that’s happening. There’s no where I could go where I wouldn’t in some ways still have to deal with all of this. My dad used to always say stop the world I want to get off and I don’t think that’s ever been more relevant to me than right now.

I have all this homework I need to do and my professors are overcompensating for not having in person classes so they’re assigning even more work and expecting even more out of us. To be honest, school is the very last thing I’m even remotely worried about right now. Today I was planning on getting all of my work done but now I literally can’t do anything but stare at the wall. 

I was supposed to go to LA this summer for my school’s internship program that I worked my ass off to get accepted into. They pushed back the program dates and they haven’t said anything but I have a feeling the chances of it actually happening are slim. I haven’t even applied to any internships yet because it just feels like what’s the point? I need one to graduate and next fall semester is my last semester at college. If I push it off until the fall I can either commute two and a half hours by train to the closest city near me or take a smaller internship around here. I’m a PR major so I was hoping to get some experience with a larger company or firm first but there isn’t any close to me. I can’t even tell you how much I was looking forward to moving to LA for three months on my own across the country. 

I know eventually things will get better but to be honest that really doesn’t provide me with much relief because even if things will get better, I’m still struggling NOW. I feel so stupid that a political candidate ending their race is what did me in. I feel so stupid crying over it. But with everything else going on I just needed that one thing to keep me going. All of this fucking sucks. I really don’t know how I’m goin to keep going. Thankfully my boyfriend is here and he’s really supportive. I just wish I could hit pause for a second and take a minute to have all this weight off my shoulders. Having responsibilities like school work is honestly making me just feel ten times worse.

152,"Welcome to my TED talk. (I hate that phrase, honestly, but it seems to apply to my thesis-like Reddit post) Please be kind. Please be open to hearing my perspective. I am struggling and would like to feel less alone in feeling this way. Ok so:

I’ve struggled with mental health on and off for ten years. My first dark period took place in college when I felt so hopeless that jumping out my dorm window seemed like my only option. Afterwards (and physically unharmed), I spent days in a psych ward and then, because of that, suffered an expulsion from my conservative catholic college. There is no room for mental anguish in a college with those type of values. After that, my mom made me promise not to talk about what happened to anyone. “It will scare them away,” she said. This taught me to internalize my depression and anxiety. After that incident, things got better for awhile - although it didn’t feel like it would. I still feel those low lows occasionally, but if I do, I’ve been conditioned to kept that a secret. 

It’s been 10 years and obviously I’m no longer in college. Fortunately we have begun a few social movements since then: #MeToo, Black Lives Matter, #TimesUp. Suddenly, the world feels a little more welcoming. Celebrities are being more open about mental health and body image. It makes me feel less alone. However, there is one HUGE area of my life where I still don’t feel comfortable sharing my insecurities, fears, and negative mental health. And it’s the area I spend most of my time in....work; more specifically, the corporate world.

From what I’ve observed, just like my conservative catholic college, most corporate cultures overlook the importance of mental health. Corporate culture seems to perpetuate the notion that everyone must be productive, engaged, and impactful...all while maintaining enthusiasm at all times. Revenue is earned by employees’ long hours. But at what cost for our mental health? 

Corporate is unforgiving and non-sympathetic (if that’s even a word). The way you get ahead in the corporate world is by consistently juggling the relentless expectations, the passion to make a real difference, and the know-how to immediately make an impact right after your hire date. 

I’ve been on my particular career path for 7 years now. By most people’s definition, I should be well on my way to being a seasoned expert at what I do. However, my particular position (legal/contracts) is a necessity at any financially sound organization. Negotiating contracts is a necessary evil and I was hired to do so at a few different firms - in various industries - throughout my career. My current job is in an entirely different industry than my last few positions (which were an ad tech company, a proprietary trading firm, and lastly, a commercial solar panel design and installation firm). It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see how all these of those companies I worked for have little to no overlap. The only common denominator is that all three need to have contracts in place with clients and vendors. But the content of those contracts is greatly different in each respective industry. With every new job I’ve needed 1+ years to fully ramp up because I’m busy learning industry standard contracts and the law that applies to them. It’s like staring from square 1 every time. I lack self-confidence at work because I am completely unfamiliar with the industry for the first year and a half after I’m hired and it has taken a toll. Every day I’m faced with feelings of inadequacy and mediocrity in my position. I end up doubting my knowledge about what our business does and how it can be sustained. I’m afraid to ask questions because that would be like me admitting that I’m in the dark about something. This fear of failing and the fear of others noticing that I’m struggling is overwhelming. 

My current company is small. We’re almost like a startup. It’s a new-ish company with only about 80 employees. In an organization that size, the expectation is to bust your ass in order to cater to the success of the company.  I’m surrounded by young, knowledgeable colleagues who never seem to burn out. They all seem to be in overdrive constantly and I’m left wondering how I am the one struggling? I’m not a grumpy person by nature, but the over-enthusiasm from colleagues in their emails and meetings is so  unrealistic and phony to me that I tend to end up being the exact opposite of enthusiastic. I’m a grouch. I reply to requests by simply saying “sure” while my colleagues answer their call to duty with a “heck yes!!!” I can’t relate. I’ve never been a lazy person - especially academically. I always pushed myself and would beat myself up if I wasn’t leaps and bounds ahead of everyone else. But in the workforce, I feel either unqualified or lazy or both. I’m not even sure anymore. I procrastinate not because I’m avoiding doing work but because I’m avoiding feeling like I don’t know what I’m doing.

I can’t bring these feelings up to anyone at my company because it could have a detrimental effect. I could lose their respect or their confidence in me or I could lose the chance to get a raise or a bonus next year. I’m not sure if others feel the same way I do. I can’t tell because there is no safe forum to talk about it. Perhaps I have not been informed about the efforts mine or anyone else’s company might be making to support those people like me, but from what I can tell, such efforts don’t exist. My company continues to have a “tiger mom” mentality....push yourself to the max, always be available, and give it 160% for 9-10 hours a day. It’s exhausting. 

And while we are on the topic of work, I need to admit that office lingo is incredibly annoying to me. If one more person tells me we need a 10 minute “huddle” before our own meeting with the same people, I’m going to lose it. If I read “hope all is well!” in another email, I’m going to throw my computer out the window. Corporate life has its own language, it’s own culture, it’s own belief systems, and it’s own “bible.” You either assimilate or you don’t. In order to maintain a steady income with decent benefits (but definitely not top notch benefits), I’ve stuck around. I learned the ins and outs of a new office for the sole purpose of keeping a roof over my head. 

And trust me, I know I should be lucky to be employed right now and let me assure you, I am VERY grateful, but office culture and just I don’t jive. I’m growing increasingly frustrated that my company (and other companies) don’t open up a dialogue to discuss mental health. Now more than ever we should be talking about it. I’ve run straight into burnout over the last few months because demands at work are increasing, there are a million unfinished home projects in my house, and don’t think I have properly processed my recent breakup with my long term boyfriend. Quarantine amplified the burnout by being constantly overworked and rushed while WFH. Today I was tempted to bring up mental health concerns to my HR rep so as to start a dialogue about how to maintain emotional balance during this hard time. However, I decided against speaking up. I once again resorted to biting my tongue about a concern that mattered to me. Why isn’t mental health discussed more in smaller companies? I see and have witnessed that it is a discussion point in larger companies with established resources, but my borderline startup company has no intentions of being flexible so as to accommodate mental well-being or any kind of learning disabilities. I somewhat fall into both of those buckets. I may have some degree of undiagnosed ADD...I have all the symptoms but I’m still undiagnosed so I can’t lean into that too much until such a condition is confirmed by a doctor. In any case, whether it be anxiety, self doubt, or learning challenges, I’m struggling. I’m struggling big time. 

Does anyone else in the corporate world feel this way?

TLDR I can’t seem to connect with my office/work life. It’s overly burdensome and I feel like I’m acting for 9-10 hours a day. I want to cry most days. I feel unqualified and stupid constantly. Motivating myself is hard. On top of all that, mental health discussions still seem to be taboo in the corporate world. Is this culture still just untapped by recent social movements or will it always be like this?",08Apr2020,1
153,"i’m not good at explaining. i’m just going to bullet point. some of these things aren’t correlated. i just really need someone to point me in the right direction.
- i am very on edge, the moment i hear something i don’t want to i lash out
- i have not done a single school assignment this year
- i can’t focus on anything, all i can clearly think about is my favorite novel (this has been the case since 2017)
- i’ve been having nightmares and dreams where i brutally murder the people i know
- i’ve had a strong urge to hurt someone or something. i haven’t done anything like that in a few months but also haven’t been redirecting my feelings toward anything
- it feels like everything is distorted and the only thing i have is my favorite novel. everything else is just, impossible to think about without getting upset.
- i have no hobbies anymore. i have loved drawing my entire life until 2018, there was a brief period where i had no hobbies before i got into video editing. now since december 2019 i have had no hobbies. all i do is walk in circles and think about my favorite novel. occasionally i play video games.
- i started testing for an IEP a few weeks ago but i don’t think i will be able to finish it because of school shutting down.
i don’t know what’s wrong with me. i know something is wrong. if i was fine then i’d be doing schoolwork and keeping my grades decent and would have attended school for the past year and not broken things or hurt things. it’s impossible to ask for help when i don’t know what’s wrong. maybe i’m just too caught up in my own situation to take a step back and rationally look at what’s wrong. i would appreciate some input or advice.

154,"Hi, I have struggled with intense anger my entire life, the type that makes you annoyed at yourself, the type of anger that feels painful, annoying and incredibly frustrating. The way I act when I get really angry or frustrated is that I have a panic attacks. Or at-least a similar reaction. I fall down to my knees moving back and forth while hyperventilating, often having repeating behaviour such as franticly moving a pair of keys, ripping paper over and over, scratching my hands, feet or pulling my hair. This is a way for me to control my actions, and I obsessively have to do them. All while both my head and my body is fuming, truly like hellfire. It is completely unbearable,  and truly painful because you just want the other party to let you be, you just want to get away. And I feel so helpless because there is nothing I can do, I cant talk or flee, I dont want to be a bad person so I cant  scream or yell. I am trapped with no options and so I panic and fall to my knees because there is nothing I can do to make them stop.

I have talked with multiple people about this and they told me that my ""panic attacks""  are caused by fear, but I find that very hard to belive, because I dont fear anything in this situation. when I am this angry I couldn't care less about me, or my goal, or consequences of any kind, I only focus on control in these moments and limiting the pain caused by my anger and sadness. I am never afraid.

And so my question is this: Does anyone else have ""panic attacks"" from anger/annoyance or is it only possible trough fear? is this truly a panic attack or is it something else? if it is then what?

155,"Like I said in the title,I’m having some things about my mental health.The most certain thing is those aren’t caused by puberty.

I’ll try to explain them as much as possible,but I’ll probably fail.

First of all,I get excited over “fictional” beings’ suffering.This started with cartoon characters.I used to enjoy them getting injured, or hurt.I was at about 9(maybe wrong,but sometime around that).Now this keeps going,with characters from series, books, movies etc.

Let me describe the feeling.I feel happy.I feel like I got some good news, my heart beats fast, I feel adrenaline in my blood.

The second one is something closer to munchauser syndrome, but not quite that.I used to want to lose parts of my body(eye,leg,arm etc.).I have no idea why,but the closest thing to a reason is “attention”.I wanted to bad things to happen to me.

I have a couple of other things, but they don’t make me feel as concerned as the ones I explained above.

156,"Asking on behalf of my partner (25) here, since they've been trying to research this phenomenon that's been happening to them since they were a child. They mentioned this to me when we were watching a show and the show zoomed in on someone's head (in a little bubble over where their head was,keeping their body the same size) and then zoomed back out. 

Basically, they said they see that happening IRL when they stare at someone for a prolonged period of time, seeing people's heads constantly shrink and grow. They've been trying to research this for years, but the most they found was Alice in Wonderland syndrome, which didn't seem to totally line up with what they experience. They mentioned experiencing this to a doctor when they were young, but all the doctor said was, ""Huh, that *is* weird.""

Is there anything that you think this might be indicative of? Is there a name for this phenomenon?

157,"To make a long story short, I've caught a beetle in a small jar today. I thought it was already dead at first, but later found out it was alive and searching around. It had a few legs broken so I knew releasing it would still mean death for the thing. So I tried to kill it, since I know keeping it alive like that was practically torture. I added just enough water to the tiny jar for the beetle to drown in, but watching it struggle to crawl up to air and lose power was suddenly so fascinating to me. So I emptied the water before it died. After watching it search around in the jar again, I did it again. And again, and again. I don't know how this thing is still alive, or why I enjoy watching it almost die but still stay alive. This isn't my first time capturing alive bugs in a jar either, but the other times I allowed the water to fully kill them. I found it amusing then but this time was a lot more entertaining. It took me an hour distracted from the beetle to realize how messed up what I was doing was and how I was out right torturing it. I know I should end its suffering but I still kept it in the jar. I'm not sure what to do. I feel like I should feel horrible but I don't, I just feel surprised about all this. One part of me is going, well, it's just a bug, who cares. Another part is going well, you're still actively torturing a living creature, what is wrong with you.

159,"Hi all. First post in this sub. As I'm sitting in my quiet house after not having slept all night, feeling more anxious than I have in a while, I realized I want to get help but I don't even know where to start? I'm 28. Female, if that even matters. A registered nurse and nurse practitioner student. Obviously under a tremendous amount of stress as I just submitted my last assignment for the semester, one that my overall grade pretty much relies on and the anxiety of getting feedback on it is making me crazy. And I mean, that's just my situation at this very moment. I've been putting off therapy or a psych appointment for several years. I've submitted appointment requests over the years and always called to tell them I've changed my mind. I have no hobbies. I stare at my phone all day. I had some bullshit blog I've been running for the past few years but even that doesn't interest me anymore. I'll get random bursts of inspiration sometimes that are very short lived and then I'm back to laying on the couch without a shower for days at a time. I stopped doing my makeup, I don't watch what I eat. I quit playing video games. I quit spending time with my animals more than just like taking care of their needs and I LOVE them like they're my children. I have literally zero friends. I'm a mess. I basically go to work and come home and procrastinate homework until the last minute. And I realistically have been like this for the past 18 years but never got help and a big part of me thinks it's too late. So idk.

160,"Sometimes I feel like there is no point in life, that I'll finish school, get a job, retire and die (at least I hope so and I dont die earlier). But its that way for all of us and sometimes I feel there is no point in that. The only thing I see point in when I feel like this is making a family. I know this things are necessary and same for all of us, but sometimes I feel like its just a never ending circle. I know I said sometimes a lot, that because I dont feel that constantly only sometimes.

I also sometimes have this feeling that everything good ends, which is true but when I have a good time  its like a reminder that its going to end. Even when Im doing nothing I think of that I will have good times in my life, but they will not last forever. 

When Im watching movies or tv shows I usually get a strong showhole or psd (post series/show depression) which is normal, but sometimes I feel like that, just not for movies, but for life.

 I watch a lot of youtube because I dont get so attached to it, but recently I found a streamer on twitch and I feel similar as with movies, but its not the same. I dont know how to explain it becauee even I dont understand it. I really like her and I want to meet her at like meet and greet, but I know its probably never going to happen, because I cant go to twitchcon and other events and when I'll be able to go and if I ever decide to go she might not even be there. This will probably last for a week or two, because I usually get over excited for stuff and then after a few weeks I forget about it, so that much of a problem.

I dont like talking about my age, because Im young and I feel a lot of people are not going to take me seriously becaues of that. I do kinda think it should be mentioned here Im fairly young, Im going to high school next year and I have pretty much my whole life ahead of me. 

I dont have any mental disorders or anything like that, even though it is possible. I might be addicted to electronics, but I dont like to admit that. I am on my phone or pc most of my time if I can, but I remember when I didnt have my phone for a month and it wasnt that bad.

I know this post is a mess. If you did not understand something, its fine, feel free to ask. Im not writting this because I want you to feel bad for me or anything like that. Im writting this because I feel that I need to get this out of me.

163,"Introduction:

Before we dive into this topic let us make ourselves familiar with WHO definitions of a few common terms. The theme of World Health Day (April 7) 2019 was Universal Health Coverage which the WHO defines as “All people having access to the health services they need including prevention, promotion, treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care without the risk of financial hardship when paying for them.” On the other hand, Mental health is defined as “A state of well-being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community.” For decades mental health services were not identified as “the needs of people” and were largely excluded from essential health services and the notion of universal health coverage.

Problem statement:

In India, around 15 crore (12.5%) people are in need of active intervention for mental illnesses. Around 1.2 crore are living with serious mental disorders. India has the highest suicide rate among 10 South-East Asian countries. This scenario is further worsened because of a shortage of specialists and health services. To put it in numbers there is nearly one trained psychiatrist for every 2,50,000 people. (Reference)

A report by WHO projected that depression would likely be the leading cause of disability worldwide by 2020.

Excessive anxiety and stress can contribute to problems such as heart disease, ulcers, and colitis; they can also reduce the strength of the immune system, making people more vulnerable to infections. Psychological problems also increase the likelihood that people will make poor behavioral choices which can contribute to medical problems. Smoking, excessive alcohol or drug use, poor eating habits, and reckless behavior can all result in severe physical problems and the need for medical services. Misunderstanding and stigma surrounding mental health are widespread.

Despite the existence of effective treatments for mental disorders, there is a belief that they are un-treatable or that people with mental disorders are difficult, not intelligent, or incapable of making decisions.

This stigma can lead to abuse, rejection, and isolation and exclude people from health care or support. Within the health system, people are too often treated in institutions that resemble human warehouses rather than places of healing. The neglect of mental health care globally, combined with catastrophic healthcare costs due to high out-of-pocket expenditure, the economic costs of being unable to work, household costs of caring for someone with mental health problems and the limited economic opportunities due to social marginalisation, means that people with mental health problems and their families are at great risk of being ‘left behind’ by development initiatives such as UHC.

What has been done:

The current situation exists in spite of a series of policy and programmatic interventions in the last three decades, i.e., the National Mental Health Programme, 1982; the Mental Health Act, 1987; and the District Mental Health Programme (DMHP), 1996. All these have failed due to numerous roadblocks that existed between developing policy and implementing programme. Recently, the first National Mental Health Policy of India was released and the Mental Health Care Bill (MHCB) was passed by the Indian Parliament to replace the Mental Health Act of 1987.

The World Health Day 2017 theme- “Depression: Let’s Talk” provided an opportunity for a comprehensive appraisal of mental health services in any country.

The recent initiatives have created a new wave of awareness about mental health and people have started believing mental health disorders as a priority.

What needs to be done:

In order to increase the availability of mental health services, there are 5 key barriers that need to be overcome: the absence of mental health from the public health agenda; the current organization of mental health services; lack of integration within primary care; inadequate human resources for mental health; and lack of public mental health leadership.

The implementation of the “right to mental health” provision could define the future of “right to health” in India and elsewhere.

Last, but not least efforts for spreading awareness at individual level should be made so that it no longer remains a taboo.

Conclusion:

Till now, the efforts at the global level have not been up to the magnitude of the challenge. The situation will only be better when not only efforts are made at the highest level of administration but more importantly at the basic unit of society — family as they are the pillars of support for any individual. Also though mental health disorder may be present in one but its effect is felt most by his/her caretakers. When we are free of depression, anxiety, excessive stress and worry, addictions, and other psychological problems, we are more able to live our lives to the fullest.

169,"Ok so this is my first post here, and I don't really know much about mental health, but I just need to get this out there.

I will start with my current situation: I am an eleventh-grade student in Germany, and here (or just my state I am not sure) you are required to write a complex paper before you can graduate. While this project is quite important in most schools, mine requires us to work together with an Institute or Business to write a ""proper"" scientific paper, which, at least in formalities, should equal something a college student could do.

As it is normal in my School I found a really kind supervisor and he helped me for the last few months, but the problem I currently have has also started getting worse over this time.

I do not know why, but I just can't work on that project. I love the subject. My supervisor is great. I love the idea of doing it. But I am not. In the beginning, it took me ages to respond to mails, or do my stuff, but I did it, and while I was definitely rude, it was ok. After winter break, there was Project week, where we students would work solely on our projects at the place our Supervisor works at, and I made progress, but now I feel stuck. I have to work on the PC for it anyways, so corona is no reason for me not to work, but I procrastinate all the time and I don't understand why. All the other Homework we get from school, I am able to do, and that is stuff I like way less. Yet, It feels like my body is physically unable to do this project.

The due date is coming up in a few weeks, and I feel terribly stressed, yet I do nothing. Whenever my supervisor sends an Email, I get so stressed I sometimes need days just to open it. Today I got an email from my school asking if everything is alright since my Supervisor send them a really concerned email, asking if everything is ok. (That's just what I got from the Notification, I have not read it yet) I have felt like crying for days, but I somehow don'T. Instead, I get like mini-mental breakdowns just tensing up, having this forced breath, and feeling utterly crushed, wanting to cry. I am always so determined to do it until I am almost doing it then I don't. It is not especially hard to do. I know what I should do, and I see no reason why I should not be able to do that. And while I am getting more and more stressed, there still is time. If I started now, It would be easy to get something presentable done in time. But, I feel so stressed, and not doing what I know should be easy just makes everything worse.

I have always been prone to procrastination, but I got things done (semi) in time. Despite having some trouble, I have always been great at school, and I never had to put in much effort at all. Now that I have to, I feel like my body is physically incapable of performing actual work for school.

I am a more or less introverted person, spending most of my time inside even while the world was normal, and I feel no stress from not being able to meet people.

I don't know what I should do, and I just wanna get this done with, but I am at a point where I know, just wanting to do it really does not help.

It certainly does not help that the PC I would have to work on is the same as the one I spend the majority of my life on anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

170,"Hi everyone ! I hope you’re staying safe and in good health (mentally and physically!!) during these crazy times ☺️ and sorry if this is not the suitable subreddit, and i will be happy if someone redirect me to a better one also please i want people with experience . Thank you;

I lost around 35kgs over 6 years and the fact that it was a long term process reassured me that I wasn’t falling into the diet “trap” and it was just me living a new “lifestyle” that was better for me health.

I was completely blinded to how wrong many of the small habits I picked up along the way like banning any oils and carbs (I didn’t eat pasta rice even pizza for 6 years!!!!) and I convinced myself it was for my best to eat salads while I watched others enjoy my cravings! This is the worst one: I started cooking everything I restricted myself to eat for my family and friends!! I mastered the art of making perfect pizza’s pasta dishes and risottos but never even tasted them! I would literally just smell them!! It makes me so sad to even write this because it’s sinking in as I recall these habits!  Then the flexible diet came along and I was ecstatic because it meant I can eat everything I wanted as long as I don’t go over the macro limit some stupid website assigned me which sounds Ludacris to me now looking back at it!

That’s when binge eating started, obviously reintroducing these restricted foods that I couldn’t eat for so many years was going to result in the cycle of late night binging and then guilt trip calorie restriction for the next days until I get bad cravings again and restart the cycle! It’s crazy and I feel trapped because some days after binging I feel worthless and some days I have to tell myself that I have to move on and forget about it but it’s always there in the back of my head unconsciously controlling me to not to add cheese or reduce my portion size


I still feel stuck and I’m aware that I am but I have no idea how to escape this toxic disorder and even worse I’m so scared to escape it! I know I wrote way tooo much I’m so sorry for that but I just feel hopeless I don’t know who to ask because everyone around me seems to just eating without really thinking about it and I envy that! I want to be normal but I just don’t know how. I wanted to ask how to start to break this toxic disorder what were the first steps because for me although I’m aware and I accepted that i have it I’m too scared to stop and I don’t even know how or where to start


I feel the scariest part is losing that extreme control I had over what and how much I can eat to satisfy the ED. I test it sometimes like I would add some olive oil or not weigh how much I serve myself and my brain truly can’t handle it, a lot of thoughts just surge in and overwhelm my head like “this isn’t allowed” “you were doing so well why mess up” “its just a test, only this once and we’ll get back on track tomorrow”..etc and i either not eat what I plated or have half and leave the rest regardless of my satiety level. I don’t understand how it works but the control feels sort of comforting in a way it’s so confusing. what makes it worse is comments I get mainly from family members on how I look like and my weight loss, they completely fuel the ED and in a way justify it making it so much harder to recover.


And omg the scales!! I’m trying not to weigh myself like before, I used to weigh myself every morning but now I have to resist the urge to do that which to be fair is easy because I’m just scared to see my new weight. The fear of losing control really stems from letting go of that power and going back to point zero 6 years ago where I was 30+ kg heavier.

I was very unhappy at that weight and I compared myself a looot to my friends I just felt worthless compared to them like I didn’t deserve to be loved because how “ugly” and “unhealthy” my body was! And that’s scary to go back to

At the moment I reached a point where I really want to break free from this restriction I have over myself, it truly is toxic not only to my mental health but it’s impacted my social life, my studies and career too! I can’t sit and study for longer than an hour without the fear of sitting for too long creeps in and I need to break out some burpees or jumping jacks to not feel like crap! Going over to friends houses freaks me out since I’ll be served food I have no control
Over and that we might be sitting down for “too” long! I haven’t had more than two periods a year since 2015 and my mom is  worried sick she took me to so many doctors and because Im able to hide my disordered habits from my family and my BMI is considered “normal” I was never diagnosed with an ED and they dismissed the amenorrhea and blamed it on lazy ovaries. I was prescribed contraceptive pills and I refused to take them because they might increase my appetite!

I spoke about it once to a close friend and I was literally told “omg just eat who cares!” Those words hurt and they make it harder because they don’t understand what I’m going through..they don’t understand that I care even though I don’t want to care I’m trapped and I want to escape it. I don’t want to talk about it with anyone anymore  because for me it’s embarrassing, like the most simple silly thing in life is my worst enemy",08Apr2020,1
171,"hello all, I (20M) have been having a problem and I just need to vent. Let me preface that this may not be as serious of an issue as some other posts on this thread but I digress. Growing up I was always the fat kid. I have recently lost 70 pounds (240-&gt;170) so my confidence around the opposite sex has skyrocketed. People actually acknowledge me and respect me a human. Growing up the fat kid had its difficulties of course, bullies and such. When I was overweight I also found it extremely difficult to find a girl that liked me in the same way I liked her (though weight is not the only factor) Let me preface that at 20 years old I have not felt love, or what appeared to be love from the opposite sex. Its always been one sided. Now in no way do I blame women for my rejection, in no way do I also dislike women or consider myself an incel. I sadly have a tendency to get in too deep with a girl I have interest in and it has caused the downfall of two friendships that I held very near and dear to me. The repercussions from those both involved a depressive slump for months on end. The most recent lasting until January. I have pretty much since, closed myself off from dating. So needless to say, I have a fair bit of experience with rejection, as most of us probably do.

Not only did I grow up overweight but I also lived in a mentally abusive household. I will not go into details but a sibling for many years caused many fights and brought hell to my house. So day in and day out there was yelling, cussing, physical altercations and just awful things that have left its mark on me. To escape from all of this I would escape to my room, where my computer, videogames, comics, movies were at etc, just to separate myself from the chaos. I tried to isolate myself

So herein lies the problem: being hurt over and over again and growing up in a fucked up house has made me some what cold and cynical. I am generally a very happy, outgoing and optimistic person. I have noticed recently (probably due to weight loss) that I have been finding more and more women that are attracted to me. And that's great. Its attention I have NEVER gotten before. I have come across a few girls who have expressed interest in taking things further but I find myself pushing them away. Consciously I tell myself, ""I am focusing on my college classes and the mission"" (""the mission"" is a name i have given my fitness crusade to get into better shape fyi). But deep down I know it is something else. I am afraid of getting hurt again and I enjoy being alone. I used to HATE being single. I thought finding a girl would help with all my problems and depressive moments, but that has changed. 

Now, as mentioned, I push people away. Part of me says ""no, u/TheBatmanWhomLaughs, you should go out on dates and meet people"" but I back out and get cold feet. I THRIVE on being alone now. I almost crave it. I enjoy it. It calms me down. I don't have to deal with other peoples BS. I have my shit together, I know what I want and don't have to put up with others. While I still find myself scrolling trough Tinder and bumble, I know theres a good chance that if i meet someone, ill just push them away because commitment or catching feelings threatens what makes me happy; the solidarity. It sounds so backwards and out of character for me because of how outgoing and friendly I can be, but its the truth. I believe that I dont need love to be happy, I have found happiness in my own way through my hobbies, ""the mission"", my goals, and my friends and family whom I love deeply. But the wall around my heart remains. I do hope that one day I'll meet the woman who deconstructs the wall around my heart.

I used to do anything for someone I had an interest in. I learned quickly that you get taken advantage of. I learned what happens when you put people on a pedestal (y'all would probably call that ""simping""). I used to want to give the world, but now I wont give shit to anyone who isn't a close friend or family or who I believe doesn't deserve it. The selfless person who I prided myself being is slowly turning selfish. Cold and cynical with a wall around my heart, only focused on myself. When I neglected myself for many years. 

This is something I haven't told others. I don't what kind of response I am going to get, if any at all, thanks",08Apr2020,1
172,"Does anyone here have experience of anhedonia without depression or other mental illnesses? By anhedonia I mean a loss of joy and pleasure. If so, for how long, what do you think caused it, and, if you feel better now, how did you overcome it? I’ve been struggling with this for years now and have come to realise that if I don’t learn how to love life again, life itself isn’t worth living. 

Though I had a mildly depressive phase in the last winter months (sadness, lack of motivation and fatigue), it’s ended now and I don’t have any other symptoms of depression — I am still motivated and inquisitive, have enough energy to exercise, dance, read and learn languages, have a healthy appetite and a great deal of hope. Most importantly, I have absolutely no desire to end my life. 

However, I have not enjoyed anything for years and don’t remember the last time I felt joy. The only feelings I feel with some intensity are negative ones — loneliness, sadness, disappointment. There is no longer any joy or wonder in my life — I feel so empty and don’t understand why. 

How on earth can I change this? I’m in perfect health and have a life most people would be delighted with. It’s frustrating because I realise now that for the past few years, the driving factors for almost all my decisions have been either distraction from this joylessness, or desire for a spiritual remedy — not true enjoyment or a sense of meaningfulness. It’s a realisation which has dampened my enjoyment of life even more. If anyone knows what might be wrong, I would be so grateful for your advice!",08Apr2020,1

Well, I have a bit too much time on my hands because of the quarantine so I decided to make one summarizing my life story and the issues I'm struggling with at the moment. I know it's silly, but it was honestly really cathartic to make, and I thought it might be more interesting to read than a long post.

185,"I don't know how to live with myself, i just expect y'all to drill me as a terrible shit person and that is okay, i am not a good man and i should probably be hung for being born with such a difficult disability (Mild intellectual disability) that makes no one understand the motives behind my coping mechanisms.

After missing about 3 appointments in the past (few years ago), i finally felt motivated to get myself back into the system through a doctor's referral, what motivated me to get back in was that i was in a mental crisis at that time. I over a month ago had 2 appointments which i attended and the 3rd which was over the phone as the Covid crisis grew, i had my 4th scheduled which was really my (7th) if you include the missed appointments from a few years ago. I missed that one last week and my therapist has called me 2 times and i have not answered the phone. I slipped into another mood where i just go ghost for no reason, merely because i felt misunderstood and because i feel shame, i also feel like no one will be able to treat me and so these things just make me ghost or push people away.

Over a week ago i called the emergency as i was thinking of killing myself after a horrific 7-day OCD episode, a specialist talked to me for an hour and i felt fine again.

It is very crucial that i commit to therapy to make sure i learn to cope with my OCD, i'm on meds for my OCD which have been lifesaving for the past 3 years but over the course of  the last few months i feel they are pooping out and i am slipping into bad obsessive episodes more frequently as opposed to rarely. It's also very difficult to treat me because i also have BPD with NPD traits.

I again feel as if i let others down, as if i mess everything up, it does not help when my doctor shakes his head in a joking but smug way and is a upper class posh narcissist., i feel like a burden talking to him, because i have visited him so frequently, he has become so sick of me and my shit. He contributes to my shame as well. I feel because of my disability no one will ever understand me and i feel i have been failed by the healtcare system, i feel failed that no one takes my disability into account for my communication issues and commitment. What do i do? continue suffering or own up to my therapist and pity myself again? something is not right here and it is clear that nothing is working for me besides meds. Last night i took like 2 pills of Valium which helped ease my obsession for an hour before flaring up again",08Apr2020,1
186,"I feel that way because mental health is in a weird spot in our world, in this world it’s survival of the fittest, if you fall behind, you die (fail), and society seems to not care for the ones cursed with mental illnesses or going through tough times. School systems especially, a lot teachers don’t seem to give a flying fuck.

I am in no way shape or form saying schools are not trying or are doing a shitty job, they are doing the best they can, and it’s amazing, just improvements could be made and staff should cooperate more.

I feel that I’m recent years mental health discrimination is also on the rise, with people faking it for attention all the time or “to be cool” it leaves us in the dark, and we look like fakes and clowns. Many people I’ve run into who do not have mental illness commonly get annoyed when I tell them my problems and how they can help me in life, saying shit along the lines of “just do (insert)” or “you’re not trying hard enough” or “it’s not that hard just (insert) or “what’s wrong with you?” Or “you always ruin things with your (insert) bullshit”

I, 17 female, consciously know that they are allowed to do things without me and that they have a life away from me, but in my head it feels like I did something horribly wrong and it's more of a punishment when I know it's most likely not. It's like the only time I can feel happy is with this person, but I want to feel happy even without them. This isn't even the first time this has happened. I've clung to other people before this one, when they left it felt like they hated me and it took months or years to get over, and yet I was still around them because I had nowhere to go. I'm still scared of telling these people how I feel and that I'll hurt or offend them with how I feel so much so that they'll abandon me. I don't want to hurt them and I surely don't want to be alone, but I feel like I should. Opening up to people just sends me into a panic making me believe I screwed up by letting them know me and that they'll leave me.

now for the past few weeks i’ve been at a huge convention center that was transformed into a hospital to hold patients. seeing these patients come in has really been fucking with me. yesterday i watched an old man take his last breath as they were taking him out the ambulance. this whole situation has me beyond stressed. i’m working 12-15 hours day, 7 days a week, 0 days off. i’m not sleeping well so i’m only getting about 3 hours of rest a night. i’m starting to push my girlfriend away unintentionally, barely even talking to her. i haven’t talked to my family in about 2 weeks. i just have no desire to talk to anyone. i don’t feel like myself right now.

191,"So this doesn’t have a *huge* impact on my life but it’s very annoying and idk what it is or why I have it.

Basically as I’ve gotten older (and I’m only 18) I have started thinking more about the past (not just during my life but back in previous centuries) and i feel so empty inside. Like I think about how happy I used to be, and other, recent eras and as things in my life have changed (moving schools, people dying whether I know them or not, people I’m used to seeing retiring/dying) it makes me sad. The thing is though, I think it’s that I just only like the first way I saw things.

For example I’m like this with tv series. Even if I’m watching a tv show set in the 1920s, after the first season or two as the show shifts I get the same feeling I have with my life. I feel like we’re in a future time where things are uncertain and everything has changed. I’m a big sports fan and my favorite times watching sports are entirely the first 2-3 years I watched a given sport. Since then I still enjoy it but because players, teams etc have changed I feel a bit empty. I constantly think about my family’s old house, the things I used to do there etc. the house we live in now is fine, my family is happy and all that but bc the other house is where my memories are from I feel like I could only be happy there for some reason?

I’m not a depressed person at all but to me these thoughts stop me from being happy. And I don’t see when it’ll go away, as time passes I’ll just be further from the times I “enjoyed” and as my grandparents pass away, I fall further from contact with old friends, etc. The only thing I feel like could stop it is if I have kids where I’m now seeing life through a new perspective but other than that idk

195,"I don’t know where else to post this. My friend sent me a documentary on shadow people because we’re both very into paranormal stuff, but this is getting too real. I’ve had hallucinations for YEARS. I believe they started when I was around 8 yo. They only come in a specific mood, something like mania. I get very paranoid and delusional, hallucinations of shadows. Last time was a couple months ago, I walked out of the bathroom and saw a tall figure. It stayed for a couple seconds, usually they don’t. I kept seeing alien type things, a bunch of times sitting on the couch. No weird lighting. At that point I was convinced my mom was teaming up with them to hurt me. It sounds pretty obvious that it was just me. 

The documentary is terrifyingly similar to what I experience though. Especially when it mentioned the aliens. When I talked to my psychiatrist about the shadow hallucinations and she just dismissed them as normal. I don’t think they’re normal whether it’s in my head or not. She didn’t seem concerned, so I’m assuming that it’s something else. I don’t know why they follow me and no one else in the family. My grandma says I used to see a man in the bedroom door. I don’t know why they didn’t stop either. I’m a bit worried. I’ve never been hurt, but it seems like they’re getting more aggressive . I’ve never seen glowing eyes. They definitely not take me energy, they  do startle me. I’m not sure what aliens would want from me, I’m barely even fertile. I’m just a depressed pos why would they be watching me?

 I came to a very eye opening realization yesterday that I have mental disorders. It suddenly became clear to me that most issues in my life are rooted to my disorders and I would like to fix myself because at this point, I feel broken. It is hard to face the truth. I grew up in an environment where both parents have deep undealt with trauma, and was constantly reflected on me. It was never an emotionally stable environment.
I have a tendency to ruminate, involuntarily obsess in terms of thoughts over past/future, ideas, situations, etc., and I have these moments on a daily basis for at least an hour. I also realized I’m very compulsive in all situations throughout my life. I don’t realize I was being compulsive until it is pointed out to me.
I am relieved to have realized these things about myself and I want most of all for my disorder to not control me, but for me to control it. I do not want to take medication and cannot afford therapy. 
What can I do to stop these intrusive and involuntary thoughts/actions?

203,"So I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this but I'm at a loss. I have depression and anxiety, the depression is mostly under control and I haven't needed to take anything for it in the last few years but anxiety is a constant in my life.

I've always had issues where I'm convinced I'll die young in fact I can't see myself making it to 30 which is 4 years away. I'm not afraid of dying but I'm not planning on dying either right now. I haven't had a suicide attempt in 3 year. I've come to accept it and haven't thought about my future because I don't see a point.

What's getting to me is that this thought of dying before I'm 30 just never leaves me, I really can't see myself turning 30 and it's always been the same age it's never changed. I have no idea how I will die so I can't say for sure it will be suicide, I've no health issues that I know of but I can't rule out a sudden sickness or it could just be an accident.

206,"hi
i’m writing this post because I need to understand the root of my hyper sensitivity, which i’ve been carrying for some time now. Growing up I’ve always felt everything in a deeper way than others and, even though this can be a positive thing to have when it comes to develop empathy towards others, the negative things that have been thrown on my way weren’t very well welcomed. I’ve always been shy and introverted, mostly as a personality trait but also as a result of home violence from an abusive dad, hence why as soon as I stepped in school many children felt like bullying me and this narrative went on up until nowadays. This negative environment brought to my soul feelings of neglect, worthlessness, self loathing that accumulated within me and never saw the opportunity to be processed in a healthy way, reason why I have an inner anger that lashes out whenever someone criticises me and a difficulty when it comes to recognise advice thrown in a little more harsh and honest way than usual from a hurtful comment. Later on, I developed some talents which I rationally think I’m pretty good at but wouldn’t let anybody question me in these things because I felt like that would’ve taken away from me the only things that I would be proud of (again, steaming from a background of self loathing). To get straight to the point, anything good about me, wherever it was something out of my personality/looks or the talents themselves, was my only weapon against the people who misunderstood me and I more than often feel like justifying everything I do.

it’s like: *look, you’ve always underestimated me and thought that I would be nothing by now but here I am to change your belief and demonstrate that I’m better than that*

just yesterday, my cousin told me that my hair were a little messy out of bed and I felt so bad...I felt like she was being mean to me but I still tried to keep it cool and told her that, next time, she can be a little warmer in her tone. She, on her side, told me that I have this inner anger that needs to come out everytime someone questions the slightest shit about me and that, at the age of 19, I should accept to be in the wrong and not always have the last word.
I don’t know what to do with myself anymore, this is just one of the many problems I have and I often look up to therapy, but can’t afford it. I hate the fact that my past is still shaping my personality and make me believe that I’m so worthless that I need to cling to an artificial ego. I lack confidence and I don’t know if I can really resolve this alone and move on, or if the blame relies entirely on the way I’ve been treated so that I could make peace with myself.

208,"This story starts at 13 I buy a Juul after moving to Cali to fit in at my new school in this new city. I get caught with it my first time when I'm suspended for (in my innocents) dropping my Juul outside the bathroom in front of a camera. my parents where relatively chill as they believe I'll deal with it with a therapist that they force me to see which didn't work for months at which point I was tired of it and put my foot down as all it was, was someone talking about dealing with my feelings and I had no trouble doing that ever I'm a very open person just one with bad self-control at the face of the social benefits that go with certain drugs. But then one day, Mark, the head of my middle school catches me with my phone oh nooooooo, this is relevant later when I get called into the office, however, and this will come in later. I have no clue why I'm there but I'm terrified 'cause I have Juul pods in my bag. This is where my problem really begins I got the pods the night before with this kid ""mike"" who I'm trying to keep away from this he took a picture of me with the bb gun and sent it to someone who didn't like me, who used it to say she was scared and get my bag searched. in there where the pods mike had asked me to buy from him. I didn't even have the Juul. I'm back in therapy which not only doesn't help but makes me resent dealing with my shit as i resented therapy now. I get caught twice more cause this kid ben and I was homies and he would buy ounces on ounces of weed and thousands of pods. My parents watched me start to go down but catch myself in time. I stayed clean and quit pretty much for good only getting a vape for like a week years later. I started going to a new private school after forcing the school to let me finish the year from home and recommend me plus clean my record. I'm clean till like mid-early 9th grade where I'm depressed cause I'm avoiding social interactions and parties cause everyone there smokes and I know I don't have the control bout me not smoke myself at that point. I'm socially isolated and the therapist my parents get me makes me feel like an addict and I decide why not act like one in an act of impulse and decide to smoke with this kid jake again. this time though I get this stizzy (weed) that I mostly only use it with my friends cause I liked the social benefits and being with people not having to worry or constantly think about self-control and not being the kid who doesn't go to parties or party at all in la. then I get caught with it like that week when I decide to use it at home and my dad looks through the bathroom window. my parents maybe due to all the addicts in my family, maybe cause of what happened to my friend, or maybe cause my mom is a shrink, send me to rehab after catching me vaping four times and smoking once. this was pointless, as a boy who grew up with a therapist mother, with coping mechanisms that were ingrained within me from birth and slammed in for years by therapy clearly this was not addiction it was social pressure that would subside with time but. they made a case that I was an addict and I spent a month at rehab where I was discharged cause the rehab specialists didn't think I needed it after this I went to summer camp and I was clean till the last week where these kids came with weed I was about to go home but had a fun week with them instead and left camp and didn't smoke all summer. this year I stayed clean for a month till I started losing friends again missing out on things getting isolated and one of my friends had another disposable this time a different friend but he gave me a good deal n I thought one time I got caught with that then got clean for 7 months and was tired of avoiding my friends when they had those tight bonds and shit and I started up again I got caught and my dad made me see his life coach. I was the first kid he had worked with. I told my dad this explaining that our first 3 calls he was clearly trying to identify and unwind bad habits I had built so I could live a better life but I didn't need that cause I am a child. I'm still building habits. furthermore, my actions don't always reflect how I feel as compared to adults. He said ur getting coached or rehab pre COVID. This caused me a great deal of emotional strain as I was tired and over this therapy stuff and I lashed out. when I stopped caring what my parents thought and had a vape and delivered to the house to give to a kid than I got to weed and got caught ordering that too. I stopped for a week than COVID hit and I was clean another after committed to getting my parents to trust me. but then I lost it again when this kid who tried getting me off the football team last year got ahold of a video of me smoking as well as one of me snorting crushed up sugar which at the time was taken by my friend cause we were trying to prank our other friend but somehow this kid gets it. He for some reason wanted to get me in trouble so he sent them to the head of the school. it wasn't on school grounds and COVID is going down so no actions where taken but it was a whole thing I told them they could order any test they wanted they could even have my hair but id never ever do coke. then I got bored I was unpacking a box and found some weed I had forgotten I packed away my parents caught me 2 days after that incident smoking and then last week with my last bit. then I waited another month smoked again and was just caught now recently yes I have been doing it stupidly cause I'm bored and lonely and miss my friends. I'm just a kid trying to fit in with the la crowd and i slip up some times a total of maybe 15 accounting of all my usage from 2017-2020 and I'm stuck. I'm in therapy at a standstill and i may go to rehab. what do i do? I'm sure this wasn't too easy to follow but please i just want to know... i have 2 As 3 Bs and 1 C better than last year, I'm a generally mentally ok person when it comes to dealing with stuff when given time but it seems the more I'm assisted the worse I am helped what do you guys think. am i an addict? if not what do i do",08Apr2020,0

215,"okay if you asked me that question, my answer would immediately be no. my family has been so accepting, loving, and supportive of my success my entire life. we have our arguments and trying times as everyone does, but for the most part i am fully aware that they love me. 

but for whatever reason, i feel resentful around them. it’s easier for me to tolerate them if i just tell myself to perceive them as normal people rather than “my family” and i often have give myself a mental slap on the wrist when my mind lashes out at them internally just for existing. 

it makes sense when they’re being rude or inconsiderate or something, but this happens even when we are having a good time and laughing. i thought maybe it was because i havent let go of some of the things that happened between us when i was younger (nothing insane, just your usual amount of childhood trauma — most people have been there) and maybe i havent been able to talk about that enough. then i thought maybe it was because i have spent so much time around them, being as my parents are strict so i am often stuck in the house. but then i moved away for college and even coming home i feel like i am best when i am detached. 

so why do i feel this resentment towards them? it’s not all the time and i honestly get really happy when i am able to feel genuine positivity around them, but when it does happen i cant help but wonder why im so annoyed when there is usually no underlying issues at hand.

221,"After a horrible time in middle school I decided to turn my life around and try to achieve a lot more than I did academically and in extra curriculars. 

I came out of my shell and started volunteering and working for a community organization focused on media. I also wanted to earn top grades and be in the top 10 in my high school class. 

My freshman year I went around and did everything I possibly could to do well and fill this need to do better. I took the hardest classes and joined various clubs to participate in many out of school events. My first semester was amazing as I earned nearly perfect grades and managed to establish myself in 3 different non-athletic activities. I was filled with pride and a sense of accomplishment. Then second semester I had to maintain it but I did worse because I started being lured to toxic people and my own mental health started to decline because I didn’t have people at the school to support me. 

I ended up being 16th in my class and on track with teacher recommendations and all these activities lined up for me to do. 

But my Sophomore year it all fell apart. My own mental health came to a boil when I got rejected again by people at my school and my parents were mad at me for my recent behavior. I was also taken advantage of by someone who used to go to the school and was left feeling really powerless and hopeless leading up to my attempt. I got put on a hold and went to a psych ward for 56 hours where I didn’t register what happened and got released. My parents weren’t understanding of how I felt and all of a sudden a lot of stuff came up and I just felt so hopeless about my life and what had happened so I went to a second hospital then a outpatient program until December of that year. Long story short, I ended up missing the first semester of school and earning nearly failing grades which destroyed all the progress I had made and got me put in way fewer classes 2nd semester. I worked hard for 2nd semester but I was behind and the school didn’t want me there anymore and I was still recovering from my experience when I ended up with a toxic person who led me astray even more and whose behavior put my mom and me in danger so I had to leave school again to get mediocre to low grades. 

I turned things around after that by moving school and heading to top school in my city and going back to earning nearly all As besides one difficult class and have managed to split myself from that experience but have learned to be more cautious with my mental health. 

But the consequences for me are still very evident on my transcript where at my new school I am towards the bottom of the class and my whole gpa is very low for where I want to go. Now I am working on preparing my college applications and am wondering how to include this very relevant to my academics information but I don’t know how I can do it in a way that will make colleges understand my drop in grades and avoid the stigma associated with mental health events. 

I am planning on writing on my experiences in one of my essays and feel the need to include some of this on my personal statement but I just feel trapped over it because I’m afraid it’s going to mess things up for me and I really want to be able to go to a good college and continue on my path. 

Tldr: I was doing really well in school before my mental health went down and I ended up in a psych ward which led to me missing out on my Sophmore year of high school and tanking my gpa and extracurriculars because I moved schools and now I need to work on my college applications and take this into account if I’m going to go anywhere.",08Apr2020,1

Which I understand but also makes me feel I have noone to turn too nor can I admit if I mess up.

So I stupidly opened up and admitted everything to my child father and ex. We've also recently gotten back on good terms and he used to be really abusive so why I felt the need to tell him is beyond me!

Hi guys,

I’m a 21 (F) was recently diagnosed by my psychiatrist with add, generalized anxiety, and depression. Have been diagnosed in the past too with add. I recently started medication because I’ve come to a point where I need help and feel helpless. I was prescribed 10mg of adderall to start with cause I’m really bad with effects of medication. The first day was fine. However, when the medicine started to wear off, I became really aware of some bodily sensations specifically my blinking and breathing. Since then I’ve been more aware of it and keeping thinking about it. Is there a way to stop this? Is this common when adderall wears off? or am I experiencing something else?

225,"About 3.5 years ago I did 6 weeks of cognitive behavioural therapy because I was feeling down and it was either that or antidepressants. I didn't find that it helped much so I gave it up and struggled on alone. I was able to pull myself out of a slump by getting two new jobs and going to college, where I met my boyfriend. We eventually got into university and that's where I'm at in life right now.

My boyfriend and I broke up a few days ago after 2.5 years together. I did not want to break up at the time! I love him a lot but he didn't want to settle with his first, afraid that he would miss out on something better.

We've decided to be friends, and I've accepted the break up and told him as much. We've had very casual, upbeat conversations often. Nothing much has changed in our interactions tbh. 

I don't have many friends! I have 1 online friend, and then my boyfriend. I speak with my sister, but she's very busy, and I don't think it's fair to contact people as soon as I'm feeling this way as it's not fair to use them like that and also burden them with my issues.

When I'm alone I get waves of very strong negative emotions, I feel breathless and cry, and struggle to control recurring negative thoughts. It's like how I was before I went to CBT, only not as bad. I'm terrified of spiralling downwards!

I can't go to a doctor about it due to the quarantine - and I don't particularly want to as the last time I went I was asked if I was on my period, which made me feel like I wasn't being taken seriously! My dad was recently diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, and sometimes I'm afraid I have it too.

Quick info about me, I am 16 years old and I'm a male. I'm a solid 4/10 in looks and a 2/10 when it comes to ""enjoy-ability"" to be around

It all started when I was born, sounds like I'm lying but I'm not. I've never really been happy and I've always thought that there was something wrong with me. I was never the funny kid, not the good looking kid or any of that and I only had one friend. I and this friend were the same people. We liked the same things, looked surprisingly similar and our parents were also really good friends. Naturally, we became best friends and I can not recall a day when we didn't hang out. All of that changed when he moved (he had to move because his parents found a well-paying job out of town). Since neither of us had a phone at the time because we were only 6 years old we lost contact.

Now I was alone, I did manage to get some friends along the way but it is clear that none of them care, I've only gotten a few calls from time to time when people wanted to hang out with me but mostly it has been me that asked to hang out and it was often met with a ""\*sigh\*, okay but only if ""person"" joins too"". So it's safe to say that I've never been the cool or popular kid. I've always been a bit of a loner.

Fast forward a bit and I start to develop a persona, this is probably the effect of trying to live up to my parents' expectations of me becoming a world-famous physicist (not joking, my mom and dad, both expect a f\*cking Nobel prize). This persona is confident, humble, knows limits. etc. My parents' ideal child. This persona is a better me but also a fake me. He became even less popular than me, I guess it's not cool to stand up for the bullied anymore.

Lately, I've realized that I started getting personality clashes. the ""real"" me has stated to get mental breakdowns disguised as anger. No one likes me, I even doubt my parents care about me considering that they stopped saying good night to me about a year ago. They just tell me to shut the f\*ck up because they are going to bed now.

My parents now know that I'm depressed after all of these years of me trying to tell them that and like usual it was met with them being defensive and them feeling attacked. They always make it seem like I am the villain for feeling down, telling me how I should be grateful for what they have given me and how it's unfair to them that I feel this way. Anyways, when they realized it was today at the dinner table when I broke down for really no reason at all, my mind went into a random circle of darkness and I for some reason just got suicidal thoughts. I broke down crying and my parents went into defense mode, my mom asked what was wrong and I couldn't respond because I couldn't bother another argument about how I was wrong for being depressed and how I should just stop being sad. My dad said very angrily ""he is depressed, obviously"" and left the table. I kept crying for a while saying nothing. I then went upstairs and my mom followed me into my room. I just kept quiet as my mom explained how it is unfair to them bla bla bla you know the drill. I left my room and locked myself in the bathroom and I texted her that I don't feel appreciated and how I think that instead, they are in the wrong for always downplaying my emotions, she like usual, went into defense mode and said that she was going to book a therapy session to prove to me that I am wrong and that I have a bad way of living. I just said that I can't wait till I'm 18 so I can move out and I told her probably 100 times to just leave me alone for the rest of my life. I am happy that I ruined our relationship as I hope that I don't have to deal with them anymore. But at the same time, I feel stuck and unhappy as I now have no one. No friends and no parents as useless as they were it was always security thinking that they might care, even if they didn't.

As I said, my parents have throughout my life expected nothing but perfection, I even picked up sports to make my dad happy and when I made my first goal in that sport I cried because I thought that my parents would finally be proud, nothing changed because I still sucked at the sport and it was made clear because all of my teammates agreed that I sucked at it and some saying it straight to my face, luckily for them I didn't want to put up with it anymore so I quit.

They also have high expectations when it comes to what I want to do with my life, I don't know what I want to do but I know its not the same as what my parents want, they want me to become a physicist and to win a Nobel prize and go on to ""save humanity"". But all I want is a normal job and a normal life. I don't want to live the American dream, I want to live a humble life in a self-built house.

It's probably important to talk about me being a victim of bullying a couple of times and sexual assault. I've had probably two bullies that stretched a total of 6 years. I'm not going to go into detail about that. And the sexual assault happened once in the locker room where a guy touched me on the ass when I was naked in the shower and when I went to take on a towel he ripped it off and kept touching my genitals. I tried telling some ""friends"" and they all just laugh and don't take me seriously because I'm a man.

On top of all this, there are now rumors about me that I touched a girl ass when she was drunk and that I took advantage of this girl (let me clarify, I have never in my life touched her). Funnily enough, the girl that people said I touched is the only one that believes me and genuinely believes I didn't do it. god, bless her soul.

With all things considered I guess you could say that I am a bit of a troubled child and that I've never actually felt loved. I don't know where I am going with this and I see that my writing is a mess, I just need a place to vent more than anything.

Also, I know this text doesn't make much sense but I hope you guys understand the general gist of things. Thank you for reading, it means a lot to me.",08Apr2020,1
