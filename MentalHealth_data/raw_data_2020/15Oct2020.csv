2,"Today, for the first time in about 5 years, I made tacos for dinner. This matters to me bc not only are tacos delicious, but this is the first time I've made them (or really cooked anything for myself) after being in a volatile long-term relationship, going through a lot of mental health stuff (depression, etc), and an currently teaching art online to elementary kiddos, so my stress/anxiety is through the roof overall. All this coupled with severe financial hardships caused in part by the relationship have made ""self care""....real hard, to say the least. But I made tacos, and they're as delicious as ever, and I'm proud of myself, and it's a start❤️ (pics of said tacos available upon request:) )",15Oct2020,1
3,"Ive went from being in the best place that I've been in years I was going out and seeing friends, eating regular meals that I cooked I was just in a really good place but overnight I've went from that to not being able to leave my bed. today I've slept for 16 hours and the only time I left my bed was to get my laptop so I could attend a uni lecture. I have no clue what's triggered this to happen nothing has changed at all I've stuck to the same routine for years because I know having a routine helps but sometimes that isn't good enough. I've got friends who also struggle with mental health but they don't understand what its like they always make jokes about theirs as a way of coping I do too but I just feel like there's nobody who understands.",15Oct2020,1

5,"This month will be 5 years after a traumatic incident. I don’t want to talk much in detail because I’m not ready to discuss. I’ve been crying all weekend due to flashbacks, along with PTSD. I haven’t responded to most of my friends and left group chats in my nursing school courses. This, one of my classmates ignored me in my virtual fundamentals of nursing class. We were in the randomized group set up by my professor. The whole time I was quiet and waiting, the classmate full blown ignored me like I didn’t exist. I did nothing wrong. That triggered me to be upset and cry, that I abruptly left my class.

I’m tired of being depressed. Chronic clinical depression, anxiety, and PTSD suck.",15Oct2020,1
6,My friend has been spiralling out of control over the last few years where he/she has gone from being let go from a reputable profession (unsure what the reason was) three years ago to  working odd jobs within the food and service industry for the last couple years. He/she seems to have these grandiose plans each year which don't materialize because it's too far from what he/she can achieve. His/her personality has changed drastically from who he/she used to be. So has his/her behaviour and body language. He/she has lost a lot of weight but looks quite fit. He/she's extremely formal in his/her conversations (we've known each other for more than a decade) although we've reconnected in the last couple years after almost no contact in the previous 6 years  this shift in behaviour and mannerisms is too drastic for me to accept. A few mutual friends of ours have noticed it as well and have tried to advice but to no avail. He/she is too indenial of the situation that he/she becomes very defensive and too proud to ask for help. Once again became aware of another outlandish idea and he/she is relocating as we speak. Our friends agree he/she needs to go to counselling but I don't know how to approach. I'm avoiding revealing anything too much for obvious reasons.,15Oct2020,1
7,"I always seemed to be the happy kid growing up but as the years went on it just become a task to be that person again. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything and never even spoke to a professional. My mental health issues started when I was a junior in high school but is at its worst right now (soph in college). I’m in my own head 24/7. I can’t stop thinking about all the problems in my life, I get anger mood swings in an instant, then I’ll feel really happy out of nowhere but then a go back to feeling depressed again. 


Most of the time I worry about the most stupidest shit. I think about all the conversations I’ve had with friends and the things that I may have said that was stupid or insulting and I’ll stress over that for hours even days. I can’t bring my self to do my school work even though I know I’ll fail. Things recently started to feel “fake” in a sense, almost like my life isn’t even real. I pretend that I’m some happy go lucky person but it really is just fake. I’m afraid to tell anyone because I’m scared of how they will view me. I really don’t know what to do anymore",15Oct2020,1
8,"I know it sounds strange, but lately I've been trying to find excuses to be depressed/anxious. Something a little bit bad will happen to me, and I'll blow it out of proportion in my brain. I'm pretty sure I actually do have anxiety, and that I actually am depressed, but what if I'm not? What if I just want attention? I sometimes purposefully do things or think of things that will make me sad, and I don't understand why. And if I have a good day, I'll get angry at myself, thinking, ""No, you're supposed to be sad, you can't be happy."" It's like I don't even want happiness anymore, and I can't understand why. But, I can't tell if I truly am happy and just making myself believe that my mental health is bad, or if my mental health is *actually* bad. I need help, I don't know what's happening to me, and why I almost *like* being depressed. I don't get it. Has anyone else experienced the same thing?",15Oct2020,1
9,"Even just the mention of a dog can put me close to a panic attack. 

I've become hyper-fixated on owning a dog. My parents refused to let me have one as a child and it lead to extremely negative feelings. I started to resent anyone who had a dog because in my own mind I deserved one more, could train and care for them better. When I found my girlfriend she was also interested in us having a dog together. A year into us dating she got into an accident with one. Now she (understandably) doesn't want anything to do with them. She's admitted to me that she's not comfortable in owning a dog after that or living with one. I have an extreme fear that I'm going to live my entire life without ever being able to have a pet dog. Every time I so much as see someone in a group chat post a picture of one it makes me feel genuine rage.",15Oct2020,1
10,"I have to turn in my master thesis manuscript tomorrow and it should be mostly a clean copy plus a review on the discussion. But yesterday and today half of my ""work day"" was sitting anxiously in front of the computer.
Also bf doesn't get that he is asking for something I can't give. 
I say ""I'm hurt bc, yeah, I don't know your classes names but that doesn't mean I don't love you, just that I do it in a different way""

11,"Idk where to post this...all over the place. I could really use some help.

First stupid question…

\-Are there any pills that will force you to be a functioning adult? Like force you to have the motivation to get a job, stay in college, and socialize with people?

I'm 21. Unemployed, living at home, and dropped out of college (before the pandemic happened). I don't want to do anything. I don't want anything in life (other than temporary things that may or may not give me happiness). I don't want to get better or improve myself. But if I don't get better my family (mostly aunts, uncles, grandparents, etc...my mother is supportive and doesn't care what I do...I feel guilty) will still be disappointed and ask about school. And if I don't get better I can't move away and have my own space. Also I fell guilty relying on others...especially my mom. So I'd like to rely on no one other than myself. And obviously to do that I'd need to work, go to school, and get my own place. And of course to do those things I'd have to socialize and be productive. So I need something to get me to suck it up because I don't want to suck it up. I go from feeling irritated, angry, and sad to tired and empty. I just want to be alone. But I can't have that the longer I'm lazy and avoidant of people. In order to be on my own I'd have to change...or suck it up.

More stupid questions…

\-Which will help more? Medication or therapy when you're lazy to change?

I have the means for medication and therapy. I just don't know which would help better since I'm lazy, unmotivated and I procrastinate on self improvement and just getting better in general. I really don't want to change. I just want to be alone but that's not an option because I'm reliant on others. So I just need something to help me go on until I'm on my own.

\-Also, are there any jobs or careers with minimum to no socializing with others?

Online is fine but video chats or calls are definitely a no. I was a receptionist once and I felt panicky everyday. My dream (I guess I do want something) if I somehow manage to keep going on this earth is to avoid people 100 percent. Maybe not my mother but everyone else. I'd like to live far away from people in a secluded house far away somehow working from home with decent pay to keep my house running. I know that's pointless in this day and age and very fantasy like thinking but I just don't want to deal with people anymore.

I have bad social anxiety. I've been in and out therapy since high school and I'm getting less tolerant of people. Because when I'm around people I'm reminded how much people can hurt you or make you anxious. So I just want to avoid them. Seriously if I could have my way I'd just avoid people and cut them off 100%. But that's not a very realistic mindset to have :( . I'm way less anxious talking to people online so that's why I'm reaching out for help this way. I'm still looking into therapy. Idk just trying to see if medication or therapy would help better. I know I repeated myself a lot of times. Thanks for reading this mess. If you could answer any of my questions I'd really appreciate it. Also if you know of a better place to post this, please let me know. Also I can remove my post if it offends any guidelines..",15Oct2020,1

This week I finally said enough is enough. I’m so tired of my depression and anxiety controlling my life and I finally summoned the courage to ask for help. 

I met with my doctor today who was extremely supportive. I have an appointment next week to start therapy.

The thing is, I'm selfish if I want to die but I want the others to live despite their pain because I know they can make it?

17," I was verbally abused as a kid for a long time and I find it hard to believe that there's any love in the world. I can't imagine people actually meaning it when they say something nice. I find it hard to believe people aren't constantly thinking critical things about me and other people. I just have a hard time believing I'm not automatically hated by everyone. I want to get past this but this is all I've ever known and this is really hard. Growing up, I heard a lot of things that made me feel hated, and a bad person.

I genuinely get really upset when someone asks me to go out or whatever and I think that they're lying and I get really angry. Its like when a bully sets you up, and then says something really mean, but I expect it from everyone.",15Oct2020,1
18,"Could this be depression?

I just don’t seem to feel anything and I haven’t for really long time. 

For example, I’m pretty sure most people would be thrilled that their friends planned a surprise party for them. They’d probably be really happy or excited. But I know for certain that if people did that for me I wouldn’t feel anything. Not happiness. Not sadness. Nothing. 

Of course I would pretend to be happy, I wouldn’t want people to think I didn’t appreciate the surprise. I definitely would. I just wouldn’t *feel* anything. You know?


I just don’t seem to feel anything. I see people get happy over the smallest of gifts and I don’t understand it. Or some of my friends will say that they had fun at the park and everyone will agree. But while I was there I didn’t have any fun at all. It wasn’t *boring*, I just didn’t really feel anything. I only pretended to.

This seems to happen in almost every situation in my life. By all means I SHOULD be having fun, or at least be happy. But I’m not. I’m not sad either. Just empty. And lonely. And I don’t know why.

This isn’t some “oh man I’m an edgy loner who doesn’t feel any emotions” kind of post. I’m just wondering if this is like some kind of depression or something. I’ve never really paid much attention to it but I’ve always noticed people seem so happy. And I decided that I want to be happy too. But I don’t know how to do that.",15Oct2020,1

20,"Life is SO different than what I thought it would be one year ago today. One year ago, I was a bright senior with good grades and playing many sports. I had a good circle of friends. I was applying to college. I was getting stood up on dates (but my buddies were there for me). Life was endless.

Fast forward through 3 months of winter, and I got deferred from my absolute dream college. I had back ups, but this college was the one. Continue through another 2 months of gruelling AP Lit, and my dream came true. My future became that of a modern fairytale. I got into my dream college. I was enjoying senior year through sports, classes, and quality time with my friends. Life was still endless (WWIII threats and natural disasters aside).

The day after I got into my dream college was the beginning of quarantine. Life stopped. My senior year was thrown in the garbage can. Graduation would be many months later, and prom was erased from the calendar. Well, maybe it will all be over by my first day at college, right?

Here I am sitting at home doing math homework on a Wednesday night. I know nobody at my college. I have been hiding from the world in fear of the infamous virus. I felt like my mental and social health were decimated, but then something happened.

I had to attend a wedding. I had to see the most beautiful act of love a person could ever see. It was amazing. Everything was amazing. Everybody had been virus-conscious leading up to the wedding, so we could all relax. For the first time in 7 months, I could lower the wall. I could talk to people, to friends. Life emerged from the embers that remained from the past, and it ignited for one weekend. Everything was normal.

Now, that fire has not only gone out but also left me feeling colder than ever. I am back in my basement studying math. As I listen to music, I hear the sweetest chimes, and my mind breaks down. I do not think of anything except the beautiful love at the wedding and the sense of normalness that I experienced. Any sweet, slow music tears me apart because I just want the future that I imagined a year ago today. I want to be surrounded by the love of everybody I know or would have met at college. I want to meet someone to love at college. I want to know my professors and go to events. I want to be with friends and to talk about sports, video games, and any other topic with my friends instead if the stale conversation about COVID-19 and doing college at home over video chat.

Surely somebody else feels the same as me. There is no way I am alone.",15Oct2020,1
21,"I hate life right now. I'm starting to see/hear things that aren't there. For example, I see distorted people, like something you either see from a horror film or a creepy pasta.

22,I know how to do my schoolwork and it’s sitting right in front of me. I want to get it done and this sounds crazy but my mind gets so overwhelmed and I almost cry whenever I look at it. I’ve missed so many assignments because I just can’t do them and I don’t care for them.

23,"This year has been hell for all of us, but I have to try to get the last three months sorted out. I'm losing my mind and myself this last week, but I can't afford therapy right now and as much as I need to talk, I feel like I can't keep bugging my friends about this.

For clarity's sake I'm not going to touch on the obvious points of the year. So, back in the summer I had a really bad mental health episode. On July 22nd after a fight with my sister, I bought her donuts and then left to go hurt myself. My intent was to never go back home, but I had the chance to get some space and reconsider before it was too late. I bottled it up while I was trying to find a therapist, until she confronted me and I blurted it out. It's a touchy subject for her, so trying to hide it while trying to get help and deal with the pain was a rough start to things.

Fast forward to September. I had found a therapist and was starting to make a little progress, dealing with a lot of issues and trying to sort them to make it easier on me. Well, I get a phone call at work that my mom had been in a minor accident, but had hit her head hard enough to get a brain bleed. Two days later I'm on leave because I had to be tested for the virus.

During the week and a half it took to get my results, I was dealing with trying to get accurate info about my mom from two time zones away. It wasn't good, or easy, and I struggled with the updates. First it was that we'd be lucky if she made it, then it was we're lucky she wasn't a vegetable, then it was that she was highly uncooperative with medical staff, then it was that she left against medical advice as soon as she wasn't in the ICU anymore.

Then two days later she falls and has a stroke. I get told at that time that she also had a heart attack the day of the wreck. Every phone call I get is more medical bad news, and I'm going crazy as I'm unsure of what the hell is going on. Finally after getting the negative test results, I book a flight to come take care of her- her roommate had to leave for a month for her own family emergency, but my mom absolutely cannot be left alone.

So I fly here. I come to my childhood house to take care of my mom. And it feels like a house you come to to die. At least a decade of neglect, and seeing my mom unable to even walk around her house without a walker. I wanted to break down, but to my own amazement I have not.

I'm here for her. I'm here checking her blood sugar every 3 hours, planning and preparing her meals, administering medications because she didn't have the dexterity in her hands to do any of it herself. Cleaning up everything, fixing everything so that she can use it safely, helping her understand her paperwork, helping her get legal documents and aid in place. Trying my damnedest to make this as easy as possible on her, with so much going wrong.

She no longer has a job. She doesn't remember things that I tell her half the time. But she's not the human vegetable her friend has treated her like. She can still do some of it on her own, and is improving a little each day. I'm beyond grateful for every improvement I see in her. Especially after the day she told me that she wished the brain bleed had killed her, instead of making life hard for us all. It took a lot for me to hold it together and try to keep being strong at that.

But I'm breaking. This place is full of a lot of memories of where my issues come from. There's no cell signal out here, and I don't want her to overhear the things I want to vent about by me using the landline (indoors only) I have no space just for myself, and even if I did I couldn't close the door (showers excluded) because if she has blood sugar issues in the night she comes to me to check the numbers and help her make good decisions. I haven't heard my friends voices in so long, haven't been able to sleep properly during this whole thing because I don't feel comfortable here.

I'm surviving on a whole pot of coffee to myself every morning, and pure determination to not let my mom live in filth and depression. But as much as I try to be strong, I need a break. I don't know when her roommate is coming back for sure, because she caught the virus. And I just really, really need my own help.

But I can't get it here. This place is where my mental health issues started, where I tried to end my life as a toddler. This place sucks the will to live out of me. I'm trying hard to fight it. And having my friends messaging me helps. But I can feel old issues creeping back, dragging me down, telling me that my friends have enough on their plate without me talking about this. I know logically that they love me and want to help me, but the toll this place is taking on my mind is staggering.

I don't know. I'm terrified. I'm out here without pay for at least a total of six weeks by the end of this. My mom gave me a bit of money to help me, but it's not enough to get therapy and pay my bills. And I just... I don't know what to do.

I want to go home. I want to hug my sister and our roommate and the stupid cats. I want to be in my own room, in my own bed, and have the option of hiding away from everyone to recharge. I want to feel normal again, and not have someone's literal life depending on me 24/7 in such a medically charged way. I feel selfish for it, but I'm being honest with myself more than anything.

I don't know what to do. But if there's anyone who read all of this, thank you for listening. I'm still lost in the chaos, but I couldn't keep holding it all in.",15Oct2020,1

27,"Don't know where else to put this.

My childhood wasn't horrible, but it wasn't the best, and I started having mental health issues in middle school. I went through ups and downs in high school, but after high school my mental health got suddenly much worse. I'm almost 19 now. I feel like in some ways, I'm getting better, but in other ways, I'm not.

I think I'm overall getting better because I'm older and smarter, and I know how to make good choices and how to cope. But I'm still so confused. I've noticed that I cling onto this vision of an idealized future, one where I have things ""all figured out"" or at least, one where I understand myself better and have found a happier life. I write a lot of letters for my future self to read, because I really want to meet her and ask her for advice. But sometimes I doubt that things get better with age.

I feel like all the adults in my life are messed up in some way. Like, my parents, for example, they're both flawed and struggling in their lives. Sure, they're doing well in taking care of me and my sibling and they're making career achievements, but they're still... struggling with these issues, mostly related to mental health and their relationship.

 I know things can never be perfect. But to me, it seems like a lot of the adults I know aren't necessarily wiser. It seems to me like the older you get, the more time you have to wrap yourself into your cognitive distortions and look for ways to confirm your flawed worldview. And in a lot of ways, that just makes your life worse.

I hope for myself that my mental health issues are just mainly caused by hormones, mood swings, and the normal stuff teenagers go through. I get that I probably have other issues that I need to work through, but I *feel* like I'm getting better and maybe even wiser. But I'm uncertain. What if my 25 year old self is doing much worse than I am now? What will I be like at 35? 45? Will I even live that long? I have no idea. 

I hear the typical onset for disorders like bipolar and schizophrenia is early 20s to 30s, at least for women. I'm worried that I could end up developing one of these serious conditions. I had a semi-distant relative with schizophrenia, so I have a slightly greater risk of developing that. 

I know being a teenager/young adult sucks, but does it get better from here on out, or worse? Should I keep holding onto the hope that I'll feel better in the future? I just want to know if this is actually true. I know some of the people reading this post are 25 or older, do people in that age group feel that their mental health has improved in the last 5 years or so? There's really a lot that I'm wondering about, and I just don't want to feel like I'm lying to myself when I tell myself that ""It gets better"".",15Oct2020,1
28,"I seriously don't know who I am anymore, and this is no exaggeration. 

The people who I used to be fond of I see as enemies. I feel like I can't trust anyone, I dislike everyone and I have no desire for anything really. I also feel like I've somewhat become 'asexual' sex makes me feel uneasy and disgusted. Relationships and intimacy seems to trivial and pointless to me. I have to put on a mask whenever I'm with my boyfriend or around my family. My mind is so dark, like my own personal hell - but I don't really mind it. 

All of this I'm okay with, but how am I supposed to keep up with relationships when I can't offer people what they expected from the old me? This has been a gradual process and I am well aware of my transition, but others aren't. Whenever someone gets close to me it makes me feel uncomfortable, I feel aggression and irritation. 

Even when I see old videos of me, I don't recognise that person as me. I'm still being treated as though that old version of me still exists and I just want to dismiss those who are mistaken. It angers me.",15Oct2020,1

32,"I don’t want to come across as that type of person that is self diagnosing because that’s the opposite of what i’m trying to do, anyway i’ve been diagnosed by a professional with Ocd, anxiety and depression, i’m not on medication anymore i used to be on prozac but that didn’t help me. i’m feeling super unstable and haven’t been to a doctor also i’m pretty bad at explain my feelings in real life and don’t want to get misdiagnosed. I find it hard to concentrate and i go into these “episodes” you could call it, where i just don’t think straight. i kind of feel like my mind is being controlled, and i do hear voices at times. I see things all the time and feel weird things like a presence or like i’m being watched, i always think someone is out to get me, i always sleep with knifes near me to feel safe. i have vivid dreams too. Now for my emotions, they’re all over the place, i can get angry very often and scream a lot. i’ve been trying to stop but i feel a sense of distress and helplessness if i don’t, i know this sounds pathetic and like i’m a toddler throwing a fit but it’s honestly been like this for so long my family parents neighbours are all used to it i’m just kinda afraid of when i have to meet knew people and go out into the real world i’m only 16 rn...

33,"I don’t have much motivation for writing this but here I am. I’ve been dealing with ocd my whole life, but freshman year of high school for some reason I started to develop pure-o ocd. During my freshman year I started having all kinds of thoughts that were just weird and irrational and I still do. I have been dealing with these thoughts and specifically hocd thoughts every day, every hour, since October 2016. It has completely drained me over time of enjoyment from things and I’m at a point where I can’t handle it much longer. I have been to two ocd specialist, both which were good but I never really improved as much as I wanted to. I sort of hit a point with therapy where it didn’t do anything anymore. I did CBT with ERP therapy specifically. I am now not doing therapy anymore. I also quit my anti depressants which was actually a good thing. They helped for a little sort of but they have way too many side effects for me. I try to manage my thoughts constantly by not engaging in compulsive behavior but it doesn’t help anymore. I’ve basically given up on it. I really don’t give a fuck anymore. The thing is though I just started college and it’s been nothing but a wreck with my ocd. OCD is just pulling me down more every day and now what I’m doing in life really matters. I still have friends and I hang out with them but even that has become a battle. I try to stay somewhat busy but it’s just not working. I want to be successful in life. I have always been very ambitious and I want to pursue my passion and have a future but I don’t see it anymore.

46,"Good evening all, 

I know, I’m sorry it’s late but now this is on my mind and I cannot sleep. Basically, to cut to the chase I have been experiencing anxiety like I never had before, pertaining to two small events that happened to me this summer. 

First off, I took my first tumble on my motorcycle. Nothing serious, 35 mph slide and a broken ankle. Since then, I just have a pretty big lack of confidence on the bike and I am constantly having dreams of it happening in different various ways and it’s actually effecting my sleep. I absolutely love my bike and I love riding it, however I will say that I haven’t spent almost anytime on it since.

Secondly, I kinda almost drowned, but not really. I was out on a boat in the ocean, in the channel. I had never been in a channel of moving water before and basically something happened that had prompted me to jump in the water. I am athletic mid twenties man, and I’ve never really been the best swimmer but I’ve always been able to handle myself. Quickly I learned that not only was the boat anchored and I was not, meaning I was floating away very fast, I also was experiencing a heat stroke from exertion and dehydration from being horribly hungover. I never in that moment thought I’d die or anything, my friends were all there, all in the boat and all strong swimmers and they had life jackets and everything. I even was able to bounce on the bottom a bit to get some air. However, once again, I’m constantly seeing this in my dreams. What actually prompted me to write this is that I finished watching a show on Netflix, the haunting of Bly Manor, and it has a lot of scenes of people being plunged under water. My heart was racing during those scenes, and my body was physically feeling like I did when I was actually in the water, like I could feel my throat kind of closing and it was like I had to really make an effort to take breathes. It was actually an interesting anomaly and I have no idea why I reacted like that but it was not enjoyable to say the least.

Either way, the thing about these experiences is that, well I was never in any real danger. But in my head I think of everything else that could go wrong. The day before I fell off my motorcycle I rode a friends sport bike and was over confident and took it to 140 mph. Stupid I know but I did it. What if I fell then? 

Like I mentioned, while I was in the water, I found a couple of areas while I was floating that were only 7 feet deep or so that I could hop up and down on to gasp for air. What if that wasn’t there? What if it happened to be deeper or the water faster, or if the boat didn’t start? These thoughts flood my mind, and I feel like these two events kind of made me realize that I’m not invincible, and maybe that’s part of a man growing up, but now I feel like maybe these symptoms aren’t normal? I’m just trying to get some sleep, I want to be able to ride my motorcycle again without fear, and I won’t go in water anymore and I sure would like to. I’m just worried that on my bike or in the water, I’ll have a panic attack and actually have a serious problem. How long will this take to go away and what can I do about it?

Thanks.",15Oct2020,1
47,"I've been pretty much alone the past year, living somewhere with no friends, and I just drove a girl I know away online because I was showing to much support for her illness and acted slightly weird. She goes offline everytime I message her to say hi now. Doesn't feel good.",15Oct2020,1
48," 

I hate online classes right now, a lot of my test require me to speak.

Personally, i think that shallow learning is caused by unprofessional creativity, since most of my teachers try being creative with their test, but instead make it worst.

I'm a beginner writer, started writing 3 months ago, and my voice is writing sounds much better than my actual voice, recorded or not.

It's such a small thing, yet i grew depressed over it.

I got a low score, a failing grade, in one of my english test after the teacher told us to say what we wrote about our country, i wrote it, but my voice ruined it.

I didn't sound happy, my voice had no life, speak higher and stop speaking in a low tone, thats what they said.

But i can't just raise my voice, and i cant speak without my voice suddenly stopping for no reason, it sounds weird but i just cant describe it, and that just makes it worst.

School doesn't even test intelligence anymore, they test things that you are born with, such as drawing or singing, sports or speaking, no longer writing things about life, test which define intelligence, all they do now is tell us useless facts, and make the test about them completely based off your talents rather than what you learned.

I know many might say, its just your voice, but the weight of this situation just keeps making me stressed.

Even if i write a good essay on something, ill just get a low and mostly failing grade cause i didn't put enough life in my voice even when i cant when i try.

It just hurts for me personally.",15Oct2020,1

What matters is, I did a thing, it involved my Dad and didn't blow up in my face for once in my life. Maybe someday soon I'll feel safe to tell him all about how I've always known that I'm gay (earliest memory around age 5 or 6) and have always felt unsafe in a violently homophobic family and encompassing environment, how I'm in a relationship with a man for 9 years as of 10 days from now, everything.

52,"2 years ago i had a bad experience with what i thought was weed and i fell to the ground and my mind started hallucinating and hearing a deafening scream while my head was spinning in a weird circular motion it felt like it lasted forever i couldn’t move at all but my mind was conscious and i remember thinking when is this going to end quickly followed by the dread that it was never going to end and i was stuck in this eternal loop of nothing forever. I briefly broke free but at that point i was already far gone and not sane, i saw my friends leg as i was on the ground and it seemed like i had ripped it open because the next thing i see is blood gushing everywhere. Turns out it was just a hallucination because when i woke up there were only a few scars. 

I’ve smoked countless times after that and never had anything like that happen again but that day still haunts me to this day and it’s always in the back of my mind that when i die i’m going to be in that state of mind, the mental torutre that lasts forver. Im not religious but i feel satanic and spiritual energies around me all the time. I just feel like im destined for doom. i know that sounds dramatic.

I'm feelin a little bad for the guy who was doing these things to me, but my dad reassured me it wasn't my fault, still though. I'm happy though, I can finally move on and not be worried about all this stuff. Short and a little disorganized I know, but I just wanted to tell somebody. 

My advice to people who are going through any form of abuse: it will be okay. Just prepare yourself a bit and let it out a little to somebody you really trust, and they'll help you. Just don't wait till it's too late, you do stupid stuff then, and believe me, it's not worth it. Just take care of yourself out there.

59,"I feel like I have to give background to this so.. here it is: My father has been emotionally abusive and manipulative since I could remember. I truly realized it when I was 11 years old, 7 years ago. My mother and father got divorced and he got worse and I didn’t realize how bad it was for a while. He’s steadily been getting worse towards me but it hit a breaking point.

He got in my face, screamed at me about politics of all things. He pulled a gun, and held it up to his head, screaming all the while. He wouldn’t actually do it, he does it to manipulate me and he’s tried the same thing but never actually pulling a gun. I feared for my life but I got out, I’m alive. I confided in my mother and she called the police, which both of us knew wouldn’t do anything but distract him. 
The police came and questioned me beside him, one of the three saying over and over again that it was just a joke. It was the most anxiety-filled evening I’ve ever had and I left to live with my mother that night. It’s been a day now, just over 24 hours. I had to get some of my things from his house, his neighbor reported us being there to him and he called the police for a robbery in progress, though we didn’t know until after we left. 
He’s now been trying to make us more anxious, and I’ve shut out a lot of the other text messages from my head. But I now live in an apartment with my sister and mother, had to give up my ball python because I can’t get him out on such short notice. My sister is terrible towards me, she always goes on about how she’s not allowed to have friends over and how I don’t belong here. My mother has finally tried to stop her entitled behavior but she’s upset now and I can’t mention how stressed it’s making me without her getting upset. It’s just adding to the stress and I’m struggling to find a way to cope with it. There’s just so much, I have to file a restraining order, find another apartment to get away from here, and try and get my things back. 

I feel like I’m suffocating. I’m a trans male in a very anti-LGBT area so I can’t have friends around here, I’m trying to look at apartments, get my belongings back, file a restraining order, and try to deal with panic attacks and heavy anxiety. This is probably jumbled and nonsensical but I’m still shaken up and struggling to cope.",15Oct2020,1
60,"I’ve suffered from a panic and anxiety disorder since I was about 10 years old. I’ve been on Lexapro (woo Lexapro!) for almost ten years. I’ve been pretty under control over these ten years, minus some periods of difficultly here and there but that’s par for the course.

Today I had a panic attack that was pretty severe for the first time in a while. I think it was the result of working all day from home, drinking coffee, not enough water and frankly not enough food.

I decided to take my dog to the dog park around 5 pm. It’s about a 20 minute walk and I was fine the whole time. Once we arrived and she was playing I started to notice some auras in my vision. I have had migraines before that started like this and I immediately go anxious that I was going to get a migraine while here at the park and 20 minute away from home with my 8 month old dog. I tried to ignore it and stay calm but I started to feel more and more trapped in the enclosed dog run around other people and responsible for my dog!

My bf works in a hospital and thankfully he was about to head home. I texted him and told him what was going on that that I felt trapped and that I was trying to hold it together. He said he would take an Uber to me to help me and so we could go home together.

By the time he arrived I had started to calm down. The aura had gone away but I felt tired, drained and out of it. We stayed at the dog park a little longer just so I could relax and come back to earth a bit (and so our dog could actually play a little more).

We eventually left and started walking home. We live in NYC and while walking home I started to feel really removed from my body and surroundings. Everything felt hyper stimulating and aggressive and I was clinging to my bf just to feel some reality. I was talking to him but I felt like I kept stuttering over words or flipping syllables or not saying things correctly. I asked him if I was talking strangely and he said no. He’s a doctor and I know I should trust his judgement but I was convinced I was having some neurological problem. I was even reciting tongue twisters in my head just to see if I could and every time I messed up it just convinced me further that something was wrong.

We got home and I drank some water, and practiced grounding myself (5 things I see, 4 things I can touch, etc.) I had a bit of a headache and just felt drained but we went about our night. I kept asking my bf if I were ok and he literally gave me a neurological screening that they give patients just to prove to me that I was ok. 

Now it’s almost midnight. He’s asleep, so are our pets, and I’m really anxious about tomorrow. I tend to get anticipatory anxiety about things and now I’m so worried that this feeling will happen tomorrow but I’ll be by myself. 

I’m pretty sure I’m just rambling at this point but I haven’t had anything like this in a while and while the logical part of me that understands my mental illness KNOWS it was a panic attack likely brought on by my hyper vigilance with sensations in my body (and like...not hydrating properly and only drinking coffee during the damn day), the irrational part of me thinks something is wrong! It boils down to being like the boy who cried wolf - everyone in my life is so used to it being my anxiety and I’m terrified that one day it won’t be that and I’ll be overlooked.

I’m looking for some commiseration or reassurance or who knows what else!

62,"So this is happening more and more recently, but today in particular I felt it hard. 

I, 21M, hung out with my friend, whom I love and care about deeply, and I felt like I couldn’t connect to them. It has been months since I las saw them, and I was so excited to see them for the first time today, but I felt like we were on two different planets. I felt like we were strangers.

I think this particular interaction was just a fluke, but It brought up the emotions I’ve been feeling. I’ve been feeling lonelier and lonelier.
I get a lot of “love you” and “you’re great” stuff on social media, but Where are the people I can laugh with and share a meaningful conversation and adventure with? I’m holding on to the memories I’ve had with my friends and that’s what’s keeping me going right now.

It’s not like I’m not trying to make new friends, but it’s hard. I made a group chat for my chemistry classmates and they used it to make their own group without me in it. I joined and am helping start up a sociology club in my university, but were small and few people stay long (no funding + people just aren’t interested here).

I recently started to attend college, and it has been really rough so far... I am really, really, really bad at remembering things. I can barely recall yesterday, and I definitely can not recall anything before that. 

When I need to study, I prepare everything, motivate myself, I study in a calm and quiet place. I tried out different learning methods, and optimized how I do it.

But even after all of this, if I really try hard to study, I can only average 1 page every 90 minutes, which is just insane, there is no way I can learn everything on time. I have 5 classes this semester, and we get about 15 pages of things to learn from each of the classes every week. Thats 75 pages I have to learn every week, aka 113 hours of learning every week, which is obviously impossible. I am already pretty behind and starting to feel bad, like I wont be able to catch up. 

I really tried getting better at this, but nothing helped, its still taking me way too much time. I do not know how some people can read and remember stuff to easily. And I feel like my mind is getting worse as the time goes on. I used to be able to remember stuff easily, and had quite vivid memories of things. Now not only I can not learn the material, but I can barely remember my life. Does not help that I have 0 personal interest in what I am studying.

If I did something very interesting, exciting few days ago, met someone really nice or made a friend, had a good food etc, I wont remember it now. I can not remember a single thing from my life, to the point where I do not even remember people...

&amp;#x200B;

And I am supposed to learn like 1000 pages of text perfectly for the exams in 3 months from now. Dunno how I will manage.

68,"As an example, some people with extreme depression can't even get out of bed because their condition robs them of the ability to do so. I'm wondering what conditions could cause a similar effect in a person even if they're feeling happy and healthy.

The reason I ask this is because I suffer a range of mental conditions including bipolar, depression, ASD, and have been found likely to have a Schizoid Personality Disorder. I don't know if one/more/all of these conditions have something to do with the ability to generate and regulate willpower, or if it's something else entirely.

Even on a day where I feel stable and elevated, something as simple as emptying the dishwasher, as an example, can take me multiple hours to get around to doing, and sometimes it's so bad that I don't do it for a number of days.

I understand if this is perceived as laziness, but I know when I'm actually being lazy, and when I am 'locked down' by whatever condition is causing this effect.",15Oct2020,1

For context during this pandemic I work as a full time Nurses assistant  and a full time student.  I work around 36-48 hrs a week.  My mother on the other hand has been laid off during most of the pandemic and was taking in unemployment benefits.  We rent a 1 bedroom for all 3 of us.  Since my mother has been home for most of the pandemic she has been nit picking on every single detail of how the room has been.  I myself has not been a very clean person but I have a certain type of how I organise things.  I go to work around 5am in the morning and get home around 730 pm (I take the bus).  By the time I get home my mom would always talks about how I dont help out in the house and not clean my little area of the room, this room is tiny.  I go to the room to change and it was the same thing as I left it.  She didnt even try to clean it.  My mother's making excuses that her ""illnesses"" isnt letting her do so much.  Recently she calling me as an ignorant and rude child and on top of that she keeps spewing like I only pay for the phone bill ($320) and she pays for the room ($500) even being unemployed.  Also she says that even I pay for the phone bill I have no right on answering back to her, she thinks she is always right.  For the past 2 years I had been contacting my school's stress and some of my counselors on what should I do.  The thing is I really cant leave yet since the pandemic is happening and the rent pricing here is really expensive (hawaii).  What should I do about this, its really taking a toll on school and work performance as well.  Since I had to work and attend online classes I barely get time to actully do the homework they give us due to the constant battling with me and her.",15Oct2020,1
70,"- *”Think about the loved ones that you’ll leave behind.”*
- *“Suicide doesn’t take away the pain. It just passes it on to someone else.”*
- *”Your parents / kids will feel absolutely heartbroken and think it’s their fault. Do you really want to do that to them?”*
- *“If you can’t do it for yourself, do it for someone else.”*

If you’ve ever sought support while suicidal / lent support to someone suicidal, I’m sure you’ve heard or said or seen at least one of these phrases before. The intent is great — rationalizing suicide and how a completed suicide may affect someone else. But the delivery, specifically themes of guilt for making someone else feel worse — do you think it’s a good suicide prevention and intervention strategy? 

I know it differs from person to person, and it has its merits and some swear by it, while others detest it. I would love to hear your thoughts, maybe even have some healthy discussion. 

•••

I’ll start — personally, I don’t think guilting me into sticking around for someone else is going to make me feel better. Phrases like these (used by friends, family, and even a former therapist) only result in me feeling worse. If I’m already vulnerable enough to think about suicide, if I’m in that much pain that demands to be felt, telling me to think about someone else’s pain is invalidating. I just want my pain to be seen, heard and acknowledged without it being diverted to the pain of someone else. 

For once, let me be the one that matters. Maybe if I felt like I mattered, that my pain in itself mattered, and that my life (and the uncomfortable mess that comes with) is allowed to take up space, I wouldn’t be as convinced that suicide is an / the only option.",15Oct2020,1

75,"Possible trigger warning: depression, self harm, substance abuse

   my depression started when i was in high school in the form a general dislike of myself, feeling like i’d never be good enough, every day became an uphill battle just to get out of bed and do the bare minimum it took to survive.
   i made my way through high school and started my life as a young adult with really no plans because i never thought i’d make it that far, as the first 3 years went by it got deeper and deeper until i ended up in a facility do to extensive self harm and drug abuse, i was released on a PCP order and continued therapy for a while after that; as i got in a better mind state of myself, my mindset towards the world got more resentful, i realized i didn’t hate myself, or at least not as much as i hated the state of the world i’ve been forced to live in.
   fast forward a couple of years to today and i’m at the point where there isn’t any hate, it’s just exhaustion. i’m tired of this world, not a single thing or person can hold my interest for any significant amount of time, even to the point where the thought of food bores me. i see the world around me and know there’s nothing left for an everyday person to do that isn’t part of a mundane experience.
    I get told that “life is what you make of it” but what is there to make of this life anymore? i can become a cog in the machine that keeps this corrosive world turning, get a job, get married and have a kid or two, but why would i want to have kids when this is the world i would bring them into? i could go against the grain and try to start a movement to try and change the world, but why? just to be shut down and labeled as a “extremist” or a “radical” or the be canceled out entirely because of a mistake i made when i was young? i just don’t see the point anymore.
   

tl;dr -i just don’t see what there is in this world anymore and everything seems to pointless now that i just don’t get it. everything a normal person can do has been done, and existence it’s self seems so null and deprived of potential",15Oct2020,1

I’m struggling a bit with being unemployed and not having much else going on right now. I had to move back into my Moms place now at 25 and that’s also getting me down. I’ve got some prospects for the future—I’ll be moving around the middle of next year to continue college elsewhere—but at the moment I don’t really have much else going on. 

I’m trying to find work but that’s been really tough and the more I apply the less motivated I become because I never hear back. I think if I could start working I’d feel a bit better, but living at home is taking a toll on my mental health. This is likely because of the pressure of some deep-set societal expectations for being a certain age and living at home, but I just feel really stuck at the moment.

I’ve got a bit of an addiction problem too, as in I tend to jump from one addictive behavior to the next—I quit smoking weed a few months ago which has really helped my mental health, i jumped to gaming and then also quit that because it negatively effected my mental health. Cutting those out freed up a lot of my time and now I’m having a hard time filling my days with productivity. So now I’ve jumped to internet addiction and I really want to cut it down a lot but there’s nothing else I feel like doing most of the time.

78,"So I have dinner with my parents about once a week and for about a month or two my Dad doesn’t show. He’s always been a workaholic so it wasn’t totally out of the ordinary, but this was a particularly long stretch of not seeing him. Eventually my Mom admits she hasn’t seen my Dad at their apartment in like 3 months and she thinks he’s staying at work overnight. My Dad out of nowhere calls me the very next day to meet up and so I ask him flat out what’s been going on. He tells me he’s been avoiding his apartment because an autistic teen who lives above him has been attacking him with hypersonic weapons through the walls. He has confronted other neighbors about the kid who they all deny exists. His explanation for this is that all of his neighbors are covering for the kid for some reason. He’s pointed out and taken pictures of “burns” and “welts” on his body that don’t really seem to be there to me and has even spent his days at various parks where he believes the kid might hang out. He also was staying at my Uncle’s house until he started being “attacked” by my Uncle’s upstairs neighbor as well. That’s when the .001% chance in my mind that this might possibly be happening to him in reality went out the window. He is still highly functional and working a very respectable job despite spending all day at parks and sleeping at his office. My Uncle, sister and I are currently coordinating to try and get him help but he is 65 years old, never had any issues like this is the past, and will likely not seek help himself because he is so stubborn. We have talked to some medical professionals and I am not necessarily expecting anyone to be able to tell me what is going on as it could be dementia, Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia or any number of things. I was just wondering if anyone had ever personally dealt with something like this because I am just totally at a loss here. I’ve done reading on “targeted individuals,” “gang stalking,” delusional psychosis, etc and it all is eerily similar to what my Dad is describing. It just seems weird for this to happen to him all of a sudden in his 60’s. Or was this something that was always inside of him and he just covered it up for that long?

I don't know if I should feel ashamed of sleeping with a light, I haven't needed a nightlight since I was a very little kid.

I'm worthless. I can't do anything right. When I do something, I end up f\*cking it up because of my clumsiness and idiocy. Multi-task, and I end up being scolded because I focused on just one. Follow errands, and I'm scolded because I don't do my own tasks first. Do my own tasks, and I'm scolded because I'm not doing any chores at home. I can't understand my f\*cking modules, and I still have to tutor my relatives. I need to use my laptop to try and understand the modules, but I still have to lend it to my family as soon as they borrowed it. I can't refuse because they'll scold me or get angry at me. When I tell everyone my opinions, especially if it's about my own f\*cking life, my mother only gets stressed out by me and tells me to stop. I can't choose for myself, and I ended up suffering in a school I never wanted to go to. No, no one's bullying me. It's just that except that time when I wanted to skip the last year of pre-elementary school, I never went to the school I like, the friends I like, or the people I like. I can't be heard crying, or they'll scold me. The most I did for myself is buying the cheapest coffee at 7-eleven because my mother will scold me once I ""waste"" money on something not needed. One time, when I bought notebooks and pens with my own money, I even have to be careful not to slip out to my mother that I just bought it because I feel like it. When I receive money from someone, even from my mother, she'll ask me and my siblings to lend her our money. She said it's spent for us in the first place, so the money almost never comes back. I have to be that behaved and obedient child at home, but I'm tired of it. I currently have a scholarship (which my mother applied ""for me"" against my will) in a ~~major~~ ~~private~~ school at my province which I don't even want in the first place. Everyone may say that I'm lucky because it's a scholarship, there are people who want that scholarship, and other bullcr\*p, but it just caused my ""mild"" depression and anxiety to become a full-blown depression with suicidal thoughts.

I want to cut ties with my toxic Filipino family who'll control and suppress their own children's lives and feelings for the sake of ""helping the family"" and acting and looking good towards ""relatives"" and ""friends"" I never even met. F\*ck being hospitable. F\*ck being kind to everyone else. I want to go away from here. I can't even express myself. I want to be free from my family's decisions (and gossips, most of the time), even if I know that my mother is still dealing with my father's death for two years and counting.

I want to drop out of my school and give up that ""precious"" scholarship, even if my mother will be very angry at me for wasting the opportunity to go to college. I'd rather go to a public school, even if I experienced traumatic events in one, or apply for military enlistment instead of slowly chipping my life inside.

F\*ck you, Filipino keyboard warriors who'll ever burn me here because I'm destroying the Filipino pride and face. I'm not having any of that sh\*t today. Not now, when I almost thought of overdosing myself with over-the-counter drugs and then drink lots of water until I explode while I'm typing this rant.

God of the Roman Catholics, if You exist, please let me reset this cr\*ppy life of mine, or at least give me the courage to do the epilogue of this life. I dreamt once of You telling me to not give up, but I can't, and I'm not even a Catholic at heart! This society and my family are the ones who decided my religion at the time when I can't even cr\*p by myself. Will I be marked by the Church as a heretic now? I don't know.

I'm trying to not give up, or at least ignore that invisible ~~mental~~ chain I feel physically strangling me. I'm even listening to my favorite song (which is neither an OPM or Hollywood-released song which the majority of the society is listening to without cringing just because it's from an anime) that saved me once in high school, when my mental health is in its all-time low, ~~when I'm afraid to go down the stairs because I ""see"" every single way for me to die in every step, and when I let the made-up people friends in my mind take over my body when I can't deal with the problem anymore because they know what's really the best for me~~. It calmed me down a bit, but it's not a long-term solution.

Preface: I work night shift, however I’ve been doing this for over three years now and don’t understand why my body hasn’t adjusted yet. 

I’ve never had good sleep patterns. Even as a teen, I would lay down for bed and end up laying there for hours before passing out. I’ve never been that person that “woke up on the wrong side of the bed.” I’m conscious for every move I make in my sleep, and unfortunately I move a lot. I toss and turn. I don’t ever remember a time in which I slept so soundly that I don’t remember getting to the position I woke up in. 

Recently though, things have gotten worse and I don’t quite know why. I haven’t made any changes to my medication or really anything else in my life. So I’m not sure what’s wrong. Same ol depressed me. 

I can’t stay asleep. My body absolutely will not let me sleep more than 5 hours max. It’s a never ending cycle that I can’t get out of, because I’ll wake up around 3pm and can’t go back to sleep. Have to go to work at 11pm. I get off at 7am and when I get home around 8, I’m so sleepy I can barely hold my eyes open. I try to stay up every day until at least 10. Sometimes I can, most times I can’t. And 3pm seems to be that number. I just can’t sleep passed that. 

I started smoking again because of this, and while that’s helped, financially I can’t be consistent with that. Melatonin puts me to sleep, but of course does nothing to keep me asleep longer. 

I’ve tried meditating, ASMR, soothing music, a hot shower. I just don’t know what else to do. If I can’t afford to buy pot, I don’t even wanna think about a doctor bill. And I’m just getting so mentally exhausted with the physical exhaustion.

92,"This is my first time posting here in this sub, I'm not usually one who likes to reveal or discuss when things aren't great. I normally prefer helping and talking with others. Just lending my ear, being a friend and providing as much support as I can. I know that many people need that, especially during this time we're in.

Some days I know and believe that I do this because I care, care about others and listening to them when other people won't. It's why I pursued the degree that I did, in Psych. Other days I worry that it's to distract myself and remain sane, to avoid dealing with the void and emptiness I feel inside.

I haven't felt it to this extreme in quite some time. Since she and I separated a few months back this feeling of worthlessness and wanting not to wake up the next day has come back with an intense earnest, like a deep, dark pit that I just can't crawl out of no matter how much I struggle. The first month was the worst of course, but every time I think it's going away, or that at least I can keep myself distracted, it comes back all of a sudden.

Sorry for the depressing read and rant, just wanted to get this off my chest somewhere, anywhere really. It felt like I was drowning and suffocating tonight, and just I thought writing it out might do some good, or at least provide distraction. I might delete this post later, as I genuinely do not want people to see or know of this side of me.

And finally, my sincerest best wishes to all suffering out there, I'm sure that many are dealing with darker demons than even I am.",15Oct2020,1

I know that venting is a big help for a lot of you out there and that's ok, but it has the opposite effect for me.

95,"Recently, I've been really considering going to a doctor to ask about the things I'm struggling with and if they're normal. I just graduated from university last year and have my first ""big boy job"" but I find that I am having a lot of struggles with it and I want to know if there's anything that I can do about it. I also had these same struggles during school, but I never really pushed myself to get help for it. I've brought it up to my boyfriend of almost 2 years and his response (when it comes to mental health generally) is that he doesn't think things like anxiety/adhd/add really ""exist."" He doesn't see them as 'disorders' but they're just ""mutations of the human brain,"" and you can't expect everyone to be following a cookie-cutter of what a human should be. 

I kind of get where he's coming from and that this is a pretty traditional Asian way of thinking. I don't know if you guys know what I'm talking about when I say that, but I'll try to give an example; it's like when people are depressed, Asian parents would think, 'you have nothing to be sad about so just stop moping.' Anyways, I'm just trying to write my thoughts out and I want to (and will) get help from a doctor but talking to my bf makes me feel like nothing is actually wrong with me and I could just be giving myself excuses?

And then immediately changed the subject by sending some random meme. 

I don’t want to pressure him to talk to me if he doesn’t want to so i just left it alone, but i really am worried for him. I don’t know what to do.

I always talk to him about how i’m feeling but i feel like he never shares anything hes feeling with me. Idk if its just a guy thing bc they’re so pressured to not show weakness in society or whatever, but idk it kind of throws me off. But i understand some things are just deeply personal and i have no right to be pestering him for information. I am just so worried for him.

I’m always worried about him since his work makes him exposed to the virus. Sometime’s i’d have nightmares I’ll lose him. I just really feel so lost right now, like nothing really makes sense.

Stuff of that sort, simple yet important things that I should remember to do/that I’ve done. I’ve dealt with just forgetting things and being forgetful but forgetting that I’m hungry is something that’s never happened to me before. And recently I’ve felt like my memories are lying to me. Like the memories from long ago, when I was a kid. They fee altered in some way. It’s strange because I can barley remember anything before 7th grade and if I really try they feel altered somehow. Like they’ve been implanted or altered. They fee different but like they’re pretending to be the same as always. I am not sure how else to put that other than it feels like I’m being lied to by my memories. My family has a history of Alzheimers and Dementia. Has anyone else had something like this? Should I be more concerned? Is this a problem with my mental health or early warning signs of a memory problem?",15Oct2020,1
99,"Hi. I'm not asking for a diagnosis, but I'm curious whether some of you also have similar experience. If so, do you associate it with any mental condition?

I have a really deep urge to tell the truth. Since my childhood. I'm capable of lying, but often admit that I lied after short time. I also feel that I have to confess all of the things I did against my conscience or all of my failures. If you ask me about my health and I feel bad that day, I might say that I'm fine but will feel deeply uncomfortable with it. I also feel like people around me should be filled with updated information about me, although it is compeletely irrational. Strangers, friends, teachers - I must tell the truth and restraning myself costs really much energy. I won't tell your secret, but keeping it makes me uncomfortable. On the other hand, I don't have obsessive thoughts about it. In my childhood no one forced me to do this.

Something  has made me think for a while. I've been through some things the last  few years, and during the most intense moments people have often been  oblivious to my plight or some friends/acquaintances remark the  following

""i'd fall apart in your situation I don't know how you do it""  
""  i'm honestly shocked you just asked me for help for this now, i'd  usually rely on you for stuff like this and I thought your question was a  joke. You always seem under control/confident/mature, you always know  what to do, at least it looks like it""  
"" you always look so happy! What's your secret"" (colleague while I was right in the middle of a really bad situation)

For starters I am not native English so sorry if my English is bad.

Created extra account because I don't want to post it with my own account

A couple years ago I was Admitted in a mental health clinic because I wasn't doing well and was very suicidal.
Of course you're getting in touch with the other people there and I created your friendship with somebody there.
She committed suicide in the clinic. Now, 4,5 years later, I still feel guilty. I should've noticed that something was going on. Ofcourse I know she was she suicidal just like me.
But I feel stupid that I didn't notice anything the day before that I wasn't there in the morning when she was in the group room. Some others told me that she wasn't looking very good that morning.  I should have been there.
For a long time more than one/two years my mind sometimes go to the point I want to go to the cops to turn myself in. Tell them it is my fault it happend. That I should be punished for it because I really think I deserve that.  I should have done someting. Should have sended her a text that morning (I Actually did send something but that was later in the morning and I don't know if she already has done something at the moment of time) I should have seen the signs. 
I don't know what to do about it.

The person in the room next to her called me that they that something was wrong.  I allready heard the alarm sounds from staff just couple seconds before but that it was a test. I run over to the room from that person and I was there untill my friend was on her way to the hospital.  Everytime I hear a siren from things like police or whatsoever my mind shutsdown and I'm back in that room.  Also if I just see a police oficer. I hate it.  I hate myself for it.  I can't complain it feels like my fault.
Allready tried 3 times(many sessions every time) EMDR and exposure on it over the last years.  All failed.

I know to myself that I'm just joking around with that person but, the more I do it, the more I want to do it again. Deep inside me, I also think that it's funny and there are times where I laugh and giggle in public when I think about it. Also, I find it hard to sympathize with another person's feeling.

He is generally a happy or more so content person and does not have major issues in his life. He is rich, enjoys his work, loves his pets, we have a good, loving and stable relationship (no kids) and he has hobbies and close friends/family. He had had longer periods in his life before where he just didn’t really feel anything, for months, in his 20’s, but as he aged he began ‘feeling more’ somehow. He all tells me this and can tell me when he’s feeling like this so I know and I kind of leave him alone. He really doesn’t know why this is happening and nor do I. He doesn’t really care for himself as it doesn’t effect him too much (it doesn’t make him sad just numb) but he cares for me as he’s just gone... we don’t live together and when we do see each other 1 time a week and he’s like this for a few hours it can be difficult. Outside of these phases he is very open, kind and loving. He’s not the most chatty and bubbly person but he can communicate well.

《Disclaimer: This isn't to self promote or anything, I'm not selling a product or anything that will bring me revenue,  its quite the opposite,  it takes up time and needs a lot of effort &amp; it's all for free. I'm doing this to help others who are struggling》

So after thinking hard and long enough how to help people who are struggling with their mental health I have finally I have actualise the idea of making a platform for people with mental illnesses. I've started both a Facebook and instagram account. The reason is because I myself went through a lot of things for many years which isn't mainstream, and which I couldn't make sense of. They were soul shattering on many levels. It took years of seeking, reading and compiling information which I grounded through analyzing patterns and reflecting on to understand what I went through.  

Much later therapy wasnt to help neither because they couldn't understand.It was also a quite isolating experience, also I didnt know what those struggles meant from an islamic perspective. 

 I'm planning to gradually increase awareness on topics I wish was more in mainstream psychology , and general things that people really need to know. I will also write about spirituality and knowing yourself , because there is no gift one can give him or herself like learning about themselves. I truly want to empower people to understand themselves and not wander confusingly. Poetry will also be part of the page , because it is part what Jung called 《symbolic healing 》 and has been an essential part of my journey.

Really hope it will be to help for people out there

132,"Before University we was all in lockdown from March to August in the UK (6 months). I haven't been at sixth form. 
I applied for university games art and design degree. And I'm here now. 

I am really enjoying the social aspect, and I've met a girl who is beyond perfect. Weirdly perfect
However my course is beyond stressful, and I'm questioning if it was the right decision to make.

Before uni I was in the most positive mental state I've ever been in. I never had to try and not feel crap, because I felt that good. Nothing got to me. I've never been happier. 
I've come to university. I have felt myself over the past 2 weeks trying to not fall back into a bad mental state I was in a while ago. And the fact that I've been trying to not fall back into it, shows that my mental state is getting worse. 

Everyone wants to see me at uni. But the stress is that I can't. I have never worked so hard in my life. I knew I Was going to be working hard. But even my friends are saying I am being over worked.

My FIRST week of work. I did 30 hours outside of my lectures. And the following week I got told I hadn't done enough work and they didn't like my character Idea. So I was told to start over.

Because of Covid. I cannot use the universities facilities and software. My laptop cannot run the software they want me to use. I'm getting told off for not being able to afford a powerful laptop (the one we need to get is a minimum of£1.3k.) they are really harsh. Also they are saying we will need to invest into Zbrush which is £400/year.

I am paying the MAXIMUM tuition fee of £9.25k/year. And my tutors are dreadful. And I cannot use any of the facilities I need to use to pass. 

I am starting to dislike art, and I'm only 4 weeks into my course. I don't have the patience for it because I'm not working as fast as they want me to. And my only thoughts right now are to drop out. Part of it is the work load. But the main reason is because I'm not even getting the bare minimum for how much this is costing me. 
However, I have made some amazing friends, I have an amazing girlfriend. And I don't want to go to a different university and make friends again
I have no friends at home. This is the most at home I've felt in a long long time. 

I have been doing work for about 3 hours today. And I just haven't got anywhere near as much as I hoped to get done. And I've had a bit of a mental breakdown from the stress. 

I really don't know what To do. I don't know if it's worth leaving. I've never felt so at home and with a FamilY. But I've also never been under so much stress :(",15Oct2020,1
133,"There's something confusing about myself that I want to talk about, it's a problem I've had for a really long time.

I've just come out of a period of self hate by focusing in on my identity and who I am, but I have these random thoughts that still manage to break my defences.

I don't know how to explain it but it's like half of my brain is constantly working against me over the smallest of things. Like for example I'll be chilling playing a video game I really like when a random thought comes into my head like ""Hey, is this game really that good?""  I'll try to get rid of the thought and justify why I like it only to have more thoughts come in at too fast of a pace for me to keep up with.

Now apply this to negative things about myself. It's hard to keep up when half of my brain is spewing negativity. ""Are you really a good person?"" ""How do you know you don't deserve to die?"" And a hundred other thoughts as well.

Even if I don't try to justify them and just ignore them it gets worse, because the more I think ""No, I don't want to think this"" the more I think of it.

How do I stop this and get the other half of my thoughts to just stop, or how do I hone in and focus on a single good thought?",15Oct2020,1
134,"My fiancee is from the US and I am from the UK. We met online when she was working in the UK 5 years ago. Since then we've suffered a myriad of visa issues that ultimately meant us maintaining our relationship long distance with a occasional visits (maybe 3/4 weeks out of every six months). We did 2.5 years of this. We really managed it very well and eventually in January this year we got our visa to settle in the UK.

However, once she arrived here, covid happened. We couldn't marry, which meant she couldn't work and the lockdown meant she was stuck with absolutely nothing to do. Her mental health deteriorated over the months. I also work from home so we were in each others company 100% of the time. The NHS in the UK has been struggling to deal with the mental health crisis and was not much use to us. It did seem like our need to marry immediately was going to be pushed out 2 years due to visa circumstances. This all changed when our lawyer said you need to book a wedding right now. Well, with 8 months of cabin fever, declining mental health and a staggering lack of purpose it was too much, she couldn't do it. I absolutely didn't help by being extremely blasé about the prospect of marriage.

She decided she needed to go back to the US to be around family to get proper medicine, therapy and familial support. She left yesterday and because we called off the visa process there is no immediate path to get back together permanently. In fact, it's not even possible for us to visit each other again until travel bans are lifted.

One of the private therapists we briefly used (but couldn't continue because of money) very quickly decided that she is bipolar. Something which my sister in law (a trained counsellor) said she absolutely agrees with last night. Her mother is also bipolar. Also, on our last night together we talked endlessly and a whole bunch of stuff about her childhood came out that she never even told her therapist when she was young. It also came out that the same issues and emotions she was feeling were not new, and existed before I was a part of her life. If this all turns out to be true did we ever really have a chance to succeed with untreated bipolar in between us?

We haven't spoken properly yet and she's still only just getting back and will have jet lag. Neither of us wants to give up. The last message I got before she boarded was ""I love you and I am going to fix this and I’m so sorry""

It is my belief that we do have something special. We share similar outlooks on life, what we want out of life, we influence each other in the right ways, we have respect for one another and I think most importantly, we make each other laugh. I always tried to explain this throughout our hard times and she would be dismayed at why even though she totally agreed, she wasn't happy.

Myself and our two dogs are in a lot of grief right now and trying to figure out what to do. It's so painful but my instinct is to give this a few months until around Christmas when she's had some solid therapy and medicine before I say you need to either commit to us getting back together somehow, someday or I need to move on. If I break this off I lose my best friend and my confidant.

Would love some advice and input on this situation. Love and respect to anyone else struggling today.",15Oct2020,1

Read some blogs and they said it's your brain and body asking for a break. I did that. Took break for a while like months and feelings haven't changed. Spoke with a councillor, and he said identify when you get frustrated in what you do now or at least look for clues as to what makes me don't like what I do. I'm trying to observe but I don't see what the trigger point is.

I need help in understanding why this is happening and what is the point of the feeling, for sure i feel it's the sign that I don't like what i am doing but i don't know what to do which can satisfy that feeling.

Some people and blog says explore more things so you find something interesting. I did try exploring things but i don't seems to come across anything that's interesting but if i still force myself i begin hating doing that too. 

For sure i don't want to just sit around till my last day. So, what is the problem? Followings are some of the things I think maybe they are the problems

141,"A close friend I had since highschool, went in India for a year as a volunteer working with an NGO. This NGO was advocating for girls education around the world and against analphabetism and child marriages.This story he didn't told me himself first his family did, but we were eventually able to talk about it together. He is better now but quite traumatized I think he spend a lot of his time alone in his room just doing nothing and depression.

He was giving free English lessons to kids although he wasn't a teacher (no diploma). Untouchable Kids from a very poor and difficult background.
After like 8 month there one of the girl from his class got forced into child marriage by her family she was only 15 years old and wanted to study to become a doctor.

The context is that apparently this is a very common custom /tradition in some of the rural backward area  in India. Where girls aged from 13 to 18 are married to significantly older men aged around 18 to 30 (And it also happens in many other countries I'm not trying to specifically point a finger only at India here.)

The girl was the daughter of the handyman and school janitor who where living in a house at the school doors as ""guardians"" supposed to control who goes in and out of the school. The irony

Well on the day of the marriage he wasn't told it was going to happen not by the local staff of the school who knew it was going to happen and told no one.
They even all waited for the founder of the NGO to be gone and he wasn't around town he was gone for a vacation with his wife that week. 
And so random people with fancy clothes started to come onto the school ground slowly from 20 people to About 60/70 people from the village and other people from the groom family.
The old men sat in a circle and the women from the village started singing. Traditions and shit. 
It's at this moment he realised that something was off and that things like that wasn't supposed to happen on the school ground so he looked for the local staff and asked them what was going on and they were his Indian friends so they told him.

And he just lost it at this moment he felt so betrayed and lied to. he insulted everyone and cursed everyone even threw the Prasad in the trash.
Went to find the girl she was locked up in a room with another volontier was crying her souls out with fear and disper.
He called the founder and head master of the organization and asked him for help the guy answered he was busy and too far away. 
The girls family were his friends and the school staff too so he didn't want to call the cops on them.
Would also possibly mean the closing of the school.
So he grabbed a bad handmade foldable knife without people noticing from his stuff. First Went to the neighbors field and caught a goat from the herd 
Went back in the school over the wall still carrying the animal and proceeded to murder this goat in front of the cheerful crowd while cursing them to hell. The goat actually didn't die though apparently had to get stitched up at the veterinary and was probably traumatized for life. But the girl also didn't marry that year. What is the real better option also dialogue with the family wasn't leading anywhere the  father being a backward alcoholic and violent.

After that he was expelled and flew straight back home. The marriage didn't happen that year but the girl could be married now even him, he doesn't know.
With corrona and confinement the people from the NGO couldn't stay on Indian ground.

After that he was really wrecked and didn't see much people he was obsessed with this and was always trying to figure out a way that he would have saved the day without using such violent ""solutions"".
He also went to a psychiatrist because he thought he was psychotic or something.

What do you think of this ? What would you have hypoteticly done in this situation ? 
Do you think he is crazy ? Or do you think he lost control but still was right in a way ?

I had friends who suffered more and became dependent on drugs or had suicidal thoughts but through it all my mates and me got kept at it. 

After this I worked for a university within the student welfare department and saw the huge range of issues facing students today in the UK and did my best to make a difference to those in need. I also saw how the system was strained to breaking point and in need of relief. 

I'm creating a course for higher education students which focusses on mental health and wellbeing through proper diet, exercise and stress/anxiety relief through mindfulness and yoga. I hope to both empower students to take control of there own wellbeing so they can achieve and also relief some of the pressure on the mental health support system.

My (f26) fiance (m35) told me two weeks ago that he was feeling suicidal.

He suffers with PTSD from childhood trauma and abusive ex-girlfriends but hasn't had any depressive episodes while we've been together. Since Covid he had been out of work for 7 months, issues with said exes means he isnt being allowed to see his kids and in July he was spiked by a 'friend' which led to a psychotic episode that lasted a month.... it's a lot.

I also suffer from depression and have felt suicidal in the past and knew that if I could just help him keep his head above water, it would pass. Instead, I had to take him to A&amp;E on Thursday after he told me that me being there wouldn't stop him from doing something, and that he's desperate enough now that he would do it even while I was at home, if he found the opportunity.

The main trigger is our home. It is where he was spiked and spent his whole psychotic episode, and he's described a day where he felt like he had died, that his heart had stopped beating and his whole body had gone cold. Our flat is old and has no central heating, and we don't have much money so we cant keep it warm.

Being here keeps him anxious and depressed and I've been trying to look for somewhere else to live, but again, we have no money.

He started a new job on Sunday that I was hoping was going to be enough of a distraction for him, and that a routine, being away from the house, and interacting with people would be good for him but he still tells me he wants to end it all.

My sister (28yo) started showing psychosis symptoms a couple of months ago. At first we thought she was telling the truth but now it doesn't make sense and the symptoms are getting more serious. So I'd appreciate any advice on what to do next. Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

Her symptoms: a few months ago she started telling my family that she's being spied on. She said that she had to stop using her phone, laptop, email... because ""THEY"" can hear and know everything (I will address these people she claimed spying on her using quotation marks). She told my mom that ""THEY"" were spying on all my family members, that ""THEY"" can listen as my mom talks at home even when the phone is on lockscreen. 

One time I called an electrician in for an issue, he showed up 30min earlier than scheduled. My sister said that he was told to come early by ""THEM"". 

Recently, she's been talking to the air a lot in English. I don't live with my family and my parents can't understand English so they couldn't know what she was saying. But she just keeps talking to nobody, no phone in front of her. Sometimes she cries for no reason, while having dinner, while driving, at 3AM. Last night my mom said something (probably trying to convince her to seek professional help) and my sister started screaming.

&amp;#x200B;

What we have tried: my dad tried to gradually talk to her, she wouldn't tell him anything. He's been very patient, he said something along the line of ""tell me what happened and who they are, I will do anything to protect you"". She wouldn't let him finish his thoughts so he decided to write a note to her. Then when she saw that she started screaming also.

155,"Three years ago, in Lisbon, I happened to meet Brad Parscale. I had no clue who he was; we just met at the bar counter enjoying yet another [**Web Summit**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/web-summit/) afterparty. We started talking about common issues in managing software development agencies, customer relations, and other stuff while showing each other some pictures, joking, and having a couple of drinks. That’s how I met [**Donald J. Trump for President, Inc.**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/donaldj.trumpforpresidentinc./) Campaign Manager.

Frankly speaking, Brad’s story is truly inspiring for me. From the owner of a small web agency in Texas that made a $1000 website for one of Trump’s real estate projects, he became responsible for managing all the digital operations for Trump’s presidential campaign. Brad was Trump’s first call when he decided to run for president. The entire campaign launched by Brad and his agency cost Trump some $98 million. 

Once I returned from the conference, I emailed Brad, and you know what, he did reply to my email. I was pleasantly surprised, but I already knew that he is a pretty down-to-earth guy who treats others with respect, regardless of his high social standing. He is a living example of why you should never reject small projects, and I’ve already mentioned his success story in a couple of articles and interviews. 

A couple of days ago, I remembered this story and decided to google how Brad was doing. It turned out that [**he had an emotional breakdown**](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article246174240.html) at the end of September. First, he was arrested by the police because of his suicidal threats and being suspected of assaulting his wife. Sometime later, he announced his complete retirement from the election campaign. He was involuntarily hospitalized, and the arrest footage was posted on the Internet.

Dealing with high risks and continuous exposure to stress is an inevitable fate of every entrepreneur, and I know it from my own experience. Anyone can burn out: not only an employee but also a business owner, especially if one is working on something really huge. This is when the “work-life balance” comes to mind: indeed, it’s a must-have these days. **Switching your focus from work to other areas of your life**, recreating, meditating, having a therapy session, and vacationing - all these are essential for our long-term well-being. Business is both your work and your life, which is probably the root cause of all meltdowns in entrepreneurs.

&gt;*Dealing with high risks and continuous exposure to stress is an inevitable fate of every entrepreneur, and I know it from my own experience.*

Speaking of work-life balance, I cannot but recall one of my employees who has been struggling with chronic overworking for the past two months. She is the kind of person who monitors her emails in the evening just to make sure our client gets a prompt email reply or can make an urgent Zoom call, even though her workday starts at 7 am. For product releases, she volunteered for a few night shifts. Although all her overtimes and night work were compensated, money cannot instantly cure physical and mental exhaustion. I decided to reward her with a one-week vacation for two to the destination of her choice fully paid by the company. And of course, her workload for the next release will be closely monitored, as we don’t want to lose her to burnout.

&gt;*Although all her overtimes and night work were compensated, money cannot instantly cure physical and mental exhaustion.*

As for Brad, I really hope he will recover soon and start a new fascinating chapter in his life. I’d love to read at least one more success story about Brad, and whatever he chooses to do in the future, I hope he pays double attention to his health because when you are a boss, you are the one in charge of your well-being.

165,"Sorry for the rant, but I was in need to talk to someone. I made this account just to do this. 

I am working on depression, heavy anxiety and CPTSD. Started going to psychologist because it was impacting my work and got send straight to psychiatrist. 
It's been one year and half and 3 different professionals, and it is being so hard. I fell anxious only thinking about it.

I do not know if it is only my bad luck, or where I live it is usual but the professionals I have talked to always are kinda rude, always late and show a big disinterest. 

First doctor wanted me to keep using pain medication that made me feel bad longer than the ortho recommended. But I was happy because the medicine he gave me to anxiety/depression had finally made me fell good for the first time since I remember. And also, all the 4 or more appointments with him, all of them he delayed from 30 minutes to one hour. The last straw was Corona, where we did a virtual talk and then waited 4 days to receive the prescription renovation to be delievered, already without my meds, and through messaging him he says to me stop bothering him. I felt so bad. Ended having to go take it in his building because he never sent it to be delivered. 

Second doctor only asked what I wanted and renovated my prescription. 
Third doctor, I then could talk how my depression had not improved and change medicine. I felt like he was a little inpatient while we talk but I am very bad talking with person, always fell like they are mad with me so I dismiss. Then appointment of yesterday was set and there I was, waiting for 40 minutes to the doctor to come. It was my lunch break so I could not wait anymore. 
Today I called to make another appointment, and I hear that the doctor will not accept appointments with me anymore because i left. 

It's so hard for me. I just want to stop it, never put myself in that position again. But I fear that my job will be affected more than already is being without the anti-anxiety medicine.

So here I am, looking through the list of doctors from my health insurance, imagining how any of this names is gonna make me wait and be rude.

Sorry again, I am just frustrated with a lot of things.",15Oct2020,1

I went through a similar thing this time last year and it eased up a bit over the lockdown period funnily enough, which is strange because you would assume it would be worse during that time. My mental health is very up and down but bad periods such as this are normally triggered by a negative event in my life which then spirals and spirals until I work myself into a really bad headspace which seems impossible to get out of. These periods are usually characterised by persistent self degrading and irrational thoughts, lack of any proper motivation, loss of self esteem, feeling lonely despite having a good group of friends around me and just a general struggle to feel happy even if I’m doing something I enjoy. I know a lot of people isolate themselves and shut people off during periods like this but I’m the opposite which is confusing to me, I need to constantly be doing something or meeting up/talking to people to combat feeling lonely or letting my negative thoughts get too loud. I’ve never really spoken to a professional about my mental health because It’s only been the last couple of years where I’ve noticed it decline (I’m 19 btw), idk if it’s something which requires a diagnosis or medication or if I’m just overreacting, it’s all a bit of a grey area for me in terms of getting help so any advice would be appreciated",15Oct2020,1

Everyone suffers tremendously in life. It can be down to several reasons... family problems, work, financial issues, problems at home, a death in the family, a regret, past mistake, depression, anxiety... as I said, there are several reasons. Nobody has it easy in life. Just because we don’t show the suffering in person, it doesn’t mean we are not going through it. A dark life can be lived brightly. 

An average person has many problems in their life, many things jumbling around their head but, unfortunately, they don’t have what it takes to speak up about it. In that case, they will remain silent and say nothing, to anyone, which makes matters even worse, by suffering silently. 
Everyone suffers some injustice in life, and what better motivation than to help others not suffer in the same way.

176,"So the other night my bf and I went out clubbing. We got really wasted and I started puking and occasionally blacking out. He dropped me of at his place and continued clubbing with his friend. 

I've been dealing with mental health issues for a long time, that my bf was aware of. But something happened that night, I can't remember. I had a lot of blackouts. So I assume something triggered me. I blacked out and sliced my arm wide open. I can't remember much of it but I woke up in the ER, my bf's flatmates took me.

I woke up to the nurse asking me a bunch of questions, apparently I lost a lot of blood. When we got back to my boyfriends apartment, everything was okay at first. But then he stopped talking to me.

He was upset at me. He barely spoke to me after that. Rightfully so. Apparently he got into a fight with his friends when they told him I was in the ER, he thought they were exaggerating because I usually self harm. But when he went into his room he saw the pools of blood and realized the severity of the situation. 

And today, he's feeling like we're not good for each other. He wants us to take a break or something. He said we can take a week and see if we feel like a we're good for each other. But he sounds really set on letting us go, despite my protest. I'll fight to keep us a float but it feels like I already lost him. 

He asked me if he can vent to his mom about what happened. Of course, I didn't say no. But I'm feeling scared, that he'll hate me even more. And that his mom will hate me. I mean what part of ""My gf sliced her arm open and littered my room with blood"" doesn't sound like a toxic mess? 

I brought it upon myself. I feel like I've lost everything. I know things weren't going well with me, but I was coping. And sure, my bf and I had our ups and downs but I was generally really happy. But its as if almost killing myself actually killed me inside. And now, it's like my eyes are open and I see what mess I made. 

Im 24 years old and I'm still a student, my academic life if a disaster. I'm stuck with a supervisor that doesn't give two shits about whether I graduate or not. My mother absolutely despises my existence. I don't really have friends left, they all moved away. Those that's left here only cares about me when they need something. I'm so damn lonely. I have no one to talk to, hence reddit... I should be visiting one of my friends this weekend that moved away. I saw her a year ago. But I don't have the strength for it. For putting up a happy face. The worst part is my health insurance won't cover my therapy anymore (literally heard it two days ago). So I am truly alone.

I don't know how to cope with everything. I wish I had someone, anyone. All these issues and problems... They were there, but I coped with it. I took my meds, went to therapy, everything was quite okay. I was happy. I was so fucking happy.

Their first thought when they post MAY not be whether or not their post is 100% on task for what YOU believe should be the operative use of this sub. You are entitled to your opinion, but if your opinion is that people are using this board incorrectly, you kind of are missing the reality of why people come to this sub. 

If someone posts an ""I Love You"" post, there is a great possibility that they, themselves, are not in a great place. Or maybe they ARE, but they are just getting out of a bad place. Or maybe they are posting what they believe they might have wanted to hear when they were in a bad place. 

I've seen people actually post on here calling ""I Love You"" posts disingenuous. That they are only made to make OP feel better. 

I am kind of dumbfounded at that statement. 

It really resonates with the way the world is right now. 

To say, boilerplate, that all of these posts are disingenuous and need to be removed from the board because they aren't useful is shocking. 

What that means is: 

""I have come to this free platform that I did not create and was not involved with from it's inception, but I have come to use this free service, and I feel that certain people are using this free service incorrectly, so I feel that I should call on an arbitrator to silence these posts based on my projection of what they mean."" 

That is such an ugly, 2020 view of things. Some critical thinking would lead you to the obvious reality that this is the internet. It's not here for your limited view on how it should be used.

188,"Hi so basically I got diagnosed with OCD when I was 11. It manifested itself in me having to do stuff eg check doors, panic attacks, dark intrusive thoughts and anxiety. So I got CBT and was put on setraline which helped. I stopped taking meds the summer after GCSEs cuz I was fine and I was fine during year 12 (but then again I didn’t do any AS level exams cuz of corona). Now I’m 17 and I’m year 13 and I am worried I’m relapsing. Recently when I’ve been in exams my hands have started to tremble, I can’t breathe and I feel  my heart beating really fast. Twice I have had to leave the lesson before or during the exam in order to calm down. In the end I got the test done but it was still really traumatic. I tried breathing during the exam ya know but when I have the clock right in front of me all I can really think of is that my time is running out. When my hand trembles I try to continue writing but my handwriting looks trash, eventually my hands steady and I can carry on fine if a bit anxious still. I am applying to Cambridge for English and I had this nightmare about the ELAT in which I failed and was literally begging the examiner to give me a second chance. I woke up at like 4am terrified and panicking again. Then today I had an English test (not like a huge one but still) on the tempest and that’s when I had my whole having to leave the class cuz of having another panic attack and stuff. Everyone tells me that I’m gonna do fine in my exams, that it’s just an exam and I get it - but I’m someone who prides them self on being intelligent. And people think I’m just naturally smart and stuff but I have this huge fear about maintaining it and not disappointing people. I told my form tutor about this and I’m meant to see the school counsellor tomorrow. But oh my god I’m so fucking terrified cuz what if this happens during my actual A levels, during my ELAT which is next month, during my other exam tomorrow or next week. I can’t fail I just can’t.

My mum said I shouldn’t be disappointed in myself and it’s fine to go back on medicine but I can’t help but still feel like this.

190,"I'm 13 and my parents have want I call multiple big fights a year. Each year they do this and pretend that they are going to divorce but they never do. At this point I wish they leave each other. 

One day I asked my mom if she would have divorced my dad if it wasn't for me being born. She said yes. I wish I was never born, so my mom and me never felt this pain.

I keep looking back on all the fights they have, I can't help it. I don't want to think about it but I can't just forgot it either. They say forgive and forget. At this point I've done that too many times to count.

I just want to leave, but I can't. They say don't be in a hurry to grow up because adults have it hard. But, I still wish I was 18 because then I could move on with my life. I don't know how I'm going to last until then. One day they are happy and nice, the next their fighting. I never know whats going to happen. They are always stressed and depressed even if they don't know it. My dad gets angry at my mom and the other way around. 

I remember one fight a few years ago. They both were in a big fight and threatening to divorce each other. I don't remember ever little thing that happened but I will try my best. My mom went to go see a friend and left me alone with my father locking me in the bedroom. She didn't take me with her because dad could say she was taken me without his consent or something like that, it was bs, and she just should of taken me. She knew that dad could try and get information out of me, of where she was. I was in the room reading scared but trying to stay calm, I had this little phone that I could use to text my mom. 

Soon after she left dad came knocking on the door, trying to open it. He wanted to know where mom was. I don't remember why though. Soon he found the key and came in trying to take my phone from me incase she told me where she was. She didn't, which just tells me she knew something would happen. He tried taking the phone from me but I was stronger. He left then. I went on the bed and started crying. He didn't care about me just where she was. He would come in and out trying to take my phone saying nothing, just looking for my phone. This went on for maybe a few hours. I'm not sure, time just went by like minutes. He got my phone later on, and I didn't even care at this point. 

Before he got my phone, I was just texting mom telling her to come home quickly. She didn't come home till much later on, even though I begged her to. I was scared of what my dad might do. When he got my phone he tried bringing up and evidence of us talking bad about him, pulling anything he could find. All he did find was us just making jokes, nothing serious. He knew that my mom talked bad about him to me a lot.

Things go blurry after that. I think at that point I realized that I they both never cared for me. Everything was brushed off, but it's hard for me to brush it off to. They always make up and leave me to be the one thats still mad at what had happened. So, I'm almost forced to give in and forget it all happened. 

Idk if I can forgive them. I can't tell them because they will make a big deal about it and pretend they understand, but do nothing to help the situation. I learned that the hard way. I guess I will wait until I'm 18 to move out and start my own life.",15Oct2020,1
191,"I'm 27 and female. I have read a lot on psychiatry and therapy. I have also been in both treatments for five years and improved a lot. I grew up in an extremely abusive household. I used to be diagnosed schizoaffective, but I've been stable for almost three years. I was hospitalized (mostly involuntarily) ten times over the course of 3 years, and the only good thing about being in the (inner city) hospitals was the conversation with other patients. Sometimes I want to voluntarily commit myself just because I am lonely and walk to talk to people.  


I really enjoy chatting with strangers. I love learning about people from all walks of life and I'm not easily bored. Any ethnicity, nationality, age, gender, etc. I give all people who come into my life equal opportunity to earn my respect and attention.  It doesn't matter if you struggle with English.  I'm not passionate about left or right wing politics. I focus my life on helping others, and so not being judgmental of either side. However, I still work hard on being knowledgeable and aware of current events, so I can help people struggling with their own views.  


Basically, whatever your beliefs you can feel safe talking about them with me. I want to help you, and I never want to make you feel bad, I just want to give you some new perspectives or information you might not have heard of before. I can also refer you to books, documentaries, videos, etc that might help you understand something, or see something that bothers you in a new way. I also understand that a lot of the times people just want to vent and feel understood, so if it's obvious you don't really want advice, I'm not going to push it on you either.  


I read A LOT of books (especially on history and spirituality) so we can get into some really detailed conversations or even deep dive into learning about a subject or reading the same book (we can also read to each other). Right now I am obsessed with ancient history, particularly the Sumerians and the legends of the Annunaki. I also love art, and I can constructively criticize visual and text based arts (or just oo and aw at them if that's what you prefer :P). I also own a successful business and can give really good advice if you are wanting to become a business owner or independent priva te contractor.  


I have been extremely suicidal, psychotic, manic, and depressed in the past. Whatever your issue, I probably have a good understanding of what you are going through and can help you. Honestly, just talking about things is so helpful. And if you are psychotic, you will find it extremely difficult to find a therapist that is even trained to talk to you, or experienced with psychosis at all. Since people with psychotic features only make up 2%-5% of the population, they focus on the other 25% (larger customer base) that have much more milder/simpler conditions.  


I have been talking to some strangers online for over 7 years. I like to build long-term relationships with people over the internet. However, if you just want a drinking buddy for the night I am down for that too. If you are in a crisis and desperate for help I am available almost 24-7. I work from home and set my own schedule, and can usually take a break to talk to someone if they really need it ASAP.  


I prefer discord which is a free application you can download on your desktop or your phone. My username is TaranaDolmeto#2982. Feel free to add me if you want to talk or send me a message here if you want to use a different app for some reason.",15Oct2020,1
192,"At school (it’s happened 8 times now) when my teacher is talking about something to do with blood or illness I get really pale, I get hot but feel cold, my mouth goes dry, my vision starts to go blurry, I can’t hear anything and my hands start to buzz. It’s happened so many times now that I don’t hyperventilate or stress, I just put my hand up and ask to go to the toilet (new teachers often get worried because of how pale I look.) 

This always happens when they are talking about something pain or blood related and today it was because my food tech teacher was talking about blood anemia, anorexia and a condition where you don’t get enough calcium and your bones turn spongey. I think I started to panic about if I didn’t have enough iron or calcium and I’d have to deal with stuff like that. It mostly happens recently when I tell myself not to feel sick over it, today was the first time I was able to breathe through it but the teacher kept talking and I lost it. It doesn’t make me feel like throwing up and it doesn’t feel like a panic attack because I don’t feel it deep rooted in my heart, just feeling giddy and overwhelmed.

197,"It's like...

everything was going so fast when I was a kid that I didn't have time to breathe or think.

First, I'm autistic

I've always been STRESSED. Always. My mother used to say that when I was little she'd take me out to the park with my sister and I'd enjoy myself, but I would always throw up afterwards. 

We had this saying ""Good stress, Bad stress. It's all stress."" because both excitement and distress just took me the fuck out. I'd start getting hardcore worse with anxiety starting in October, you know when holidays began, and my headspace would get so much worse.

Christmas was horrible because even though it was fun. The anticipation was too much and I couldn't stand it. I don't celebrate it anymore lmao. 

I could barely sleep. Everything always felt like too much. When I was little, I used to sleep under the covers because I was terrified that something was going to be there if I looked out. It was hot and uncomfortable, but I was terrified. I just knew there would be something there.

I was constantly anxious. Obsessively anxious. I used to have Self-Hate O'Clock. Where my brain would make everything horrible around 5PM-7PM and then until bed where I had trouble sleeping.

I used to sleepwalk when it got really bad when I was little.  

My mom tried explaining it to doctors and then I tried when I started to be able to put it into actual words. Was I explaining it wrong? My mother seemed to get it. She was around to see how truly awful it was. She was was a stay-at-home mom and she took care of me and my sister.  

She fought for my meds because they didn't want to medicate a kid my age. It had gotten really bad when I was 10 and was transitioning to middle school. I was kind of suicidal, but in the way that was just like. Wished I didn't exist, rather than actively. I was put on Zoloft and it was the first time I was calm in my life. That particular med lost it's potency pretty quickly. Went through a lot more that either died out or caused mood swings. 

I didn't talk in school because I zoned out enough to be there. It was hard to drag myself back for communication. I would just like go away in my head and then I'd come home and I'd have good hours and the I'd have Self Hate O'Clock until bed. 

It got really bad around high school to the point that My mom had to take me out of school in the middle of my junior year because I was kind of not there? I don't remember a lot of it. 

Then post high school, a year or two afterwards. The Break happened. I really don't know how to describe that. But I was numb for about two years. I couldn't think right or do really anything. I came back.

I'm on good meds now. They break up my concentration a lot. I'm on antidepressants (2) and take a tranquilizer that is like an extended release med. 

I don't know what the fuck any of that was. I don't think I described it right to any professionals. I don't still don't know how to get it out correctly. I always feel like a child when I try explain it. 

I kind of want to try therapy again. I don't live in the best area for it and now there is a plague. The few times my mother took me to some, it was always a disaster. One of them immediately said my problem was that I wasn't taking enough responsibility for my mental illness which hit all of my insecurities at once. That ended up being a really bad day.

I feel stupid. Like nothing was wrong. I've heard the phrase 'We all have anxiety' so many times. I always feel like 'how can I make what I'm trying to say sound like something'. Like it's not severe enough. It always seems lighthearted when I talk about it. I don't know what I'm doing wrong when I was trying to get people to get it.

I'm gonna post this before I lose confidence.",15Oct2020,1
198,"Everytime I listen to music I think about death, doesn’t matter the genre. Sometimes I think about my friends, family or me getting killed. Maybe by a robber, a car accident, a shooter, a fire, ect. Sometimes I think about killing other people. And sometimes myself.

Everytime I cycle to school I think about a drunk driver hitting me.

Everytime I think about killing myself I think about, where, when, what I will kill myself with, if i’ll write letters to everyone, what i’ll write in those letters, what i’ll write to my penpals, what i should leave behind so they remember me. 

Why do i keep thinking about death? And why does my heart hurt when i think about it? Do i want to die? Do i want to live? Idk at this point. I know i won’t do it because im to weak to pain. But i still fantasize about it.

I think I’m bipolar and have been thinking that for sometime and I think I’m manic again. I’m doing stupid shit and not feeling anything at all. I cut my hair yesterday, spent 1,500 dkk and two days before that I boned my besties ex boyfriend. Bad friend I know. 
Though I feel alone and unloved I can’t feel sad or anything like that. I feel comfortable, but super uncomfortable at the same time. 
I kinda tried explaining this to my friend (who I’m also in love with) but regretted it bcs I felt selfish. These days she can’t eat and I just got back from not eating and here I am helping her, but I just had to also have a stupid problem? Urgh! Why am I like this?
The guy I mentioned earlier is kinda trying to convince me to let him come over tonight and I’m bad at saying no bcs of all of my shit, but I don’t think it’s a good idea. I didn’t really wanna when we did it last time either..://
Basically I’m mad bcs I’m like this. I’m selfish, stupid and I don’t feel anything. I’m in love with an amazing girl (who just sees me as a friend(for now XD)and I go fucking my besties ex? Like why? Wtf? I don’t even really like him... 
I’m basically sitting in my basement hoping that one day someone will show me as much live as I give out, but how can anyone love me? 
I give this girl little notes everyday reminding her that she’s beautiful and perfect, I try to help her eat and I show her love. I do my best for all of my friends. I think I do this and it’s so important to me bcs no one does or ever have done this for me. Probably bcs I’m awful I guess, but I really do try. 
Sorry for this messy post, I just need to say it all out loud I guess. 
I wrote her a short film. I haven’t filmed it yet, but I wrote it. It’s supposed to be beautiful and show her how I see her and tell her about the day I actually almost kissed her, but I don’t know, maybe it’s dumb...

200,"Good afternoon everyone, 

I am new here on this sub so please forgive me if this isn’t the right place to ask. 

Background Info:

I am a 20yo Male college student studying at a big university in Minnesota, USA. I am studying business and marketing and getting a minor in economics. I am also in the midst of developing my own business theory. I have never been diagnosed with depression or anxiety but my mother has. I haven’t had many big hardships in my life, which I am thankful for and acknowledge, but I feel like I am sinking into a bigger/ deeper hole. I try and mediate and do things to alleviate the stresses on my mind. I do not use substances to cope. I drink a few times a month with my friends to kick back and catch up because they are either states away, working full time in their careers, or busy with school and part time work like myself. I do not feel this is an issue but I’m open to opinions on it if you few the need. I have seen a therapist a few years ago for some high school issue my mom felt I needed to talk to someone about. That was a good thing because I really like the man I spoke with but he deals with people under the age of 18. I tried two others near the end of high school but I did not resonate with them and it felt like a very  “cookie cutter” experience. 

Reason for Post:

I am reaching out today because I feel my mental health gets a little worse each day. I haven’t seen a therapist recently because my schedule seems to be too binding. 

I am fully online for school and I am doing well in 4/6 of my classes. My course load feels quite heavy because I learn well in “in-person” classes. I am struggling with time management, despite my continual attempts to write out and schedule my school work, and understanding the material. I feel there are some parts to this: 1) I do not enjoy starting at a screen for hours on end for school and my job is outlet on my phone as well. 2) 3 of my prospers are at the university for research or graduate studies so teaching isn’t the main reason why they are there (which is common at big state universities). 3) Because I am online, I am at home saving money for rent for the upcoming semester, given that our classes are in person. 

I would like to reach out and ask if there is any specific  medical profession or therapy you guy would recommend? I do not know what to call these professions other than therapy but I do not know what to exactly search for to get some professional help. 

I write this as I find it hard to talk to my loved ones about this because I feel vulnerable if I did. I know it’s the stereotypical male complex to bottle up feelings and push forward without figuring out my issues. 

I would really appreciate suggestions regarding which medical practice to seek. I would also love it if anyone has ideas on things I can work on from at home such as mediation, organization, or anything that has worked for you within the comfort of your own space. 

TL;DR 

I am seeking any guidance for what professional practice to talk to or any “at home” remedies to help ease my depression and anxiety a little bit. 

I am sorry if my post is slightly incoherent; I needed a brain dump to just finally reach out to the wonderful world of the internet.  Thank you for taking the time to read and offer help. I really appreciate it. My DM’s are open if you don’t feel comfortable sharing publicly.",15Oct2020,1

Or he refuses to use plates and chopping boards so he dirtys counters tops and tables with his food. Like chopping onion on the counter top and refusing to clean it etc. Because... dishes.

my mom started talking about the dog, and eventually the dog my uncle came up, she said she has always found my uncles dog scary because he was unpredictable. i answered and said ''  he wasn't that bad I would say he was playful. I have experienced worse, but with my little sister I understand that you found it scary ''.

my stepdad reacted to that saying that i just should acknowledge her feeling, and that i was not really listening. this is a discussion we have had alot

to keep this short, the conclusion of the argument, that i never think emotionaly but always, idk if the word rational is the best word, logically, factually not thinking emotionally

i dont really know  what i am/what i need. i do feel like i have emotions, i have been \`\`diagnosed\`\` with an extremely high IQ what commenly makes EQ suffer (emotional smartness) i dont like the words  highly intelligent, i dont know what i am anymore if im sociapathic or a bad person overall

I thought I had a good plan. I was going to school to become an art teacher after New years but then I told my family, and they thought it was a dumb idea, which makes me think it's a dumb idea.

And now I'm so unsure. I can't go the academic way, that'd drive me insane, I can't take care of my chronic illness if I get a job in a factory. And now my plan is dumb. I want to apply for art school, but they only want contemporary art. I do surrealism and that's about 100 years too old.

With the current state of the world, I feel so unmotivated and uninspired. I can't think about a future now that the future of humanity is so uncertain.

Quick background, if it's useful for anyone: I'm a male in my mid-20s heterosexual, living in australia.

So I guess I'll start where I'm at now and add context, I'm depressed and have pretty bad anxiety wreck, I live with my dad and I've recently (ish) gotten over it enough to speak to people at shops, and can leave my house without having bad panic attacks but otherwise I struggle to hold conversation with people I don't know well when not intoxicated in one way or another, it's worse with women, I struggle to talk to eveen the women I feel close with, with the sole exception of my mum.  


About \~5 maybe 6 years ago I went to my doctor and was very adimmant I wouldn't talk to anybody, he reluctantly perscribed me some drug that was supposed to be both an anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medication, 1 week in and I ended up overdosing on about a 2 weeks supply at oncee, apparently I shat myself and pissed all over the floor, I was delirous for several days but eventually became lucid again, to this day I don't reeally know what happened but I've not spoken to dad about that since. Afteer this episode I went back to my doctor, finally feeeling like talking to someone would be the only way, he forwarded me to some kind of mental health expert, I'm not sure whether it was a psychologist or a therapist or what. In any case I had a very bad experience, they bought out things but I couldn't handle them and this causeed me to spiral out a bit, I lost maybee a year to pretty substantial drug and alcohol abuse after that, a lot of that year I don't really remember at all, I know I overdose on some kind of amphetamine at least once, but never went to the hospital and again eventually I sobered up and despitee a feew fragmented memories of wigging out I don't really know what happeneed, eventually I dropped the harder drugs (more from broken friendships, lost contacts and no money than an intentional decision) and began smoking marijuana and drinking instead, the weed stopped me from drinking too much because I'd just spew it back up so I at least have some memory of the time after, eventually though my tolerance grew that I could drink plenty without it mmattering, and eventually the weed slowed and I beegan drinking more and more, that continued up until this year and is still ramping up. I'vee been leaving the house more, but only to buy necessities + alcohol &amp; cigarettes, and I still struggle to talk to most people. When I first start leaving the house it felt like there was change like after a while I could talk to people and though it was hard and I tended to tremble in public when sober atleast I could work my wway through it, but that plateaud  and now I feel stuck.  


I've been wanting to post this for months, longer but it's takeen this long to write this up even on a throwaway account and even then I've had to drink just to force myself to say \*sommeething\* about it, even if it amounts to nothing.  


So I guess I don't know what to do, I wwant to change but I don't know how, I can't bring myself to go back to the doctor, to see another therapist or psychologist, bring myself to talk to my friends about this, even when I'm drunk it took such a long time to work up the couragee to speak to completee strangers even with anonimity. I try to eat healthy, I try to excercise and even things as simple as being in the sun more or drinking more wwater but at the end of the day nothiing seems to change and I can't help but go back to drinking all night and just pretending not to be hungover to dad. I've lost all my hopes of long-term plans, I don't even know what keeps me here apart from mmy fear that the accumulative brain-damage caused by my repeated half-assed attempts at suicide are making it harder and hardeer for me to live a normal life.  


I don't expect anyonee here has any answers for me, or eveen if they do that I would have the ability to accept them and follow through but I guess if nothing else then I've beeen able to get part of this out of my head so thanks for that I for whatever it's worth. Anyway, I should probably go to bed, it's getting light. Deepeending on how I'm feeling when I wake up I might comme back to this, but I don't know whether I could work myself up to do this twice.",15Oct2020,1
215,"My best friend is 16 y/o and a female. I have been with her for six years. A few months ago she told me and a few other close friends she was raped when she was about 6 or 8 y/o in a refugee camp. She didn’t tell her family. Of course this shocked me. But we were all said that if she needs anything she can talk to us. An other friend and her talked on FaceTime and i was not there. I was not there for my best friend, i feel so bad. I wasn’t there when she needed me the most. I found out two days later that they talked. TWO DAYS. AM I STUPID. WHAT HOW COULD I NOT.... anyway..

A week ago she told us she found a video on her family friends phone where he was undressing her in her sleep. FUCKING DISGUSTING, SHE IS 16 AND SHE WAS ASLEEP. Again we were all shocked and helped her in anyway we could. She didn’t tell her family. She said she felt gross and said that maybe he thought she asked for it. SHE WAS REALLY THINKING THA-... of course we were all like wtf- in what way would he think that you wanted it. We told her she was not asking for it and she is not gross or disgusting, he is. We talked for a bit and she left to get some fresh air. After a few minutes she didn’t respond. We were all scared something happened because that man was still in her house. Later that same friend from before said that she messaged her and she is save.

Why didn’t she message me? Im i not her best friend anymore? Am i just a friend now? Is she still hung up about that i wasn’t there when she needed me? I feel like I’m being replaced a little bit. Maybe I’m just thinking about it to much. 

I don’t have a lot of friends and i love her so much and I couldn’t take it if she leaves me. We already lost friends because they hurt her and of course I chose her easily. If she would jump of a bridge so would I. But now I’m scared i’ll say something wrong and she’ll hate me. 

I hope she won’t leave me and get angry at me for being jealous.

One time 3 people had a secret among themselves and i wanted to know so i asked whats the secret? They said they cant tell me. I asked if it was about me. They said that i wouldn’t know the person. So why wont you tell me then? I felt left out. Turns out one of my friends sister had a boyfriend.... you couldn’t even trust me with that secret? What? I don’t even know her family.

I think I’m just to insecure but i feel like they think they don’t trust me.

217,"Hi. im u/Bubbleking01. ima 17yr boy. since 14 ive been struggling with my body (i always felt a bit fat compared to the others in the class or friends), or how i look, never feeling satisfied with how i look, and ultimately resulting in bad selv-image and confidence. all the kids would go down to the beach and swim, and i never felt comfy doing it because of how i looked. i was never the athletic type, sports never really interest me, other than badminton but that was mostly for the social aspect of it. through the ages 14-16 i hated how i looked and would complain and cry to my parents about how i look, and i always got the same answer ""then just do something about it"" which at the time was really frustrating to listen to, cuz i felt like they didnt understand and i really didnt think what they said helped. suddenly Corona came around and the start of the this year. i where i live all the schools were shut down and classes were virtual, so i would wake up, do my homework. and then lay in bed all day watching netflix(brooklyn 99 was my jam!) feeling sorry for myself, and just not doing anything. than our PE teacher gave us a challenge, to run as much as we could, and the winner would get a prize. so i thought to myself, ""hey imma do this, and imma fucking win"". now keep in mind that i was never in very good shape at least not in my opinion. so the next day before anyone had even started i went on a 5k run(not a good idea for the first time ;) ), when i came home i felt like trash, but i knew it was for a something good a bigger goal, not only the ""prize"" but ultimately for myself. so i ran every other day for the next week of quarantine, as people from my class found out how to cheat and get higher onthe scoreboard, i gave up. i didnt see a point if i was gonna lose. so i dipped again, into the netflix and the self-doubt. one day i thought ""what if after every episode of the netflix show i went down and di 20 push-ups"". so thats what i did. and i slowly built a tolerance and routine for it, but after a week or two i quickly got tired, and needed something new. so i ws scrolling through Tiktok, and saw this guy doing ""easy at home ab workout"" so i took a couple exercises from that, as my stomach was what i always hated, and i had a bit of a belly, still do! so i slowly put that ab workout things into the usual pushups. and i felt good, i did that up to the summer holiday, where i went to meet up with some friends on the beach, feeling pretty good about myself, i also did some training before i went down to the beach just to look a little more puffed up and buff. so i met with my friends, who i felt comfortable with. we hung out played some football on the beach, had a good time. then one of them says a couple of other people from the year were also coming down to join in. this is when my anxiety kicked in bout my look and how i look. they came down at to beach, and one of the girls i am really close with, we are really good friends, and she told me afterwards how shocked people were seeing me, i usually always wear big t shirts, cuz of my stomach. so they were shocked to see my and what i look like, i had lost weight, both from the running, basketball which i played with friends and the pushups etc. i look pretty good and that point. and since that the pushups and basketball, have evolved into a  **Calisthenics** routine, and better food. 

and now i am happy with my body, i know it was a bit of a jump, but whatever you are struggling with

i know it sounds dumb but ""do something about it!"" and it does get better. if it has for me, i will for you. trust me

219,"i f16 have been struggling with mental illness since i was 11. all i remember is getting diagnosed at 11 and my doctor recommended medication and my mom said no. then at the same age my mom thought my depression was due to a thyroid issue as i had just started puberty. she took me to get blood work done and the place was closed and she never went back. that was the last time she had ever tried to help.

i think my parents are in denial, still. my mom also struggles with mental health which is why i also dont understand why they wont help me. my dad ""doesnt believe in mental illness"" despite having diagnosed anxiety. my mom also has diagnosed depression and ptsd.

i have a lot of issues and i need therapy, ive known this for a long time. but mental health really isnt a discussion in my house, even though my mom says i can tell her anything i feel like she always dismisses it bc her problems are worse than mine in her eyes. the times i do end up opening up nothing gets done. my mom told me she would ask my doctor about anxiety meds over 2 years ago and still hasnt. my mom told me she would try to get me into therapy way over a year ago after i had the longest depressive episode of my life and the most she did was call one place in summer 2019, and they never called her back.

it's like they just ignore the obvious signs when im in a depressive episode and they even make fun of it. my mom ignores it until she feels bad for me after ive not left my bed and barely eaten in days. but she never does anything to help me. my dad will just make jokes about how i sleep all day or how i never get up. and when my legs or back hurt from barely moving in days he'll guilt trip me about it because it's  ""my fault."" one day when i was in 7th grade i had the worst panic attack of my life and i passed out and 2 days later my mom was joking about it at the dinner table.

Have been dying to get out of this supported accommodation for as long as I've been here, there's just issues after issues. Before I got pregnant I lived with my mum and my brother, the household was very abusive and as a result shouting and screaming makes my brain shut down. The neighbors are constantly screaming at eachother like they're all being murdered and this makes my day to day life very difficult, especially trying to be in the right frame of mind for my baby.

I yelled to try and get his attention and see if he needed any water or something from inside and he didn’t respond. I moved closer to him and saw he had flies all over him. I got a bad feeling and went inside to ask the cashier. She said people had been telling her about him all day but we went inside this morning and bought alcohol and she thought he was just passed out drunk. He had apparently been in the same spot for a the entire day and hadn’t moved. I went back outside and around the building to where he was and tried to get his attention again and saw he already had a hospital band on his arm. He was bleeding and not moving at all and completely unresponsive. I called 911 and told him and they told me to try and get his attention so at this point I’m screaming SIR? ARE YOU OKAY? And I get no response. At one point I saw his hand twitch but that was it. I told them he didn’t appear to be breathing, if he was it was very shallow, and he had flies on him and hadn’t moved all day. She said that someone was coming immediately. She got my name and number and told me to go home. I’m hoping the hand twitch meant something but I don’t know. I just had a bad feeling. My city has passed out people on the streets and stuff pretty frequently but this was different. I hope he’s not dead and just passed out but I don’t know I’ve never seen anyone just passed out like that and the flies? Idk.

Found this good video on the influence of diet on mental health, especially depression. It's very interesting how our gut health has such a big impact on our mental state - most of our serotonin being stored in the gut.  

Lactobacillus reuteri supplementation improved mental health in some studies :

Also deficiencies in Omega 3 Fatty Acids could lead to mental health imbalances, so increase omega 3 intake. Magnesium and Vitamin D also seem to have a role in mental health.

225,"I hate people. They want me to go and tell them how I feel and they tell me that im not alone, cool. But, when you tell them these problems they naturally start giving advice. When they give this advice they're shocked to find out that that advice doesn't help, in fact, every piece of advice I've been given has been stuff I've already thought about, and no, I'm not trying to act smart. Then they regret even trying to help me, did they really try tho?, and so they get frustrated when I'm the one who's frustrated over you thinking you could magically fix my issues. You don't really listen either, I didn't want you to tell me what to do in the first place and I never look forward to hearing your false hopes, so don't get mad at me for not being grateful. 

Grateful for what exactly? Waste of time? You're the one who wanted me to pipe up so I did. I already know what my problem is, I'm too busy stuck in my own head or how my parents put it ""You don't seem to care about anyone else"" and ""you act so selfish and hateful."" Thank you, I'll take that to my grave mixed in with all the other helpful anecdotes over the years. 

Hating people is a very new mindset for me, I used to never hate people, actually, I used to love people. Person makes mistake? Good, we all make mistakes; that means that person will learn from it and it also makes me, a very imperfect person, look better too. No, not anymore. I have less and less tolerance for it, especially from myself. 

When people hear you say you hate people they suspect you're some kind of narcissist. Not even close, I hate myself more than anyone and everyone from anywhere around the world no matter what time in history. People say they want to live in another person's shoes, I want someone to live in mine. Not as in my life sucks but because they would do better with it and would enjoy it more. I've wasted my life as an educated suburban, white, male, cisgendered, straight person. You'd think with all of this privilege that I would atleast have something to my name. At the end of the day, I'm ignore, accused of being something I'm not like an Incel or some shit, taken advantage of, and then I'm by myself all alone doing nothing but pathetically scrolling through Reddit. 

I have my parents though! I can't be alone if I have parents in the same household! Yay! Yknow strangely enough my dad reminds me of his and my mom's mortality a whole lot more than I would've liked. It's cool though, they seem to already see me as an uncaring person so why should it matter? Why should it matter that I'm 17 and hate thinking about the future much less tomorrow. There's no reason for me to still be here besides the possibility of an unsuccessful suicide attempt which will just make life even more unbearable. ""Oh, b-but dude, do you know about all these other people with worse problems than you? You should really stop being so self-centered."" It's crazy to think that I still love the idea of having a soul mate even though I won't have one. ""But what does a 17 year old know?"" Stop, stop giving me false hope. 

Out of everything I mentioned, false hope has to be the most painful for me because its like I failed at getting something that wasn't even there. No, more like failed at getting a stupid fucking carrot on a stick that you keep dangling in front of me and when I try to get it it slips out of my grasp as you yank away from me. In the future that carrot will still be there taunting me. Seriously, how can I go back to all of those motivational quotes and say they were wrong after the fact? Wouldn't matter anyway I guess. I just hate people, I hate your positive messages like ""its going to get better"" when it won't, atleast not for some. Idk maybe if you're lucky, but when I call out on your bs other people come in and tell me how toxic I am or how cringey my reply was and how repulsed you are by me. 

First of all, you could never treat me worse than the way I treat myself. Second, I have nothing to complain about, I don't understand why the fuck I'm angry and no I'm not about to self-diagnose myself as being depressed or whatever because I'm not. I'm just fucked up. 

I've said my peace now please leave me alone so I don't have to go through another scary episode. That's right, I'm scared. Yeah, I'm a worthless whiny bitch, I get it. Even more reason to just let me be. This isn't towards anyone here, you all are just fine.

The fact that people can just shrug it off when they hear that their friend is depressed is a problem.  The fact that (some) healthcare providers just nonchalantly prescribe SSRIs for depression without delving deep into their patient's psyche, memories, motivations and desires is a problem.

In my opinion, **depression is the worst possible thing that can happen to someone**.  Being diagnosed with terminal cancer, contracting AIDS, even losing all of your limbs for whatever reason are all better fates that depression because **while afflicted with those conditions, you still have the possibility of experiencing positive emotional states**.  **When you're truly depressed, there is no chance of feeling anything meaningful, joyful or good, and that is a fate worse than death.**  Of course, those conditions suck ass and increase the likelihood of developing depression.

i feel like i'm a bit anxious. i can't function in large groups of people, it's too overwhelming.

my friends know about this, some of them say i am depressed, but we're all 16 year olds with no psychological degree haha. my parents don't know about my mental state because i'm worried they wouldn't understand. last december i cried every fucking day for like 2 or 3 weeks. mom noticed that, and she was there for me. few months later it was sunday, round 8 pm and i was playing mc. she said that i should be studying and if i get an f that she wouldn't comfort me like she did in december. so i gave up on the idea of telling her all this.

i'm not suicidal tho. i don't particularly want to exist rn, but i don't want to kms.

Here's the situation. I have several small pets and sometimes one of them will have an empty water bowl or a piece of poop on the floor. I try to refill and clean them ASAP but sometimes life gets in the way and it takes me a few hours to get around to it. I keep my pets in a room that's visible from front door. I'm scared that someone look through my front door when I answer it, see a water bowl that's empty or see a cage with some poop in it and report me to animal control. Animal control will seize all of my pets and euthanize them. Then the police will arrive and arrest me for neglecting them. 

I've been having vivid daydreams about killing myself. In one I'm standing in my kitchen and cutting into my arm from elbow to wrist with a steak knife. In the other I'm sitting on my bed with my eyes closed and a pistol in my mouth. I haven't told my mental health worker because I'm afraid she's going to think I'm actively suicidal, call the cops and they'll see the empty bowls or poop. Then I'll get arrested after my trip to the psych ward. 

I have a young daughter who throws toys everywhere. I'm afraid that someone will see how messy my house is through the front door and call CPS. I'm afraid CPS will see an empty pet bowl or poop and call animal control on me. What is wrong with me? This fear started out as an occasional what if thought (I have what if thoughts about random stuff all day every day) and it has turned into something I'm afraid of every single day of my life. What the hell is wrong with me?",15Oct2020,1
239,"I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I wasn’t ever a ‘social butterfly’, don’t feel like I ever had friends or people who liked me besides members of my family. And that’s literally my only goal in life. To have a friend, to be happy.

But recently I noticed this pattern if one wanted to call it that. I’m really bad at upholding social relationships. Even if it’s just calling another person or texting them because I want to ask them how they are, I won’t do it. I won’t take the first step, so in most cases I just do nothing. Even if they are family members. It’s so, so hard to actually text back or call them. 

Example: My cousin has moved to the region I live in and has expressed interest in meeting up once in a while. He’s great and I like him a lot and want to meet him but... he’s not like me, he’s busy, he has friends, a girlfriend and we don’t have any particular ‘bond’, we only see each other a few times a year, so we aren’t exactly close.

Maybe I should reach out to him but can’t bring myself to even ask him over text. Because I feel like a nuisance. And I don’t know how to talk to people. I’m just awkward and always second guessing everything I think or say. It doesn’t feel right. And it’s exhausting and draining.

I know I’m pushing people away with this and I know I am a terrible person but everything social is always so overwhelming to me. Like all other people are moving at twice my speed and I cannot possibly keep up. Maybe it’s because I’m a boring person. I don’t have cool hobbies, I can’t tell jokes, I hurt people’s feelings easily without even knowing I did, I’m not particularly smart either and know nothing about how the world works. 
And I won’t take action until someone pushes me. 

I don’t know why staying in contact with people is so hard for me. I don’t mean to ghost anyone. I care about other people and their feelings. Or at least I choose to think so. I would like to not be that person. I would like to be able to talk to people how others do. It seems so easy for them, while I seem to avoid having to interact with other people for as long as people. 

But maybe it’s better that way. All people I know have their own social circle. They would be fine even I didn’t exist. Maybe they would be even better off. Without me making things awkward and not texting back.

243,"[Discussion] shoulder injury

Shoulder injury

I don’t really know where to start I’ve just been feeling down about an injury I have to my shoulder and thought writing down some of what I’ve been going through might help a bit. Last year I had been going to physio all year cause my shoulder was bothering me it kind of helped but my shoulder wasn’t healing up so after about 8 months of physio I decided to rest and get an ultrasound. The ultrasound showed that I had inflammation in my ac joint and my doctor recommended I get a cortisone shot. Fast forward a month the cortisone shot didn’t help and I felt quite annoyed because I couldn’t play basketball properly (I was looking to walk on to my university bball team) or do any kind of working out with my upper body. At this point I’ve basically lost all the muscle I had in my upper body which took a toll on my self esteem especially since it was summer and I was now 6 foot 2 and only 160 pounds. I went to my doctor again and requested an mri. It ended up taking about 3 and a half months to get my mri because Canada has ridiculous wait times. This was another 3 and a half months of not being able to do much in terms of activity with my upper body which is quite saddening for me. About a week ago I got these mri results back and it says I have suspected partial separation of my labrum and now have to go for another mri arthrogram to accurately asses my injury. My doctor is going to get back to me within the next week on the wait time for this mri but I just feel very down because this now most likely means that I have to wait even longer just to get a proper diagnosis. I know my problem is very minor compared to a lot of people out there but I was just feeling quite sad so I decided to write this.",15Oct2020,1

I’ve been through this before so I know I can occupy time on my phone, reading, writing, drawing, word searches.... I’m thinking maybe TV on my phone but not sure the battery can handle that and of course the charging cords are with the nurses.

Anything else? There isn’t much patient interaction due to COVID. And I’m not super interested in sitting alone in the common area hoping somebody will eventually come up and say hi.

I’m on constant observation at the moment and it’s making it harder. It feels weird doing anything with a person sitting by the door watching me.",15Oct2020,1
247,"I apologize if this seems all over the place. There's just a lot of shit in my head and quite frankly, I don't ever talk about this stuff except with one person so I don't know how to properly express it without it being all over the place yet. 

I have been extremely lonely my entire life and have a lot of emotional trauma from my childhood. Thankfully I was never physically or sexually harmed but the neglect has absolutely taken it's toll on me. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get along well with kids at school through middle school, but at high school my life improved but once it ended my life really just fell off a cliff.

I wanted a more supportive environment, so I finally moved out of my home to live with my partner at 19 and it's now a little over a year later. In terms of personal freedom and my ability to just breathe and be myself, it is the best thing I have ever done.  But holy shit, economically, it is probably going to be the worst decision I've ever made in my life. I am currently paying for vision therapy on top of rent and college to solve some longstanding issues I had no idea were even related to my eyes and I'll be done with that in March 2021. I really need mental health help NOW, but I can't afford it, straight up. I can't stop this therapy and prioritize mental health either, because if I do that, then my eye condition can actually get worse. Thankfully, the eye condition is very related to the anxiety so it should help quite a bit. Strange, huh? Amazing how everything in our bodies all works together and coordinates.

Anyways, so... what do I deal with now that I'm on my own? Every single day I worry. I feel lifeless. I've had shit self esteem for a long time, I recently found a paragraph I wrote about myself when I was 11 that was seriously disturbing for someone that age to say (the feelings of worthlessness are unbelievable for an 11 year old to say. Even I was shocked at myself for writing such a thing about myself).  I go on my phone or computer the entire day, if I don't, racing thoughts come at me like absolute wildfire and I soon find myself checking online to find the answers. I have absolutely no substance or anything without computers in my life. I want to get away, but the anxiety is just fucking murderous. This kind of behavior makes my emotions kind of cycle, though admittedly, my emotional health has taken a fat shit and I barely even feel anything anymore. I feel a weird separation, in addition to the eye coordination issues that kinda exacerbate this (everything looks flat bc my 3d vision isn't that good), I almost feel like I'm watching my life as opposed to occupying the space in my own body. It's like watching my life come out on a tv screen. I operate like a robot and say whatever is best for the person I am currently speaking to. I feel like I don't even know myself anymore everything just feels BAD. I don't know what I am or what I've turned myself into trying to take the easy route with my anxiety / difficulty socializing. It hurts a lot. 

I have no long term goals (which I'm sure is a huge %age of my problems) other than I want to get better at cooking and I want to stop feeling weak. I'm an accounting major and I seriously don't give a shit, I work at Best Buy at the Geek Squad and I really do enjoy helping people there. I would much rather pursue a career in IT using the customer service skills I've learned here (after some certifications) after  I've signed up for a gym and started to do some basic lifts, bodyweight stuff, and cycling, and man I feel AWESOME after a workout, I just really need to work on my diet to make it count and cut the shit foods out! 

I feel like I'm finally going in the right direction. I am now attempting to eat better, I know it won't be perfect from the word go, same with my experiences at the gym. My eye therapy is about a month in, and I have 5 more to go. The other day, I did an exercise there and for about a minute afterwards, I felt completely normal, it felt more like I was present in the room. It was the strangest sensation... but if this is what this therapy is going to cause then I'm super excited what I'll be like at the end of this! I'm a little confused on what to do with the socialization thing, I get along well with people, but I am terrified of trying to take friendships further than what is kinda automatic (think, people at school and work that you wouldn't otherwise see outside without extra effort). My super ridiculous anxiety is also an issue, and it makes it hard day to day to stick to trying to better myself because I just feel a constant push to check and check and go online to find answers and get reassurance. 

I just wanted to make this post to vent, not really ask for anything. I know I need to get mental health help but I just flat out cannot afford it right now, especially with the extra expense of my vision therapy until March. I will definitely be trying to find someone as soon as I am completely healed from my eye coordination problems. It's really hard being in charge of myself while at odds with this anxiety, but I WILL win, I am not letting this thing steal my life and youth from me any more.",15Oct2020,1

I have a very low self esteem as a result of bullying (about my appearance) by my old friendship group and as a result I’m incredibly reserved and have developed symptoms of social anxiety disorder which I have been displaying for probably two years now. 

A year ago I moved to a new area and so a new school and have struggled to make any friends. I’d sit in the corner of all of my classes and not interact with anyone. If the spotlight is on me, I feel like my appearance is being judged and I just want to hide away. I’ve started to sit with some people at lunch instead of sitting on my own but I struggle to be myself around them. I’m still really quiet and struggle socially which makes me think they’ll get bored of me and a potential friendship will just fizz out.

The issue is that I’m not actually a quiet person. Around my old friends I’d talk a lot, when I get home I end up talking constantly at my parents because I’ve bottled everything up in the day. I feel happy and energised after a social interaction which implies I’m an extrovert but the anxiety I experience before and within a conversation leads me to try and avoid them.

253,"I tried my first antidepressant with fluoxetine (Prozac) (20mg) around three weeks ago and I decided to speak with my doctor on Tuesday about stopping them. I had severe side effects, to the point where I basically couldn’t function over the course of those two and a half weeks, but my doctor seemed really hesitant and said I was ‘giving up’ and they should have started to clear up soon. 

I was on the meds for extreme up and down mood swings, where I’d have spend a week extremely high, then a week extremely low (for more detail you can look in my post history). Within three days of getting in those meds my mood was straight up. Then down. Then up. I have been switching everyday or two ever since I’ve been on them, going from extremely out of it and up (to the point where people questioned if I was on drugs), then literally waking up the next day wanting to die. 

On top off all this I had issues with clumsiness, balance and spacial awareness, racing thoughts to the point I can’t think, zero concentration or motivation, severe constant dissociation (to the point where I couldn’t control my own body), extreme tiredness and the inability to stay away when tired (I’ve never napped in my life and now I can’t stop), not to mention problems with my memory where I’ve forgotten what I’ve just wrote or in the middle of a conversation or even sending 30+ audio messages and having no recollection of what I’ve sent. I’ve also experienced weakness, weird dreams, diarrhoea, dry mouth, unusual sweating, and generally feeling weak and lightheaded with headaches. Also extremely bad tremors in my hands and jaw whenever I got stressed/anxious/dissociated. Overall I had pretty much every side effect you can think of, on top of my crazy mood. 

I had a breakdown in collage Monday morning where I cried for three hours and had my first panic attack in months. All of my friends and mental health team at college were telling me I had to go back to the doctor - I was completely apathetic about everything, couldn’t do any work, and was consistently having breakdowns and severe dissociative episodes. I’ve never experienced suicidal ideation like it (and unfortunately relapsed last night with self harm after 7 months). 

My doctor was extremely hesitant to let me give up however. I don’t have a diagnosis, was not weaned on or off the meds, and he spoke as though I was pathetic for not being able to just push through it, saying the side effects should wear off after a week or two (despite being nearly at week three with them only getting worse). 

Half the people around me think I should have gone and my doctor is being unprofessional, but some people think I gave up too easy and should have just pushed through it. I honestly don’t know whether I was in the right or not by stopping. Am I being pathetic for not being able to take the expected side effects?

Then she explained to me that if I don’t willingly go with her, she’ll contact law enforcement and have them hospitalize me regardless. I’m scared of police too.

After I was panicking for a minute or two, she eventually proposed a ‘safety plan’ so I wouldn’t have to be hospitalized. Basically it involves me messaging her daily, or she’ll send somebody to me to make sure I’m okay and possibly hospitalize me.

People always make it out to be like there's an easy solution to your problems, I still get asked if I wash my face because I have acne, like, yes, believe it or not I do wash my face everyday twice a day and have since I was eight, I've also tried thousands of dollars worth of face washes, toners, serums, creams, face masks, and even prescriptions both oral and topical.

It sucks, it's like admitting defeat but there's only so much time, money, and effort you can put into something before it consumes you.

Today it was work (ongoing theme) and my doctor (one of them) that made me feel like this. I was so happy to have started this job in March, decent pay, kind coworkers, and in my field, then we had a change in management and it honestly feels like they are trying to get us all to quit now. I applied for an office job, I was supposed to work at a set site, have my own private space to work out of that had decent ergonomics, benefits such as your own parking spot, a staff kitchen, and a staff washroom and the security of always having team members around and being able to kick unruly clients out of the office if they were becoming aggressive. Now, during the middle of the freaking pandemic, we've become outreach workers and spend half our time in shelters and soup kitchens. I'm a petite woman with RA (so I'm very weak) and I'm in the men's shelter, I wouldn't feel safe there even if I was perfectly healthy and covid didn't exist. I hate driving and suddenly a major part of my job is driving to all these different sites. There's no washroom for staff, no space to eat, no microwave, no fridge, no kettle or coffee maker, you don't have the authority to ask the men who get aggressive or don't wear masks to leave, you don't have the safety of having other staff around. It's scary enough when someone goes off at you in the office, now I'm expected to deal with this in a room removed from everyone else.

Since I have RA I identified early on that being expected to carry equipment around and sit in a folding chair for hours on end would be a problem for me. I asked if there was any way we could get a better chair in the space, not specifically for me, I might be in more pain than my coworkers if I don't have an ergonomic set up but folding chairs are hard on my coworkers too. When I was asked why I was asking for that I mentioned my RA and my new supervisor made a big deal out of it, said I'd have to get my doctor to fill out forms so that they could provide such an accommodation. HR sent me the forms and they don't really say anything about accommodations it's all about returning to work after an accident or injury, I mentioned this to them but they assured me that's the form I needed. I didn't think too much of it, I sort of worshiped my RA doctor, so knowledgeable, so nice, suffers from RA herself so she understands it, she had told me if there was anything I ever needed, whether that be medication or something for work, to just let her know, so while I hated that work was making a big deal out of getting a proper chair I thought my doctor would still help me. However, when I asked she started telling me about all this other paperwork she has to do and that she doesn't really feel comfortable filling out forms like this because it asks about how much you can lift and how long you can walk/sit/stand etc. and that's not something she measures or tests, she said she could probably write me a note but I'd asked HR about that and they insisted upon these forms. She said she'd send me for more tests and once she got those results would take a look at the papers to see what she could fill out. Now though I feel like an idiot because here I was going through this whole procedure, meeting with the supervisor, meeting with HR, booking off work for this appointment (and now these tests) and now it sounds like my doctor won't support me with this so I feel like I'm going to come across as a liar to my employer. I wish I had never brought any of this up because the moment I mentioned this situation to my doctor she went from warm, caring, and understanding to cold, dismissive, and almost demeaning. 

I don't understand why me trying to do something to lessen my pain and therefore make me more productive at work has to be such a big and difficult process. I just don't want to suffer more than I already am or further ruin my body or catch covid and die because my immune system is already compromised. Now I feel like I'm gong to have to suffer anyway and I've jeopardized my relationship with my doctor and employer.

All I've ever wanted from life is to be healthy and happy with a small place of my own a few close friends and some kids with a job that could support that sort of life and wasn't soul sucking. I was closer to achieving this as an infant than I am now.",15Oct2020,1

269," I've built so much hate against school that when I even think about it I get so stressed the next day I get sick.

Whenever I don't get sick my EDS acts up and my joints start hurting so I can't move without being in indescribable amounts of pain. This COVID-19 shit is fucking up my life. At least last year I was able to make it to school and just go to the nurse. Now everythings fucked.

I honestly don't know what to do I spend more time having mental breakdowns about school than actually doing it then I have a mental breakdown about having a mental breakdown about missing school.",15Oct2020,1

271,"I wished you could understand me 
I wished I can tell you about my mind and you understand me and undedstand how I feel 

Some days I'm happy like I'm on cloud 9 
Some days I go on binges; drinking smoking amd snorting new things to feel again 
Some days I can't even get out of bed to take shower and care for me 
Some days I cry with a heavy heart
Some days I just don't feel nothing 
Some days I don't even wanna be here anymore 
Some days I wanna scream and yell 
Some days I'm mad and angry at the world and god for the way I am 
Some days I just wanna have some control over my mind 
But mostly some days I dont even recognized myself 
Like I dont know who I am 

But I can't tell you that can i? 
I wanna scream and cry it out n tell you but I cant. As I know it isnt your fault you just wouldnt get it Hell who would i barly get it myself 

I told you I have a appointment and you tell me I don't need the pills but how can u tell me what I need when you dont know whats going on in my head I can't stop the thoughts ive had some close calls and almost vanished 

If anyone knew how bad it gets theyll call me crazy ive been called a liar and dramatic for trying to express it so I learned to keep it in but how long will that last 


I just wanna be normal 
I wanna be like other people 
I dont want the thoughts 
I dont want the feelings 
I dont want the dark nights and long days 

I'm tierd of using other stuff to either forget or to feel something 
 I just wished you could understand me and be there for me but you can't becouse you don't understand or been in the situation. its why you ask why I'm acting funny and ask why I have to get on the pills again. You think I'm switching up on you but I'm not 

If only you knew what actully goes on deep inside me  
Kinda funny becouse if you ask people who knows me im the happiest person in the room amd the funniest 
Thats because I make it a mission to make everyone smile at least once and laugh thats because I know what can actully happen behind close doors amd when your alone amd how people dont smile as much as they should 
Or maybe its because I wanna hide my hurt or maybe I'm just a nice person 

I just wished you could understand...",15Oct2020,1
272,"So...idk why i felt the need to tell strangers about it but maybe people have words of advice or anything really...
To put it frankly me and my friends would preform foreplay on eachother in the 3rd grade. 
This all started when i moved from california to Washington state for about a year, it was my first time experiencing a move as a little girl and i was scared and exited all at the same time. Me and my old brother were inrolled in a new elementary school that spring and it was their where i met a group of girls in my class. I kindve remember their names..but just for privacy reasons i wont put them. Their was 4 of us including me. We would talk everyday and we became very good friends, but one day one of the girls said that they read a page in a magazine for teens, somthing like ""how to be a good kisser in 4 steps"" so being curious we all wanted to practice on eachother in recess. This went on for a couple days, and along with that we would all go home ans serch pictures or videos of kissing on the internet. One day one of the girls came across lesbian porn and we wanted to try it... and from that day on every recess me and my friends would go to the girls bathroom stall (the big one meant for the disabled) we would preform oral sex on eachother. This went on up until i had to move. I never thought much of it but growing up i have always been such a sexual person. Even my boyfriend of 4 years cant keep up with me. I have to resort to other ways of relieving myself alone... i started watching porn since the age of 10 up until now, is that weird? I watch it almost every other day. Ive never talked about this to anyone in depth. I dont think im traumatized or nor does it make me feel horrible. Should I? Idk its weird. Maybe someone has input.",15Oct2020,1
273,"That part of me that nobody really knows and I may be even ashamed about, I've seperated from ""myself"" and act as if those thoughts and feelings are a seperate identity, and I don't associate with them at all other than letting it live in my head

 (I can't get rid of those sense/ view/ perspective of things but I'm aware they're toxic, hence 'living in my head') 


and talk to me (talking by willingly accepting that part of myself for a brief moment and talking in/ influenced by that sense/ view/ perspective of things)

I try not to let that part of me influence me at all but even as I try to seperate that part from myself, it is still me and it knows how to ""convince"" me to do what it wants because deep down, that is what I want. it sounds confusing but is really simple, and wonder if anyone does the same/ feel the same?",15Oct2020,1
274,"Hey all, so I experience what my wife calls ""frenzies."" When I'm overstimulated, or stressed, or sometimes for no reason, I enter a frenzied state. Here is an example:

Last night I was writing a paper, there was music on in the room, one of my sons wanted to play xbox, the other wanted to watch a movie, and both were trying to talk to me at the same time. Rather than help them in any reasonable way, I ended up *literally running around the house. I shuffled the xbox games around but never put one in the xbox. I opened disney+ but never ended up putting a movie on. And I was snappy with my boys, who had done absolutely nothing wrong. 

Sometimes I get these results if I am taking the trash out and my wife asks me to do some other small task. 

Sometimes it happens for basically no reason at all.

My family is supportive and doesn't make me feel bad about it. Other than a little bit of light hearted joking, but my boys are old enough to make a lot of life long memories, and I don't want them to remember me like this. 

Any suggestions? I have had depression issues in the past, but not clinical. I also saw a therapist as a child for a couple years but don't exactly remember why. Otherwise, totally clean mental health history and no drugs or alcohol ever. 

Thanks guys!!",15Oct2020,1
275,"I guess what I’m experiencing is a mixture of schadenfreude and morbid curiosity, but it bothers me a lot. I think it’s been exacerbated by quarantine—I find myself gravitating toward YouTube videos about terminal illness, hospice, dying children, etc and frankly, it disgusts me how I find other people’s pain...entertaining (for lack of a better word).",15Oct2020,1
276,"My procrastination is really, really extreme and I'm also recently starting to wonder if it might be a symptom of ADD. (+ For reference, I'm 16F and already struggling with social anxiety and an undiagnosed eating disorder)

With practically every exam or assignment I've had this year, I've procrastinated them until the very last minute - the morning of any exam, after pulling an all-nighter of doing nothing but browsing the internet, I'd just break down and beg my parents to let me stay home instead of having to face the exam, then after at least an hour of my parents giving me an angry speech about how disappointed they are in me and how this happens EVERY single time without fail, they usually cave in and let me stay home to study. 

You would think that after this I would learn my lesson and make sure to study before going back to school the next day but instead, I spend the entire day relaxed, knowing I now have the rest of the day to study, only to go back to extreme stress at around 10 pm when I still haven't studied at all, that stress again preventing me from even trying to study, even when I know that I would be able to do it if I really tried. This loop continues until the next week when I go back to school knowing I no longer need to take the exam since it's been over a week.

But I really do care about my grades. I feel extremely guilty every time this happens, and even while procrastinating instead of studying, the intense feeling of anxiety from the fact that I am not preparing for the test is constantly in my mind, yet for some reason, no matter how much I try, it's practically impossible for me to get around to actually doing it.

My parents started taking me to see a therapist about a month ago, but out of fear of being judged I decided not to mention the procrastination at all, instead deciding to talk about my social anxiety, another issue that is affecting my life, but a lot less serious than the procrastination. As a result, my therapist thinks I just have social anxiety without much else to be concerned about, when really, I have a LOT to be concerned about.

I used to think this was just extreme laziness and procrastination as a result, which it very well might be, I'm not sure, but after recently having a conversation with my friend who mentioned that she had ADD, I realized that my current issues are similar to her issues before she started treatment, which apparently made a great impact on her life. 

I'm starting to wonder if I should ask my parents to go get tested for it, since alongside procrastination, I have a couple of other symptoms - having trouble paying attention when others are speaking and forgetfulness, but nothing else. however, the thing is my parents are the typical Asian ones who don't have much belief in mental illness, and although they would probably let me get tested since it clearly is a problem at this rate, if I end up not having it, it's just going to become a confirmation to them that I'm just their lazy, useless child that keeps causing problems for them. I've considered talking to my therapist first, but I don't know how to integrate it into our sessions now that it's become basically entirely focused on social anxiety.

On top of this, the school is now demanding for answers to why I'm absent so often (my attendance has now reached below 50%), and if I don't get a diagnosis, I'll have no proper reason to provide to the school. My other mental issues are also factors, but I don't think they'd take my social anxiety seriously enough + I'm scared to get my ED diagnosed since I'm not at all ready for recovery. I'm really scared about getting expelled on top of being extremely stressed about everything, and I know this is a long read (if anyone even bothers to read it) but if anyone could give me some advice it would really be appreciated.",15Oct2020,1
