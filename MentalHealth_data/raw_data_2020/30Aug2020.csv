0,"9 months is by FAR the longest I’ve gone without self harming since I was 12. And yesterday I fucking ruined it. Well, I didn’t, my anxiety did. Or maybe it was me. I don’t even know.
My anxiety makes me vomit, so when I start feeling anxious I stop eating, and eat when my anxiety eases. 
No food in my stomach = no content to come back up. Well. My anxiety never eased, so I ended up starving myself. That was my first form of relapsing. Then everything just fucked up and I ended up disappointing and upsetting my loved ones. Then depression came in and made everything worse. It’s so hard when you can’t stop the shaking, the crying, the fever, the dizziness, the heart pounding and the bad thoughts. It’s so hard to stop the self harming thoughts when you’ve already got your eyes on a sharp object and a feeling that you’re nothing but a waste of life. So I did it. And I’m so sorry. And I’m so disappointed in myself. 
I’m sorry for venting. I just needed to get it out of my system.",30Aug2020,1

2,"Hello, so I’ve been referred to a psychologist, but it seems my sessions in October are bound to be over the phone. I am entirely uncomfortable with the idea of of this. I’m worried I’m being an arse for wanting to decline this and may be refused help in the future because of it. I’ll find out on Monday when I call them to say so; but wanted some other opinions. Thanks. :)",30Aug2020,1
3,"Hey guys I get paranoid sometimes but I heard like a man and a woman talking and it sounds like it could be my neighbors but it was like 3am. They might have been yelling at their teenage son but my mom cant hear them in the video and I would rather not go to a mental hospital. So please tell me you can hear it, I even added in the middle where I think a man says ""no matter what"". But I need to turn my volume up to 100% to hear it since its faint and ignore the white noise.

4,"Hello everyone,

This is my first time posting here, so I’m sorry in advance if this subreddit is not the right place to post these kinds of problems. If it is not, I’d be glad you let me know on what sub I should post this.

About 3 weeks ago, I was having a conversation with friends about weird things that happened to us during our childhood. Most people see their childhood as the moment they enjoyed the most with their lives. And they are probably right. No issues to think about all day, no 9 to 5 jobs, everybody is taking care of everything for you. But for some odd reason, I remember my childhood (from 3 to 8 years old at least) as something kind of terrifying. I haven’t been assaulted or anything as a kid, nothing like this happened to me at all, my family was and still is here for me, but it was something happening in my head and I still don’t know why it happened to me.

I had hallucinations. Like one day, my grandmother was taking me back home to school, and I saw my past grandmother. She was wearing a red dress and was walking in a weird way. The problem is, she died a year before I saw her. My grandmother didn’t see anyone that day.

I was also hearing voices coming from the walls in my house. I live in a very old house (it was built in the 1930’s), so you expect to see some cracks here and there on the walls. I don’t remember what the walls were saying, but it was a woman speaking.

And by far the creepiest hallucinations I had were those of a woman, probably with a height of 2,50m, with long dark greasy hair, a green skin, an old face, her face reminds me of some old american indian portraits. She was wearing overalls and had very wide shoulders. She was appearing every day when I was 8 years old, and when she did, it was no longer than 3 seconds and a creepy bassline was playing in my head when she appeared.

Can anybody help me figure out what this all means ? 

Thank you very much,
a long-time kid.",30Aug2020,1
5,"THIS MIGHT BE A SENSITIVE TOPIC TO SOME AND IS NOT MEANT TO OFFEND ANYONE

Lately with all of these reports coming out, like the Smash community fiasco and the recent children sex trafficking, I've been feeling really, idk, unlovable, tarnished and just feeling like an enemy to the world.

For context, I'm a cis/het (straight or heterosexual) white male.

I'm not sure if its just me overthinking, being sensitive or that I'm constantly coming across toxicity aimed at my kind. I know that I'm privileged and all but I hate it. I hate my privilege. I hate how tarnished my kind has become with all the pedos, MAPs, rapists, perverts, abusers, incels, etc, and that I always feel pulled under whenever there's misandry just because I'm a male too (I know that there are bad women too but from my experiences, they are brought up less often). I hate that every fandom that I'm a part of, I always feel unwelcome for who I am.

What sucks is that I've been rejected and bullied by people of my own kind in the past and, combined with the feeling of being unwanted in the fandoms that I'm in, I just feel like I'm on my own. I admit I'm pretty emotional and sensitive for a guy and that's all thanks to relationship issues and conflict in my past.

I always come across posts from people in my own fandoms saying stuff like ""Men are a disease"", ""Kill all men"" , ""All women should go lesbian"" and even ""Men should just accept all rape accusations, false or not"" and much more generalizations.

It sucks that people generalize you based on how you are born and that there's no character creation menu. Some would say ""Just go trans."" and no hard feelings but I just feel like doing that wouldn't fix my problem personally and I would just feel untrue to myself since aside from all this, I'm ok with who I am, but its how we've been portrayed and generalized that just kills me inside.

I just feel really hurt from all this. I know its mostly the internet where its a ""use at your own risk"" kinda thing but has anyone else ever felt like this?

(I respect women, I'm a self-titled LGBTQ+ ally and completely against racism and sexism btw.)

(And if I must add, I'm also the youngest and only male sibling of my family with 3 older sisters so I've got no one to relate to about this.)

Once again, I'm sorry if this offended anyone. I just want to be understood.

(Also in-case this was the wrong subreddit to post this, please direct me to a potentially better one.)

Thank you.

TLDR: I feel hated by the world for how I was born and its made me insecure and has been putting me in bad headspace recently.",30Aug2020,1
6,"About a month ago i was home alone and smoked some pot, and had a bad trip alone, thinking i was going crazy. I had some weird toughts that really made me thinking that i am actually crazy and that was very unpleasant. The day after i kept remembering these toughts and i got pretty paranoid so, i made the bad decision of going on the internet for some clues and i got scared even more that i might really go crazy.
 At first i tought i got schizophrenia, then i realized i had none of that( no delusions no haucinations), but scrolling through forums i tought i had depersonalization and derealization but i was not sure at all if i was just paranoid from reading too many symptoms( i might have just imained those, if that makes sense) or if i had it.
 After about a week i was sure that i was ok but kept thinking about it.
 For the next almost 2 weeks i have had a good time with myself and friends, i even started exercising and stuff, but 2 or 3 days ago i somehow started to question my sanity once again and the rollercoaster from the beginning started( not as bad as before , but i am still feared and paranoid). 
This time i am more  concerned about why am i coming back to this tought. I dont know how to describe my feelings about this.
At some point i read on google that people with the idk what disease end up killing themselves. I have read about sucidal toughts and since then, sometimes when i think about that thing i get scared very badly.
 I am doing my stuff and i start to think about life and stuff and how everyone has its own mind and stuff, but then i think i might be or go crazy because i think about this stuff again. I have already tought on these before ( over the years)but this time it feels  strange a little bit. And all these toughts and fears of going crazy add up on each other and i become even more anxious, like my mind is going on overthinking mode, like accelerating. I usually get over these toughts by doing something else to keep my mind busy. But i still dont know why i keep thinking about this. 
Ps: i am 19 yo almost 20. In my lifetime i feared that i was going to die from different illnesses like testicle cancer hearth attack , internal bleeding, skin cancer etc. Everytime i kept searching on google and i was scared of what i saw and this time is no different. 
That all i can say about my situation and my symptoms. Feel free to ask me questions, because i might have forgotten something i dont know",30Aug2020,1

9,"Recently I had a severe mental health crisis brought on by a WhatsApp message I received from Ghana. I'm undergoing treatment from the NHS home treatment team in the UK, but I'm finding that they give no useful feedback on how to improve my mental health. Instead they listen (which is useful of course) and try to assess. 

At my family's request, I attended a intervention appointment at the local hospital and complied with what they wanted, but the best description of the experience is ""psychological torture"". They took me into an enclosed space, knowing full well that I was more comfortable outdoors. I wouldn't describe myself as claustrophobic, but the staff asked leading questions which I pointed out, and they seemed agitated by my rejection of their binary diagnosis techniques.

For context, I'm an intelligent 26 year old who got caught out trusting the wrong people in a complex life situation. I was following my strong ethical compass and two people (who should have been protecting me) betrayed me (contrary to their responsibilities in their positions of power). 

I'm lost as to where to go now. I've never had severe mental health problems before but now my mood swings by the hour. I'm not keen on medication, but feel I have no other choice at this point. 

Any thoughts would be gratefully received!",30Aug2020,1
10,"&gt; Sooo what’s the plan tonite man?

&gt; It’s gonna be a early night man...

&gt; Wait I mean we kinda had plans man... didn’t you take a nap?

&gt; Yeah I did take a quick rest earlier. My original plan was to go for a walk somewhere bc I didn't want to go alone... Not necessarily go get food dude. I said that already so apparently you didn't listen. And you know I like going out for food don't get me wrong  but I do that all the time anyway. It's not like you're my girlfriend or something... Like I'm %100 obligated to go through plans you know. That's why if I was gonna do that I would go back to the bars bc at least I could talk to some girls or something while I eat... So yeah plans change dude you need to get over that right now. I know you apparently have a hard time with grasping that concept but guess what dude? That's how the real world works. Get that thought out of your head right now that just because I make plans I absolutely have to follow up with them. You try to guilt trip me so much with that dude and quite frankly I'm really tired of it. If I had a dollar for every time you complain about that I would be a lot richer. Just stop dude.

&gt; What’s up with the wall of text man? I’m not mad just confused...


&gt; Well ok maybe you would like to not necessarily think of it as complaining but I notice you seem to bring that up a lot... Where you get offended if plans change or something. Most other people would be like ok whatever you know... Idk that's just what I notice. Sorry if I came off as a douchebag I do still wanna hang out again I'm just tired rn

I was still confused so I asked him if he was drunk as he’s usually never this angry... I told him I wasn’t mad I was just a bit confused. 

He said he kinda feels bad, and I told him I love him like a brother. 

Depression-induced anger?",30Aug2020,1
11,"I only recently decided that I no longer hate myself, just a month ago. I’ve hated myself for about 7 years. My deep self hatred started in sixth grade, when I had no friends and felt unwanted. And when I had a friend that made me feel bad about myself, only to later realize that she was jealous of me all along. My self hatred was so deep that I quite literally hated EVERYTHING about myself, EVERYTHING that made me ME. I hated every single cell that made me, I even hated my first, middle and last name. I hated my past, the fact that I struggle mentally, that I’m not popular, that I’m an introvert, the way I believe others perceive me. The way I look.
It was so hard for me to even begin to imagine NOT hating myself because I had this persistent feeling of utter disgust for myself. This horrid feeling of constantly being grossed out just for being this person, and it would get so distressing and to the point where I’d begin to panic and cry explosively because I wanted so badly to just jump out of my skin. I recently found out how to combat this feeling...by being positive. Ik this sounds stupid, cliche, obvious, etc. but just by viewing myself better and by saying only positive things to myself, I started to not feel as ugly and the intensity of the disgust actually went away. I was so excited with this discovery and begin practicing self love since it didn’t feel gross anymore. In any case It seems I’m still dealing with the aftermath of the poor self image I’ve had all these years, and found that my confidence is next to zero, I have no sense of self worth, and am literally scared of everything. I’m so insecure, and soooo sensitive. Anytime anyone Ik accomplishes something big I just feel bad about myself. When I look at the Ig pages of people from my school that I envy I feel sooooo incredibly low on myself and start to hate myself again. I’m just so unhappy with who I am and constantly wish I could just be someone else. I feel so worthless and so ‘less than’ and inferior to other people. It just sucks and I don’t know how to fix it.

12,"The past couple of days has been extremely horrible. My last post here was the start of constant intense anxiety, depression, dread and frustration that continued until, well now. I started journaling again, just now actually, and I found that there is a lot that I didn't notice or realise, sort of a root to what's causing these feelings. I feel a lot better now, but I do want to see professional help. 

Right now, I think therapists are open to take patients, but being a student I'm unable to chalk out £50 per session. I'm not yet registered with the doctors near me since I just moved, and I will be moving again in 2 weeks for university, so getting therapy on the NHS or a counsellor isn't really viable until I move back to university. I wanted to know what I can do when these feelings and emotions rise up again? I feel like I've done some good work with journaling and figuring out at least some of the roots to my anxiety, so I will be continuing that practice. Is there anything y'all can recommend?

19,"I find myself, in the things that I say, people pleasing; I'll say something that's often not my true opinion in order to please someone, other times, I'll say it to 'fill a gap' when I can't think of something to say.

I have two prominent examples; quite recently, I had someone try and embarrass me in the sense that they tried to 'assert dominance' over me in front of others - I didn't like it, but I was too concerned with people pleasing to resist it, so to speak. Another time, a very arrogant person also said a sarcastic comment about me to a friend of mine right in front of me, without even speaking to me - it wasn't a big deal, but I could see what he was doing - as a very egocentric person, he was seemingly enjoying establishing a social dominance over me whilst simultaneously trying to humiliate me - I wanted to say something back but I kind of went with the joke and smiled a little, pretending I didn't know what he was saying - I wasn't comfortable doing that. I did it to try and get him on my side, and I'm annoyed at myself for doing that. I want to be stronger.

I know there's the real me, with all my opinions, underneath this layer of people pleasing, I just want to bring it out in a slightly belligerent manner; not in an abusive way of course, more so in just a kind of 'fiery' manner where I won't accept other people trying to assert dominance over me like the above - I know I can do it because I used to do it during the time before I had social anxiety but it seems to, I don't know, be forgotten. I can't actually remember how I used to do it as it was so long ago. Maybe my mind is inadvertently blocking it out?

Would anyone have any advice? Or suggested online resources to help?

1. Fear of the unknown
2. Unhealthy relationships
3. Idea of a ""perfect life""
4. The need to be in control of everything
5. Comparison of yourself with other people
6. Placing your partner on an unrealistic pedestal
7. Your insecurities
8. Fear of failure
9. Any possessions that don't spark joy
10. Overindulging in unhealthy habits
11. Failing to care for your physical, mental, emotional well-being
12. Gossiping
13. Your dependency on other people
14. Procrastinating on your tasks

As soon as I felt my anger rising I’d hit my bowl and within 5 minutes I’d be back to normal. I’ve done this going on 20 years now. Recently I’ve decided to stop smoking for awhile to help with my tolerance. For the past 2 days I’ve been on a level of anger and depression that I can’t control. I converted my dinning room into my office and my wife and daughter know not to clutter my office with toys or junk. I haven’t spoken to my wife in 2 days and anytime I do speak to her I lash out with yelling I insult her and I broke my daughters favorite toy because she left it on my desk. The problem is, that isn’t me. I’ve never insulted my wife besides joking around and I’ve never broke any of my daughters toys. My office is where we do her “Science Experiments” and when I see what I’ve been doing these past few days it breaks my heart that I could do that to them. Then my mind goes to suicide and I’m not a suicidal person at all.  Sure I get angry but I can control that. I’ve never raised a hand to either of them except my 4 year old when she get a tap on the butt when she’s not listening but I’m not abusive. I came here to get someone’s help.

31,"Hey guys, first time posting, been here for a while reading the posts. I \[24M\] would really like to take some advice regarding mental health. I have been dealing with depression for a long time. I believe it started back in highschool, but could be tracked back even further since I was bullied as a kid. Gotta say I haven't diagnosed properly, because I could not afford more than three sessions with a shrink. So, to the point. Currently i'm not really under much problem, but the issue is that the thing is more of an off/on thing. Sometimes I see something or rememeber something and it gets triggered. I go under this bad behaviour and start feeling awful about myself. I'm explaining it with more paragraphs down.

Back in February/March I had serious thoughts about ending my life, which now are more likely gone, luckily. One of the issues which caused it is a relationship I had early this year with someone I work with. Lasted for a month nearly, in that time I started to feel kinda far from her because she would get mad about me going out with friends and was kinda absorbing. I really suck at relationships, and I admit I ended it not in the best way possible. I was starting to be more far away from her, until I finally told her I really wasn't ready for a relationship. She stormed off, later called to talk and told me I only saw her to have sex. Damn. That hit me hard. Never was about that. I cracked since I felt awful about she saying that. I took it very bad and she seemed to be sorry about saying that. I avoided the conversation with her again until we finally had it and decided to end it well. Then, I started seeing this posts (damn social media) clearly directed at me, about how I did her wrong and stuff like that. I'm that kind of person who always looks to be on good terms with everybody, so it hit me hard. I was sinked at the time, also because I was listening to somewhat depressive music. I have kinda recovered but, as I still work there (now as home office), I have some kind of contact with her, which usually makes me think about what happened and I go down down down below. Leaving work is not an option since money is tight these times lol.

My other issue is clearly porn. I have become more dependant, with less things to do daily. I'm not studying since I really can't do it at home, too much distractions and up to 15 hours sitting down would kill my back. I can't control it, and got worst since I now spend money at subscriptions, which I regret inmediatly after. I can control myself for like a day or two, then I feel this urgency to watch and consequently do the job. I have tried to do more exercise at home and signed up to some online courses, but really the time spent at porn kills all. Is there any way to eventually stop it?

I don't go out much because COVID, really never did before actually. I only chat with one or two friends somedays. Regarding flirts with other girls, it usually end with me being ghosted or being used as a study rat to help them lol. I also play videogames most of the time, which makes me happy sometimes. I have kinda told my problems to my family but they do not seem to be much involved. I sometimes spoke about my problems with close friends, but I don't want to worry them. So, I ask you, kind people of Reddit, could you lent me some advise to keep these hard toughts out of my head and ways to improve my mental health? I really want to see a shrink, but right now where I live (Peru) is not easy. Sorry for the long post, I guess it will be a hybrid between venting and help seeking.",30Aug2020,1

37,"To give some context on to why I feel this way. About 2 years ago we had our three youngest cousins move into our suburban neighborhood with us, their mom had plan to drive 4 states west just to meet some guy online and go on a date (and she would bring her children along). My mother saw this as super dangerous and irresponsible so she devised a plan to protect them and keep them out of harms way. Within two weeks my cousins begin living with us, we only have 4 bedrooms in the house (one of them an extension in the garage). Being the oldest I was very willing and ready to sacrifice my own privacy. Another thing to mention is that they were already 4 kids living in the house (including myself). As the weeks went on we had many painful and lesson based experiences with our little cousins because they went through about 12 years of verbal and emotional abuse from their mother. In the beginning it was a rather stressful time, but eventually we met an area of white where we found a nice peace and relaxation with them as their behaviors did improve. Life was good again after teaching them how to live in a non-abusive world. Currently there mom is not allowed to visit them unless she brings it to the court, and so far she has made zero attempts to see them. But they’re much happier with us now, and that makes me glad. I wouldn’t want to grow up with a shit show mom either. 

Going back to the present it’s been 4-5 months since the Corona Virus has broken into everyone’s nation. Other countries are doing better but not so much America. With handling 7 kids and the heaviness of social distancing and quarantine, I would say life has been harder than ever. Being the oldest and most mature child in the house, I’m able to understand how much stress my parents are going through to make this family work and be successful even with the stress of paying bills, getting corona, or having a child get the corona. 

Observing my parents I wish their was something I could do to help alleviate their pain of life and it’s absolutely ravenous pressure. I’ve let my mother cry on my shoulder over how hard life is for her. I help my dad around the house and try to do what he says for the most part. But I feel even with doing their requests and listening to what they have to say. They remain still underlyingly  stressed. I know this stress isn’t because of me, but I feel a failure for not being able to change their suffering in any way. I just can’t find the reason to stop finding ways, and I can’t stop trying no matter how badly it hurts to fail. I’ve sacrificed so much to help my little cousins, and now I want to sacrifice myself to help my parents through the hardest year they will have ever faced.

38,"I flared this as need support but I'm venting too. This might be long. I'm not planning on it but I feel like once I get going it'll just spill. Also I'm sorry if it's all over the place my brain is everywhere right now. Idk even know where to start. Lately I've been having these obsessive thoughts about death. Not like I'm going to kill myself or I really to die. But the opposite. I can't stop thinking about the fact that one day I'm going to die and literally nothing I can do will stop it. It's out of my hands and inevitable. I'm going to leave my kids alone. Regardless how old they are I have the idea that I'm going to be gone and never see them again and miss things. I can't stop thinking about the fact that they will die one day too and that I brought them into this insane world only to die one day.  I'm only 33 and in know that's not old. But I'm closer to 40 than 20. And 33 years and by fast. Before I know it my boys will be grown and I'll be old. It keeps me up at night. I'll start to finally relax and boom there it is and I start getting a anxiety attack and can't sleep. I've always been worried about drying but never like this. I never thought about it daily multiple times a day and I never lost sheep over it or let it affect my daily life. I'm not religious. I've tried but I just can't grasp the concept of god and jesus. There's just so much that is ridiculous to me and things I think are bullshit. But I can understand why people believe. It gives them comfort in thinking about heaven and being with your loved ones for eternity instead of just being gone. Like it terrifies me thinking that our body is just a shell. That what was once a living breathing human is nothing but skin and bones that'll be buried underground alone to rot and be forgetten about. I've always had anxiety ever since I can remember.  My dad was a alcoholic and unpredictable. I was a loner and weird in school and got picked on. I only had my dad because my mom left when I was 16 months and I never knew her. I had to go through a lot when I was little. Abused by a babysitter, scared of my dad when he was drunk plus worrying about him. I knew when he was in jail even though my family tried to protect me. I didn't have anyone to talk to about things. As a teen my dad went through a hard time and because of that there were times he was gone for a week or so and I was alone. We lived in a literally tiny little town in the middle of nowhere. Sometimes no heat or food or electricity. I eventually bounced from friends to friends for a long time meeting up with my dad on Fridays to get money for the week. Also we are going through a really hard time. My boyfriend and i have 4 boys between us. My 8yo who lives with us full time, his 5yo who we get whenever his sons mom is in a good mood and our 2yo and 1yo. I lost my job and apartment literally at the exact same time out of nowhere. I was given 10 days to move and figure everything out. We have no car. We had 3 people with a truck bail on us. We live in a small town so there's nothing for rent around here. Even if there was it's hard to get a place with no job. I can't move out of town because I have no way to get my son to school. Things have just been building up. I'm trying to cope but it feels like it's always one thing after another. I feel like no matter what I do I can never catch a break. I feel like because I'm so nice and I work really hard and can't say no that I am looked as someone who can be pushed around and walked all over and that I'm just forgetten about. I've been promised promotions at jobs only to have someone who isn't as qualified get the job. Like at the nursing home. Worked there 4 years started in housekeeping and laundry, got my CNA license and when I was fired I was the assignment manager of activities. I got fired because my 3rd write up was that even though I called the night before to let them know what was going on and I came in at noon I was still written up because I had to take my oldest who was about 1 at the time to the doctor because he has a rash from head to toe and his eyes were swelling. Come to find out that the person who got my job was the best friend of the manager. I've had 3 jobs in the last 10 years. And I can count on one hand the complaints I got from customers or co workers. But I'm too nice and I'm easily forgetten about because of it. This last one was the final straw. I just feel defeated and broken. I dedicated my life and sacrificed so much for this place only to be treated like this. I feel like what's the point? Why be av good decent person. It doesn't get you anything anymore. I believe in karma. But it just seems like nothing i do matters I guess. We begged people to help us move or watch the boys. Nobody would and we had 3 people bail on helping with a truck. But yet family or people would judge because my house was messy sometimes. Yet nobody stops and thinks oh I know you're overwhelmed and it's hard let me help. I just don't know how much more I can take. My anxiety is getting the best of me and I can't stop it. I am constantly on edge and snappy. I'm constantly feeling like I'm about to just combust from everything. I feel like I have no purpose or reason. Without my kids I'd have to purpose at all. I feel like I'm just always going to work my ass off only to have it blow up in my face. I get anxiety when I don't work hard. I take my job seriously and I do it the best I can. I can't tell my bosses no so I'm constantly getting stuck with shit and not taken seriously when I try to say no. Idk I'm just having a hard time with everything lately and I can feel myself getting depressed again. I can feel my depression creeping back in. I hate that I'm so confident and myself but at the same time I'm not at all. Like i know that I'm a good person and that I do the best I can at my job and go above what I sound but at the same time I feel like maybe I'm not and that in reality I suck and everyone knows and that I don't deserve it. I am there for everyone all the time. I do anything for anyone anytime but when I need someone I'm alone. I've never had and real close friends. I'll find friends but eventually they move on and I'm forgetten. I feel like I'm the back burner friend. I hate feeling so woe is me and feeling pity for myself which makes me beat myself up more. Ugh idk I just don't have anyone to talk to. My boyfriend tries but he doesn't really understand. I just needed to vent and stuff before I exploded. Thanks for making it this far if you did. Sorry if that was too like pity me type of post.",30Aug2020,1
39,"I’m a 23 YO Female. History of PTSD (not really active anymore), anxiety and (situational) depression. I’m healthy aside from bladder issues and infections. No medications other than birth control. Don’t drink (56 days without substances. Sober but not an addict) or do drugs. 
I recently went through a very hard breakup. It led to a lot of suicidal thoughts and I had to call a hotline and almost be admitted. I’ve been extremely depressed since my breakup that happened over a month ago. I just recently had a really good day the other day which was awesome considering every day since the breakup has been miserable. I couldn’t eat, shower, brush my teeth or hair. I was just go to bed and go to work but I’m getting better. Maybe a week before my break up I had a horrible sleep paralysis moment that was terrifying. I’ve only had SP once or twice and it’s not a normal thing for me. After that episode, I’ve been seeing things at night. I’m not asleep and I’m fully awake when these things appear. I’ll see weird spider things on my pillow as well as weird balls of tangled yarn (I know that’s weird but Idk how else to describe it) run across my pillow during the night. I’ll turn my light on and nothing will be there. I see these weird things almost every night for the last few weeks and I don’t know what’s going on. Possibly hypnogogic hallucinations? Every once in a while I’ll hear things but that’s not as prevalent. I don’t have any family history of mental illness aside from addiction. I don’t have gas running through my apartment so there’s no carbon monoxide leak or meter. It’s effects my sleep because I get scared and have to hide under my covers. I don’t know what to do.

40,"Yesterday, I was out of the house for 6 hours spending 3 at the mechanic's and 3 at a Walmart. 
At the mechanics I was okay for the most part. It was stressful trying to keep my daughter entertained but, otherwise it was okay. However, about 20 minutes into my trip to Walmart I was on the verge of a breakdown. When did people become to fucking selfish? How are they unaware of other people? I am social distancing. I am happy to wait my turn, I am happy to give you extra time, however, please, think about me too! A lady pushed me out of the baking section, literally walking into the 2 foot space between me and the flour I was reaching for. I stood aside and she took 10 fucking minutes looking at different flours and complaining about too many choices. Bitch, grab what you want and fuck off to Jupiter! I have needs too you selfish ass! 


But, this was happening everywhere. Grabbing tea? Pushed out. Grabbing ketchup? Pushed out. Grabbing spices? Pushed out. I swear to god, I'm going to start running people over with my cart. Anything you can do I can do better, including being an absolute pile of pig shit. Jeez wheezing christ! I'm not taking a lot of time! I look, spot, grab. Look, spot, grab. I'm not standing and staring at the Jello for 10 minutes complaining about the lack of horse hooves in these new batches. 

My trip to Walmart should've been an hour tops. Not 3. 

Today, I had to go to Walmart for something I gave up on yesterday. I was in fucking Walmart for 5 minutes and a skinny trashy lazy bitch on a fucking motorized scooter ran over my foot and stopped on it! She then asks me to move and I told her I fucking can't. Then the frayed drug busted and burned wires in her brain finally connected and she moved. I hate people. I am done with them.

My husband is on a ""Bro-ad (road) trip"" with his friends and will be gone for the next few days. He goes on 3 vacations a year always with either his friends or Step Dad. I finally have the car and I am supposed to do the maintenance on it. I drive it every so often, maybe 4 times a month and I have to do the maintenance. When do I get a vacation? When can I run off and dick around? Why am I the only committed adult in this fucking relationship? I don't want to take him from the homies but fucking christ, give me a mother fucking weekend you asshole. I ask for so little. And I get even less. I'm so tired.",30Aug2020,1

43,"Idk if this is the place to post this but I just need to vent. If there’s a better sub to post this on, please let me know.

I’m in high school, and I am consistently horrified that the career I choose will be the wrong one. Sometimes I considered a scientific field, because it seems fun, it seems like a well respected position, and it seems like I could make a difference. But then I realize that I’m definitely not smart enough to be like at the top, and I feel like the only scientists I or other people look up to are the best, and I feel like any difference I could make would be negligible. I also really love music, but I only started learning piano a year ago ( and I love it) because for years I felt like I’d be judged for trying to learn (no I don’t know why). And it’s a hard enough industry to crack if you’ve been studying music your entire life, so I always worry that someone like me will just end up failing with nothing else to do afterwards. I really want to do something good for the world, but half the time I’m worried that I only want to have a legacy and be remembered as someone who did something good. Basically my biggest fear is just laying in my bed when I’m old and just looking back and thinking “damn, it’s so crystal clear what you should have done and you didn’t fucking do it” and just die full of regrets. It feels weird to have typed that all out, and actually seeing it visually is already kind of clearing things up a bit idk. I’m still going to post this though for some extra input.

47,"I had a mini panic attack or break down today. What happened was i was feeling scared and anxious for no reason, then i was helping my mom with something and i was lightly chastised for being too slow. This set me off a bit because im a sensitive person. Then, my dad kept calling me to help him and hes the type of person that expects you to be there immediately. I couldnt because i needed time to rebound and be okay, but the frustration set in, and i was crying in the bathroom with the vent on and the water to drown it out. They heard it anyway, so later that night my mom asks me while we are watching tv what happened. I explained and then said i like how there are all these labels to identify what im feeling. I felt that labels help solidify what my feelings are and help me understand it better, then i mentioned, “like i understand that i have anxiety” and my mom freaked out and said stuff like “you read too much negative shit on the internet! You bring it to yourself! Ive given you everything! This is not genetic!” Im more shocked than hurt. I still havent fully processed wtf just happened. Im not diagnosed, so i think her own meltdown came from me talking about it one more time and her misunderstanding that i am not looking for that help or therapy.

50,"Hey, I would really appreciate some advice with my dilemma. So sorry for the length, please bare with me. I really, really need different peoples take on this. 

I met my first bf at 16 (him 19 &amp; his first relationship) 3 years ago. Before I met him I struggled heavily with depression &amp; when he came into my live it was literally a new lease on life. 

We were so happy when we were together, I thought of him as this wonderful enigma, someone I wanted to spend the rest of my life with because he was ‘perfect’ in looks, humour, character, and always had me interested with his intelligence. It was going amazingly. 

However, when we werent together, he could be distant at times &amp; I just felt like someone was off. Given my mental health, my anxiety would kick in and I spent about 3 months during my high school exams being completely at war with my mind over my sanity and becoming someone I hated. 

I had my suspicion that he was talking to someone in particular (someone he started talking to but it never went anywhere before me). I would ask to see his phone &amp; would check up on when he was active on messenger &amp; question him on it. He would profusely tell me he loved me so much and would never do anything like that to hurt me &amp; I couldn’t do anything without proof but go on because I loved him with all my heart as well. Obviously this only pushed him more away because it was controlling but part of me knew in my heart that he was lying. 

One day I was checking after we said goodnight over text on messenger to see when he was last active and this other person and saw they both went offline at the same time (e.g 42 mins ago) and decided to check his phone when I next stayed over. I found on his snapchat when he was in the shower he was talking to them &amp; sending them nudes on snapchat by his username &amp; nicknamed him something else and later on in the day asked to see his phone &amp; confronted him, he tried to pretend it was a workmate until I mentioned the username. It led to a lot of pain and crying on both sides and he said that my crying scared him and he would never do anything like it again. 

After that he spent 6 months trying to repair our relationship &amp; I was trying to give us another chance but I wasn’t strong enough and my anxiety plagued me often, I couldn’t trust him again. He then went to uni 3 months before we finally split which put a strain on things a lot but we tried to video call almost every day and we would laugh &amp; tell each other about our days which made things easier. But it was also hard because he wasn’t out as gay because he thought his dad would be disappointed so only his close friends knew and his best friend didn’t really like me unfortunately. 

When I went to stay in his accommodation one time however (to get away from sixth form &amp; my parents who effected my mental health a lot) I saw a pack of condoms in his see through draws (visible form his bed) &amp; of course was destroyed. He claimed he only used them on himself, however we spoke about breaking up before he went to uni with my impression being he wanted to be free to have sex. We spent about 2 days miserable &amp; I demanded he tell me secrets he was hiding from me and 1 by 1 they came out. He had downloaded grindr several times throughout our relationship and had another phone in which he used for it &amp; hid behind his desk... he once again was crying &amp; didn’t want to lose me but it broke me. I threatened myself with a knife &amp; to run away to get the truth out of him. (I didn’t want to hurt myself but knew the extreme was the only way). He called the police because h was worried I would hurt myself&amp; the officers arrested me because they saw we had a bit to drink &amp; they thought I threatened him with it. He pressed no charges as he never intended I was arrested &amp; I was released the next day. After that he seemed to have little interest in me and we were both drained &amp; I went back home. 

Then 2 weeks later he came home from uni a week before Christmas and broke up with me. I said I would block him on everything as I knew I was too broken to be able to handle being friends  and we never really spoke since. He only lives about 20 mins walk away (family home not uni which is hours away) but thankfully haven’t ran into each other. 

No matter how much he hurt me I couldn’t bare to lose him. He was the love of my life &amp; my soulmate. But in time I saw that it couldn’t have gone on because it had not been healthy for a long time. Given my mental health &amp; it being my first relationship, in retrospect I saw that  I could be overbearing at times &amp; would vent to him about my mental health and my shitty parents &amp; it was terrible that I was driven to be controlling &amp; how extreme things got in the end. 


It’s been 3 years &amp; I have been with someone else now for 2 who is kind, caring, would never cheat on me loves me. I am so healthy mentally and don’t struggle with my mental health very much anymore and feel great about myself, I’m a completely grown &amp; changed person. 

I love him &amp; respect him, but a large part of me still clings to my first partner. Despite how toxic things became and the mistakes he made we were madly in love. Every date felt magical, the memories we made together felt like they would stand the test of time. The times we upset each other or went to breakup we would historically cry because we couldn’t imagine life without each other &amp; with who I’m with now, nothing ever feels magical &amp; all consuming in the way it did with my first. I think about him several times a week whether it’s because of dreams or things that remind me of us. 

I know soul mates don’t exist but I just can’t seem to move past it. I would never want to risk losing who I’m with now because he treats me right and loves me and I love him.  
I can’t describe how guilty I feeling that I can’t move past it completely but as much as I love him I feel like we’re very comfortable and we’re very close but there’s not much excitement in comparison, my heart doesn’t beat fast on dates and I don’t feel in awe in the way I was with my first. 


I honestly think subconsciously I wish we could talk &amp; get date as grown people because we just worked so well asides my mental health &amp; his sexual urges. The last few words he said to me were about the possibility of getting back together one day after uni but I knew I had to get on with my life and get myself together and forget about him for now in order to be the person I am now. But I also worry he only thinks of me with mainly distain and as the young, insecure, version of myself just before we broke up.  And now that I am and I’m confident in myself and am in good health, I can’t help but wonder why even with having someone love me and years between us, why I can’t move past him and whether I should explore messaging him asking him to meet an see how I feel ? I wouldn’t ever cheat on who I’m with but sometimes I wonder if it would give me confirmation on how I feel whether that would be to move past him or explore it depending on who he is now. I don’t believe in once a cheater always a cheater &amp; that people grow and change but just wonder what Reddit’s take is. Thanks so much for hearing me out, it’s the only thing that upsets me in my life regularly &amp; I need to work through it because avoiding it all this time hasn’t ever made it go away. Thanks for letting me get this out there :)

When he asked who hadn't, the best explanation I had was that I just couldn't. I sometimes really want to take a shower, more than I want anything else, but I can't. I'll be incredibly hungry, I know exactly what I want, but I can't get it.

I'm not physically incapable. I'm not thinking, ""Oh, I shouldn't do that cause..."". I'm not too busy. There's no real reason other than i just can't do it. Is this just bad procrastination? Am I just being super lazy?",30Aug2020,1
71,"for months straight, maybe even years on and off, i’ve had this weird feeling where i feel like my conscience (or that voice in your head) takes over. for example, it’ll tell me to do something, like grab a certain cup or something small like that, and if i don’t do it, it’ll threaten me saying something bad will happen. and often i feel like it’ll take over my body and i just watch on the inside. idk if this is too weird or something but i tried looking it up and nothing came. i cant afford therapy, but i’m just asking if anyone else has this problem",30Aug2020,1

76,"I don't even know exactly how to say what I want to say but I guess I've been dealing with some shitty things lately and I've had extremely poor mental health for a long time now. I feel a lot of pent up frustration, exhaustion and stuff so apologies if I seem disjointed or whatever

I could be out driving somewhere and something will say to me ""you could hit the acceleration and hit that pole and it would be over with"" just shit like that. My brain just comes up with these scenarios where I could do something to kill myself (I don't actually want to).

My mood has been crazy too. One minute I'll be super positive and optimistic about the future but then I'll be incredibly down in a point where I just feel like curling up in bed and dying. I've been going through these cycles more frequently lately.

Another thing that's been eating at me is nightmares. More nights than not, I have these absolutely horrible nightmares. 

I told my online therapist that the best way I can describe the nightmares is Freddy Krueger/Nightmare on Elm Street. The teenagers in the movies are too scared to go to sleep because they know they'll have to deal with him when they sleep so they try not to sleep and it affects them throughout the day. That describes me perfectly. I don't want to sleep and I get kind of worried when I go to sleep.

I've been struggling with every day tasks. My room is filled with dirty laundry that I need to do. My room is a mess. I've been struggling to keep up with things like brushing my teeth as well. I just cannot be fucking bothered.

I'm so tired and exhausted of dealing with this.",30Aug2020,1
77,"For over a week, I haven’t been able to feel any sense of familiarity whenever I see myself in the mirror. My face looks diffetent. My body looks weird. Nothing feels real. My relationships feel so distant. My emotions are weird. I don’f feel stressed at all from law school, even when I work full days. I feel like i’m wrapped in cotton. I’m increasingly convinced i live in a dream because i feel like i control things. Last week I wandered around my house with a knife because idk it comforted me knowing i could free myself. I also feel like my subconsciousness is out to “get me” by making me say things that makes me look insane as a way to garner sympathy, only to reveal itself as a ploy that embarrasses me. And i get that makes me sound even more weird, but I swear that this is all my dumb subconsciousness whom I jokingly refer to as Cleo pulling a stunt.

78,"Social anxiety, generalized anxiety and depression. I’m fucking useless. Can’t work, drive or make friends because how/where the hell would I met them. Seeing people succeed in life where I’m stagnant just fucking hurts. I’m happy for them but sad for myself. Honestly I don’t know what I want or what I could do even if I had a chance. Culinary school was nice but didn’t work out because after finishing I realized it’s a high stress environment I couldn’t handle. I couldn’t even handle a job at Walmart as a clerk at the deli so what make me think I could work anywhere else? My brain won’t  shut up when I’m anxious and it never does when I’m under the slightest bit of stress. Driving was dangerous because I’d zone the fuck out and feel like I had left my body. Working was more difficult than school because I was responsible for more then writing an answer on a fucking sheet of paper. I realize I’m not stable and I can’t predict when I might feel happy one day and stressed/depressed the next. Every year I feel like my mental state gets worse. I have been happy for years and I feel like once my parents die I’ll lose my sanity all together.",30Aug2020,1

I know this is a controversial topic because everyone has a right to their civil liberties and bodily autonomy however I am dealing with a mother that desperately needs to get mental health treatment. Her mental illness is causing a rapid decline in being able to live a sustainable and full life. She cannot hold down a job or have any type of relationships and I’m worried soon she will become homeless. She is continuing to become more and more isolated due to mental illness that continues to get worse. Unfortunately she does not qualify as gravely disabled and has not threatened suicide or others. yet her mental illness in dilapidating every aspect of her life.

81,"I'm 19 years old, I feel like I live in a mentally abusive family, I take antidepressants and anxiety medicine to cope with everything that has happened in my house.

 I really tried to focus on school, I tried my best, despite getting full scores on many of my tests, the periods of me falling out and missing out important work because of horrible mental health, bullying and everything else, this is where I wish I could go back. The worse thing is remembering when my teachers would tell me I had so much potential and that I wasted it all.

I didn't sign up for college the first year after high school to exclusively look for a job, applied everywhere possible, I made various different CVs depending on what job I was applying for, in the end I only really got one interview for a job which never went beyond that. I've been looking for work since I was 17 and I'm still searching today.

I started university this August, all clases are via Zoom, I haven't been able to attend a single one,  I don't have internet and haven't had it for 3 years, which also significantly screwed up my highschool performance. This year, my computer unexpectedly broke. 

Starting two weeks ago I begged my parents to at least get us internet in my name so that I could at least use my phone for school work. Something I would have done on my own had I had a job, it's only $30. My mom is incredibly stubborn and obsessed with money, always wanting my dad to pay for everything I need, my dad is willing to help but he logically only wants to pay half the bill. My parents are separated, for context.

My sister today, after a heated argument with my mother after she manipulated me promising she would pay for, outed me as gay to my mom and revealed that I smoke weed, and I made a vow that I would never speak to her again, I blocked her phone number, that's the most I can do for now. Both my mom and my sister are extremely manipulative, even to each other, I don't know how they were able to get so spiteful.

I don't understand why after ending one chapter of life, I get to another which is just as bad or even worse, I'm not developing my life, I'm in a cycle of misery. 

If I leave university I'll have no goal, which really makes no difference since I won't even be able to do anything since no one is willing to help me.",30Aug2020,1
82,"tonight i thought i was going to lose my best friend. we haven't known each other long but i believe we were meant to know each other.

83,"When I was 12/13, I went through an awful bullying situation and have not really had friends since. Instead of going out with people like most others, I just sit in my room and play video games.

I have online friends; however, the majority of them live in Europe, so I can't visit them. I recently reconnected with a guy I knew in high school and hung out for the first time in two years. It felt so nice to socialize again, but it's making the night feel even more lonely. I don't know why. 

He and another friend recently got a girlfriend and the majority of my other online friends have someone. I'm 19 now and, outside of two toxic online relationships, have never properly dated. 

I had to take the semester off due to me having back surgery three weeks ago and covid. I was looking forward to starting back this fall so I could hopefully meet some people; alas, I have to wait until January. If even then. 

I can't stand to live like this any longer. The envy and loneliness is eating me up. I just want someone, for once, to care. Even my family has been super distant as of late.

84,"i apologize for the improper wording/grammar in this but bear with me. 

to simplify it, i fucking hate everything and everyone, there’s a lot of factors that play into this so i’m gonna list them in bullet points

1: i’ve had a bit of a rough home life, i actually didn’t know much besides my dad being an alcoholic (who has thankfully quit drinking as of 2019) until i think 2017 when my mother told me a myriad of awful things about my family, my half brother was molested by a catholic priest, my dad is HIV positive and my other half brother was a suicidal heroin addict along with a lot of stuff i’m probably not remembering, as a young lad i’ve also come across obscene videos/pictures of my parents. there was an incident wherein me, my sister and my mother had to hide in our grandma’s living quarters (which was connected to the rest of the house) as my drunk dad lumbered around the house talking about how my mom hated us and wanted to kick us out, about ten years ago my dad had a seizure from overdosing on some narcotic and i saw him on a stretcher on his way to the ambulance. our house was also extremely messy and cluttered (mostly from me). to elaborate on the priest incident my half brother was sexually assaulted by a priest in his childhood, he blanked it out of his memory until late 2017 when me and my mom were moving off the property, he for some reason thought it was my dad who had molested him and he called my mom on the first day that we moved into the new apartment and i thought i’d never get to see that side of my family again. in mid 2018 i moved into another apartment and things seemed to get better for a while until in april 2019 my dad started calling me and my mom while drunk, it really screwed me up until i learned that he had quit drinking, as of now my family is doing amazing, but every time i go over there i can’t forget all the fucked up things my mom told me. 

2: my brain is stupid, i have a lack of compassion, i don’t know why but i just don’t feel bad for people i don’t know which over the past year has turned me into a bit of a bigot, i don’t really hate minorities but i just don’t mind making jokes at their expense, I’ve seen so much screwed up things on the internet mostly from live leak and reddit (who knew), and it’s desensitized me, yesterday i saw a video of some eastern european woman fall off a 200 meter cliff and i didn’t even bat an eye, i just watched it and moved on. on the complete opposite hand i have a huge soft spot for animals, i cannot stand seeing animals get hurt, i saw a video of a cat burned alive and i swear to god i’ve never cried so hard in my life. next problem is that i’m really bad at voicing stuff like opinions, ideas and solutions, combine that with the curse of a genius’s memory, a traumatic childhood and a lack of compassion and a soft spot for animals and you’ve got a burning hatred for every man who walks this earth, all i wish is that we purge this world of all evil, i’ve given up on humanity and i want to take matters into my own hands (no i am not going to commit any crime i’m not that low) my brain refuses to forget all the awful things i’ve seen and heard, i cannot voice my concerns, leaving me to wallow in my misery, i’ve tried therapy so many times throughout my life and it’s never worked, my brain just won’t let me heal. i’ll make a follow up post if prompted",30Aug2020,1
86,"Okay, so it doesn’t really bother me as much anymore what I’m about to say, but I’ve never actually told anyone. When I get super down in a depressive episode I think of all the bad things I’ve ever been told, and these experiences skip to the front of my mind. It bugs me that I never got to tell anyone, so I’m gonna do it now I suppose even if it doesn’t matter anymore. I wanna get it off my chest. 

From the fourth grade up until freshman year of high school I was bullied so relentlessly that it became part of my life. Eventually I just delt with it, brushed it off, ignored it etc. but of course it wasn’t always like that. 
I was called a bitch, fatass, idiot “who would never amount to anything”, and told to go kill myself “or they would take care of it for me” an well.... some other worse things I’d rather not type. Super weak insults now, but to a small girl who was an overweight, nerdy loner, they hurt.
I was pushed around, the target of cruel jokes, my homework was taken and ripped apart many times, I couldn’t sit around people at lunch without them steeling my food or mixing it in disgusting ways. It was hell.
I’d never cry in front of anyone, I quickly learned that get you in worse trouble (plus from trauma at home, I learned I couldn’t cry or I’d get in trouble). I’d wait until I could go to the bathroom, cry for a good ten minutes, then walk out like I was fine. I stayed composed. It was hard at first, but like I said I got used to it.

But one day something happened. It was particularly bad that day cause of something that happened that morning at home, then everyone else just seemed to have it out for me cause they were bored or something.
When one group in particular began to bug me again, I got dizzy and everything began to spin. I remember them saying I should go kill myself, which was a now daily reminder. I was shaking so much, but I wasn’t afraid, and my ears were ringing. They were mocking me for shaking I remember clearly, and suddenly it’s like my eyes hyper-focused. I stopped shaking. I heard my heart in my ears and every breath I took. I quite literally saw red. I was pissed, I was so done with their bullshit. Even typing this I’m shaking again. It’s like I snapped. I huge grin spread across my face even when I tried to stop it. “What do you have to be so happy about bitch? Finally decided to die then?” was the initial response. I just burst out laughing. I laughed so hard I began to cry. An adult came and asked if everything was okay so I just stared the kid in the eye while saying, “Yah, these guys were just telling me a joke....” the person looked at me funny then walked off. The teachers knew but didn’t give a damn. Everyone knew. The bully then said, “what was that all about? You’re starting to piss me off!” I said, “like I said, you just told me a really funny joke.”
“What!?” Cause they obviously didn’t get it. It made perfect sense to me at the time, something was super funny. I don’t quite recall what I was thinking though or what the “joke” was. “You’ve been saying the same thing the past four years *name*, don’t you have anything better?” I just laughed again and they cleared off real quick. 

I suppose I scared them off or somethin cause it wasn’t an issue anymore after that. Thinking back on it I really went crazy for a sec huh? I was, and am usually so timid and shy. I don’t like conflict, and as much as I hate to admit it I’m a people pleaser. It feels like a dream sometimes, like could I really do that? But sure enough.... it’s clear as day in my memory. Is that even a normal reaction? 

I know that can’t have been a normal reaction, an I have such mixed and confused emotions about that memory. I never told anyone else about it before, and as far as my parents, siblings, and current friends are concerned I had a normal and pleasant school experience. I don’t know why I want to hide it so bad, it’s like I’m ashamed of it or something.....
Anyway, thanks for reading this overly long rant haha
It was kinda strange, but I appreciate it. Had to get it off my chest. So thanks kind stranger for listening to my story.",30Aug2020,1
87,"This is going to be extremely lengthy so I do apologize in advance and I understand if you choose not to read. Also, I’m very sorry for any grammatical errors as I really am just letting all my feelings out. I’ve never truly opened up about my mental health. I’m a 20 year old guy (the youngest sibling, I have 3 older sisters) and I feel like I’m never going to truly be happy no matter where I’m at in my life. The truth is if you met me at a fast food place or you were in the same classes as me in high school or you came across me on the street or wherever it might be you’d probably think of me as some very happy person who loves to smile and brings a lot of energy/life to any situation I’m in. I love to make others happy and I love to crack jokes at any given chance.... but I’m extremely depressed on the inside and I have been for a long time. My parents fight a lot... at least a couple times a week on average and I can’t really remember when that started but it isn’t necessarily all their fault even though I hate it. My oldest sister has a terrible attitude and she always makes them feel like they didn’t do a good job raising her (my mom had her when she was 18 and my dad when he was 19) but I do know that my parents worked their asses off to raise her and give her and good life and I honestly have no idea why she treats them like shit all the time but it really has ruined a lot of relationships in my family. I could be mad at my dad for being away on and off my entire childhood but he was working so hard at his job and he was forced to travel a lot. Despite my parents fighting they support me a lot and I do appreciate that. When I was about 13/14 (my first year in high school) my youngest sister was diagnosed with an eating disorder and it was really horrible. She was only around 19 when it happened and she was already small and it really hurt me to see her like that. She was on the verge of dying when she first was in the hospital and she was forced to stay there for a few months. Almost Everyday after school I’d go visit her in the hospital and do my homework before having to go to hockey practice. It was hard to leave but being able to play a sport really helped me get through it. Looking back at it I guess I started to grow up kind of fast during that time period. That’s where the next chapter comes in. I was only in grade 9 (14/15 years old) and I blew my knee out. I needed knee surgery and I was done hockey for the next 4 months. This is when my grades started to drop. I was a fantastic student (not to pump my ego) up until that year and this is when the downfall really started to happen. I skipped one class in grade 9. It was the first and only time I did it that year but it caused me a lot of issues in grade 10 and the later stages of high school as well. Grade 10 was one of the worst years of my entire life. It started off so well because I made the hockey team that I was trying out for but that ended up being a big problem. I was a 15 year old playing on a team that was mostly 17/18 year olds. I had one teammate who went to the same high school as me and he was the same age as I was and we were actually friends but he tried to destroy my life and he pretty much accomplished that. He started rumours at my high school and he also brought those to my team. Whenever I tried to talk to a girl he would purposely tell them things about me that weren’t true and he ruined my relationships with some of my other friends at school/hockey and he would do stuff in the dressing room at hockey that would basically just make everyone laugh and look down on me. I couldn’t escape it anywhere I went. Hockey wasn’t a safe place for me anymore. Every time I was in the dressing room I would get told that I suck at hockey or that I was extremely ugly. I was in such a dark place that I was trying to figure out a way that I could kill myself that wouldn’t leave a mess for anyone else to clean up. I was at an all time low. I was skipping all my classes every day of the week. I was sitting in the bathroom all day at school because I was too afraid to go to class and be made fun of or treated like garbage. For fuck sakes I even ate lunch in the goddamn bathroom somedays. I was failing in school for the first time in my entire life. I wanted to end my life. For some reason I didn’t.... but to this day I still have very little confidence in myself. I couldn’t even talk to girls anymore because I felt like such a loser and I thought they all hated me. It was terrible. I felt like I had to beg most people to like me when in reality they probably just liked me for who I was. Over the summer I was trying to make one of the top teams in my area and I was cut right at the very end. Going into grade 11 I had nowhere to play. I ended up having to train a year with a younger team (one year younger) so I wasn’t eligible to play and of course I got bullied. Grade 11 wasn’t as bad as grade 10 but I still skipped classes and I started to get into weed.  When I say get into I don’t mean that I was doing it every day but I still enjoyed it on the occasion. The reason I started to get into it was because my dog died. My childhood dog died and so many people experience this but the way it happened really stings. Me and my parents were off touring universities with my hockey team and my dog died of a heart attack at the dog kennel and I hated how I never got to say goodbye. I felt guilty for that. I felt like my life was going nowhere and I just continued on a downward spiral. Grade 11 came and went and I was ready for my graduation year but I didn’t even have the proper requirements to graduate. I tried to work my ass off in the summer but between training for hockey and trying to do well in school I was always going to put more effort into my sport. I got cut from nearly every team I tried out for that summer but the week before grade 12 I got a call from the previous team saying they had an older team this year and would love for me to join. I had no other options so I took it and I was able to remain at that high school. This year was actually a good one for me besides one event. I was playing in one of the top midget (16-18 years old) leagues in the world and I was averaging about 90% in my classes. Everyone on my team loved me and my teachers were all pleased with me. Everyone seemed to be satisfied with me but I was never satisfied with myself. A lot of girls were talking to me/into me but I still lacked any sort of self confidence to try and make anything of it. Plus I’m not the typical hockey player that tries to go after every girls because I have 3 sisters and I don’t want to disrespect women (that’s another thing I was bullied for). On Halloween of 2017 my aunt (who I was extremely close to) died of cancer and to this day I don’t think I realized how much that actually hurt me. I was trying to act strong when my family was sad but on the inside I was dying. I started to get high more often but it didn’t make a difference to my productivity it just made me more chill and happy. I was close to making a lot of great teams that summer but it just never happened. I wasn’t planning on going to university because I was going to play junior hockey and that would be my way into a school. But time as running out and by the time September arrived (2018) I was ready to quit. In fact I actually did quit. I was working at a grocery store doing 40 hours a week as a cashier. It was terrible for me because it didn’t interest me at all but hey I was getting money so that’s all that matters in the end (sarcasm). About a month into the job I got a call from a coach that wanted me to go play for him. I thought about it and I finally decided that I wanted to do it. The place where I was going to play was about 18 hours away from my area so I had to live away from home for the first time. A bit scary at first but after a couple weeks I loved it. I was enjoying my independence. Lots of partying. Lots of drinking. Lots of screwing around and just lots of fun. I was playing junior hockey in a pretty good league and I was playing a lot. It was a fresh start. All my teammates liked a lot and I met some of my best friends that I’ll be friends with for the rest of my life there. I even found myself a girlfriend. It was great. Until it wasn’t. Nothing from the season really made me depressed but it was this girl. We started dating in January (2019) and I loved her so much. I would have given her the world if I could have and I only focused on making her life happy. After the season ended (late March) I stayed until mid April so I could be with her. It was really terrible having to leave but we maintained a long distance relationship and it was actually going really well. She was still in high school (one year younger than me) so she was getting ready for exams and this is when things started to get rocky. I supported her and was trying to help her not feel stressed out but she really didn’t give a shit about me. I found myself worrying about her all the time while she barely checked in on me. She used the excuse that she was busy with school but she was hanging out with friends every other night and it made me feel terrible. We made it through it in the end (was mostly me on my own) and I went to visit her in the summer for a month and it was fantastic. I helped her study right before her exams and I went to her graduation and was always right be her side. We had a great time that entire month and even went on a fun vacation. She was getting ready to go away to university right before I left so I helped her pack everything. It was hard to say goodbye after that month but I was going to see her shortly anyways. She was actually going to a university not far from where I live so when her and her father were moving all of her shit I helped them with all of it. I bought stuff for her apartment, I helped her decorate, I did it all. It was easy to get to her so I went for a week and went home and then I went one more time late in the summer and we started to just argue all the time. She became extremely moody and was treating me like garbage but I would always try to solve everything because I loved this girl and in my head i wasn’t good enough for anyone and I was surprised I even managed to find her. I went home and she was just really awful to me. I finally called her out and told her that she needs to show me some love and that if she truly loved me she could actually act like I exist. This didn’t go so well. She turned it around and blamed me for everything. She made me feel like shit... and then she broke up with me over texts. I never saw her again. She barely texted me. She didn’t even have the decency to talk to me on the phone. She just broke up with me and made me feel terrible. She even toyed with me and acted like it was a possibility that we could get back together and me being the idiot I am decided that it was hopefully gonna happen. She ended up getting a new boyfriend within a month and that fucked me up too. This was also in the middle of a trade negotiation that I was trying to get through. I was forcing a trade that would see myself moved from the previous town I was playing in to a much better team with a few of my friends. It was taking forever and I couldn’t use hockey as a distraction. This was the closest I’ve ever been to killing myself. Once again my sport was complicated and the one person that truly loved me and understood me basically kicked me out of their life for no real reason and it sucked. Everyday for about a week and a half I was popping any type of pill I could find in kitchen of my house (where we keep the Tylenol,Advil etc). I wanted to die. Every night I went into my kitchen and grabbed a knife and would run it along my arm/wrist while I was crying because I was so lost. This was just under a year ago but it feels like ages ago now. The trade finally happened late September and if it didn’t I’d probably be dead right now. I was playing for a great team but I separated my shoulder and was out for over a month and that really made me upset as well. Every time something is going well in my life it seems to derail. I couldn’t break into the lineup after that and I was stuck on the bench. I was willing to make the sacrifice because I loved my teammates and the people I lived with but over the Christmas break I was traded. Once again it was a fresh start for me but I wasn’t really wanting one this time. Anyways it happened and I went to a terrible team but I was the star. It ended up giving me a lot of confidence that I needed and I’m a much better player after a few months there but I also smoke weed way more often now because so many guys on that team did/do. The season ended early due to COVID but we weren’t gonna be in the playoffs anyways. I’ve been super lonely ever since then. All my really good friends live far away now. I’m not necessarily very depressed at the moment but it comes back every now and then and it really hurts. I’ve always had issues opening up to people ever since I was a young boy I would keep things to myself. I was outgoing but I didn’t get very personal. I’m not sure if I’ll ever open up to another girl again or at least not for a long time because I’m not sure if I can take another heartbreak or someone using me like that. I don’t talk about my feelings to very many people. In fact there’s probably less than a handful of people that I’ve ever talked to about it in my life. Like I said at the beginning, I love to make people happy. I love to make people laugh... but on the inside I’m extremely broken down. I recently ran of my latest supply of weed and I’ve just been thinking of life a lot more lately and this year. Between the virus and all the other sad things happening I just feel like I don’t have that much to be sad about compared to so many humans who haven’t had a chance to live a good life because of where they live or where they were born or how they look or the language they speak etc. But I still feel like shit. Nobody who actually knows me would ever think this is me talking. They would be mind blown. Absolutely shocked. I can go play university hockey, I can go to Europe and play, I can play on so many different junior teams in so many different places but I just don’t feel like I’m worth anything still. I’ve worked so hard to be where I am but I still don’t feel like I’m the person that everyone thinks I am. I have so many dreams and things I want to do. I wanna live in so many different places. I wanna be a YouTuber and make people laugh but I feel like I can’t because of my low confidence. I wanna do so many great things with my life but I’m not sure if I’ll ever accomplish them even though I’m probably fully capable of doing the shit I want. 
I’m told I’m a very sweet person and I’m liked by nearly everyone I encounter but inside I feel like a screw up and I feel like an asshole. The world feels cold to me. I get annoyed at females very easily and want nothing to do with them (because of my last experience) and I’m slowly starting to cut off more and more friends I’ve struggled with mental health since I was barely a teenager and now that i’m a young adult I feel like my experiences have made me so much stronger but at the same time have messed me up mentally. This might sound like some bullshit sob story and I don’t blame anyone that thinks that because I am not the best at translating my feelings into words and maybe my life seems easy compared to yours and that’s very understandable as well. Like I said I don’t open up. Anyways I’m very sorry for how long this is. There isn’t really a main point to all this it’s just me trying to explain where my depression and sadness and mental health issues come from and if anyone else feels like opening up or wanting to add anything please feel free to... and to anyone that has read all of this, I thank you and I hope you’re doing great. Have a wonderful day/week/month/year everyone :)",30Aug2020,1
88,"Hi, I’m feeling very sad right now and I just don’t know who else to say these things to :c 
I just keep thinking about how I’m such an embarrassment with everything I do, and I feel disgusted with myself. I just wish I felt good enough. I wish I didn’t hate myself. I wish I wouldn’t feel so guilty. 
Why do I have to suffer with social anxiety and depression? Why does it have to be like this? Why does it have to be so difficult? Am I ever going to actually get better? 
I wish I felt beautiful, I wish I felt smart, I wish I didn’t feel like everything I’ve ever done is embarrassing, I wish I didn’t have to feel so disgusted by my own self. I just want to be good enough, like the people I admire. But I feel like I’ll never be like that. I wish I didn’t feel like isolating myself so I wouldn’t embarrassment myself as much.

93,"tw: suicide, self-harm

Hey, I've posted here before but not with much luck. I only got a few upvotes and no comments but I'm hoping that I can get help from here.

For a few months now, maybe 3, I've been feeling extremely depressed and suicidal. I've been to therapy in the past and the happiness only lasted for a while and then I just went back into my hole. I feel unfixable. Lately my parents have been treating me like a disappointment and make me feel so worthless. My mother has called me useless and a lazy pig and my father likes to disregard my mental illness (I have social anxiety that he said I was faking) and said I don't try and acts like he knows me when he doesn't. They always act like I'm just lazy and don't want to do anything when I'm not. I can't find the motivation to do anything and just feel so empty and exhausted all the time. I don't even like eating anymore because I can't find the energy. It's even worse for me because I'm almost in Year 12 and the assignments are weighing me down so much. I've put off getting help for so long that my grades are rock bottom because I have literally no motivation. 
If I'm being honest, I've started to self-harm. Not much, but I always have the urge to just hurt myself and I don't know why, and even when I go through with it I only feel a little better for a few minutes. I'm just so tired of living when every day since I was 12 has just been constant torture. I haven't been happy for such a long time and I just don't see the point in going on when even after all this time my life is just getting worse. Last night and today I was really thinking about it and had such an urge to just kill myself and get it over with. But I didn't and haven't, but I'm scared I will. Just because I'm saying all this doesn't mean I don't want to get better, because I do. It's just that my suicidal thoughts and depression are just being constantly fed into by everything in my life to the point it's clouding my fair judgement. I really think I need to go to a mental hospital but I'm not entirely sure. Please help.",30Aug2020,1

I like videogames, welding, electronics, computers, etc. But at the same time, im so incredibly bored of them. Ive loved computers for ever and would love to know everything about them, but for some reason i cant find the motivation, patience, or interest when i go to learn more. Videogames arent even rewarding anymore. Games i havent even beat and im so eager to see the ending of, im still bored of them.

People say that if you dont dedicate yourself to something you want, then you dont really want it that bad. But its not that i dont *want* it, i want to be able to do things i like, but i cant find any motivation or interest anywhere. I look through my game list 100 times, look up and down youtube video reccomendations, look for more stuff to learn and stuff to make and stuff to do, but i end up just sitting back and thinking about how lame everything is and why its so lame.

Even my best friend i dont know how to have fun with anymore. I love having my friends with me but then after a few hours its just i wanna be alone and go to sleep, even though im not even motivated to sleep anymore.

I was scared. I was scared of a lot of things. And the more I type about it the fears are coming back. I kinda just wanna take myself out. The only way I can deal with it is sleep.

What do you need?” And I get really upset when they dont respond because they are in the class. Or at times Im alone. Dont tell me its demons dont tell me its ghosts I know it isnt real. I dont want to get set back again. It happenes a lot where I think the delusions are real and it makes me scared and I cry. I think I should seek mental help but I have no money. Its upsetting. Wanna know whats funny? I feel like a faker even though im not. I kinda feel like I dont have it. But ik I do. Its hard to hide this from family. I dont think I have a name. Like im not me.

98,"I myself have Bipolar and lived away for years but visit every few months.

I am back during the pandemic but have noticed the past few years my sister is angrier than she used to be.

Just recently during the pandemic she lost her job and split up with her partner, he now has a new girlfriend pretty quickly after they broke up and she is living in social housing with their kids ( house was in his name and they were not married) 

So she has been stressed and telling me she is annoyed with my parents etc and wants to reduce contact.

I've tried to draw on my experience because I suspect but not entirely sure that she may have played a role in the breakdown of her relationship and job ie the way she reacts to situations becuase I know i have in the past and this is why she is less tollerant towards our parents who can be difficult.

I just messaged her explaining this and think i offended her.

She doesn't want to be on any medications ( used to be on beta blockers) 

I wondered if anyone has experience talking about these things with people they are concerned about because I think I have offended and insulted her when all I wanted was to help her avoid the mistakes I've made so she has a happier life.",30Aug2020,1
99,"
 Tl;dr: Sometimes feel suicidal, but I deny it when I gradually (and inevitably) get better; it's a cycle of misery, hope, and emotional amnesia.


Why do I feel this way? Logically speaking, there's no reason for me to feel like this. I know life can be good. Yet it still comes. Like the tide, it ebbs and flows, flooding my brain with these thoughts. At times I'll feel completely normal or even as if I have my shit together and can actually take on the world. Confidence and ambition is over the roof and out of orbit. My personality might even «improve» (read: more social as I’m quite reserved, more funny etc.). I will deny ever feeling suicidal: ""I was overreacting"", ""I was just being lazy"" and other excuses^(tm). When the tide hits, all traces of hope will be washed away. My body will be filled with this desire to just... *be gone.* Just as strongly as the thirst of a dehydrated person that's stranded on a tiny island. You're craving water to drink, but the only water available is the sea. Seeing so much water all day and not being able to drink it is fucking maddening. That's how I feel at my lows. And it's so frustrating because I *know* that I will feel better again and brush it off; I'm stuck in an unending cycle. Not like I ever had any confidence to actually do it (after researching I’m seriously baffled there's so many complications that can happen! Who knew it was that difficult to safely kill yourself?! Not me lol.)

104,"I think that i didn't say everything correctly in my previous post so i'm doing another one.

Again, over the last few years i got into some problems that while not so serious on a global scale were serious for me (and anyone else who has them). When i reached out to my friends for some emotional support they just dismissed everything, said there is nothing to worry about, everything is going to be fine and it's all in my head. It wasn't fine, but instead i lost all of my social circle later once i went to college and all the people there treated me with disdain. Then i met a girl who claimed to be a therapist and pressured me into accepting her therapy. It was basicly a month long non stop session of invalidation, guilt tripping, insults and accusations and it left me a mental wreck. Then i had my heart broken a few times in a row, sometimes in pretty cruel ways, people ghosting me on my birthday and multiple failures at pursuing my dream career. Also institutions and public people i believed in turned out to be weak, corrupt or downright evil and my belief system got broken into pieces. For all those years i knew only loneliness, dissapointment, humiliation and people telling me to ""just be more optimistic. Just worry less about this bullshit. We won't help you, we'll just remind you not to get frustrated"". My father was pretty much the only person who supported me through all of this. And because of this i grew more frustrated and angry. Not just over my failures. Mostly over people dismissing everything. Instead of helping me like they promissed they just told me to not be such a whiner, to just accept it, to just find other goals in life, to just smile more and mentioned that one time they've been dumped by their partner and how they dealt with it, and how they just found someone else next week like there was some comparisson between this and my problems. This is why my anger grew. Because people didn't allow me to be angry, sad or complain about my problems. So i grew more angry purely out of stubbornness. This continued for years with me growing more bitter, and started to flip out on people though somewhat rarely and i felt guilty over it after the fact. But a few months ago after more failures and some public unrest something snapped inside me and all my good emotions just died. I'm just a pent up ball of anger and bitternes and i don't feel guilty anymore. I sometimes think that maybe this isn't healthy and maybe i should stop but then i remember people telling me my emotions aren't valid, to just ""chill the fuck out"" like therapist lady used to say (it's been two years but i still despise that woman and rant about her constantly). Afterall, i am justified to be bitter. Life screwed me over and if you were me you would have done the same.",30Aug2020,1

110,"Hi! I am new to this subreddit, so if this type of post is not allowed or something please feel free to delete it. Also English is not my first language so sorry for any mistake. Thanks in advance. 

I am a little worried about my brother's girlfriend. They are together since 2 years ago, and I like her very well. But along these 2 years I have been thinking about ways that she behaves, that maybe are related:

\- She has her house **full of things**. Not trash, but books, cds, papers, scultures, furniture. Things she doesn't need. Some things are relatively ordered, like the books, but other things are in a pile, as she has no more space in her house (and it's a very big house, a 3 story house with garage) to organize them. When my brother say to her that maybe there is too much things and is time to throw some of them she reacts aggresively and anxious, so my brother ended up not bring it up to avoid an argue.

\- She is very kind, but in a little **anxious** way. She can be in the sofa more than 20 minutes without saying that needs to do something fast and comes back right away. And she is also very close, phisically speaking touches and kisses and hugs people very often, not so much to people be uncomfortable, but to think ""mmm she is a little strange"".

\- She is strongly into **conspiracy theories** and anything that is not the common thinking. She is an homeopathic doctor, thinks the occidental medicine is the worst and only uses homeopathy, alternative remedies, etc. She always thinks some form of mobile radiation or something hurts humans (always without details about what type of radiation), or that the goverment covered up mass murders, that Bill Gates created covid (that's actually a thing she said).

\- She cleans every **food** with an ozone cleaner, is very careful about what she eats. Always points out studies and so when someone is about to eat something she thinks is bad, like pasta. She only uses glass containers, does not uses foil, etc.

I talk to myself. I imagine like there's another me out there that reacts to what I'm saying. I create situations in my mind and talk accordingly.

In my defense, I literally have no one to talk to and no one to trust. My old friends became people who I feel uncofortable with. My family is abusive and exhausting to talk to. I can't meet new people by going outside or attending any school (not because of quarantine, cause weak health). 

I feel like I would go insane without talking to myself, but at the same time it makes me disturbed. If I would stop talking to myself the only words I would say is ""Hello/Goodbye/Gimme that"" with biological family.

Were now engaged and have bought our own house together (im saying this to paint a picture of where we are at)

I do have a full time job and have always worked, i dont rely on anyone for money (except for when i was diagnosed with MS last year, was ill and had to take time off) i still paid my half of the bills however my partner put a bit extra in. 

At times when it gets bad, ill admit have self harmed and tried to take my own life. This was a few years back. I had support from a friend/“mother figure” (55F) (i say this as she said she was the mum and wanted to adopt me just without the papers so to think of her as my mum). She was in my life from 14, im now 25. She was lovely and did a lot for me i cant lie, i never had parents so she also felt a “safe place”. id say when id feel bad i could probably rely on her to chat etc? Which she always told me she wanted me to do. BUT i never met anyone she knew, never her family etc despite her meeting everyone in my life. I felt a bit of a secret. Anyway, one day she text my boyfriend telling him i was doing things he didnt want in life when i was struggling with self harm. Shes 30 years older than me and previously had said she was jealous of me and my partner “but not in a bad way” and we are good together, she said her reason for this is that shes not found that yet. My partners father passed away last year and its been a struggle for both of us, however im always there to help/support as he is for me. 

My friends text caused upset for both of us and had my partners mind wondering, thinking she knew something he didnt.(which wasnt true), just to add. im never aggresive or name call etc.

My friend would tell me i had the mind of a toddler, and tell me that she was the adult and im the child, despite me disagreeing and advising im 25 and an adult. 

During covid, isolation felt too much and i was aware i was having a negative impact on my boyfriend and even more so after this text, i wondered how i could work on myself. my job stopped temp due to covid and i was stuck in day in day out, i noticed myself slipping into self harm/suicidal thoughts. After discussion with my boyfriend and him being concerned, i decided to self admit for a few weeks and work through my issues with the hospital. I did more intense sessions and therapy, I also wanted my partner to be aware i was making an effort. When i felt more stable i came home. 

My friend showed up and told me that i was doing this as a “fuck you” to everyone, and that im manipulative. It felt she was angry at the fact my partner hadnt left me due to her text. I never said anything to my friend about the text she sent to my partner (hed asked for advice as he could see me spiralling) he asked could we chat and let me know i still had people around me etc. it just upset me that if she felt a certain way, that she couldnt address it with me. 

im always super cautious of letting everyone know how grateful i am of support around me etc. Trying to reciprocate the love the best i can. And how if im ever too much, draining or they feel im crossing boundaries to tell me so i can be aware and change it. (Sometimes id say im not aware im doing it).  

I feel im doing everything i can to be well, be better and im really trying. Any help im offered professionally i take and even also save and pay for private sessions on top of this. I feel like an arsehole now and my friend has made me feel as though im a lost cause. Shes blocked me off everything and told me im a narcissist.",30Aug2020,1
118,"Hey people.

  
I think a big part of my mental issue is the fact that I just can't get over things. Over pretty much everything.  
That can mean things that happened years ago, confrontations, discussions or even just small emberassing moments. But also things that have just happen. Someone making a comment about me. A small confrontation at work. I can't stop thinking about those things for HOURS and of course those things make me mad or sad or both. Small things can literally ruin my day.  
I repeat the situation all over again in my head and think of things I should have done or said. This can be the silliest smallest thing ever. It will still drive me crazy.

119,"basically, Suite Life of Zach and Cody + on deck is my comforter. When ever my parents are fighting and it’s start to get worse (which causes anxiety attacks) I just watch an episode or 4. My parents heavily praise my brother. He IS the golden child. Anything he wants he gets. If I show a bit of emotions beside obeying I get banned off technology and forced to read and not allowed to be in my room unless it is to sleep! Once I was having that time of the month, and I yelled at my mum. I wasnt in the mood to waste my money on my brother. She goes tells my dad. He banned me from preordering the Nintendo switch game I had been waiting a YEAR for, banned me from walking into EBGAMES for 5 months, and I wasn’t allowed on my technology for a month and a half. Now, my brother swears and calls my mum a slut (which he does a lot, and calls me fat cunt, etc) they don’t do anything. Sorry for the story but this is where Zach and Cody fit it. I am a geek, I love manga, pop culture, art and music. I’m chubby and don’t have the best looks. My brother on the other hand, he is skinny, is in this academy for soccer, good looking and semi smart. In suite life, there’s an episode where Zach admits that he is jealous of his brother Cody sometimes because he thinks he’s liked more than him because of his looks and smarts. I remember watching it and being like, yeah I understand how you feel. I’m so sorry this is so long, I’ve poured my emotions onto this. I would just like to know if it’s normal? Should I seek help?

121,"I have few memories of being beaten, cursed at, and yelled at as a young child, and those that I have are hazy. However, what I do know is that I started to get hit around 6 times with a malleable metal when I made a mistake around when I was 5–6 years old. At this time, I started to witness severe verbal abuse at home in fights between my parents that led to torturous atmospheres in the family apartment. At one time, if I remember correctly, I was 6 and I think my mom was groaning on the bed in pain and telling my brother who was about 9 to ‘call an ambulance’. But my memories of that time are so hazy, like a distant dream. I should also mention that I was fostered by my grandparents for about 3 years in very early childhood, because my dad was severely depressed after losing his job. I think whether or not I was physically abused is debatable, as I could be just exaggerating the details of unpleasant memories, but what i know for certain is that my brother was severely physically abused, in a way that would possibly be illegal. When he was a very young child, like 7 years old, he was beaten so badly that a school nurse asked him what happened to him during a schoolwide physical examination… When he was older, he once got beat so horribly that the cane used on him SNAPPED because of how much force was used.

What I think affected me more than the physical beatings was the emotional torture I was subject to sometimes as a young child. My mom is either very nice to me, or absolutely horrible, some speculate that she may be a borderline. When she was angry, she would lose it. I remember that I was 9 and they had fought, so she was understandably upset. I was home from school and at lunch she just kept staring at me before suddenly she pressed a finger into my forehead and with gritted teeth, she told me she hates me. She curses, makes threats, insults, and devalues. She has threatened to kill me before, and she did not spare me the grisly details. She would talk about slicing her children up into little pieces, so that my dad would come home to the horrific scene, and tear my face off. As a child, my mom would tell me that my dad is a useless, stupid man, and that caused me to dislike my father for years. Of course, my dad isn't entirely innocent too. He would slap me very hard, and hit me with a belt, though he did it for discipline and is a much better, less volatile person than my mom. 

I think the beatings that could be constituted as ‘traumatic’ were when I was around 7–8 , and again when I was 9. That time, I believe she slapped me and corned me till I was on the ground, then dragged me and pushed me out of the door that way. When I was 10, I had a mini tantrum and I was pushed down to the ground, with my mom slapping, pinching, and scratching me. I had a small puncture in my arm after that and there were maybe a few drops of blood, but I barely remember…My mom has shoved me so that I landed on my back after I said a few words she didn't like, and that was when I was about 14. 

I have heightened sensitivity when people come close to me in a way I perceive to be ‘threatening’ in some way. I sometimes shudder when my mom or dad come too close and they are visibly agitated, though this response was much worse back when I was young. I had fantasies of running away, and I lived in a fantasy narrative in my own head for the majority of elementary school. I am sometimes plagued by disturbing imagery in my mind and I suffer greatly from depression, though I believe I fit the criteria for bipolar 1. I have a ‘flat affect’ and I always have had trouble communicating verbally with others.",30Aug2020,1

I have a few things going for me, and I do truly believe in those things, but it’s nothing extraordinary or completely out of the ordinary. The only thing I know for sure is that it’s this feeling of feeling like I have no voice at all in a world full of chatter.

Sometimes I wonder if I’ll ever achieve anything substantial in the end. I feel like philosophically for all of this suffering to be truly worth it in the long run is for there to be something good on the other side, right?

130,"I used to be way into science, especially biology. Evolution, natural selection, species relationships, genetics, anatomy, paleontology, conservation, and even just being around animals have all always fascinated me. Or at least, these things should. Right now though... I don’t know anymore. I feel like I ruined my own mind. I had other interests too, videogames (especially survival games and game about being different types of animals), reading, comics, TV shows, DND, drawing and art, and plenty of other things. I was also very emotionally invested in things I cared about. I had recently even had interests in romances after I realized I had a crush. (Things didn’t go well with said person, but we’re still friends). I’d also often fantasize about the things I liked. I would spend hours in my own head thinking about all sorts of things: space travel, what it would be like to travel the world, have a zoo full of extinct species, the biology of fictional creatures, how certain characters would interact with eachother, what it would be like if I had superpowers, how I would survive on a desert island, what it would be like to have a significant other, and thinking of dramatic and emotional scenes for my comics and stories. Now though, I feel like I can’t engage in my passions, not even science. 

I looked inside myself too deep while bored in quarantine. I was particularly depressed and didn’t feel like doing anything. Looking back, it’s quite obvious that I had depression. I was out of contact with my friends, my videogame system wasn’t working, nothing was on TV, and I just felt this feeling of uhhh... I’ll do it later. Not to mention I was still beating myself up over the fact that I still liked my crush despite her not liking me back. I could still fantasize and often did so regularly, although I did start to not feel right. 

I also looked at... adult media. I had, let’s say, unusual tastes in what I looked at, but a combination of depression and overindulgence led to only the most messed up stuff... causing a reaction. Again, I’ve ALWAYS been into some messed up stuff, but I was usually also fine with more regular and tame stuff. So, after finding an article about the dangers of porn addiction, I decided to quit looking at that stuff then and there. However, after about a week of feeling even more depressed and somewhat off put about things I was once fine with, I started really analyzing the stuff I was once into, while also in my depressed state, I couldn’t help but question which of my interests were influenced by said things, and what that said about me as a person.   I started connecting dots that didn’t need to be connected, that shouldn’t have been connected. Around this time, I found my interests and fantasies start to fade. I also started to see the world differently, I felt less like myself. I couldn’t relate to the world around me, I couldn’t get angry or passionate, I couldn’t get excited either. My inspiration was gone. 

This caused me to panic and research how I was feeling and what was causing it. I kept looking at mental disorder after mental disorder on google, without stopping to realize the obvious fact that I already had depression, anxiety, ADHD, and Aspergers, which could all contribute to such things. 

I had intrusive thoughts, which led to more googling, which led to even more intrusive thoughts, (as I looked up the intrusive thoughts shared by others online) to the point where I’m sure my fear of intrusive thoughts led to me preemptively creating them myself. 

I got existential, wondering about the meaning of life and death and the sheer pointlessness of everything. 

Now I see everything differently. I can’t help but see the things I liked in a darker tone. I can’t help but notice violence and cruelty, even when it’s used for comedy. I feel like I tricked myself into thinking I’m a violent person for liking violent or dark things, when I still remember always having an aversion to most violence, unless it is used in some joking absurdist way. I have intrusive fearful thoughts of becoming a murderer or a serial killer because of a combination of things due to a combination of factors (Those being the weird stuff I was already into, the fact that I absorbed a lot of the true crime stuff my mom watched, I over analyzed my taste in certain violent stuff I was into, I feel different and disconnected now, I feel like I lack empathy and emotion, trying to act like myself feels fake like I’m putting on an act, I keep dredging up older intrusive thoughts and fears about the same thing, I’m having new intrusive thoughts, I over analyzed the way I could essentially turn on and off my empathy while looking at certain things, my analytical mind itself, the way I see myself when hearing about “they were always the quiet ones, the less social ones, the smart ones, the ones with anger problems, etc.”) I remember one intrusive thought I’ve always had was “if you become a more confident person, you’ll do this stuff in real life”. I hate this feeling. It was almost out of my head, nothing more than a small intrusive thought in the back of my mind, but now it has overtaken everything. 

Self love is difficult when you are afraid of yourself. Fear of this thought made me unable to view myself as confident, has made me unable to view myself as a good person, has made me afraid to do the things I enjoy or view the things I enjoy, I can’t picture my happy fantasies anymore, I feel guilty and disgusted with myself, afraid of myself. I feel like engaging in my passions and pleasures will somehow lead to me becoming the person I fear becoming. I know that’s all just fear mongering in my mind, but it feels so real. I it feels more real than the actual reality going on around us, more real than my memories and past experiences. I feel sick. I just want to forget all this and go back to my life, to start over from June. 

I’m only 21 years old, just entering adulthood, it’s my last year of College, and I fear I permanently damaged or changed myself. 

I know I used to be different than this, that theses fears are nothing more than intrusive thoughts. I even have solid proof (my emotions were real, I felt real empathy and still want to feel real empathy, I know I cared about people in the past, I fell in love). But they pop up whenever I try to engage in what I like, they pop up whenever I try to be myself, they pop up whenever I try to be normal, they pop up when I try to meditate. I keep having this thought of a documentary about how I was normal before I lost my mind and became like this, and about how the signs were always there. It’s chilling. 

The mornings are especially rough, since coming into consciousness is when my mind buzzes the most. That’s when I feel like I “reset” and everything I do throughout the day to feel better about myself is gone again. 

I just want to look at the world the same way I used to again, but whenever I try doing that, I feel like I’m faking it, and faking emotions scares me. Having passion scares me. I know it’s no different than the “Hitler drank water therefore drinking water makes you evil” way of thinking, but my mind has made connections that I don’t know how to break.",30Aug2020,1

132,"I've been trying to pin point my exact depression waves lately and thought deep about this. Just now using memories not related to the depression waves, I pinpointed the exact time they all happened.

June or July 2017, it lasted less then 24 hours

November 2017, it lasted I believe 3 days

February 2018, it lasted  5 days

April 2018, it lasted 3 days

I'm not sure about this one but I know I'm missing one, so it has to be this one: in beginning-mid of 2019... I don't remember exactly. But I believe it lasted over a week or maybe even two weeks with sucidal thoughts towards the beginning-end (no, I am not sucidal, nor do i attempt to do it)

And recently June 28-July 28. It started out with me loosing most of my interests over the next week period. Unlike my other waves which I immidatly lost all interests. And around July 12-27 was the worst I ever had imo. 

Now it back since a week, but it's not as bad. I still have interests and all, I just feel sad deep inside cause I'm lonely irl. And that's been the cause of my problems ever since, due to loneliness. Only this time the sucidal thoughts are there but not as much (again, I am not sucidal, nor do i attempt to do it). I have even considered self-harm to help deal with the emotional pain but I'm strong enough not to and just suffer the wave out like the other years. Considering this year I have online friends it's easier as I sometimes feel less lonely but is still difficult. I know how to cope with it and I have considered an online therapist. But I've done my research on these topics as I support others. Professionals just won't be able to help. What I have tho isn't depression yet. It's minor or as I often reffer to it as ""semi-depression"". I know I'll make it through this one as I've made it through the others with no support whatsoever. Even now i don't rely on a support. But I do have questions tho? Why is this happening like waves? Why is it means, like is it supposed to mean something?

It's been getting much worse lately. The things I would do in the past to distract my thoughts no longer have the same effect. I can hardly talk to people anymore. I feel helpless and weak. It's really pathetic. I feel ashamed because according to society I am better off than any other group of people but still can not pull up out of this nose dive. I don't see the point of trying but I'm not ready to forsake my family and friends. I'll take the pills but I need to know how to get them.",30Aug2020,1
146,"Let's start. I'm a 39 year old male. Mildly overweight, up until March I worked out alot. Like a 5 day a week CrossFit habit for 3 years. I drink. I really enjoy craft beer going to breweries , the fun of trying different beers from new area. I quit smoking 3.5 years ago. I work full-time 4 10 hour days a week as a production supervisor in a manufacturing plant. 

So lately I've been just overwhelmed. 
I get a email at work I start to panic to the point my chest hurts.  I've had the position for 2 months and it's so much more then I expected between deadlines and staff issues. But the pay increase was huge as will help me and my girlfriend in the long run. But I feel like we are never going to get ahead and that drives me to be depressed more then normal. We have the normal issues couples have nothing major no infidelity no violence no secrets. Ten years together and no sign of nothing she supports me in everything. But yet every day I'm afraid she is gonna leave or I have that thought I'm gonna come home and she is with someone else. I don't have much communication with my family and I am constantly awaiting to hear something happened to my parents as they are in their senior years that I dread ever text message I get. I ride passenger in the car I am grabbing and panicking and closing my eyes when the car 5 car lengths up brakes. But I drive completely fine
I have a neighbor that is heavily medicated that threatens to kick my ass on a regular basis just because in his mind  I(me) think I'm better then him. So basically I feel like I can't leave our apartment at times. Especially when it get dark. And I dwell on every interaction with him to the point I almost throw up.

I've sent myself into panic attracts growing up with asthma. If my inhaler would run out I would get so worked up that I couldn't breath.

When I leave the house I have to lock the door a certain way and check it multiple times. There is times I've gone down the road and had to turn around to make sure the door was locked.  And go thru it again.

Lately I've been having a harder time. 
In march i injured my back at the gym. Was out of work for a month that coincidentally happens around the covid shut down. So my one escape was gone. I haven't been back as gyms just reopened.  

I've been so worried about money and  such that the slightest thing would upset me. To the point I would just stuff my face.  In the car fast food junk food. Just shoving down.  

I am constantly worried about my health. The slightest chest pain I worry. 

Even writing this out is making my chest hurt and feel like palpations. It's weird.

I know you can get your self managing this but I don't know where to start. I hate the idea of medication. 

I just don't know where to begin.

Any advice",30Aug2020,1
147,"I have/had episodes of depression since my teenage years, I went through a phase recently (all June/July) and my mental health is recovering slowly again but I feel like my body is giving me all the signs that I really need to change some things once and for all for good. I'm starting to get back pain and pain in my legs from constant laying/hiding in bed, that is something I can recover from by working out but-

What's new is that I can't eat properly anymore, normaly I'm the type that can eat large amounts of food 24/7 and eats more when stressed out but now if I eat like two bites of a slice of bread I feel full or a small plate of pasta makes my stomach feel like it's filled with stones.

I could be to blame for most of my unhappiness but it just feels like attempts to create some form of happiness would inevitably revert to hopelessness, gloom, and bitterness.

149,"this year has been absolutely horrible for me, it had such a promising start but obviously it took a sharp turn for the worse mid march. i never considered myself one with anxiety or all that but after everything that has happened this year both worldwide and in my personal life have just picked me back up and then knocked me back down even harder, making me even worried to do the things i normally like. 

i have zero motivation to do the things i enjoy. i dont have any hobbies anymore besides watching the same thing on youtube over and over again and browsing twitter and reddit for hours on end. ive tried to get into new things but they last for at most a month until i give up and go back to doing nothing. 

i also cant help but keep getting into these negative thought patterns, and although i do believe them to be true, im seriously trying to break them to no avail. ive “disappeared” for days, and while a few people noticed, even those people didnt bother to try and contact me. im nobody’s first choice, and that realization is starting to settle in hard. negative things friends have said to me keep repeating through my head like a chorus and im so close to just cutting every single person who is important to me off. 

almost every single relationship in my life is toxic, and while id rather not go into detail about some of them ive just never felt a genuine connection to someone, and ive also let toxic people shape who i am since i was in middle school, which i feel like might be where a lot of my problems come from. now i feel like everyone im around catches my lazy, apathetic personality like a flu. 

i have done absolutely nothing with myself this past year at all. i went to the gym a lot early this year but i think we all know how that went. im unemployed, my grades are lower than theyve ever been, all my friends and family remind me of this and yet i still do it. no matter how hard i try and motivate myself to finally do something with my life i either give up entirely or eventually get “bored” with it and passively stop. 

i honestly just cant enjoy myself anymore. playing video games doesnt feel rewarding, doing any kind of work is the equivalent of my brain climbing mt. everest, and even being with people just makes me more anxious than the company is worth, despite me always feeling lonely. i hope this is just a fluke, but honestly this year has been the worst of my life. i dont know what i can do, ive tried for so long so many times, and to no avail. im honestly desperate so anything i can do that may work even in the slightest would be a massive help.",30Aug2020,1

151,"I'm on the fence about going inpatient due to covid and being pregnant currently. I looked at the website for the hospital I'd be admitted to and they don't mention Covid at all. It's also exclusively mental health, so I'm worried they won't have the resources to appropriately monitor and manage my difficult pregnancy.

I've tried handling my mental decline outpatient with my providers so far, but it feels like it's getting out of hand. I don't really want to be treated by doctors and nursing staff that don't really know me or my situation. There are so many meds I've tried that aren't for me, my treatment team and I have decided TMS was the next step for me, and this facility would be the one I'd need to go to for that, but I know inpatient means meds. And I'm worried they aren't going to be upfront about the associated risks during pregnancy.

Also, I know it seems trivial, but I really need several of my pillows to be able to sleep comfortably, and my music. So going in patient I'd be losing access to a lot of my coping mechanisms and stuff. And idk if my personal items would be allowed. They've allowed them before, but that was before Covid.

I also need to eat more frequently and in smaller portions than 3 main meals a day, and can't keep water down. So I'd need doctor's orders for accomodations for that as well.

I've been hospitalized 7-8 times now, across 4 different facilities, but my most recent one was almost 2 years ago and a different facility so I just don't really know what to expect anymore.",30Aug2020,1

The problem is, since graduating I've been stuck at my mother's house which is small and hard to have private phone calls in. I want to talk to someone, but don't want my family to find out or hear what I'm talking about. My family are massive conspiracy theorists and my dad has been a stoner/drug dealer so I guess I would spend a lot of time talking about them and I want to talk about issues my family don't know about such as the fact I used to make myself throw-up as a teenager.

156,"So this is a long story, but I'll try my best, and if anything needs further explanation I'll answer questions in the comments. 

I've dealt with very bad anxiety for a long time, which has effected my mood and behavior and even how my brain has been processing it seems. I've dealt with maybe depersonalization feelings nearly consistently for the past 2 years. I say 'maybe' because I wasn't diagnosed, but these feelings just make me feel disconnected with my body and mind, and I feel bad when I try to claim myself as me, as if I don't want to be myself. At this point, my thoughts nearly feel like a static TV and I don't really have any. A lot of times I see people talking about something they enjoy, I struggle to try to support it, because I can't help but to think it's stupid and annoying. 

I know there has been at least 3 big impacts on my anxiousness and brain in the past decade. First, my mom passed away. Years later, I dealt with a horrible break up, and that was the end of 2017. I consistently hadnt been in a place I felt safe and comfortable in since then, last year during an emotional break down I had to call the police on my aunt, which was the 3rd big impact. I moved 200 miles away to my cousins house with hope for remission from my anxiety. But after about 9 months, a few days before my birthday, she kicked me out and I had no where to go but to my new girlfriends house in another state. 

The girlfriend I live with is nice to me, and supportive, and I believe I am safe here. However, since I've had bad relationships and bad experiences I'm having a hard time feeling so safe. I overthink things, and I think I become delusional by my own thoughts. I have a very hard time controlling my emotions and I get very depressed at random times. Previous therapists have commented on my abandonment issues, my parents were neglectful and I hadn't felt a sense of security, and I've been in 3 serious relationships and each have hurt me and abandoned me in one way different from the next. I have a very hard time letting my guard down. Which is probably very reasonable, because I hadn't had a chance to put my guard down possibly ever in my life. I always felt like I didn't need anxiety medicine because I knew what was wrong with my life and I wanted to fix it myself. Being kicked out of Holland, Michigan was unexpected, and living with a girl I've only known for 3 months is a lot to process. I just know my brain still feels like a static TV though, and I can't catch up with myself. I'm just sick of dealing with my overthinking and paranoia and depression. I don't know what else I can do. 

If it's relevant I was medically diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression, and I'm self diagnosed ASD (it's difficult to get a medical diagnosis)

165,"Hi folks, 

I'll preface this by saying that I'm in the UK.

- It's important to note that for the past year or so my dad (44) has been (I think) addicted to co-codamol tablets. He was originally told to get them for gum pain and just never stopped taking them. More recently, before I left, he was also excessively consuming energy drinks (about 7 cans a day). Me and my brother (16)  have repeatedly warned him that both the tablets and the energy drinks are bad for him, but as he was still functioning normally, didn't push too hard. 
- I moved out of the family home at the start of August, having moved back there for a year after my Master's. I'm now living/working in a near-ish city. So left in the family home now is my dad, brother, and brother's cat. 
- Around a week after I moved out, according to my dad, he tried going cold turkey on the tablets and energy drinks. This coincided with his coming off (he works on/off periods at work) a period at work where he'd worked 60 hours over four days as a carer. He began feeling sick, and says he also injured his back somehow. 
- A few days after this, he started an argument with my brother and apparently got super aggressive, saying he was going to kill himself/overdose, etc. because nothing in his life is worth anything. He also complained that my brother, as he's growing up, will be leaving him soon &amp; then he'll be alone. I rang him that night and had a fairly lucid conversation with him where he told me he felt depressed but not suicidal, and agreed to potentially bring it up at the doctors the next day. When my brother woke up the next day his indoor-only cat was nowhere to be found, though he was eventually found sheltering in the garden. My dad *must* have let him out, but says he no recollection of doing so. He also didn't attend his doctor's appointment. 
- Since then, according to my brother, my dad has been laid on the sofa 90% of the time, complaining of feeling itchy, randomly talking to himself, potentially watching porn in the living room (my brother isn't sure but thought he heard it), and letting household jobs pile up. My brother has been vacuum cleaning every day, but says that there are no longer any clean pots in the house other than those he washes to make himself food - my dad has been ordering a lot of takeaway food through his phone (although I'm not sure how, as he has virtually no money). 
- My brother says he is coherent sometimes, but only briefly. This makes sense as when he replies to any messages I send him, he seems fine, but it takes him a few days to actually reply to anything, and seems to forget whatever we've spoken about previously (eg. I have an important letter that's been sent to that address, and have asked him to look out for it, but seem to have to remind him every time we speak). When I ring him, 90% of the time he doesn't answer. 
- Is this an extended withdrawal period from the tablets, do you think? Or does it sound like something else? How can I help him? He refuses to go to the doctor's/says he will but never does, whenever I or my siblings suggest it. He's had periods of bad mental health previously (my sister - his daughter - died a decade ago, and my mum cheated on and walked out on him around the same time), but he's always managed to function still. It's hard for me to get to the house because I don't drive and it requires a length (and expensive) bus journey to and from his house.

174," i am constantly worried if i might have early stages of schizophrenia or some mental illness. I have no haluciancions and no delusions, but whenever i dont have something to concentrate on or something to keep my mind busy, i remember that i might develop some bad illness and lose control over my actions and mind. Basically after i get rid  of the toughts they come back as if i want to clarify something 100%, but it looks like i cannot reach that 100%  so this is an infinite loop.




I smoked weed about a month ago when i was home alone with nobody to talk to and somehow i convinced myself into thinking that i am crazy.

Weed has always given me anxiety if i smoked too much, but i always had a lot of fun in safe places and with good people, but the last time was pure madness and i didnt like it. Since then i never smoked weed and i plan on staying away from it.
I never abused it, smoked maybe once every 1/2/3 or 4 weeks, depends. With this pandemic i didnt smoke for like 2 months. 
Recently i smoked at a cabin with friends when i had 2g for 2 nights, and then i was home alone for a week, when i smoked a joint  almost every night for 4 or 5 days with the boys.




I searched so many symptoms on google and i dont know how i feel now, like i have different scenarios in my head with those symptoms. I read about something like a prodromal schizophrenia but i am not sure if i feel that way . for example finding a symptom of sucidal toughts: i love my friends and family and i dont wanna lose anybody you know.... &lt;&lt;Lmao writing the last words made me emotional i almost cried :))&gt;&gt;,  those suicidal toughts  might never came to my mind if i never read those on google).

 Another example of ""google induced"" sympyom would be from reading different posts like ""i feel like i will lose control of myself"". After i read those i kinda take it serious and ask myself ""what if i lose my mind someday?"", and it creeps me out like what the hell.

After my research i think i might have ocd since this tought that i might become crazy keeps coming to my mind and it stresses me out. ... 


BUT , For about 2 weeks i felt good , UNTIL  2 days ago when i started thinking about this again.  Can ocd work that way? Feel bad for a period, the have a good time, then come back ??  During those 2 weeks i might have remembered these feelings but they passed with no problem.

If these bad feelings and toughts didnt come to my mind, i could even 1000000% say that i am experiencing a glow up since i feel more talkative than before generally ( i am a very shy and introverted person since forever) and i exercise regularly after a program, i dont like being alone and i cant resist staying inside without meeting my  friends when the sun goes down. 


Should i be worried? (I was worried before with many different things like skin cancer , testicular cancer when i would basically feel my testicles over and over again looking o google etc, mouth cancer, etc. Everytime i searched and panicked until somehow i reassured myself that i am fine, but this time is weird since i feel like i am the only one that can say wether i am fine or not and i keep analysing this over and over ). 

The reason why i wrote this big ass text was to find that release from someone and  to take out some of the stress.


Thank you.",30Aug2020,1
175,"TW: mentions of suicide, alcohol, drugs
I’m a teenage girl who still lives at home. I’m going into my last year of high school and I have a lot of mixed feelings about life, I think I might have some sort of mental illness, but then again, I think I might be overreacting. I’m just looking for advice.
For a brief background, without being too too personal: 
I was in a very toxic “friendship” all through out elementary school. Looking back on it, those two girls were extremely manipulative towards me, mentally and emotionally. For example, one of them would call me and say that if I didn’t go to her house and hang out with her she would take her life. (I was about 11 at the time). No matter how much they did stuff like that I kept coming back to them because I didn’t have any other friends, and I think this was detrimental to my social development. Seeing as now I never talk to anyone, I don’t share my opinion, I cry when I have to talk in class, and I can’t talk to people like waiters or order food at a drive through because I get so stressed. That friendship went on from grade 3 (10 y/o) to grade 6 (12/13 y/o)
When I was 12 my older brother got sick and lost all his memory. A few years later he started abusing alcohol and drugs. He used me and my younger brother, (stealing our money, hiding drugs in our room, etc.) He was suicidal for a time. Because of all that I never got much attention from my parents, and when I did it was usually kind of patronizing or making me feel guilty for being alive.
Things definitely got better and I found a group of friends who I thought were much better for me,  but through this pandemic and spending time away from them and talking to others I think they might be bad friends. I’ve come to realize they can just be all around judgemental and kind of condescending at times. I’m not sure if I should leave that group or if I should just stick it out for one more year before they go off to university because I don’t have any other friends and I hate being lonely.
School starts on Thursday and I have a lot of stress towards it. I’ve had things that seem like panic attacks and breakdowns because of school and I’m also afraid to go back and have to face my group of friends. 
Also my parents kind of don’t listen to me when I tell them about problems about my physical heath. For example, I had a cavity and got it filled back in April but it still hurts/is sensitive, I keep telling my parents about it but they “haven’t got around to making an appointment”. It’s not big things but just in general sometimes it feels like they don’t care about my well being. 
I’m also in the closet, I have personally come to terms with being bisexual, but I’m afraid to tell my family. 
In general I just sometimes feel worthless, not worthy of having friends, I’m scared to talk to people I don’t know (i get super stressed when I have to talk to a waiter, etc.)
All in all I don’t know if I’m just being dramatic/overreacting, or if I should talk to someone/seek professional help, and I just need advice on how to handle all these things. Also just looking for someone to talk to. 
If you have more questions please ask, I’m very open about myself and my past. 
Thank you &lt;3",30Aug2020,1

177,"I tried to post on r/off my chest but they automatically took it down 

My dads a sad racist

He grew up really poor- he’s white trailer- has done better for me and works a lot 
But has been yelling at my mom every morning as long as I remember and then yelling at me I yell back 

Maybe in 2017 punch a glass window right by my face when I said “black lives matter “ 

He is an alcoholic- has so many issues has always really avoided me - he wants love and it’s hurting me cause I just scream at him now -we hardly talk - he’s always yelling and bitter

He told my mom “she hates me “ but abuses her all the time 
He’s been going on racist rants in bars 
And I’m worried he’s gonna get hurt or filmed and lose everything 
He’s absolutely terrible but his mental health is stupid and he’s insane 
He’s fucking cruel but then you see the humanity and I know he’s deeply hurting 
I have to live with him for the year but he screams and it makes me so fucking sad

My mom is really passive and physically disabled 
And holds micro racism because he’s a bully to her when I talk to her she’s different 

I don’t know I’m having issues being here and abusing drugs (not alcohol) but like him 

I rage at him like him - and sometimes feel like the world is plotting against me - but that’s their twisted minds but I feel like I can’t be near them or it’s gonna absorb - but I’ve gotta be careful how I talk in my mind or aloud or I’ll allow something- like be being cruel or snapping back opens a flood gate - but allowing it to have a gate in my mind was inserted when I thought the word “gate” 
Ya know - I feel like this is particular thinking but sometimes I freak myself out and don’t know what to think 

But I’ve googled mental issues and I feel not always bad but 
I don’t even know if I should post 
But does anyone relate 
I don’t want to vanish because I feel bad 

I don’t wanna go down racist because of association- I feel so bad for them 

They are honestly just so ignorant and self consumed in their negitive hell",30Aug2020,1

I showed signs of depression from a very young age &amp; would complain to my mum about being sad.

I really want to be a writer, but i would be horrified if i ever became famous. This is because famous ppl have no privacy &amp; autobiographers can go into famous ppl's private lives without their permission. I think u can sue in these cases- but given the power of the press &amp; corporations- it would probably be unsuccessful.

It's not my fault that racism exists and just because I have white privelege doesn't mean my life is easy, it just means my life didn't get harder because of who I am. and I think a lot of people think that every white person doesn't understand how bad racism is and I agree that most don't I don't really like to think about racism or people's races. It just upsets me and I don't understand why God allowed it to exist in the first place. If he can apparently do anything why doesn't he stop it?

190,"I don’t know if this has a name but I’ve been feeling this way for 6 years. I’d prefer not to talk about *what* I see or hear about but periodically I’ll run into a video game, TV show or movie that I watch for a while. Something just bugs me about it and I turn it off. Then I end up losing sleep over it for a couple of days at best and 1-4 months at worse.

Like if something bothers me about it, I’ll have obsessive thoughts about it and constantly relive what bothered me about it indefinitely. I avoid it but it ends up popping up everywhere or I keep associating other things with it. The longest it’s happened for was like 6 months. Usually it happens for 2-3 weeks. Recently I’ve had it nearly 2 months and even then I’m not sure if it’s passed or not.

Sometimes it’s actual horror or disturbing/heavy stuff. Other times it’s something innocent like Enter The Gungeon. Sometimes it’s a dream I have.

Like giving an example I played Metal Gear 5: Phantom Pain and felt like the opening hospital sequence was intense. Of course I didn’t *feel* it at first but then I couldn’t sleep one day. The following week I had obsessive thoughts and aversion toward anything “Hospital” or “Military” themes. Right now it doesn’t bother me but I haven’t touched that game since.

Or like Assassins Creed 2. I forgot the name of the side content about the guy going “Oh my god history is wrong there’s aliens and shit” but the moment I discovered what the glyphs had to show me it took me 2 hours before feeling off about it. Then I lost sleep again, had more thoughts and aversion towards “Historical” or “Alien” stuff and even dropped a history course I was planning on taking the next college semester because of how I felt. It ended in a month, but again I haven’t touched the game I spent $50 on.

Hell even typing about this makes me feel queasy again. Do me a favor and try not to mention nang particular fiction because it might be another one of those things I was bothered about.",30Aug2020,1
191,"The title sums it up perfectly. 
I’ve been suffering with anxiety and depression, and after years of therapy I was starting to get better.
But lately I’m slipping back into depression and crippling anxiety.
It started all with the lockdown and since then I’ve always tried to do something about it. I had many mental breakdowns and depressive episodes but I wanted to get better again, so instead of isolating myself (once the lockdown ended where I live of course) I’ve always tried to go out and not to cancel on my friends and not to give up on my hobbies.
But this crippling anxiety is making me miserable. 
I feel like nobody really wants me around and it just worsened lately since I’ve discovered that some of my closest friends are backstabbing bitches, i’m having a rough time with my bf of almost two years, and my relationship with my mom is just terrible.
I feel like I did wrong somewhere along the way and it’s my fault that people dislike me. I really don’t know who to talk to and who to trust. I don’t want to talk about it to my bf even tho I know he’s the only one who would be there for me bc I’d like for us to get over our relationship’s problems first, and I don’t want to look like I’m fishing for sympathy.

I just want to feel loved and wanted.
I’m getting kind of tired and I’m considering disappearing for a bit from social media and from my friends group.
I just needed to vent bc I keep a diary where I usually write down all my breakdowns, but this time I just needed some feedback idk.",30Aug2020,1
192,"I am struggling with something that I’ve kind of determined to be true of myself lately, and would like anyone to comment their thoughts for me to have something to read about this.

It seems that unless I am talking to someone, and have a special kind of thing going with them and they’re in my life in some kind of way as “my person”, I’m not content with just being by myself. I am constantly seeking out a partner or relationship. I am constantly using dating apps to see if I can match with someone who I really click with, in hopes of finding a happy and healthy long term, serious commitment and relationship with them. I want to find love and happiness so bad for myself that it’s almost an obsession of mine to always be trying to match and start the steps and process of dating them. 

Two months ago, I went on an amazing first date after matching with a guy on Tinder. We were seemingly both looking for the same thing, and totally hit it off. We continued to see each other as much as we could make it work and talked a lot both texting and FaceTiming for hours at night. I thought (didn’t ask, didn’t make it a conversation) that we were boyfriend and girlfriend. We would use that terminology together. It was out in the open how I felt things were going for us, at least. 2 weeks ago I learned he had met up with a girl from Tinder and I immediately felt like a stab in my gut. I felt like I needed to have a conversation about how I see this as an exclusive thing and no longer use dating apps because I found someone that I was happy with to date. I did that last night after thinking about it but not doing it for the last 2 weeks. It went about as bad as I thought it would. I am not sad and frankly feeling a little heart broken. I thought we were good together and on the same page. He wants to play the field. He was very open and honest about how he realized I was seeing us in the way I described here, but how he didn’t know how to say he wasn’t. He didn’t want to hurt my feelings. Well, they’re very hurt. I told him, please just be honest with people next time and early on. It sucks to match with someone and think this is it— to learn they’re still seeking out something else that I cannot provide for them. 

This is where my poor state of mental health kicks in. I am in my own head with how I cannot be good enough for him to want to be done playing the field. I am good enough to have around to have lots of sex with, and drink with, but not to become emotionally invested with, and see a future with. I try so hard to fill the void of loneliness by just getting right back to swiping to find another guy who I click with and can increase the serotonin I am always actively seeking.

How can I teach myself that my happiness does not need to be determined by having another person of the opposite sex who is a love interest and likes me back, and just be happy with being by myself. There has been times where the loneliness and feeling of desperation for a relationship keeps me up at night or triggers long days of staying in bed depressed and feeling sad for myself that I still can’t find a healthy relationship, meanwhile everyone around me in my life has that. I am so dateable, and do not have a hard time getting guys to match with me and talk to me, but it just seems that I’m not worthy of anything more than the friends with benefits kind of situation. 

If I did not care so much about my worthiness in the dating world, or having a companion in my life, I think my overall mental health would be in better shape. Is there anyone reading this that thinks there is something more that I need to figure out for myself before I can get past the other stuff I’ve described in this post? I am very desperate to figure it out. I want to be done feeling sad, depressed and lonely. I want to feel happy and fulfilled with just my own self.

TLDR:
I am very aware that I am too caught up in the fact that I cant be happy unless there is a partner to help me feel complete, and I want that to change so I am not always getting heartbroken by getting dumped from short not so serious dating app relationships. Also-I fall too hard and fast. Dating apps are not helping my depression.",30Aug2020,1

199,"*(TLDR at the end)*

First of all, I’m terribly sorry if this is the 10,000th post you’ve seen about this topic. 

First time posting here, took a lot of courage. Anyway, what this post is about: I have low self-esteem just like many other people. I worry a lot and lack confidence in (most) social settings, probably more than is healthy for me. Some of the things I ponder about very often:

1. University: I just finished my bachelor study (University of Applied Sciences - it works a bit different where I’m from) and I’m pursuing a masters degree which starts tomorrow (*~~help me~~*). However, the courses are much more in depth and of a much higher level than what I was used to. I worry that I’m not smart enough to pass any of the courses.
2. Career: I have always had this idea and goal to be successful career-wise. However, even after four years of university (of applied sciences) I feel highly incompetent. I’m clueless as to what I’m good at and what my real strengths are, if I even have any. I'm afraid I'll never succeed in achieving any of my goals.
3. Relationships: I (22 M) have only had two relationships, both lasting about half a year, give or take. I’m more of an introvert and it basically stops me from approaching girls in real life. To counter this I use online dating apps. However, successes I have had very little. Hence, low self-esteem. Am I uninteresting? Am I ugly? Am I too shy? ... who knows.
4. Social awkwardness: this pretty much boils down to me being an introvert and it’s not only when dating. I worry what others (friends + strangers) think of me and I always pray to God that I don't embarrass myself while in public or say/do something stupid. 

I’ve read a few articles ([this one](https://www.psychalive.org/low-self-esteem/) was pretty interesting, if anybody is interested) and the gist of it is that one should practice self compassion and try to not listen to the voice in your head. However, these articles seem difficult in that it’s written as if it can be done with the snap of a finger. And to be honest, I have very little confidence in overcoming this as well. 

I’m looking for advice on how I can overcome (or fight) my low self-esteem. I’m sure there are people out there who’ve successfully done this and it would be wonderful to hear some real life examples. I genuinely think this would help me more than any article from the internet.

**TLDR:** I have low self-esteem and I’m looking for (real life) advice on how to combat this.

Thanks to anyone reading this.",30Aug2020,1

I’ve still tried very hard every day to leave my house and push myself though and do exposures.

Then today my family was helping my brother and his girlfriend move. I agreed to go too because I’d be with family so it seemed like a safe exposure. Long story short my anxiety started at lunch and then got worse as we did the first load. Once we were heading back for the second load I had a panic attack. It felt like everything I was touching while moving things was contaminating me with the virus, I just felt covered in ‘bad stuff’. I don’t know how else to explain it.

So my question is for those who have done exposure therapy before. This obviously doesn’t feel like a successful attempt. What do I do now? Is there a way to turn this around today so it’s a positive exposure somehow? Is it possible I’m pushing myself too hard? About a month ago I had an exposure go bad and my anxieties dramatically increased afterwards. I’m really scared this will keep happening.",30Aug2020,1
205,"So I live across the world from my long time best friend and he's been suffering with manic depression and possibly more (he hasn't been able to get a proper diagnosis) and he just turned 18 recently. He is living with his mom and since his birthday she has been completely neglecting him, she leaves him with no money, no food, not even any toilet paper. Me and my family has been sending him a bit of money to help him out but now we're broke so we can't any more. Several people have tried to convince him to go to a food bank or something but he says his anxiety is too high to even walk out the door. Its been 3 days since he last ate and he almost passed out a few hoirs ago trying to get a drink of water. I just don't know what to do anymore and I was hoping somebody could at least give me some advice or resources that could help him. Hes already had a suicide attempt in the last month and I'm trying to prevent that the best I can.

We are also trying to fly him out to the US with us so he can live here but I dont know what subreddit to get help for that on. Any advice would be much april",30Aug2020,1

209,"Ever since I was a kid, I've never had a close connection to anyone. Not even with my parents, siblings, or grandparents. I would always know when I liked or cared for someone but never in a way where I cared enough if they died. I can care about someone but not too deeply. Growing up, whenever a family member died I wouldn't feel anything. I would be so confused as to why I would be the only one who was just so calm and emotionless while everyone else was so sad and heartbroken. I've always been this type of quiet and emotionless person even as an adult. The only time I would have ever felt a close connection to someone was with one of my ex girlfriends who showed me how strong love can change someone's life. But that didn't last long either because we broke up after 2 1/2 years of being together. To this day I still can't feel anything for anyone, not even my closest friends. I can tell that I care for them but I can't feel it at all. 

On a side note, I tried to explain this to a friend a month ago and she got angry at the thought that someone like me who has helped her through so much and who has been through so much with her can't feel a thing if she died. I tried to explain that I can't help it and that I've been like this since a child but we haven't talked since.

I’m pretty sure this isn’t just me, but basically, I live in a daydream 24/7

Whenever I get the chance, I daydream completely, I pretend I’m an alternate universe with other people, and typically we just do other daily life things. 

However, when I am doing something, such as homework or eating, I imagine myself doing those things in other dimensions, I imagine other people/characters sitting and living next to me, doing their own things and such, and it’s a perfectly normalized thing for me now. 

I feel like constantly doing thing made it harder for me to distinguish reality from fiction, and it’s sort of hard for me to do daily life things. For instance, I’m learning how to drive (I’m a teenager) but I haven’t driven in such a long time since whenever I do drive, I constantly lose my train of thought and start daydreaming back in my new world I have made, my parents think I’m just a bad driver or something, they don’t like me driving either way.

I’m not sure if this is a mental health thing, I was just wondering if other people do this.",30Aug2020,1

 Tl;dr: Sometimes feel suicidal, but I deny it when I gradually (and inevitably) get better; it's a cycle of misery, hope, and emotional amnesia.


Why do I feel this way? Logically speaking, there's no reason for me to feel like this. I know life can be good. Yet it still comes. Like the tide, it ebbs and flows, flooding my brain with these thoughts. At times I'll feel completely normal or even as if I have my shit together and can actually take on the world. Confidence and ambition is over the roof and out of orbit. My personality might even «improve» (read: more social as I’m quite reserved, more funny etc.). I will deny ever feeling suicidal: ""I was overreacting"", ""I was just being lazy"" and other excuses^(tm). When the tide hits, all traces of hope will be washed away. My body will be filled with this desire to just... *be gone.* Just as strongly as the thirst of a dehydrated person that's stranded on a tiny island. You're craving water to drink, but the only water available is the sea. Seeing so much water all day and not being able to drink it is fucking maddening. That's how I feel at my lows. And it's so frustrating because I *know* that I will feel better again and brush it off; I'm stuck in an unending cycle. Not like I ever had any confidence to actually do it (after researching I’m seriously baffled there's so many complications that can happen! Who knew it was that difficult to safely kill yourself?! Not me lol.)

Everything has changed when I've got pregnant. We were  no longer a couple but a family. We've found love we lost in the way and learned to be together again. We've started nesting. Bought a house, prepared everything for little one.. We've been so excited. So up... 
Then baby got born and we found out that it's a fruit of that one night stand. We broke. Him and me. Lockdown hit us hard. We were closed together in one house. My husband moved to different part of the house. I was taking care of my child. All by myself, after cesarean, weak and sliced.
Baby was perfect. Still is. But it is not what I wanted. I would never have it if I knew it is other guys. I look at her and all I feel are regrets. I do not love my own child. I've started to have suicidal thoughts. 4 ppl in my family died this lockdown. All hanged themselves. I started to look at high oak trees like solutions. Or at spot on my belly that had nerve damage like a window to pain free harakiri.

Truth is I don't care about much.. I used to have dreams, used to want to do things.. now I literally wake up, work, eat, and repeat. I literally have no energy to do anything. I don't want to do anything. 

Aside from my parents and grandparents, I feel like nobody really gives a shit about me. I honestly don't even feel close with them. I've cut out most of my friends.

Been suffering depression blah blah for about 7 years now and I've noticed that one thing I do when I'm happier is that I tend to sort of  lock onto other people or a person and just go along with their life and their interests and their activities and forget about me.

I'm talking like, when I had a bf I would just do whatever he wanted like going out etc and if he wanted to watch something specific I'd go along with it even when I didn't want to. If I didn't want to do something but he was like oh let's do this then I would. But not because of him, since him I've been staying with my aunt and uncle and I'm doing the same things. Nothing excites me anymore so I just do whatever they choose to do and go in with it. I'll even eat food I don't particularly like just bevause they're having it.

I don't like confrontation no, but I know it's not a case of me not wanting to say no. If something is really bad or I really don't want to then I won't but it's got to be quite a big thing. I've always been a people please but it's just like I switch myself off and become this shadow in others worlds? If I'm feeling extra low I won't even talk much at all which I know is depression but it's just like I don't exist.

I literally don't have a life of my own but I also don't have motivation or the courage and ability to do anything about it. Maybe that's why but,

He’s been a single parent my entire life. Ever since maybe 7-8 years old I’ve had to learn how to take care of myself, I never once got emotional support, an ounce of empathy from him or anything resembling going out of his way for me. 

I got a roof over my head and low par processed food to eat, and was expected to fulfill the roll of a maid / mother figure to both myself and him. It wasn’t ALL bad, but the vast majority of my childhood and teens was filled with my crying myself to sleep trying to dissect why everything I did around the house wasn’t good enough. He always had something to complain about or add on too, and would almost overnight act like nothing ever happened 

He lacks any sort of emotional intelligence and I see very odd and fast switches from him with moods. He doesn’t like physical touch and has a very hard time with it coming from other people as well as in general showing any sort of affection at all. 

He’s not stupid by any means but there are certain things with how to act around others and in professional settings that would not be considered acceptable by most, it’s just how he’s always been. 

I’ve suspected for a little while now he may be on the spectrum, and it would explain a lot about the way I was raised. I’ve just moved back in for college to save money, it’s only been two weeks and I’m now remembering exactly why I wanted to move out with every fiber of my being only two years ago. All I’ve done is work around the house and cook for the both of us, and all he’s done is start arguments with me. Whenever I express how I’m feeling or how he shouldn’t be talking to me like that he straight up just doesn’t understand what he did wrong and instantly switches to being nice.

I've been really depressed as long as I can remember, but pretty much stopped being a threat to my own life by 17 years old. I function... pretty ok in society. I have enough energy to go to work and a lifestyle I can afford. 

I haven't really felt any *fun* in years though. Every day is just a blur of ""go to work, finish work, go home, sleep"" with no time or any wants to hang out with people. I've been ghosting all of my friends for months because time accidentally goes by too fast without me doing anything. 

My family works by the logic of ""if you have a problem, fix it yourself"" and so I have been searching for private therapists in my city. 

It. Is. SO. EXPENCIVE. Like, 170$ for 45 min. And I'm not even sure if it is what I need. The things they advertise on their sites are mostly just like ""feeling depressed? anxious? problems with your marriage/work/life? we know how to help"" and thats all well and good but is this the kind of therapist that I need? Seems like it is advertised to normal people going through a rough patch, maybe not someone who cant remember enjoying life ever

Either way, I have a pretty stable income, but I still dont want to spend 170$ on one session with a therapist... I've heard that it is cheaper if I speak to my doctor and get sent to an official therapist thing but I've never been to the doctor before. My body is basically indestructable, and heals alright by itself so I never saw the need. Would it be awkward for me to just... Meet my doctor for the first time only to ask him to give me to someone else?? I also dont know if he would want to know all my problems before sending me there...

243,"For background I’m a female with OCD.
So I think I’m bi, and I’ve thought I was bi for most of my life. I dream about dating females and I feel attracted to masc women and non-binary people. When I say dream about dating females it feels good, and it doesn’t make me feel bad or not want to be bi. I want to be myself if that makes sense. But every time I come to terms with my identity, I start to analyze females I find attractive and convince myself I’m not bi. For example I may find a female character attractive, but then I may look at pictures of the actor that show them with a much different appearance and I’ll find myself only attracted to the character, and I’ll then tell myself since I don’t find the actor attractive like I find the character I’m not bi and I’m just making it up. Or I’ll tell myself that I might just be having obsessions over being bi and therefore how I feel is not real, but I’m pretty sure what’s actually happening is I’m obsessing over not being straight rather then being bi. Because I want to be bi, not because it’s fun or I find it “trendy”, but because I honestly am attracted to females. But I also only find masc women attractive so I tell myself I can’t be bi because if I were really bi I would like fem women too. And when I start to analyze my feelings I’ll start to convince myself I don’t actually like women. Like I may stare at a picture of a character I find attractive and I’ll stress I don’t find them attractive and because of that stress I’ll start to stop feeling attracted to them. And I’ve tried to come out a long time ago but then I started second guessing myself and telling myself I was just making it up. So then I did everything to make people believe I was straight and people finally forgot about me saying I liked women. And I feel like I finally came to terms with my sexuality but ofc my OCDs telling me I’m straight and am making everything up even though I know I’ve had a crush on girls. Thing is, most of them are fictional so now I’m wondering if I’m making it up because of that. I’m not sure if I’m straight obsessing over being bi or bi obsessing over being straight. The only thing that makes me not want to be bi is fear that boys won’t like me, but it’s not something that would stop me from coming out. Everyone in my life would be really accepting. But I’m so scared I’ll come out and be wrong or my feelings will change and I’ll turn straight. I don’t like being out of control and I feel like if I say I’m bi I’m committed and can’t take it back. But I’m comfortable with the bisexual label and I really do like women. The attraction is different though, but I like them. Do all straight women like women to a certain extent though? Does anyone know what’s happening and what I should do? Ugh it’s so confusing.

Anyways, here’s my next question, I’m on 20 mg of lexapro and 300 mg of gabapentin (for insomnia). As of late, I’ve been sleeping a ton on both these medications. I don’t know if it’s a normal symptom or if I might no longer need the gabapentin. I will be talking to my doctor but I want to know what to prepare myself with. I don’t want to say I no longer need the gabapentin when the sleeping is just a symptom of a more severe depression or anxiety.

I know it may sound disconnected from reality, but even since I left smoking drugs I became very scared to ever come in contact with them if even through touching or second-hand smoking, and if I do come into contact with them I don't know what happens exactly but I become very obsessed that my intellectual functions are hampered and I become confused and it just irritates me. As things got worse, I not only became scared of coming into contact with drugs, but also of coming into contact with someone who has smoked or may have smoked drugs. The moment this happens I become possessed by this mood of confusion I mentioned before. I feel like since they have smoked drugs that by me coming into contact with them ( shaking their hands, being in the same room with them, me inhaling the air they breathe ) I have also been affected by the drugs they did.

255,"Well, if I'm going to do this, I might as well express it in a way that'll give insight, nothing left out. I'm not afraid to ask for help, who might read this, nor am I afraid of what comments there might be.

This is my message in a bottle.

The first time I saw the movie The End of Evangelion, I felt traumatized. At the time, I had no knowing it was a direct sequel to the series, Neon Genesis Evangelion, an emotional and psychologically induced mecha anime. Seeing as how the movie was ""Not rated"", I decided to take a gander, thinking it was a stand-alone movie. Big mistake. This movie made me feel past traumas of my own that made me feel nearly empty. At first glance, I couldn’t help but feel ashamed of my own mental illness considering how the main protagonist, Shinji's own was the cause of his suffering and gargantuan downfall.

One of the reasons why it triggered by PTSD is because back in 10th grade, I was the target of a lot of ridicule. I, like Shinji, felt like the victim of of everyone else exerting their will over me. I had more difficulty understanding social customs due to my Aspergers Syndrome. Because of my diagnosis, I was often labeled by the others as a retard on a consistent basis. The worst thing was, I wanted to appease everyone there because I wanted to be their friends. I didn’t care about praise, I just wanted to be accepted as a fellow student. Yet, I was still the outcast. My requests for help were often neglected by the staff, and I was often harassed by my peers physically to the point I thought about taking my own life. Still, I know there was much I could’ve done on my part. Even back then I knew there were moments I had done wrong as well. I thought it would get better if I took responsibility for my actions as my elders have taught me. But it didn’t. I excelled in academics, making it to the deans list, hoping that if I did well and got good grades, I would be accepted as a fellow student and intellectual, but no one did. I felt like my world was ending.

After all that, I was became an emotional wreck. I was sent to a therapy program for two years, where I had learned to accept and make peace with who I am despite my mental disability. Four years later, the moment I come across End of Evangelion, I feel as if it undid all of that progress, and put me back at square one. Moreover, I felt like this movie has dug itself into a mental scar of mine that was still healing. Sometimes I wonder if I’ll have to endure this forever, and if I can bear it.

About a year ago, I was at a Trade School for students with mental or emotional challenges. I became depressed again because even though I made many attempts to connect with my peers, many of them refused to connect back with me due to their own personal issues. Some of them even went so far as to vent their anger and frustrations onto me, labeling me with outrageous and degenerate titles, even though they were just rumors. Despite this I kept trying because I wanted to understand them so I wouldn’t be alone. But the more I tried to befriend them, the more they hated me for it, and the more hopeless I felt. To this day I am still unsure if its me or them. And I don’t want to be selfish or self centered because I want to be honest and truthful. And the truth is I hate being alone.This is another thing that End of Evangelion brought up inside me half a year later. I don’t want to close myself off in my own world, I wish to be open. When people hurt me, it affects me because I care about how others feel because I wish to befriend others. It hurts all the more when the majority of my efforts are in vain.

It’s been eight months since I came across EOE. I still had a hard time trying to make peace with it. Every time it came up into my mind, it hurt. I have Asperger’s Syndrome, and endured mental scars like other people, and when I could relate to someone, even a fictional character as an extension of my own personality, it can affect me. Hideki Anno, the director of the series, as most people claim, poured much of his own personality into Shinji at the time when he was grappling with depression. Simply put, Shinji is a troubled boy who relies on other people's praise to validate his existence, a feeling all too familiar to me.
​​
There's this one scene where Asuka, Shinji's romantic interest is killed by other Evangelion mechs, and Shinji arrives too late due in part of his unwillingness to intervene in fear of hurting others. At first, this scene had little effect on me. But then, two weeks later, my friend Max Schafer took his own life. This pained me, because I always saw him as a little brother. It felt like I had the power to save him but chose not to. This, in correlation with the movies effect on me, spiraled me further into the rabbit hole.

These are reasons why I saw myself in Shinji, or Shinji in myself, and why I had a hard time letting it go. Shinji represents what I could’ve been, if things went differently for the worse, and I didn’t make the choices I did to make my life better. End of Evangelion represented Shinji to me is a distorted and twisted reflection of me, staring me back from the other side of a dark mirror. I daresay that at one point in time, during tenth grade, I was a twisted mirror reflection of Shinji. And it felt beyond haunting and disturbing to see this distorted version of myself go down this nihilistic and self loathing path to the point of no return.

The worst part is I sometimes felt this trauma taking on a life of its own, clawing at the back of my mind like a demon from hell, trying to drag me down with it. People had told me that I should accept myself and move on. The trouble was, whenever I accept myself, I felt I’m accepting all of me, including my trauma. Whether I ignored the pain or acknowledged it, the outcome seemed to be the same. The hardest part is knowing that nothing can exclude the pain that End of Evangelion brought me.

Twice, I had a nightmare where I saw myself as Shinji, choking his romantic interest Asuka and starting the third impact. I reached out to try and stop myself only for me to wake up. I felt I was on the verge of snapping, that the veil of reality was wearing thin.

I’ve heard praises about Neon Genesis Evangelion, mostly on how it was so well written and many viewers claimed it cure them of their depression. I was still new to the series, so I was really confused about how some people say the same for End of Evangelion, as it did quite the opposite for me. And I tried searching for the internet for an answer, but all I was came across we’re articles, videos, and other media that claimed how this movie was a happy ending and cured them of their depression. To this day, I still feel it is far from it. This confuses me greatly. I want to appreciate both of them as an art form, and I love old school anime, so I did loads of research behind the series and Hideki Anno to try and understand Evangelion and how it was able to affect me. One of the answers I came across was that I watched the movie before the series, which added a dose of confusion to my emotional reaction. So I dug deeper into this mystery. I was under the impression that because others said the series helped them understand themselves better, I would be able to achieve the same if I forced myself to appreciate the series and delve further into the heart of its depressive nature, not minding the fact I was digging myself a deeper hole altogether.

​​I discovered that the Evangelion fandom on social media is more toxic than I anticipated. Time and again I’ve asked for help and posted my thoughts as a wall of text, only for members to retort and say, “It’s just a movie”. This makes me all the more ashamed of my initial reaction and the fact that it brought up my trauma for the first time in many years, so I kept asking questions because I wanted to feel that my argument was valid, that I am not insane, to know that I truly wasn’t the only one who became an emotional trainwreck after seeing this psychological roller coaster of a film. In all honesty, my persistence can become stubbornness. In turn, this annoyed them to the point they began to insult me with outlandish terms and labeling me as a freak for letting the movie affect me this much. Some have said that the movie has a tendency to unfurl and bring up people's underlying issues, and in my case, something extremely painful. I couldn't have said it better myself. It didn’t help that movie doesn’t come with an epilepsy warning and continues to remain “unrated” in the USA.

One of my biggest insecurities is not being accepted as a friend or a member of a group. Years before I was much more introverted, especially around people who had issues of their own and I had a hard time understanding. I’ve worked so hard to accomplish this new life of mine, to obtain the new friends I saw End of Evangelion in January of 2020. Now this COVID-19 pandemic seems to be preventing me of my chances to connect with new friends. I am greatly saddened because my apartment complex has become a ghost town, most of my neighbors have gone. This Quarantine has taken a serious mental toll on me. I am grateful for the friends I have in Virginia, but I am still nonetheless bummed by the fact that many who I made connections with in Arizona have left for good. Another insecurity of mine is being disliked by others.

Ultimately, I do not wish to live my life alone, I want to connect with others because it makes me feel good about myself, thus I want to make others feel happy too, rinse and repeat. I don’t want to be the closed-off introvert I used to be. But it was getting increasingly harder during quarantine. Most of the people whom I wanted to connect with have left because of this. 
​​
Ever since I came across End of Evangelion, the days had turned from walks through a garden to walks through a battlefield. Every waking minute was a struggle to convince myself that I do not need to understand Evangelion to understand myself, and I don’t need Evangelion to be validated or achieve what I want in life.
​​
But more importantly, I want to learn to live again, especially after the pandemic. I want to live because I know it would be wrong to take my own life. There are so many others that love me. And I love them back. This world is too fragile, and this life is too finite to simply throw away. Despite struggling with this new trauma, I'm still here, and I won't give up until I have found a way to make peace with the mistakes I've made these past eight months. I've overcome trauma once, and I can do it again.

No sooner did I have an epiphany. The hardest part about coming to terms with End of Evangelion is that I kept delving into this rabbit hole, because I wanted to get to the bottom of Evangelion, hoping I’d also discover the root of the issue in the meantime.

Anno once said that their is no correct interpretation of Evangelion. That is ultimately up to the audience to determine. As much as I wish it brought me comfort, I feel like the only thing at the bottom of the rabbit hole is...nothing. Then again, nihilism is a recurring theme in Evangelion.

Which at first made me feel having wasted eight months of my life trying to solve an unsolvable mystery so I could understand how it affected me. Because of my initial reaction of End of Evangelion, I was under the impression that the answer would lie in the franchise.

But then, something clicked in my head. Slowly but surely I could feel something come together, like a spark igniting every synapse in my mind, spreading in all directions.

Despite the fact I barely watched the show, and never have before coming across the movie, I still wanted to gain an understanding because I wanted to be in a group of intellectuals, considering how many claim Neon Genesis Evangelion to be written so well. I confess at one point in time, earlier this year, I wanted to confront Anno to know what he was thinking. But then again, he already had, as he poured much of his emotions into the making of End of Evangelion during his relapse.

I’m actually proud of myself, for trying so hard, even if there is no fixed answers. One person said to me that EoE is a tale without any fixed answers at all, for better or for worse. While I was trying to make sense of Evangelion and how it affected me, I was also second-handedly trying to make sense of myself, little by little. 

I find it odd how I feel like to only way to come to terms with it, is to reel myself in, out of the rabbit hole. It’s a paradox. But then, does coming to terms with something mean having to agree with something? No.

I am flabbergasted on how the movie doesn’t come with an epilepsy warning, seeing how there is a load of split second flash imagery. One could argue that Anno wasn’t thinking about his audience. I daresay he wasn’t, seeing how EoE was virtually his self directed therapy in the aftermath of the series finale and death threats. He wanted to put his own mental health first before all else, and choose to vent his emotions. And you know what? I really do respect him for that. And it feels really courageous to say that despite how I acquainted myself with the franchise by seeing the movie.

I did my research and wrote down my thoughts to express my emotions in an articulate manner, to find out what path suits me best. I’ve already come this far, andI am still trying to connect with others. As of thus far, I desire to maintain at a safe distance from the series until I feel ready to tackle it again.

That’s when another thought came into my head. The Hedgehog’s Dilemma. It’s a recurring theme of Evangelion. The closer two hedgehog’s are, the more likely one is to get hurt by the other. It was then I realized I could use this metaphor to establish a healthy distance from Evangelion and step out of its shadow. It was then I had another epiphany, could the Hedgehog’s Dilemma also apply to an individual’s connection with other works of fiction? I think so! Therefore, I believe it would be ideal to also maintain a healthy distance from fiction. 

The best thing I can think of to come out of all of this was that I chose to reach out to others. While doing my research I came across a piece of work, which in my personal opinion is one of the greatest analyses of Evangelion. It is titled, Learning the (love) lessons of End of Evangelion by Doctor Nerdlove. While I don’t necessarily agree with every single sentence, it provided a motherload of insightful thought, and challenged me to look at the movie from a different perspective. This article is evidence that there truly are others who are seeking to understand Evangelion just as I, and have not hesitated to pour their thoughts and emotions into a beautifully composed artcile.

I don’t need to tell myself whether or not I’m better than the characters or fandom, because I’d still be comparing myself with them. And I don’t need to compare myself to them because it just doesn’t matter.

The only person I really need to compare myself with is me. And I am glad to say that I recognize that I am doing this for my own mental well being, and starting to accept myself again.

End of Evangelion is a story; an unimaginably haunting and surreal, yet relatable story. It’s a story that speaks to many of us, and had the potential to resurface our deepest fears and pains, and in some cases such as my own, force us to relive them. The present molds us as does the past. And sometimes the past can catch up with the present

Maybe The End of Evangelion isn’t just a cluster of unexplainable psychoanalytic philosophies, but is also one giant epiphany itself. It was Hideki Anno’s answer to all the emotions and pressures he felt during the production of the series and the backlash he received. Perhaps it became the answer to let my emotions flow free, to lead my inner demons out from the shadows and into the sun, to let them spread their wings for a while. Maybe for better or worse, I am unsure. But I feel relieved to have come to this interpretation. And with that, I can start to accept myself more easily. 

There’s a quote I like to refer to. “Everything will be alright in the end. If it’s not alright, it’s not the end”. And let’s face it, things in the movie’s finale are far from simply being alright, the world and its people are royally screwed over. But the End of Evangelion is the beginning of something else. The fate of (its) destruction is also the joy of (its) rebirth.

Thank you all for reading.

I can’t stop hating myself and I just want to die. I can’t get myself to eat because I really want to so badly die. My bird is dying and I think when she dies I’m going to try to die too. And I’m going to give the baby that landed on my doorstep to someone. I’ll have nothing left that I need to do before I die and I’ll finally be able to have peace and leave.

I also just keep feeling like I need to cry and I won’t cry. Like.im carrying heavy bricks on my heart and stomach for days.

268,"So my younger brother today at dinner was making an annoying noise over and over and over again, so i got super annoyed and yelled at him to stop and he just left the dinner table and my mother turns to me and screams “YOUR TO HARSH ON HIM YOUR SUCH A BITCH” and you know here’s the thing after years and years of trying to be nice wtf is the point? i just get ignored, punched, kicked, yellled at, and told that my feelings aren’t worth shit so you know what suck my dick.",30Aug2020,1
269,"I am a 24 year old male virgin who has never had a girlfriend. 

I also have not gotten my driver license yet (working on it now, got over the fear but at this point it’s harder to have someone to practice with, trying to avoid paying for lessons because I already got ripped off that way) so rely on Uber/Lyft, and on my parents driving me (because ridesharing was not designed to be as affordable as public transit, and my city isn’t big enough to have public transportation) and this is one of the biggest sources of my insecurity.

Also I have an extremely low skilled and low paying job, the only one I’ve kept long-term (almost 2 years now, damn) as the others were seasonal, or I was let go.

I was unable to get my first job until I was 21.

I did start school recently, community college. COVID changed a lot, and it sure is harder to stay focused online at home. 

I’m still not exactly sure what I’m doing, but I chose to start when I did because I’m 24 and have no life plan and no prospects, so I decided it was time to get off my ass and do something. Also I thought actually going to school might help figure that out. 

I’ll have to go back in late start classes, as I have to redo one of the college tests, because the school somehow lost one of my scores (apparently this is not unheard of), and like everything else, I put that off until the very last minute, but this time I wasn’t even able to do it at the last minute. Better late than never though, right?

I don’t have good self-motivation, too much depression and feelings of hopelessness, and other things hard to explain, so I really do need to be in classes on campus.

I’m not good socially, but being around people is still better, and maybe things will happen, I don’t know.

But when people tell me “You should stop comparing yourself to others and be happy with what you have” I see that as continued isolation and just being abnormal. 

I’m sick of being told “It will happen when it’s supposed to, you just have to be patient”. NO! You don’t get ANYTHING in life by just waiting and not doing anything! My problem is feeling like things I have to do being more than I can handle, and either not knowing what I want to do, or constantly changing  what I want to do.

I often feel like everything is boring, just not exciting, but when I do have any longer-term/stronger interest, it’s always something that “isn’t realistic, that’s a pipe dream”. 

If I can’t make a living doing something I WANT to do, what is the point of life? Especially if I’m this lonely, celibate, weirdo, with no social life outside of work. And just, life goes by so fast, and then it’s over.

Even still being alive, but older age, and never lived, is depressing. Let’s face it, it is NOT NORMAL to be a virgin who’s never even dated in your 30s, it is NOT OK to still not be able to fully support yourself, it’s life-interfering at worst and just embarrassing at best to be unable or scared to drive, and telling me that “It’s OK, you don’t need any of that, forget about it, just accept that it may never happen and move on.” I CAN’T STAND HEARING THAT! It makes me shudder and cringe, it reopens the black hole, and it grows bigger.

Why is it wrong to want more in life? Especially NORMAL things like dating, sex, financial independency, being able to afford to live in a dream city/country, even wanting to pursue big dreams (isn’t that what life is all about?)

Why am I CRIMINALIZED for wanting more? Why is it bad to want more? Why is it wrong to try and get more in life? Why has it been so hard for me....

I sure as hell don’t want to be an incel, I’ve never met more toxic people in my life. They ENCOURAGE giving up, and even suicide! (Yes, there are still incel subreddits, and they ARE NOT support groups for the lonely who just want someone to love them and/or to get laid, even if they claim to be non-hateful, THEY ARE BS LIARS!)

Look, if you want to try to make someone feel less shitty, and tell them “Your circumstance isn’t the worst thing in the world, or it’s not that pathetic” that’s fine, but don’t try and NORMALIZE it. Even if it’s more common than believed to be, it’s unhealthy and depressing.

I always say, just because many suffer from the same problem, doesn’t mean it’s any less of a problem, it just means that the suffering is multiplied”.",30Aug2020,1
270,"Hi R

You see, I have been in love with the same person for 3 years and the truth is that things never worked out, we were never a couple and she is doing her normal life like anyone entering and leaving relationships but I have given a lot of importance to what I follow feeling because the truth is that he was the first person I fell in love with and because I have not overcome the feeling and sadness that I have never been able to take the relationship to another level, I want to feel better about myself and give myself the opportunity to know to other people and then in the future to have something with someone else other than her but it really makes me very difficult since my mind constantly reminds me that I failed with her and I am discouraged from trying something new.
Thanks for reading &lt;3",30Aug2020,1
271,"Having a bad day.   Wondering when my positive breakthrough will come.  It's been years now.  I feel like I'm living in exile.   I've been shopping for a mental health therapist, my last one QUIT  to take a job at a cancer research center.   Only one that had any sense and who was smart and who GOT ME.   Now back at square one its a nightmare

Example:  Many of the therapists and I have contacted many say the same thing  ""I have no openings go here""  ""Go there""  only to be told the same ole same ole.    I now have to WAIT, WAIT, WAIT for the VA to find me someone and I'll be old &amp; decrepit b/c of how slow insurance which is dimwitted Triwest is.   They're obtuse!   I'm all alone in the world.   

Those VA crisis lines are so dumb!   One volunteer asked me ""well do you have any friends""?   If I had any friends, why would I be calling you?   They seem dumb as a goal post.   Maybe they're high?  I haven't had a great experiance with them.  I'd rather pray which helps better than those nimrods at the VA.",30Aug2020,1
272,"So around a week or two ago I had breakdown which was building up for a while. And my family have seem to notice that I have one major one every year or two where I just kinda lose it. They haven’t been that helpful before. But this time I they suggested I talk to someone my mum tried to get an appointment for me I was in a bad state at the time and she was concerned but we didn’t get an appointment. I have social anxiety to I’m really awkward. I’m fine with close family and close friends but to others I probs seem very rude and anti-social. 
I’m unsure what steps to take now since I couldn’t get an appointment and how to help myself. Plus when someone asks me how I’m doing when I’m in a bad state I just burst out crying cause idk what to say or how I am feeling because i don’t even know what’s wrong?",30Aug2020,1
273,"One thing that has gradually become more and more irritating for me to see in &amp; amongst the mental health community is people invalidating others feelings if they’re smaller or not completely synonymous to what the other person have/is experienced/ing. This isn’t a huge thing, may I add - most people are able to empathise and guide people regardless of how much they’re suffering but they’re is definitely a small but loud minority that seem to not be able to comprehend that EMPATHY IS NOT BOUND BY EXPERIENCE. Human beings are social creatures and innately able to empathise and guide each other. When someone is trying to help you and they say that they have experienced a similar event that can be compared to yours - even if yours was *way* more eventful &amp; dramatic - it doesn’t mean that they have no place to speak on your issue or the ability to be helpful. Understand that we are all going through the human experience and the great majority of the population want to help and guide you to your best path. Keep a warm heart even in the rough times. Don’t take efforts of kindness as insults. I’m speaking to a minority here, so if any of this was already intrinsically apart of your values like mine, then know that this wasn’t directed to you of course. 

Most people on here are either going through/have gone through a rough time or are just interested in the subject etc - to anyone struggling, hold on! You’re okay, you’ve got this! You really have - I genuinely am rooting for you and you don’t even know it.

That’s all from me!",30Aug2020,1

276,"Hey everyone. This post is going to be all over the place, because I feel like I’m losing it and I just need to vent/ need support. I don’t use reddit that much, but I just, I need help. I have nearly nothing to live for anymore. My life is a poor excuse of what it means to be alive. I never feel joy, happiness, only depression and anxiety. My mental illnesses destroyed my 5 year relationship with the girl I thought I’d marry. We were dating since we were 14. I was bullied relentlessly in secondary school. I now have crippling anxiety, low self esteem, suicidal tendencies and depression. Because of that, like I said, my emotional immaturity ended up pushing my girlfriend, or I guess ex away from me. She still says she loves me, but that she thinks we have grown apart. I agree, and I think in terms of a breakup, we had the most peaceful and mature one you could have. We plan to still be really close, just after we heal, so we rarely talk right now. She was the only thing I had. Having anxiety as bad as me, making freinds is next to impossible without stuttering. The worst part is, since I’m moderately attractive, people approach me expecting some what of a confident person. They are obviously drawn away by the fact I start stuttering like a idiot and go bright red. So yeah I don’t any freinds. All those I’ve made while being drunk out of my mind at parties I’ve been dragged too have their own freinds they like more and seem to have forgotten I even exist. I did a experiment, and I wanted to see if they would reach out to me if I didn’t pop up first and start conversation. Not one has tried and it’s been months. I am drowning in loneliness. I’m only 19, and I feel like I’m done with life already. I wanted to try the other night, I wanted to try and kill myself. But I got so scared of death I didn’t. I’m so pathetic I’m not even brave enough to kill myself. I would’ve overdosed by now if I had any money to buy drugs, but I’m also broke. The only upside to my life, the only slight bit of light keeping me going, is the fact I’m starting university in a couple of weeks, in my dream university. But recently even that light is starting to fade. I’m just so desperate and so alone I don’t know what to do. My mental illnesses are eating me alive. And I have no one to cry to. They would all care if they knew how much I was suffering, they are all really nice people, but the thing is they wouldn’t know. I just don’t know what to do. Fuck I just, I don’t want to keep going like this. I want to cut and I want to bleed and I want to die",30Aug2020,1
