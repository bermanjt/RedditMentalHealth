1,So I’ve always suffered with small anxiety attacks. But this past week I’ve had 5 anxiety attacks. They get worse each time. I have a bad heart to begin with from chemotherapy. I can’t even leave the house without having one. I was wondering if anyone had any helpful advice?,12Feb2020,1
2,"So it’s a very long, horrible, story, but I’ve recently had a counselor suggest that I’m up against PPD. The counselor took his time listening to my story and says that it sounds like classic PPD, but could also be Bipolar. Since she refuses to see him, he can’t diagnose. Just told me that it’s not good and that I have to find a way to get her in front of a professional that can see her body language and all. 

Her latest BS was suggesting we go our separate ways. When I told her to pack up and I’d rent her a suv to go back to her parents, she had an all break down. She’s locked herself in her room. Been days now of telling me to leave her alone. I know that what I said didn’t help, but she’s been threatening divorce anytime I stand up for myself and it was just a matter of time I lost my cool. 

Long story short, she thinks that I’ve been having her spied on for a year by cops or something. In reality, she drives a GD Porsche and cops tend to take notice of cars like that. My brother is a cop, hundreds of miles away, but she decided it makes sense anyways. Before this, she was being spied on by her old employer, whom she just abandoned one day...

How do I get her help? I can’t just break down her door and force her into my car. Nor can I call cops and make them drag her away. Help!",12Feb2020,1
3,"Hi all,

I hope not to impose or bother anyone.

I am currently an applied psychology student doing my honours year project on interventions that may reduce anxiety. I’m in need of a few more participants and thought it may be an interesting study for your group.

It’s all ethically approved and if you have any questions, I’m happy to answer them. Here’s the link if you want to have a look yourself

I look forward to your response

Many thanks,

4,"I hate myself. I hate everything about myself. I hate absolutely everything about my personality. I think I’m weird, hyper, unfunny, awkward, and annoying. I’ve always felt out of place even with my friends who are the only people in school I feel like I can really relate to. All of them are unique but pretty popular. They get invited to parties, have a lot of friends and acquaintances outside of our group, can talk to people with ease, and are generally well like. Although I have a good number of acquaintances with people from a lot of other groups outside of the group, I still feel like I’m weird and awkward. I usually win people over with my dry humor, but one-on-one in an actual conversation, it just feels dry and uninteresting. When I hear my friends talking to each other one-on-one, the sound like normal, interesting conversations; but in my conversations with my friends they just seem awkward and un-human in that makes any sense. The other thing is that all my friends say I’m funny, but there are plenty of times where I make jokes that are weird and are usually followed by awkward silences. I’m fine in group settings, I’m actually one of the most dominant people in group conversations because other people can lead the conversation when it gets stale, but one-on-one I’m a mess.They say I have a dry, witty, and weird sense of humor, but in a good way. 

I also feel like my values and who I am as a person don’t really translate in reality, and I think that’s mostly because of innate characteristics that I have. I come off as really immature, reckless, and energetic, when internally I’m pretty composed. When I hear them talk about my motives, actions, and behavior in possible scenarios, it doesn’t sound like me at all. It’s like they don’t know me, but also if everyone perceives me the same way then I must actually be like that as a person, and I hate it.

I feel like events when I was younger, how I grew up, and genetics (my parents are also very unconventional but I don’t like their personalities I know that sounds really really bad) have ingrained certain unalterable characteristics that are perceived as unorthodox and weird. It’s not like I’m not generally liked, people tend to like me, but it also always makes me feel out of place and odd. 

Recently I haven’t been talking a lot, because I’m afraid that anything I’ll say will be weird. I’m usually very talkative so this has worried my friends a lot, but honestly it’s for the best.

I’ve been kind of rambling but basically, I hate myself. It’s not just that I hate myself, I literally can’t live with myself. I hate who I am as a person, and that I can’t change the basic fundamental innate parts of my personality. I contemplate suicide frequently because I cannot live with my thoughts and me as a person to the fullest extent. It’s gotten to the point where I try to suppress ALL of my thoughts because I hate them that much. I need help. I don’t want to be like this forever but I don’t know what to do. I’m in therapy, but that hasn’t helped and I feel completely hopeless.",12Feb2020,1
5,"Sorry if there are mistakes, but english is not my first language.

I've been reading and learning more about mental health during the last year and I started to think that I may not be as mental healthy as I wanted to be.
I've always had issues with socialising, anything that was related to communicate or been with another person made me anxious, feeling pressure on the chest, sweats, increasing of the heart rate, and in the worst situations shaking and queasiness. Also I criticise myself a lot, I think I'm not good enough, that I don't deserve anything and things like that, so some days it gets hard and I feel that I don't have energy to do things and I just can't do anything.

The good thing is that during the last year I somehow managed to get a little better for some time, but everytime I do that, in some moment something happens that triggers me and I get even worse, to the point that I have this anxious feeling constantly and I don't know why or what to do to get rid of it.

I'm a girl that have always been like this and I always was told that I was shy and introvert, that is true, but I don't think this is that normal, and now I'm in college and this really affects me, some days more than others, but it's hard just dealing with studies, so with all this it's even worse. 

I've been thinking to get some sort of therapy to see if this can help me, but sometimes I think I'm overreacting, that I don't want to bother my family or even that I'm just ""faking it"", I know it sounds absurd but I dont know how to describe it. 

I really don't know what to do and I thought that I could share something here to see if someone can give me some advice or at least give me some courage.

Thank you!",12Feb2020,1
6,"I have felt shit about myself since I was 15 (im now 19) I have flashbacks and constantly think about things I’ve said or done and anytime I see my self I want to hide away and never get up I’m 200lbs and 5’3 do yeh I’m pretty hefty and my head always feels like a mess


A few weeks ago I had a solid 2 weeks where I felt soo good about myself I had no flashbacks and didn’t think about the things I normally think of, I never felt like that before I felt amazing like a new person my head felt clear, it felt like in tv shows when they are dreaming and there is that glaze over everything, it was great and I didn’t want to hurt myself for the first time in 4 years and it felt amazing 


Two weeks go by and one morning I wake up and it’s gone I’m back and ever since it’s just the worst I have no motivation and my heads fuzzy and the worst part is I remember feeling great and now I just feel empty like I really need that feeling back but I can’t and I don’t want to live this way anymore knowing what it felt like to be normal and not this constant state of self hatred


What was this what happened why did I get this short burst of normalcy and now I’m back to shit, is this normal? If so what was it and is it because if some deeper problem

7,"On January the 22nd, I attempted to overdose by taking 38 sertraline. I threw up an hour or two after taking them and the whole night I hallucinated. I usually hallucinate but this wasn’t the same type. You know when you were sick as a child and had hallucinations and you’re not scared, just curious? That’s how I felt. It was the happiest I’ve ever felt and I don’t think anything will ever give me that amount of happiness. It wasn’t even what I was seeing it was just... acceptance of what was yet to come. The longing for death had been there for so long and to come close to a release? It felt so good. I still wish it had worked but it didn’t. I wasn’t sectioned  but I was taken to a hospital and they monitored my heart. The happiest day of my life was my attempted suicide. I spoke to a teacher about it and she told me how sad that was but, honestly, I do wish it’d work. I’m in pain and I was so close to ending it.",12Feb2020,1

9,"The guy put me on Prozac. I do not have depression. I do not have anxiety. He couldn't understand me. I don't know my problem but I sure as hell know it's not that. I feel on top of the world great often, and yes I am down like that sometimes too but that doesn't mean I have depression? I argued with him saying that I think that won't help me but he seemed to completely disregard that. My dad is clueless in the whole situation and tried to explain it but I guess only his word matters.  

It was an hour and he put me on a dose of Prozac. I am not taking it. I do not have depression. He's supposed to be this really great one with tons of experience but I felt like he was the worst doctor/mental health sort I've ever seen. If I am telling him that I'm sure I don't have these things, why is he so convinced? I mentioned I can be extremely low but also my highs.

Is he deaf? Is the old age getting to him? I wasted an hour of my time and money. I want to kill this man, though I won't do anything chill out i'm just.

This is beyond stupid. I felt like he wanted me out the entire time. It was an hour but it felt like 5 minutes. The questions seemed mostly pertaining to my health rather then how I felt. Maybe the Prozac can be good for something, I could probably kill myself on it. It's drinkable so much easier to swallow down...

I just feel so bad. This was a waste of my time and I feel like I want to kill myself. I already self harmed a ton this week. I can't do this, what the fuck.

only thing keeping me going at this point is sanrio memes 

Suicide sounds like the happiest thing, it truly does. I'm likely done with living, I refuse to make it through this year. I keep getting bolder! Maybe I'll be bold enough to kill myself. I have locations and methods already logged in my brain! A nice bridge, maybe that Prozac, maybe that pain killer...

12,"

Im a 16 year old male by the way and have been experiencing similar symptoms for at least 3-4 years.

It feel like I have a dysthymic and pessimistic mood which is pretty much a high functioning depression. This lasts until I usually have periods of high motivation. During these times, I usually get really into an activity. It is usually a video game but has also been weight lifting or boxing. I have never gone more than a month with consistent dedication to these hobbies. The most I've ever lifted for was about 2 months last summer. I wasn't necessarily happy during this time, but I had just came out of a cloud of being a bit suicidal. 

Most recently, It has been a single month of lifting and now I feel bad again. I lifted nearly everyday and started eating well and spent most of my time thinking about lifting. 

I feel like dedicating my energy to a video game seems to suppress the sadness for a while. maybe at most a month where I don’t feel too bad. 

I should add do have a bit of the occasional anxiety where I get randomly overwhelmed and I've been struggling with depersonalization for a while. 

I feel like it doesn’t meet the standards for cyclothymia because I’m not sure I’m experiencing hypomania. I don’t know if it’s dysthymia because I sometimes have periods where I can get into exercising and gaming .

23,"This might be along post but fuck it. I've been seeing a lot posts regarding mental health issues lately so I thought I would give my on non-pc thoughts on my views to do with mental health. The saddest thing regarding mental health is that most people will show sympathy towards someone who decides to open up about a mental health issue at the starting point and will glorify the end point but it's that in-between phase when someone actually tries and I mean actually is proactively trying to better themselves where most people struggle. The people closest to that person will most likely go against them intentionally or unintentionally because that person is initially acting incongruent to how he/she has always behaved.  

A example would be someone with social anxiety. If someone is shy, nervous and doesn't like to speak up or be noticed and all of sudden he/she starts to express themselves more but because it's not normal/natural for that person to do so he/she will most likely come across as weird or strange because it hasn't become a natural way for that person to start behaving and the people around them which could be long term friends or even family members will most likely say to him/her that they are acting weird or strange which unintentionally discourages that person not to better themselves as they are hammered back into acting like their former submissive depressed self's despite initially wanting to change and improve for the better.

The main point of what am getting at is just because someone or you decides to open about something regarding a mental health issue. Don't expect everyone around you that you have known over the years to show genuine sympathy. There will be a lot of people around you that will convey sympathy because it's the pc/appropriate thing to do but that doesn't mean it's genuine from everyone. There is always a bunch people that are secretly happy to keep you the exact same way you have always been. Even if the current you is sad and depressed so always be willing to walk away from people that are not letting you improve yourself and hang around people if you can that are liking the new direction your going in. peace out",12Feb2020,1

25,"So this is my first reddit post actually so I’m not sure if I will be doing this right or anything so please hang in there with me. It will also be quite long, so if you dont have the time I’d recommend moving on.

Anyways, my “story” ig ill call it. I’m currently 16[M], live in the US, and I want to possibly seek help but I am A) Terrified of the thought of meeting face to face with someone to discuss anything, B) Afraid I will be horribly judged if I seek help, and C) I’m afraid of what my parents will say/do if they learn about everything. This is why I have chosen to post on this subreddit.

I’m not sure exactly where to start, so ill go back to before high school. I was always a very lonely kid. I was diagnosed (not sure if thats even the correct term) with ADD around 2nd or 3rd grade. Before that time I was always the annoying kid in class, and therefore was a very lonely person because no one wanted to be around me, even though I could not control myself. Then after I was put on medication for ADD, I began to continue to have virtually zero friends. I was also bullied as well. A lot, in fact, and I dont even remember most of it. The one event that I can still remember exactly is when one of my “friends” told me that my parents paid him and the others to hang out with me. I remember that crushing me, and so after that I never even left my room other than for school and extracurricular activities, which I also barely participated in. I spent my weeknights and weekends in my room or the basement playing games on my computer. For years my parents always asked me why I dont ever hang out with anyone, or even if I had any friends at school, but I always told them yes and I was just playing with them on my computer, which was a lie. I was totally isolated from around the beginning of 1st grade all the way to my sophomore year of high school. 

I’m going to skip a big chunk of time up to freshmen/sophomore year because I dont remember most of what happened during the time before. So coming up to the end of freshmen year, we began to have all of those mental health assemblies, talking about depression/anxiety and everything else. I remember thinking that I had a normal life, and I would never be affected by any of those things. Then sophomore year hit. Sophomore year was possibly the year of the biggest changes in my life. The beginning of this year was around the time I realized that something may be wrong. A few months in I had become aware of the fact that I was horribly depressed. I had always heard about this sort of thing in the assemblies and in health class, and then I learned how people would cut themselves or do different things to themselves in order to feel better. So, me being me, I thought I would try that, but I was so afraid I never actually went through with it. Soon after this time, by an act of god himself a wonderful girl came into my life (whom I am still with over a year later :)) who I soon learned was dealing with depression and anxiety. I wont go into her story as I dont feel right doing that, but just know that her telling me about these things, I felt like I gained a purpose for my life— to help her get better. So I did just that, I did everything I could to support her, but at the same time I did the best I could to hide my problems because I did not want her to worry about me, she already had enough to worry about. Also around this time, I found a friend group which I became a part of, and will gladly say they are way better than anyone I had ever been friends with before. I love them all. So this I would say is when I thought everything was going right.

Then, around 8-12 months (November of last year) after my first battle with self harm(jsut to give a time frame) I became horribly depressed again. I could never figure out why, but this is when I gave into the temptations and did go through with cutting myself. I used a pair of sharp scissors on my left hand and for many weeks I had cuts all down my hand. I also began to deal with what I call my “intrusive thoughts.” I hated myself (even though I had for years before this) more than ever. Different thoughts such as my friends hating me, my girlfriend hating me, and even as far as my girlfriend cheating on me began to fill my head. I also was filled with much regret from my past, thinking all the isolation and bullying I dealt with was my fault, and therefore to get rid of these thoughts I would cut. Sometimes just to get rid of them, and sometimes just to punish myself. I also became suicidal, and although I never attempted anything, the thought of suicide filled my thoughts. So for weeks I lived in fear of everything, thinking everyone hated me, or that people were lying to me or hiding things from me, or that my girlfriend was cheating on me. Even though deep down I knew these things were not true, my head kept telling me they were. Now I had been telling my girlfriend about some of these things, but never the whole extent of everything, and even thought I felt horribly guilty for not telling her, I was so afraid of being judged or made fun of that I haven’t told her everything. And up to this day I still deal with these feelings. A few words I would describe I feel is empty, lonely, scared. I always have this indescribable feeling in my gut that I cant get rid of. My short term memory has also just gone completely out of wack, and I have trouble remembering my thoughts from mere seconds before, so I have no idea if that means anything or not.

Please give me advice or something, I want to be able to figure out what to do, or what may be wrong with me. Questions would also be appreciated, because I highly doubt this was easy to follow, so I’d be happy to answer anything. If you decided to read my story, I greatly appreciate it.

28,"My therapist seems a bit *too* interested in my well being. I used to think that this was a good thing, as I would get more quality care, but I'm seeing now that I should have trusted my gut instincts. 

I was talking (regrettably, a bit too honestly) about my suicidal ideations/intentions. She said that ""other therapists"" would call emergency services, but since she's apparently not like other therapists, she's willing to put her ""career on the line"" by ""believing in me"" and my ability to get better.  

She's making me read this book that she believes was brought to me ""by fate."" I respect her beliefs, but the fact that she's insisting on me actually reading (she's asked me to literally read and discuss the book with her, as a kind of ""assignment"") this book assignment, just based on her sense of ""fate"", puts a weird taste in my mouth. I don't know how to tell her that I just don't want to read it. I tried reading some of it, but I lost interest.  

At this point, I feel a bit threatened. It's either: ""do what I say is good for you (including reading this long, boring book that ""fate"" apparently brought me to)"" or ""stay the way you are"", with the implication that ""staying the way I am"" will get the ambulances and emergency services called on me. All with the additional guilt of apparently potentially ruining her career. 

I do not want to be institutionalized. I am not a threat to myself. 

I told her about my struggles with accepting my sexuality (I'm mostly attracted to the same sex, though I'm technically bisexual, and I have had trouble accepting this part of myself), and she seems a bit too focused on it. 

She invited me to go to a rock climbing wall at one of the university gyms (she apparently helps the students out as a community engagement... thing? Didn't quite catch what she said), and that rung some alarm bells in me, because I wasn't aware that it acceptable for therapists/counselors to have non-professional relationships with their clients. Although, I guess since that rock climbing thing is also a part of her role, that things are different, but still. It didn't sit right with me.

My mom said we could go the the pediatrician the next morning (I had been skipping school for the past 2 days because I felt mentally done). Then, before the next day, she said that maybe we shouldn’t go. She said that, with some sort of evaluation, it would just be strangers who didn’t even know me. I didn’t even care at that point, so I just went along with it. I have many questions, but here are a few: Does anyone have experience with getting the help of a pediatrician (or whatever an adult doctor is)? Also, what the heck should I do? I really want to know what’s wrong with me, but I don’t even know if I want “help.” I’ll probably end up leaving it be for another  few months.",12Feb2020,1

33,"So when I was around 9, my mums brother stayed at our house while he was working or studying (not sure what is was but don't think it matters). Anyways he was in his early 20s most likely and he stayed in my room at the time. I slept in my mums room and often I'd go to my room to get something of mine.

One time I went to my room, he told me to come in then shut the door. He turned off the lights, had stripped and told me to suck him off. Obviously being a child I had no fucking idea as to what the heck was going on or what I was doing or what he was doing. I remember clearly telling him I don't like it and I was scared, with him telling me to do things to it. I don't remember how it ended but I guess I can say I'm glad I wasn't raped??

I'm now 22 and for a long, long time this incident has haunted me and messed with my mind. I ended up being exposed to porn since I was 11 and have struggled with trying to stop. I don't like it. I really hate it and I've never said this to anyone before. One of my closest friends is aware that something happened but I've never told her it exactly and repercussions of what I had done and had to deal with. I would never openly admit to being 'addicted' to porn or anything do that sort in real life since I'm a Muslim girl. I'm always encouraging my friends to be open about topics such as sex, periods or even little things like bras, things that are seen as taboo or embarrassing to talk about, when in actuality, they aren't. But I can't do it myself. Especially when it comes to things like porn. I don't think I'm addicted but I've had a weird relationship with porn.

Things started to really go downhill when I was around 12 and in year 7 (from the UK) and for a very, very long time I isolated myself within my four walls and never went out. For over four years I'd stay at home and never went anywhere. I only went to school and even then I had a serious attendance issue. I messed up my education and had nothing going for me for a very long time after turning 16. I spent so many years at home just in my room, which was my safe haven. I had issues with everyone in my family, particularly my brothers (two older and one younger, in which case the 2nd oldest was incredibly violent and so was the younger one) and it was like no one was on my side. I didn't talk to my 2nd oldest brother for four years since he's a piece of shit and still is but now he's more 'holier than thou'. I know I should let go of all of it but I can't seem to continue to feel so wronged by everything that's happened. I still continue to remember the shit that happened to me and how I was (and still am) treated like absolute filth in the family because I chose to stay in my room. Because I chose to stay isolated. But not a single person in my family thought to ask me what's going on. What could have made me be like this.

One instance where I dropped out from college at 17, my mum told her sisters and my nan when I was there. They all questioned it immediately and my nan was appalled (out of concern and because she's from another generation, it's difficult for her to understand certain things). But when one of my aunts sat down with me to talk, it was all 'little things'. These little things added up and I've been consistently feeling like absolute shit since I was 12. I've been cutting since I was 12 too and my arms are jacked up as well as my right thigh. It's all little things to them and so damn fucking insignificant but why can't I seem to let go of it all? It's like I need closure but I know it won't help.

The uncle that sexually assaulted (is it even sexual assault or harassment?? fuck I don't even know what happened to me, myself) has been staying away from me ever since. I remember having a emotional breakdown from being treated like shit once when staying at my nans (mums family's house) and he mocked me for having a breakdown. Other than that he stays the fuck away from me and I am so fucking glad. I have a feeling that he feels guilty in some way (fuck him I don't care about his guilt since he hasn't apologised for fucking me over) and he's never ever touched me or come near me ever since. Especially if I happen to be by myself. He'll stay there if there's others there but it's like he's uncomfortable around me when I should be the one who is visibly uncomfortable around him. Fuck I don't know tbh.

I just hate it all. Life has moved on and I'm currently studying at university but I'm still stuck in my shitty mental state. I don't know what to do. I can't even ask for help because I'm so scared of opening up to others. I can't do that. There's so much more to this shit as well, so it's all frustrating and gives me even more reason to not open up to anyone. Even a professional. I don't want to. I can't but still I thought maybe, just maybe, using a throwaway account to 'confess' all of this would ease some of it for me.",12Feb2020,1
34,"So basically everyone I know can agree that I tend to laugh hysterically at really dumb things for a while. I don’t notice it, but my friends say when I laugh my face turns red because I’m laughing so hard. The most unfunny thing I have laughed at is wind, which is pretty fucking embarrassing. I wouldn’t have a problem with it, but sometimes it tends to annoy people. I try to stop but it’s just to funny. Also I tend to get really angry at some things (I just saw this was another symptom, probably not relevant).",12Feb2020,1
35,"I've had a few truly okay days in a row, but today everything has come crashing down. My Probation Officer ""yelled"" at me (no worries--I didn't do anything that had violated my Probation) and accused me of ""not realizing how serious my crime was""...
Ummm... I did a year in PRISON on a first offensr and I now have PTSD from the abuse I'd seen and the trauma I'd gone through for that year. I am well aware that my crime was incredibly dangerous (potentially) and that it was really a bobe-headed thing to do...

Here is where she pissed me off, though at the end she kind of redeemed herself a bit, so to speak. She was going on and on about how I could have hurt someone as if I was doing what I do with absolute wild abandon...completely recklessly. I actually take serious measures to ensure there is minimal risk (though I know things can get out of control--I am aware of that too) and it isn't like I am just doing it for fun or to be a wild child. I literally can not stop myself when my urges hit. They completely overwhelm my brain and that pull is so strong that I get physically ill and so stressed if I don't either satisfy that need or (if I catch it early enough) distract myself to the point where I have to completely use my concentration on something else. A good example is that I was so triggered (I call it ""sparking"") this afternoon when I got home from Program that I was literally in pain from the desperation I was feeling. Well, my hubby saw this sign that I was feeling really...stressed out, and he then asked me to go to the nearby mom &amp; pop store for soda for dinner time. I had to take our 12 year old because I can only trust myself to go to Program and Probation alone (sometimes I get horrific urges even then that take every ounce of my willpower to resist so I don't commit another crime like I want to) and that made me focus on something totally different--walking and having a conversation with our little girl. 🥺 I just gave in though a few minutes ago but I was safe and it was controlled and small. Anyhow, my PO ""redeemed"" herself by asking if this disorder is that severe that I think about it constantly and have a problem resisting. I said it certainly is *that* severe. I didn't do anything that violated (as I said) so she couldnt do anything but express concern. I am going to this Program every day... I am looking into receiving individual therapy as well... I am taking my medications as I am supposed to be taking them.

Sorry this is a wall of text, but I am kind of annoyed that the PO is still treating me as a straight-up criminal. I never ever denied doing what I'd done...but it truly isn't something I'm doing just for shits &amp; giggles...it is a mental illness that had no cure and actually no set protocol for treatment, especially in adults. It has barely even been studied. It only affects less than **1%** of the population. I don't glorify it...well...maybe a little...but now I feel as if I have to be ashamed of it and should hide it and myself from society because I'm ""dangerous""...

I do not wish to live the life I am in, I do not know how to get out of it.

I have two autoimmune diseases, scoliosis, endometriosis, required leepz procedure, getting a biopsy for cancer in May.

I am tired all the time. There is no explanation for the random symptoms I get. I'm told o may have another condition, but they don't know .

I went to university, I work in my field full time. I make less than 35k a year with no medical benefits, on contract with no job security.

I will not have kids because of my health. I see that the world is on fire and based on the science we as a race seem to have little hope. Less so when you review the state of prejudism in the world.

Currently, my work place is incredibly toxic. I've been applying to jobs for months with almost no call back. I live with my family, very toxic; mental health, hoarding, etc. 

I'm trying. I'm budgeting my money, I almost never drink (one-two glasses every other months). I try to exercise despite chronic pain and fatigue. I'm looking into getting additional diplomas/accreditation in my field to move into a higher pay scale hopefully. I've booked a session with a therapist, but it always ends up being too costly. I'm trying to find an alternative doctor or specialist that can find the missing piece in my health.

But I'm so tired. Tired of trying and getting no where. I don't see a way out any time soon . I don't know I can continue living and working Ina toxic environment, but to move out I would have to sacrifice the money I spent on physio, therapy, meds that I need to maintain function.

I don't know how to get out, other than to keep puttering along and hope it gets better not worse.

41,"I don’t know where this type of post belongs, and the only place I can think of is here. Before I start, I should say that I don’t want to mislead anyone. I have several factors in my life aside from my weird fear of getting old that led me to believe this is the only solution - the fear is just the icing on the cake. 

Basically, I’m an 18 year old in the US. To some people I’m a kid, to some I’m an adult. depends on how old the person is I’m interacting with. But regardless, everyone can agree 18 is young. I have pride in being young and youthful. It makes me happy. Having that teenage spirit with all of its brashness and arrogance is... comforting, I guess. And I’m just not really ready to give it up. I don’t think I’ll be at a point where I’m able to take my life while I’m 18, but when I’m 19 I surely will. It just has to be before I’m 20. 

I guess my reason in posting this is to ask am I literally just crazy? Like obviously everyone here is going to say suicide isn’t the answer, but I’m just like... never going to be happy aging. Never. My life will be an endless downward spiral until I eventually succumb to old age, alone and uncared for. I just don’t know what to do at this point.",12Feb2020,1
42,"Long story short, my parents moved down with my sister and I several states away from any other family relatives due to economic opportunities. They raised us themselves. My father made friends here and there but they seemed to have never stuck. I think he never adapted to where he raised us, as he seemingly had plenty of friends back in his hometown. 

Fast forward about almost 2 decades. He apparently told my sister he was going to kill himself a few years ago 4 ish years ago) using exhaust from car. Nothing became of it. He is one of those guys that think avoiding medical treatment and not speaking about anything is “manly”. 

We have had a lot of good memories, he has been a good father to us, provided and showed us the ropes. He never physically hit us, anything like that. However, he does have a short fuse for yelling at times.


We went through some turmoil with my sister 2 years ago. She ran off with some boyfriend. She was suspected to be using drugs. DURING THAT SAME PERIOD, my father lost his job. He would make mention to a “death day”. I am assuming he was either referencing killing himself or something along those lines. 

He has a dark sense of humor and sometimes it is difficult to read in between the lines. 

He was able to get another job but making less. However, my parents were able to stay afloat. My sister is doing better, back on track.

Over the last 2 years, my father just sits in the house and never goes out to do anything. He goes to work, goes home. He just sits on his phone or watches movies on the couch when I am there. He is also always watching sci fi talking about how he likes gore and serial killer stuff, always making references that he hates people and thinks it would be “fun” to do those things... i told him that is kinda weird... he responds with “would you rather hear me say I want to kill myself?” 

My parents get along most of the time but they usually aren’t even with each other when they are both home, just in different parts of the house. I am unable to answer if they are authentically happy in their marriage. I’m not sure. 

I really don’t know what to do. He won’t open up if I try to talk to him but this stuff haunts me. What am I supposed to do? It literally kills my mood he is so miserable all the time.

46,"1. I don't remember how it turned out this way. I was born one year after my parents marriage. My parents were new in their careers plus there was family tension so they didn't pay much attention to me. I don't remember a day of love. My parents must have loved me but I don't remember  anything. I lived with my mother in rural city, I was often humiliated for my lack of knowledge. Confidence in rock bottom, no one to support me, but hey I get punishment for mistakes 

2. I have survived because God knows how I have a light attitude towards life and so I'm here. Parents don't see how I was neglected,  isolated. They had born me and let me figure out things on my own. My education, manners etiquette, bringing up was my own responsibility. I was beaten up fo mistakes, sometimes everyday. When I look back at my life, I see fear, tears, beatings, humiliation, isolation, mistakes, regret. 

3. A new topic began when my parents beat me for mental illness. They said that I'm not mental stable. Now keep in mind, my parents are educated,  I come from a high class family and everything is civilized beyond imagination so I don't know why they thought I was mentalLY Ill. But they must have seen something that I didn't 

4. Soon enough, I started seeing it too. In 2011, I started having maniac episodes , ranging all night long, all day long. My episodes consisted of crying, tears, speaking to people in my house and dancing. My body shakes vibrates, voice changes , I shout at the top of my lungs over nothing. Just now I shouted at nothing and came back to sense and saw there was no one so I rushed to write this post 

5. I was declared an undiagnosed maniac. Everyone in my family knows this. My father has a good habit of humiliating his own children, while he lies about other children's mistakes. 

6. All day long, I go through episodes. I live a rather normal life. I have made good friends, lived normal life outside of home. They thought this was my personality, I thought it was too. But something else is going on

So I want to learn more, to become more enlightened on the topic because it seems to have been becoming quite popular over the last 2 decades. Between Councilors, Therapists, and other such things, they seem to exist for almost any and every topic and seem to vary greatly in quality and professionalism. 


Like, I don't fully get the point behind them exactly? They seem to be people you pay hundreds of dollars to per hour, just for them to talk to you about topics and thoughts that you could have either looked up on your own or had a discussion with a random online, in person, or from family/friends. 


Hell, even during my time when I had committed myself like 9 years ago for depression the patients did most of the help. Talking amongst each other, realizing that there wasn't anything overly 'wrong' with us just we were different. Hell, even the guy who would talk to me daily inside flat out told me that I seemed to have a solid grasp on most of my problems and the solutions I needed to do to fix them (Mostly from my own research into the topics and the professional methods people typically suggested for X things). 


I don't know, the whole thing just came off as pointless to me in hindsight. If your work covers a few sessions, might be worth checking into, but past that, just cause they got a fancy degree doesn't mean they will actually KNOW how to fix every single individual persons issues for people who want to get help. So why should someone have to spend hundards or thousounds of dollars on someone who is going to just tell you stuff the internet can tell you for free if you have enough time to actively look it up in detail to begin with? Cause if you have time for 1+ hour of sessions per week (plus travel time) then you have the time to be putting that same amount into deep dives into the topics as well. 



Also, how do they know for certain that you are X thing instead of Y thing? If both things cover all the same boxes and you show signs of both. Is it just a coin flip? And what happens if they don't get it right? You could spend decades trying to fix one issue you didn't have because a professional said you were X but then another professional years later said you were Y instead. 



I want to learn about all of this, cause the more thought I put into it the more, almost silly? a lot of it feels. Silly might not be the right word. Cause there has to be some benefit to it beyond just blind trust that person with a degree can fix you.",12Feb2020,1
57,"Here I am. Dissociating. Talking to my imaginary audience within my daydreams. Talking to a void really. My dissociations bring up my past trauma and leads me down a hole of depressed agony which certifies dissociating is not **good.** No ifs or buts about it, Morgan. Hey future me, **stop coddling yourself you dumb fuck.** \\

Anyways, I started walking down the seemly endless staircase of thoughts: me making my fictitious world laugh as I am the true God literally and nothing I do will ever become real- a hard thing to accept when you suck dopamine like a nicotine lollipop, me saying something vague as my special friends ask perfect questions to allow me to elaborate further, I electorate but not really, my special friends go silent and I start asking *myself* perfect questions- except I cannot elaborate on them because it is beyond my understanding, bad memories. Bad thoughts. Anger. Irritation. Guilt. Loneliness. Rinse and repeat until it is tender, stir and enjoy. 

My mother is the root source of all my trauma. My dad is dead, my dad isn't *my dad*. My mother lied to me as a kid about my medical condition. She said it was due to a car accident, I swallowed my tooth. My dad was the best and he was my idol. Imagine that idol not being related to you? Imagine your real dad is actually everything your 'foster' dad wasn't. My biological dad was a criminal. He was abusive, he was a *monster.* The boogeyman that haunted me since I was made aware. The villain that caused my medical condition. It didn't help that my oldest brother, my only *biological* brother, used him as a threat against me. I was 10 when I found out. My brother loved me so much, oh yes! He really did *love* me. If lust is love then I was his goddamn wife at the time. That motherfucking bastard. Ever since my dad passed, my mom's mental state went downhill. A big snowball effect, there was no damage control. Her hallucinations, her delusions, her erratic behavior. I mean, what the fuck. Of course I kept quiet about all of it, I didn't understand. Years of this shit with added ingredients such as her abusive boyfriend, her ignorant ex who hated me, her final pregnancy, my new brother's autism, her prophet mindset, my psychotic break, bullies at school. All were optional but the box labeled them regardless. I don't know if it was thanks to the ingrained delusions or her foggy memory where she stopped referring to me as her daughter.  

Do you know what it feels like to have your mom genuinely ask you if she gave you the sex talk yet at age 17? Do you know what it feels like to see your mom look at you as if you are unrecognizable? Do you know what it feels like to have your mom doubt your ability and to feel the need to treat you like a pet instead of a family member? I wouldn't expect anyone to know how that feels. But if you want to know, it feels awful. It hurts. The last time I had any interaction with my mom, she called the pilice on me in an attempt to lock me up in a mental institution for the rest of my life. Why? Because I wanted to move out and live with my sister. I told her I would keep in contact, I told her prior about y plans. She done nothing until the last minute, the day after my 18th birthday. She was yelling on the phone, trying to explain to my sister that I'm an 'animal'. I need to be 'watched at all times'. How you can't 'leave me alone'. That I'm a 'danger'. Amazingly, after that huge fight, her boyfriend had the nerve to (calmly) say ""Don't put your mother throw that again"" as if I was the one to start the flame. I only boiled over due to her constant nonsense, I have kept it all inside all these years and have dealt with her verbal and PSYCHICAL abuse. I have gave her excuses after excuses defending her actions towards me. I wish it felt good to defend myself but it really didn't. It was a huge blow. I also wish I could say living with my sister was a good idea. Yes, *it was*. It got me outta there and I am grateful, but my sister was only a fraction better. She was a druggie, a negative person overall. An unstable one. I eventually had to leave her too, I tried to kill myself. I hope she knows I'm alright and never meant to leave like that, just gain reached my boiling point. I don;t know what I did to deserve the animal reward from my mother. What did I do? I never touched anyone physically unlike her. I had my breakdowns as you do in those situations. Did nothing mayor though. I never got pregnant unlike my sister when she did at age 16, I never done any drugs unlike my sister and brother. I never got into fights unlike my oldest brother. I never did anything to directly harm anyone, yet she felt like my every move was a threat. It's mind-boggling. What she'd cherry-pick was normal teenage stuff as I learned later on.

60,"  

Hello! I'm Aidamis, currently a student abroad, several months after a good Samaritan convinced me to get over my fears and follow through on this project I had started myself.

edit: feel to scroll down to the ""therefore"" actual checklist paragraph if the wall of text intimidates you :) thanks

However, my trip is having the same effect as Steve Jobs' trip to India. Lot of new experiences but no ""Woaouh"" factor, no magical ""falling in love with xyz"", no sudden inspiration surge to fix my nonexistent work ethic, find my passion, or face my demons.

I have discovered self-help three and a half years ago after a lightbulb lit up and I faced my wrong university choices, poor life hygiene and low self-respect (like Jordan Peterson I'm a bit wary of the idea of self-esteem). However, after somehow defeating my own dictator who keeps coming back once in a while, I'm still wandering through the desert and still have no clue on how my life relates to my future or any contribution to society worth a damn (pardon my language).

Quora recommended ""medication and meditation"" to folks with symptoms similar to mine, and I'm taking neither since I think I'm deeply depressed, just apathetic, zen in a bad way. Meanwhile I put off meditation because (I think that) I'm aware enough that 99% of my problems are still stuck at the wall of accepting mortality, normality and ultimate lack of control. I still cannot let myself go.

All in all, that leaves me with one mess of a privilege life I'm ungrateful for, all because while being lazy I'm also a perfectionist with unattainable standards and I stubbornly hold the belief that I have a moral obligation to save the world, or at least contribute to the betterment of the lives of many. Actions-wise this is why I still haven't abandoned creative writing completely, though I've yet to be published. But here too I can't get sh done because while I'm imagining my characters completing their arcs and finding solace I (think I have) no desire for solace myself, maybe because complaining is so much easier.

Still, as the song ""to say goodbye"" by Uma2rman goes: ""a late epiphany is wandering my barren room"". I know I have the tools somewhere but I know I don't want to feel pain.

So, I've compiled this random list of stuff I need to fix/actions that might be helpful which I am writing in real time, from the top of my head. Problem is, to me getting homework done and playing a videogame is one and the same thing, and love and even self-love is worth pursuing as much as a billion dollar, which is not much. Finally, I have trouble quantifying my goals and breaking them down. I might be in need of some cognitive therapy but where I live the cost is prohibitive and I'd rather take some advice on which books to read to ""self-medicate"".

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, what I might be in need of but don't know what to prioritize/how much time-wise is:

\-become even more mindful

\-set a schedule

\-find time for my hobbies and my foreign language studies

\-find time to check on universities for my MD (I graduate this year)

\-get some progress insofar as to finding my life purpose

\-go to the gym/exercise

\-get rid of some annoying addictions, the least of which are YouTube, daydreaming and videogames

\-procrastinate less

\-learn to reward myself without becoming a dog (I heard from a self-help specialist that traditional carrot and stick schemes are outdated and stupid)

\-become self-grounded at long last, whatever that means

\-find true happiness edit - pick up meditation and stick to 20 min/day? if not 20 how much?

Please, if you could give some tips on which things to do first, I will be very grateful.

I dont have many memories of my father when I was young. I only remember him coming home drunk and beating my mom. I woke up once when I was 5-6 yo
To him beating my mom on the kitchen using whatever he had in his hands. Or being at my aunt's house and him smashing on the door from the outside wanting to come in. I never asked my mom why and as I grew up I tried to supress everything. My father still gets drunk but he hadn't beaten my mom in a long time, but about a year ago. The same shit happened again. I'm 19 so I was somewhat able to put my mom and little brother in a my room and lock it. He still tried to get in but didnt and then I went into my room. My father isnt always like that.

62,"Hey there

So I work in retail and as is often the case, there’s a lot of gossip and complaining going on behind the scenes. Most of the people I work closely with have shared their distaste for how another co-worker behaves or conducts their business. It almost seems like a bonding/coping mechanism.

Unfortunately, I get very sensitive to the critique about my own performance and identity that I hear through the grape vine. 

I consider myself a pretty amiable person and I generally get along well with people in my life outside of work, so I feel confused and hurt when I hear that somebody I’ve given the benefit of the doubt before is not doing the same for me

How do I stop caring about what my co-workers think about me? How do I rise above all the gossip-y BS and not let the anxious work environment pour into my home life?

75,"Crisis: what should I do with my life?

In high school, I did a lot of different things: National Honor Society, all advanced classes, 4.0 grade point average, cross country team captain and top runner, one of the top runners in three different track events, concert band section leader, marching band soloist, pit band for musicals, jazz band soloist, saxophone ensemble, leader at my church, extra church classes in addition to regular school, and all the usual family commitments and chores and all that...

Then, I went to college. I chose to go to the school that gave me an academic scholarship instead of the one that offered me a spot on their cross country team. At the school that I ended up going to, I wasn’t fast enough to make the track or cross country teams, the marching band was actually just a boring pep band (so I quit), sax ensemble was made up of music majors (not me) that had won awards for playing (I was only holding back the group), I stopped going to the gym after a while due to loss of motivation, I quit going to church out of guilt, and I ended up losing my scholarship because I couldn’t keep my grades up. 

While all of these failures were happening, I was diagnosed with major depression and extreme anxiety. I’ve tried medications, therapists, counselors, psychiatrists, the works. Nothing seems to be helping much. It’s been years since I started college. I kept trying to go back to school after I lost my scholarship, but I just got deeper and deeper into loans and debt. My parents also refused to financially support me in any way when they were still able to, so I wasn’t getting any help from them or FAFSA. I managed to scrape by and get my Associate’s Degree, but I will probably never be able to go back for my Bachelor’s. 

Somehow, I got the man of my dreams to fall in love with me. We are getting married in just a few months, and we bought a beautiful house together. The problem is that, because of certain circumstances, we are financially struggling a bit. He has a high-paying full-time job that he doesn’t like very much at all. I have two part-time jobs that I like decently enough, but they don’t pay very much. My fiancé wants me to try to get a higher-paying full-time job instead so we can afford for him to get a job that he enjoys more (and for the current financial situation). I agree that we could use more money, and I would rather not have two different jobs (because it’s a lot to balance and handle). 

My anxiety and depression have really taken control of my life. I don’t do anything because my depression takes my motivation and my anxiety makes me afraid to take chances. I’m just really at a loss. 

Alright, (more than) enough background info. The current situation is that I’m sick of jumping around to different random jobs. I need a real job, I’m getting married, I need to start an actual life. But I’m not good at anything. I’ve realized that I’m mediocre at a lot of things rather than good at any one thing. I also don’t really have a certain “passion;” I try to stay very neutral in most things. I’ve tried a few different careers, but they all have ended up in failure.

I was thinking maybe somebody else is familiar with these symptomps and can help me identify?

It all started probably 7 year ago (at a wedding dinner)...i suddenly felt like im gonna puke. I kept rushing to the toilet, to have some air...all fine...when i got back to the table - same situation. Since then I had these feelings all the time. I couldnt eat out, only at home alone, lost a lot of weight...finally i somehow learned to live with it and gained some pounds back.

Lately though I've been experiencing it again. I get really bad anxiety when im somewhere I cannot leave (theatre, plane) and at that time its impossible to eat anything. I feel like im gonna vomit, die, whatever...even tho im trying to be rational - i know im not gonna die, i know - it doesnt help. Its exhausting. All i wanna do is sleep. My job is all about travelling (its great, i shouldnt be complaining) but its hard, i cant eat with the colleagues in restaurant, im always like ""aaah, i want to watch netflix, so i will order room service""...sometimes i rather dont eat all day, when im working, its ""safer""...and i think colleagues notice and are weirded out...

I started therapy, but i cannot think of ""why"" this is happening. Its getting worse. Therapist says he thinks its not eating disorder (i dont have body dysmorphia, i dont wanna lose weight)...he says its anxiety.

I come from kinda broken family, so i dont really know how to do romantic relationships and just the idea of romantic dinner makes me nauseaus...im scared im gonna end up alone.

Im a 20 year old college going student . 9 months ago, I got into my first relationship (in my country,that is the avg age to start dating). The person I am dating is diagnosed with severe anxiety and low self esteem issues and is going to therapy.

A little background on my life : born in a lower middle class household,parents couldn’t focus a lot on me both financially,mentally and physically because I have a sibling with cerebral palsy ( neglected in the sense we couldn’t afford anything more than food on the table,not a lot of toys and other childish fantasies, also parents were busy putting food on table or caring for my sister) . Was bullied a lot because i was unable to afford iPhones and eating out at expensive places during my teenage years. I feel that I have had to grow up before the required time multiple times. Converted that toxic anger as a fuel to push myself to crack the best uni in the country. 

I feel mentally drained rn because I am the primary caregiver for my girlfriend and she sometimes becomes too much to handle,she accuses me of things that i have not said,gets triggered at me for no reason, all our firsts in the relationship(date ,kissing, saying ILY, intimacy) have been marred by her anxiety and random esteem issues/fear of happiness/whatever you call it. 

I personally don’t believe in therapy or pills(my father is now a successful man in the pharmaceutical business,so I know what pills actually do and the dark side therapist-psychiatrist-pharma nexus)

I need help/tips so i can articulate what i feel about my life a little better and feel happier,as I believe that if i know what is bothering me/draining my energy, i can feel better.",12Feb2020,1

A few years ago I had a really tough time coping with my newfound struggle with anxiety and it made me learn more about mental health and the importance of checking in.

Last year I opened a Telegram channel as a way to inspire myself and others to check-in and have ongoing, safe conversations around mental wellbeing. I called it Mellow Millennial.

[https://t.me/MellowMillennials](https://t.me/MellowMillennials)

The channel features a scheduled broadcast of content pieces that aims to inspire personal reflection, thinking, and conversations with the people you care about. We hope to engage young professionals and individuals to activate their awareness of their mental health and struggle with issues such as anxiety, depression, or loneliness.

Mental wellbeing shouldn't have to be so serious. So I keep it fun with interesting polls, memes on adulting, and pieces of music and videos to help you get through the day.

I atleast want a diagnosis, however the psych I see said ""at your age we can't diagnose you"", I'm wondering if she's talking about my 'antisocial' tendencies? I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, however I think I may have something more, perhaps a personality disorder, apparently so does she (my psych). she even got... scared, or just shocked the other day, it was the first time I spoke about my true thoughts, she sounded disturbed, and told my mum if I get any worse I'll be admitted to hospital and they won't let me out til I'm medicated. I've also come to realize therapists think that me talk8ng about my problems to them will simply help me magically. I want to give up I want to die but I won't kill myself because I don't wanna leave my pets, or my nephew, they're so innocent they won't know where I've gone.

I also have a fantasy world that I go to when life gets too much, (almost all of the time). I've stopped school due to my lack of friends and my overall, arrogant selfishness. Everyone there hates me, and to be honest I don't blame them. 

Any advice for this situation?",12Feb2020,1

93,"Recently work on my dissertation has gotten really intense. My supervisor is scheduling meetings almost every single day, usually with a day or less notice, for me, him, and the other guy (student, same as me) on the project.

It started in January with these meetings, where he’d often send a request to meet the next day. I check my emails every day, but because they were usually send with less than a day’s notice I didnt always see them in time. One of these times the other student on the project message me 5 minutes after the meeting was supposed to start, asking if I was coming. I was at home at this point, and it would take me half an hour at least to get to the building. Now I had seen the email shortly before that message, but by that point it was already too late to go, and seeing as the other student had not send a reply confirming he was coming, and hadnt message me asking if I’d seen the email, before apparently was already in the meeting, I at that point assumed the meeting wouldn’t take place and we would reschedule.

Instead they have the meeting without me. This has now happened several times, and it is stressing me out because I feel judged for not attending the meetings, even though I feel like it’s his fault for scheduling them at such late notice (without asking us if we are free; I guess he just assumes anytime we are not in class we will be free).

Anyway, recently I had some home stuff going on, as well as this, and on top of serious worries about my future. I got a counselling session that the university provides, and I have another session in a weeks time. I took some days off University to work through stuff and get a breather. I send a message to the other student in the evening (we were supposed to meet up about something else, not the main project, and without our supervisor the next day) and let him know I wouldn’t be able to come tomorrow after all.

This is at the point where he tells me that the meeting him and our supervisor had at lunch time that day (the 3rd meeting they’ve had without me), they’d organised meetings with important people regarding the project, at the time we were supposed to meet (I guess they both assumed I would be free then, which is fair enough). He says he can do it without me if I still can’t make it. I don’t answer straight away, as I am unsure about whether I should go afterall.

I decide not to, and email my supervisor. I say, I’ve been informed that they’ve organised those meetings, but unfortunately I won’t be able to go. I also in that email mention that I would appreciate them not having meetings without me unless they are urgent, and cannot be rescheduled, as I feel left out of the loop. He emails me back (he is aware that I have some stuff going on at home, as I emailed him earlier that week to inform him). He says to take care of my mental health, but then also says that the meeting is important and is there any chance I can come anyway. Then he says that him and other student have only had urgent meetings, so I am not out of the loop.

I dont end up going to the important people meeting, but I organise a seperate meeting with me and the important people a couple of days later, so all should be in order. Things were starting to look up again, but today I had to cancel a meeting (we had a meeting yesterday, so no this meeting was not urgent; and I realise it seems like I am missing a lot of meetings, but I swear a) we just have that many meetings b) this is the only one I’ve actually cancelled, the others I wasn’t aware were happening/they were organised so I couldn’t go in the first place)), and now I just got an email with two random sentences, so I guess they had the meeting without me (again). They don’t send me notes on what happened in the meetings either, when they have one without me, so now I feel out of the loop again...

It’s gotten to the point where I want to drop out or kill myself. If I could drop out I would, I am not enjoying this course as much as I’d hoped, and it is only one year so I could drop out now and reapply and get in somewhere else for next year (my grades are fine, and enjoy the content, so it’s not the degree but the place where I am doing my degree I regret). However I am stuck paying rent for the rest of the academic year, and I receiced some grants I would have to fully or partially pay back because I didnt complete the course, and because I am halfway through the degree I’ve already spend half the money (and paid 2/3 tuition fee). So economically it is almost impossible for me to drop out.

I don’t know what to do. I feel anxious, and keep crying; I keep getting annoyed at my friends/housemates for really minor stuff. I am super busy at the moment with this dissertation; my consellor told me to do more things I enjoy, but I don’t have the time, trying to stay on top of this dissertation stuff. It’s my 25th birthday soon, but I don’t want to celebrate. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to; I just want to be done with this degree, but I can’t drop out.",12Feb2020,1

I’ve been through hospitalisation and therapy, I thought I had coping mechanisms that worked for me but life just seems to be pushing me over that edge again. I can’t believe I’ve actually done it after such a long time free from those destructive actions and coping mechanisms, which has just added to my feelings of being a failure. 

I’ve been waiting a few weeks now for an assessment for my mental health needs as I knew things were getting bad again but it’s just become too much all of a sudden and the urges to hurt myself became stronger than they have for such a long time.

97," 

I'm going through a lot, I'm done with trying to help me and get out of this hole by myself. I need professional help.  
I feel like I don't deserve the good things that surround me. I have a very beautiful girlfriend and lately I've been an asshole to her because of this bunch of thoughts that fill my head. There's a lot of negative thoughts in there about me (like I'm not enough for anybody, insecurities, the thought that anybody is better off without having me as a friend or that my girlfriend is better off with someone else but me), about what I can become, about what I'm capable of doing to fuck myself up, the thought that I can trust no one and that's not true, that's not my true self, but I don't know what it is that it suddenly fills my head like that.

When we first started dating, everything was different. I was very affective, I had no worries about her, I trusted every word she said, she's not a bad person, she has been there for me and in the beginning that was the case for me too and now everything is difficult for me, I'm not saying I don't trust or love her anymore, but my own mind is hurting me with thoughts that are not real. I know this problem has been chasing me for years, because I know I have lost things and people because of this. I had a big progress with this issue, that's when I met her and we were the happiest couple around. I'm hurting myself and her with this, I don't want to hurt her anymore.

She told me that we might have to break up because I'm letting win the problem I have (is it depression?) and I'm putting those thoughts first instead of her love, support and care.

I'm going to therapy tomorrow (it's my first time ever), I want to fix myself, I want to be the one that I once was, I am now reaching for help.

98,"I don't know if culture has anything to do with it, but my friend is from Finland and thinks my goal should be to stop being in treatment. She frequently says ""I just want to see you be done with the doctors,"" as if mental illness doesn't require lifelong management and doesn't ever come back. FWIW, she also just got a degree in sports medicine/exercise science and according to her boyfriend, Finland has one of the highest suicide rates in the world.

I told her that treating a mental illness doesn't start with exercising more, it ends with exercising more. It's the ""finishing touch,"" the final step to making your life manageable and meaningful. I told her that mental health treatment is similar to exercise in that you can't overwork yourself and your body literally may not let you. It starts with getting out of bed, maybe being on meds that even allow you to feel the effects of serotonin in the first place. You have to go to therapy before you can safely do self-help and practice your skills, but just as not everyone ditches their personal trainer, there isn't always a reason to stop going to therapy. Only once you have energy, the ability to process serotonin, and the ability to handle the endorphin and adrenaline rush does it make sense to add exercise to a mental wellness plan.

At this point, I don't care if it's oversimplified or if I ""got it wrong"" because she apologized for suggesting I was ready to walk for 20 mins a day. She didn't realize that my 16 hours a day of sleep was because I fall asleep naturally after 8 hours of being awake.",12Feb2020,1

103,"My brother, he’s 18, has been struggling for a little while now. He’s dealt with OCD since he was young. Since he finished high school last June, it seems as if things have progressively gotten worse. His anxiety and depression is keeping him in this constant state of isolation. His OCD causes him to not be able to do normal daily tasks if they’re not at a specific time. He hasn’t charged or looked at his phone in over a month. He barely leaves the house. It’s like he’s deeply afraid of living. He’s been in bed since Saturday night and hasn’t gotten up. My dad got him to take his medication I think once on Sunday afternoon, but that was it. 

Last month he was a patient at one of the mental health facilities in our area. He stayed there for a few weeks, going to groups every day, taking his medicine, eating, and staying on a good routine. He was of course being monitored by doctors and nurses who work there. He came home last Friday after being away for nearly a month and he seemed like a new person. He was talkative, smiling, and overall he just seemed a lot better than before. 

Until Saturday... as soon as he comes home it seems like he relapses. He goes to bed and doesn’t get up. For days. No eating, no drinking. He doesn’t shower. It’s insane. 

He’s done this multiple times in the last 6 months. He’ll go in isolation mode for days, sometimes over a week, until he’s so weak and delusional that my dad has to make him go to the ER. Every now and then he chooses to go to the ER without my dad making him. He’ll stay there for a day or so, then he’s transferred to the rehab facility and usually improves when he’s in the care of other people. A few months back he only weighed 112 pounds. He’s around 5’10” so that was the skinniest I’ve ever seen him. After being away for a little while, he gained close to 40 pounds!!!

Basically, my dog is my #1 trigger of my bipolar disorder depression and anxiety. I got him at the recommendation of others to try to HELP my anxiety and depression through walks, affection, unconditional love, etc. However, the dog I ended up receiving from the non-profit has worse anxiety than I do, doesn't like to be touched, and is extremely needy. He also hates our apartment. I work SO hard to try to give him a good life (seriously, I even get commended by his vet for being such a responsible pet owner), but he is still terrified of everything and unhappy. He makes me feel like an absolute failure, especially considering the fact that he doesn't act as badly around my husband. I feel anxious about his well-being 24/7, I feel rejected, and frustrated, and it triggers self-harm and suicidal thoughts. I've been dealing with this for over a year; I realized within a couple months the effect the dog was having on me and wanted to find it a new home - NOT a shelter, but work with friends, families, and non profits to find a safe and loving home where he can run around a yard, maybe have a dog sibling. My husband says he has bonded too much to the dog to give him up, its like a ""son"" to him, and immediately shuts down the conversation if I bring it up -though he has seen me attempt and self harm and go on more medications because of this. He thinks I am just projecting on the dog. Maybe I am, but regardless, my family and therapist recommend I find a new home for the dog for my own safety. It will break our hearts, but I just can't do this. But I also can't hurt my husband, I love him so much and this will leave a huge rift in our relationship. Looking for advice, I have no idea what to do. But I just can't take this pain anymore.

It’s still here and I want to kill myself everyday I live on this earth. Whenever I tell someone e.g a teacher, or friend and they someone for me, I’m labelled as an attention seeker. Like I do this for my enjoyment. Like I want to struggle. I don’t. I fucking hate my life and my mental is never taken seriously enough by my family or my psychiatrist. I don’t what to do to convince them that I’m actually struggling.",12Feb2020,1

120,"Hey guys, so I'm a pretty big hypochondriac. I freak out about very little things, exploding it into something else, constantly psyching myself out. With that being said, I have undiagnosed tinnitus. I played drums when I was a kid with no protection and throughout my later teen years into my 20's (23M), I have always heard constant ringing. However, on top of that, I have heard very minimal swooshing or running water. Recently I was by myself doing some work in the office, and I heard something (that I assumed was my swooshing) however, auditory hallucinations has always terrified me, specifically the thought of hearing voices or people. So right away, I thought ""am I hearing voices?"". Since then I have fixated on the ""swooshing"", trying to hear if it would be ""voices"" per say. However, when I'm laying down at night, I am never able to discern ""voices"" or ""swooshing"", sometimes I think I psych myself thinking it is ""chatter"", however, again, I have never been able to discern anything, or hear an actual ""voice"" saying anything. Im trying to stay calm and tell myself its my tinnitus but again, with me being a hypochondriac, I'm just fixating on it. Im just wondering if anyone has any thoughts on the matter? I can only hear this stuff when its completely quiet.",12Feb2020,1
121,"Throwaway because I want privacy.

I was raised by strict parents, but they cared and loved me a lot, they never hesitated on paying whatever was necessary for my needs. For clarification, I live in a undeveloped country and until recently in a very small city. My parents were poor and got themselves in a lot of debt to pay for my medical needs, I don't remember it, but all my mother's pregnancy was problematic, as well my process of growing up until I was two years old, when I got healthier.

My biggest issue growing up were the mental problems of my father, he has anger issues and severe anxiety. Today he is a lot better, but many times when I was growing up I had to hide many of my problems, by instructions of my mother, from my father to evict problems. My father also always said to me to ""never trust anyone"", which makes sense for him saying it, since he suffered a lot on his life (When I was a kid, he worked 16 hours a day by working in two jobs, one as a teacher and the other as a water station, where besides treating the water he acted as security since they lack personal).

This however led me to develop big trust issues, and my mother, perhaps trying to guide me to be more independent and resolve my problems alone always said to me that ""I shouldn't blame others for my problems and that we are always responsible for what happens to us""

Overtime, the financial situation of my parents improved a lot, with my mother today being a fairly successful government officer and we being fairly well off, but with this, I think our family grow more and more dysfunctional, no more we played games at night and enjoyed good moments together, we less and less had truthful moments between ourselves, because everyone is hiding something from the other all the time.

I went to a therapist and got hold on most of my issues, mostly always putting my needs in second plane to please others and feeling anxious about harming others, which I did a lot, but even after I changed, I continued having self-depreciation thoughts and self sabotaging myself, thinking that I wasn't worthy enough of good things happening on my life.

Today, tough, I had a nightmare, which shaked me up, where my father hit me and choked me (similarly to what my girlfriend did to me on our last fight) . I waked up without breathing right and feeling a  lot of pression upon my neck. But I couldn't bring this over anyone, I only felt blame over letting myself be shaken by a nightmare, and then I can't think straight on why this affected me so much and I go on in a spiral of self sabotage.

After it I went to a Mall to buy my lunch (for clarification, today I live in a big city, I moved there so I could go to College) I couldn't avoid the feeling of being watched by all those people, and whenever I heard someone laugh I thought that they were laughing of me. I felt myself sweating a bit and very  nervous.

That is until I convinced myself that I had the right to vent somewhere about how I feel and started feeling a lot better, and almost didn't make this post anymore, since I thought myself selfish of drawing the attention of others that probably would need this more than me since I was feeling fine. 

I'm feeling anxious right now, because I am used to expect a lot of harsh judgement of others whenever I bring my problems, even when it doesn't happen I can't avoid feeling guilty for doubting them in first place, so many times I simply don't bring it up, since I also have severe difficulties to express how I feel. Talk about politics, history, games or whatever? I can give a lecture about these themes, even being shy. Try to talk about how I feel? A lot of stuttering and awkward long silences.",12Feb2020,1

Alot of people say its good to talk about your issues, but ever since recently when I started taking anti-depressents for my Anxiety and Depression due to a serious 'feeling down-phase', I've been more open with my friends and family about everything I've got going on. Lately because of how I've been feeling, I'm just generally so confused now, mentally I feel better but now I just feel soo out of coordination. It feels like what I used to be like has just been multiplied by 100.

Unfortunately alot of those around me are tired of me being open with my mental health, (It's only recently that I've started being more open) and so far within these last two months no one wants to be around me. I've recently lost alot of so-called 'friends' I've been kicked out of of a group of mates and one of my good close mates has told me they're tired of my shit, both these incidents felt like a dagger going straight into my heart and through my soul.

Because of how confused I am, everything I had set straight has just been re-shuffled and now It's almost as if I cant think straight and I've lost who I used to be. Everything just keeps getting worse and I dont know what I can do. I just want to be myself again but now I cant make sense of anything, it saddens me so much.

Sorry if anyone reading this thinks otherwise as of what I've written, I just wanted to write this all down and see if anyone can help me make sense of this, saying as some of you lovely people have been through stuff aswell, you guys might understand where im coming from. Thankyou for reading, Im just soo confused at this moment :(",12Feb2020,1
126,"So I’ve suffered from depression in some form or another since I was 10 and started self harming when I was 11 due to bullying at school.
Since then I don’t seem to be able to pull myself out of it. I constantly feel like I’m a burden to everyone, I have no confidence at all, I have no self esteem at all either. 
I used to use work as my motivation and distraction to keep going but eventually my mental health got so bad it resulted in me suddenly developing a form of epilepsy so I haven’t worked in over 3 years.

I dont feel like I have any actual friends and people only have any dealings with me when they want something or when they need someone to talk to but when it comes to me problems everyone always seems busy. 

Today was a good example of how bad it has gotten I was having a coffee with a friend along with a couple of their friends and I just felt ignored and excluded even though they were talking to me and I was talking to them. My friend picked up on it as I said I was going home but she basically forced me to stay and talk about what was wrong (she’s incredibly supportive and is pretty empathetic).

I have serious trust issues aswell due to my previous romantic relationship ships being very abusive from manipulation to gaslighting to stealing from me to physical assault.

129,"I have to see my GP at least couple of times a year about my eczema. It should be something I am used to. It’s the same thing every time. How is your eczema? How are the medications you are using? The answers are always the same. However, I still have to prepare myself. I have to think about all the possible questions I am going to be asked and how I am going to answer. One random question, which I haven’t prepared for, can change my whole mood. From being confident, to feeling like I am losing control of the situation.

That is what happened yesterday, when I went to the opticians. I have to go every two years, but the last time I went was much longer ago. I was trying to put off going, but my parents made me book an appointment. Once the appointment was booked, I tried to think of every question I would be asked. I even looked at the alphabet, just to get used to looking at letters. Once I was there, everything was going fine, until I was asked about my hobbies. This one simple question caught me completely off-guard. This wasn’t in the script. I haven’t prepared for this. How do I answer? Is she expecting a specific answer, or is she just making conversation? Every possible answer went through my mind. After what seemed like a lifetime had passed, I replied with “Oh, just sports.” It was such a simple question, but for me and my mind, it was a test. Unfortunately, one that I did not pass.

131,"I never struggled with this when I was pre-teen kid. Meeting new people was just easy, maybe due to lack of social awkwardness and various other elements that you learn over the other development years, and especially if you encounter certain trauma.

I don't really have any friends. I mean my phone is mostly silent, occasional meme swap with a friend that I meet once every few months. But I don't really have anything else. Whenever I hear coworkers talking about taking trips to various countries together. I become really jealous, since I have never traveled anywhere interesting or exotic and can't really share any interesting stories or adventures myself. 

I would consider myself a shy and introverted person, but the introversion is probably due to more to social developmental circumstances. I want to be near people, but often when I feel like I'm about to be involved somewhere, I hesitate. Or if I do take the chance and bite the bullet - most of the time I just sit by myself, or eventually just roam around somewhere alone with myself and my thoughts. I'm bad at small talk as well, so it does not help.

Doesn't help that I'm also a relatively big guy (195cm, 95kg wide, big chin), with generally stoic facial expressions. I guess I kind of developed this way, because I used to be teased and bullied a lot for having a ""dumb"" ""retarded"" face and it sort of got stuck in neutral. lol

Not to mention that I also have a lot of trust issues and I'm very hesitant at opening up to other people.

To give a little background. I'm 27 years old, had relatively difficult teenage years and then was diagnosed with cancer at age 19. My girlfriend at the time left me and most of my friends cut ties with me and I essentially spent a better part of almost 1.5 years without friends or any contact outside of parents and medical staff. Later on, when I was 23 I was diagnosed with severe depression and was almost hospitalized because of it. Gained a lot of weight and had a lot of self-esteem issues and anxiety.

At the moment, I'm a lot better. I lost a lot of weight, started gaining more lean mass. Have a stable job and can maybe make a sustainable career in the future (maybe travel to another country to for a new position). I'm generally good at my job and I have no issues communicating with people on a professional level, but when it comes to personal - I sort of lose maybe 20-30 IQ points and struggle real bad with reading people. Not to mention that I still have a lot of self-esteem issues and asking a girl on a date is also really difficult. 

I'm developing in some parts. Reading Jordan Peterson's book and listening to his lectures really helped turn some parts of my life around. Taking a more martial approach to my life is helping and other people like Jocko Willing are inspiring me to be more focused and to keep grinding at it.

However it often feels like a massive weight on my neck and I get crazy mood swings when I realize that I don't really have anyone to talk to in life. To share with anyone, to be part of society outside of my work profile. 

I'm thinking of taking up boxing, maybe living a stricter lifestyle will help me put things into perspective more.",12Feb2020,1

133,"Every so often, I get triggered by something and my mental illnesses run out of control. I've been diagnosed with depression, OCD, and anxiety. I talk a lot about my anxiety and depression, but my OCD is still a bit foreign to me. So, I feel as if these incessant nagging thoughts are normal. I overthink,  tell myself the same thing over and over, and ask hypothetical questions. Sometimes I do it so much that I give myself a headache. Other times I do it so much that I sob, partly because I'm ashamed of myself and partly because I believe what I tell myself.

I'm in one of those ruts right now. I feel as if the entire world is conspiring against me. I feel as if the world hates me. That I'm a failure. That people think I'm an idiot or embarrassing. I get too scared to leave the house when I'm like this because I'm *convinced* that everyone — literally everyone — feels the same way about me and can't wait to call me out on it. I don't recognize that others don't perceive me this way. 

Does anyone else get super paranoid about these things? Does anyone else feel like their mental illnesses keep them down or that they're just a big embarrassment? 

I feel like I know what my problems are, but I don't know how to fix them. It's also partly because I don't want to fix them; I'm comfortable feeling like shit about myself because it's familiar. I don't ever want to acknowledge any good in me. I constantly seek validation from others and when I don't get it, I feel as if they're right. I'm unworthy of forgiveness or love or understanding.

134,"I had a lot of expenses last month. my tooth needed a crown, I also bought shoes and a few shirts &amp; trousers because of post-New Year sales. I also only cook not more than twice per week. I live far from the city so I spend at least 45 minutes of commute from home to work, the upside is that I pay less by half as much when it comes to rent, which gives me the breathing space I need for other expenses included with a bit of leisure time and therapy. 

I was able to squeeze all of that in one salary, with very little left. Yet a part of me feels horribly self-indulged. I'm one of the lower paid staff of the company, yet when I go to work, everybody is always frowning, even though most have earned modestly higher than me. Everybody has these big money-making ambitions but I feel my mind is just glued to the present and instinctual pleasures.

136,"I’m 23, been smoking and drinking fairly regularly since 16. Been off the cigarettes and booze for over a month now. I feel healthier physically, but all the friends I had, I used to either drink or smoke with, or both. Everytime I talk to them now I find them irritating. Like the dopamine I was getting from the chemicals was the only thing that made these people bearable. In fact, I’ve lost interest in all social contact. I am suspiscious of everyone I meet, including my “friends”. I continue to refuse invitations to hang out and I sit in my room all weekend. At work I daydream of a more solitary occupation, and an eventual relocation to a cabin in the woods with a dog. At least a dog doesn’t fuck you around.

The problem is, environmental factors are extremely hard to avoid. Even small things like break up, low self esteem, loss, or lack of sleep can trigger those genes, causing full-blown depression. That’s why if depression runs in your family, you’re almost always going to get it. It’s one of the most inherited diseases. Clinical depression can be triggered by trauma, yes. But if you take a normal person with no family history of depression and torture and starve them for days, they are not going to end up with clinical depression because they don’t have the genetics for it.

139,"Context: For a long period of time, about 2 or 3 years, I was in a very unhealthy relationship, we would fight very frequently because he was jealous of my friends. The fights were really bad honestly, he would yell sometimes and say really harmful things, so I would cry a lot every time, and he would tell me to shut it already because It was annoying, and that made me repeat ""I'm sorry"" and cry even more.
We would fight probably 3 times a week. It got worse over time until I couldn't take it anymore.

Since then, whenever I have an argument with my SO, if something triggers me, I would start crying and hyperventilating. It feels like I'm living those awful moments again, my mind won't stop repeating things that hurted me in the past, that i'm annyoing and such. I start saying ""I'm sorry"" and ""don't get mad at me"" again and again. I get to a point when I think ""please just stop"", hoping the bad thoughts will disappear. All that while my SO is trying to calm me down.

Last time It happened (two weeks ago) I was able to calm myself, reminding me that everything is okay now.
Sometimes I think of what may be this thing that happens to me, maybe panic attacks? Sorry if not, I really don't know.

In which we lost our house, savings, jewelry etc. We now live on rent as my mom and brother work and I study. Since i was in school I had no close friends only the people who were in my class I had fun with. After school I completed diploma in there also I had no close friends. By close friends I mean those who hear your problem when you have something to share. My mom never really paid attention towards me I went to a school where our fees was almost nothing and completed diploma in CS by paid scholarship which I got on my own. Mom never cared if I had any problems she just thought feeding us was her only job she saw more as a responsibility than her children also used to hit me a lot, she sometimes used to hit me for something that happened with her and she released her anger when I did something wrong as kid. After diploma I decided to take a break and enroll for degree after a year because I was fed up with studies. But still wanted to get a degree as it'll land me a good job. As I'm older now me and my mom fight a lot but my brother just says sort it out between us. Just because I took a break from college didn't mean I stopped I still take different classes related to my studies.

I did not dress myself until around that age as well (I had a very hard time with getting my limbs through the right parts of the clothes, could not figure out zippers and buttons, etc). Self-care has always been (and continues to be) challenging for me.
* **Sensory ""discomfort""(?):** I don’t know how to explain this, but there are certain textures that are deeply disturbing to me (tissues, denim, silky fabrics, etc). I can’t touch them. If I do, I need to rub my hands together or wash them a lot to get the sensation to go away. *This has been present since I was a small child, and has fluctuated throughout the years (Present as a very small child, very intense later in my childhood, less intense as teen, then more intense again as a late teen/adult).*
* **Communication issues:** For most of my life I've had a difficult time expressing myself verbally. Communicating with others is taxing for me. *This has been the case since I was a small child (as I said in the first bullet point, I was a little late in my developmental milestones), and I feel like this has been where I have seen the most extreme fluctuation throughout my life.* I was extremely quiet and isolated when I was a small child, and I never felt like I had the words to describe what I wanted/how I was feeling. At around 9, my communication skills increased so significantly it was kind of unbelievable. Everyone around me was either impressed by my vocabulary/how mature I sounded, or annoyed because I sounded cocky (to this day people in my family say that I was a smart child who thought she was better than everyone else because of ""the way I spoke""). I came to America as a High School Freshman at the age of 14 without knowing any English at all, and in 3 years I was completely fluent and starting college. Then since my early 20s, I have inexplicably been losing all of those communications skills. I am losing vocabulary, losing my ability to understand nuance, losing my ability to effectively express what I mean, losing the motivation to talk to others, and overall regressing to what I was when I was a small child. This is also reflected in my behavior. I have always been told I behaved childishly for my age, but when I hit puberty I started to be able to behave normally for longer stretches of time. I even became popular with boys. Then, as I became an adult, I started regressing again. I started feeling like I couldn't be alone anymore, feeling very attached to objects, etc. I recently went through a very stressful period of time during which I felt like I had to bring my stuffed bear to work with me (hidden in my backpack). I recently went on a first date with someone, and the date didn't go very well (he wasn't that attracted to me) and I cried in front of him. I couldn't control it. I didn't sob or anything, but as we were saying goodbye there were tears in my eyes. I must have looked like an insane person. It was humiliating. This is one of the reasons I just don't want to interact with anyone anymore.
* **Self stimulatory behavior (Rocking from side to side, punching myself lightly in the upper arm, rubbing the palms of my hands with my fingers, etc):** It is not something I consciously start doing, it just happens naturally when I’m anxious or bored or uncomfortable. *This has been the case since I was a small child, and has fluctuated throughout the years (More intense as a small child, less intense as a pre-teen/early teen, then more intense again as a late teen/adult).*
* **Social issues:** I consider myself to have okay social skills if the social interactions are not too long. I learned how to mask my discomfort around people and draw responses to social cues from sort of “scripts” I learned over the years. That said, these scripts don’t always work. I interrupt a lot and have problems identifying when it’s my turn to talk. Very often (especially when am I talking to people in positions of authority or about things that I am interested in) I tend to go overboard and talk too much, repeat myself A LOT, and after a while I start not making much sense (trying to over explain things, etc). I take people too literally, and also speak very literally, which causes people to misunderstand me a lot (and vice versa). *This has been the case since I was a small child, but manifested itself differently throughout the years. When I was a small child I just stayed quiet and isolated myself. I was still a somewhat quiet teenager, but a lot less so. Then as a late-teen/adult, once I lost the structure of school (which forced me to interact with people), I became almost completely isolated again.*
* **Clumsiness:** I have always been very clumsy and had a hard time with certain motor tasks (such as tying shoe-laces, for example). I have been told by more than one person that I have a strange walk, but I could never identify exactly what they were referring to. I could never learn to swim or ride a bike. That being said, I have been able to draw extremely well since before I could even speak, to the point where sometimes I would try to say things to people by drawing pictures. *The clumsiness has been present since I was a small child, but I feel it has been improving consistently through the years.*
* **Inflexibility:** I have always been extremely distressed by changes to my routine/to what I was expecting. I have been described by people around me as ""unbending"" and have been told I am obsessed with fairness. Also, pretty much every I have argued with always says it is impossible to argue with me because I sound like a lawyer (because I am too literal and always try to stick to objective facts rather than emotions when arguing). *I have always had some level of obsessive compulsive behavior, but this fluctuated in a very different way from the other ""traits"" above (It was manageable as a child, became much more extreme as a teenager, then has been slowly decreasing as I get older)*.

I just can't keep going like this. I'm so unhappy and almost completely isolated. I've been told these things sound like autism, but the psychologist I saw wouldn't even discuss it. I don't know where to turn for help. Any advice will be highly appreciated.

145,"I’m about to turn 21 and I still feel like a child because everyone else decides that I can’t take care of myself.

So incapable that it was decided it was best I didn’t finish school and that when I was about to get a job - nope let’s move me across the country because me as an 18 year old with scary mental illness not being looked after , can’t have that.

I get pissed when I try to quit my “disability money” and they keep wanting to talk to someone else (a doctor etc) about it like no discuss it with ME, legally an adult that takes care of my own shit. If I want to get a job take me off of it. I already know everyone is saying “go into your fifth year of internship” dont get a job never become independent u cant do that.

And I know so well that people think it’s so easy to just get out of it and taking care of yourself but I was so so close. I was about to get a job how tf can they legally decide that I’m supposed to move 6h away. And no matter how many courses I take or jobs I apply to I’m always expecting 2 police officers at my door saying I’m moving to x city asap dont even put on shoes.

My friend who is also in this situation we talk about this so much because we imagine the day where we have control over our own lives and aren’t just a diagnosis on a paper and when we can look back at all of these people who decided what was best for us and think we showed you. And it makes me think without any diagnosis at all this wouldn’t have been allowed any normal person isn’t always being watched like this.

I’m slightly anxious on how the session usually looks like.

148,"First time posting. Just wanted to share my long journey so far with someone. 

I’ve been battling with severe mental health issues for the past decade or so, and I’ve never sought out treatment until a few months ago as I was afraid I wouldn’t survive this round of depression. It was clear that I had depression and anxiety but I wasn’t sure what type really. 

Anyway, finally started medication and also meeting with a psychologist. Turns out I have major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder (together literally called “double depression”) social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder (one can only assume that’s called “double anxiety” lol).

I feel extremely relieved (I guess that how I’ve been feeling feels legitimized somehow - not to say that it’s not legit without a diagnosis ofc but) and I’m glad I have a name to what’s happening me.

Are there any other people on this subreddit that suffer from this sort of combination of disorders? Any tips/advice/stories are welcome. Thanks!",12Feb2020,1
149,"This is a bit of a rant post but I don't know where else to say this so I understand if you don't want to sit through my ramblings.

I feel like my mental health is beyond help. Not only do I have depression, anxiety, and possibly OCD but everything in my life is being ruined by well, me.

I only have to friends, the rest I've pushed away by being to weird, awkward, or distant. Oftentimes I'll say something over text and if I don't get a response right away I'll stay up all night worrying that I've said something offensive or stupid. Then I realize it was nothing when the person I'm texting responds normally. I'm always doubting myself and afraid of joking around for fear of making a mistake. I overthink every single little word I say and it's killing me. I'm always afraid I'll lose the only two friends I have because I'm a boring unemployed loser who stays at home all day and they have lives, jobs, and are dating. I've never been on a date in my life and I'm 20. I can't hold down a job because of my depression but I don't tell them that because I'm afraid of what they'll think of me. So I've been pretending that I'm looking for a job for months when really I'm struggling every day to get out of bed and take a shower.

Every night I feel like my personality changes and suddenly I'm very dark and negative and I believe life is meaningless and that there's no use trying. That's when I struggle the most with suicidal thoughts. I feel like my whole life is fake and a lie, like I can't really be myself and I'm always hiding how bad I truly feel. I wonder how I'm supposed to survive in a world where I'm expected to work a 9-5, raise a family, and then grow old and die when I don't want any of those things. I feel completely incapable of functioning normally in society.

I've been taking medication for 2 years but so far all they've done is drastically lessen the suicidal thoughts and help me sleep.

Since I have nothing to fucking do I constantly make new Reddit, email, and gaming accounts only to delete them when I feel they've been ""tainted"" either by something dumb I said or by not becoming popular or well liked.

I was super cringy in middle school highschool and went through an edgy phase where I was into metal and dressed in all black and told people I was a ""witch"" even though I was an atheist. I think I did it for attention and because I was trying out different personalities to see where I fit in the most. I obviously got made fun of for my stupidity and I still cringe at myself to this day and constantly put myself down for being such a fucking ass.

I still don't know who I am in this world and on top of having and existential crisis I feel as though I'm having an identity crisis too. I can't bear the thought that I'll never amount to anything in my life while other people were rich and famous or be loved my many friends.

And that's pretty much it. I don't know what'll fucking fix me, and I don't even know if I should have posted this rant because I feel super ashamed. But here goes.",12Feb2020,1
150,"Hello, this my message the world fix everybody. Anybody that is struggling or finding to cope. Being in a dark place where walls in are caving in inside your mind. The feeling so strong. You become to think that will the pain ever stop. I bet I am not the only one felt this powerful emotion before. You probably think it’s better off if you just disappear. You think of proper day to do it. The right time and right moment. Just like that  your gone. Your existence fading away in the abyss. Once your gone the people around you will be hurt and filled with lifetime regret. What about you? Well you, your energy and your being will be stuck in a window. Unable to fully pass on. Reliving that finally moment for rest of existence. 

I am writing this because I want people to really understand pain. I think all of worlds problems can be fixed with an easy solution. I want to bring amazing future to our planet. I am tired of people suffering in silence you don’t have to be. We need to be there for each other. We need to stand up and think for people and less of ourselves The planet can only handle us for so long. We gonna stop tearing ourselves little by little. Stop being the recipe for are own self destruction. The rule of our existence is based on energy. You were once non physical form aka soul/spirit into a physical form. The chance of you becoming you is so high it can not be explained. There will be only one version of you. We gonna make it count. 

The environment we are in right now isn’t looking good for the human race. Governments and people in power don’t have a best interest for us. They are trying to mould us to be In a system that isn’t able to support human life. 

All my millennial friends. Who don’t think they will ever amount to anything. All our answers to our problems are always right in front them. Each of us as powerful gift. What gift isn’t thou. We have the power influence and it comes to us so easy. The people that fought for our future. Are standing above us will die for the blessing we have today. We have the ability to change perspective. Global Consciousness is a real thing. We have the ability to shape a our planet in ways we have never seen before. 

My rule of life. We need respect and love each other ❤️🙏❤️. Please do it. We have more control than you think. All the sadness we face can be fixed my Nurturing the human heart. The connection of emotion is around us from life till death. I believe we are already in a world war. What war is it do you ask? It’s the war on Consciousness. How can we fixed it. Well it’s easier than your think. It’s all about connection. The funny thing is that everyone expects to be human but being a human is the hardest thing to do ever. We aren’t perfect but we strive to be. Isn’t that good enough? We gonna stop shattering our connection with ourselves. 

I believe in life we have 
Personas. You start from a baby to adult. We have titles along the way. We are gonna learn how to mentor people and be the reason for someone to change their perspective. Even if it hurts them. The greatest lessons In life are learned through pain. Rmb that 🙏 . Sorry to break your hearts. Pain is part of the human condition. It’s in your being, we are all Survivors. We gonna start acting like it. When we will bring life to this world. If you are caregiver or a parent. You to have ask yourself this question. ARE YOU READY TO PASS ON WISDOM. If you think you are and confident life will fill in the blanks for you. If aren’t ready think about this. With your loved one standing right in front of you. You are not only loving a child you are loving a father,brother,grandparent,mother and sister. We want the best for everybody. We gonna look for the big picture. The reason to bring life into this world. Is too make sure love spreads. All of us life’s problems can fixed by repairing a lost connection. That simple. The reason we fill our cup half empty is to keep a opened mind. Rmb that. Fixed your world the whole world will fix itself. Rule of life, the ripple effect.

I want people stand up for what they believe in. People of power want to separate us but we are humanity we can not broken. We are special. It’s never too late to inspire the people around you. You don’t have to have super powers to be a superhero. 

I want my message to all share across all platforms. We can all be a superhero. The time we are in its our shining moment. God bless.  Loved a caring human ❤️",12Feb2020,1

153,"Back in November I got to a point in my life where my mental illnesses consumed me. I ended up attempting suicide, which led to the worst 3 days in ICU. I talked my way out a 72 hold and went to an intensive outpatient program for a month. It was rough and it put a big toll on me and my family. It ruined me financially to the point I thought about doing it again. 
I'm on some meds that work and doing better, but getting my life together after this has been hard and I still struggle. I try to talk about what happened because everyone in my life is trying to move on, but I can't move on. I wanted to kill myself, and still struggle with suicidal thoughts. My therapist helps, but sue doesnt understand or get personal about anything. 

I tried to look up a support group for people who survived a suicide attempt. I have done really well in groups before and feel like if I had a group where we could talk about it and help eachother. All I can find though is support for families of people who attempted or had successful suicides. I tried a generic mental health support group but they got uncomfortable because of how open I was. 

Do you think starting a support group in my area could be helpful? Is this something you would he willing to go to if it existed? I dont know where to start but I feel like I need this and others might as well.

154,"Something is wrong in my head. I've known for a while but its been bothering me lately.

Since like sophomore year 3 years back ive been able to kinda turn off my emotions in a way. Like if i feel really sad or really angry i can just ignore it. Especially if somebody is going off about something to me. For the most part i can probably hold on to an emotion for for like a minute before it starts to fade back into contentment.

 I just kinda don't empathize feel other people anymore. 

Its not like i have super control over my emotions, for the most part i usually just feel mellow or content. 

Nothing excites me but nothing lets me down anymore either. 

I can kinda feel joy and i can kinda feel anxious and annoyed but i cant really feel sad, or angry, or compassionate at all. 

i get annoyed when people try to get me to sympathize with them by telling me about their life like they want me to pity them because i genuinely just don't know how to make make sense of what their feeling.

Recently I've noticed that people have been looking at me like im crazy.

 Like people i don't interact with.

 Ill be sitting on the bus minding my business and notice somebody giving me this look like i might want to hurt. People do it at work to. 

People move around me like im some kind of asshole manager or something. 

They look at me like im this secretly violent person when im really just trying to get through the day. 

I get that i don't talk or converse as much as everybody else but i don't understand how that can make me into a threat.

Im a short african american female and i feel pretty self aware. I don't think im making faces at people and i think i have a pretty neutral presence.

But i cant help but get annoyed thinking that everybody around me thinks i care enough to want to hurt them.

I don't know what you would call it but for the most part i don't care enough about the human race to want to hurt another person.

All i wanna do is make enough money to support myself and live until i die.

My first instinct is to try to help him with whatever is frustrating him, but I can see how that might just reinforce the behavior.

This guy, I asked for beta-blockers, told him I was depressed/anxious and had lost over two stone due to a flare up of anorexia. His response? I’ll print out the beta blockers on a separate prescription to the sertraline so if you change your mind you can get the latter. And go book in with the nurse for your BMI.

161,"I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and ADHD. I took stimulants (adderall, ritalin, Vyvanse) to combat the ""ADHD"" but none of them helped. They all made me feel emotionally good, jittery but never focused. I realized that the diagnosis was wrong. I took what was prescribed and occasionally took more because of my cognitive issues (easily distracted, forgetful, emotionally unstable).  Now my brain is complete shit to the point where I can't read a sentence without getting confused or rereading it 10 times. 

I took Prozac and it made my depression significantly worse. It made me sleepy almost all day. I'm taking Zoloft now but they're also making me extremely tired. The anxiety is minimized but my depression seems worse on antidepressants. 

My mood swings are intense. I go from having suicidal thoughts to happiness in minutes or hours. It fluctuates constantly throughout a day, but my baseline is depressed. I have a lot of internal anger at the world and myself. I think people are not genuine and do things because it's the right thing to do. I never believe what anyone tells me. 

I feel jealous and sadness at everyone doing significantly better than me. I also feel jealous of people having better childhoods than me, or having supportive homes, or just being normal. Sometimes, when I get a pinch of validation I think I'm the shit and feel better than everyone else. When I get slight criticism I shut down completely and have a hard time letting go of what caused me to feel this way. 

My thinking can be black and white because of my mood swings. I have a boyfriend, and he does everything he can to show me his affection and love, but sometimes I don't believe him at all.

 I have these weird thoughts that he doesn't love me. He's embarrassed by me and only loves me because I was the first girl to reciprocate feelings for him. I avoid him most of the time and act passive. I hate that I act this way because I really am in love with him. Sometimes showing affection and expressing that vulnerability is difficult for me. Sometimes I am extremely in love with him. Other times I question everything about us.

I isolate myself socially and avoid people all the time. I never speak to anyone in class because I feel weird. My thoughts, actions, and behaviors don't feel like me. Sometimes they feel foreign to me, like my body is on autopilot and I do things automatically without being aware of it. 

I act differently with different people because of my fluctuating self-esteem/idenity. I catch myself mirroring other people's traits because I don't know what normal is. I understand it's not normal. I always feel like people can see through me. This is amplified when I become mute. My thoughts sometimes feel blocked. This makes me anxious, which is when I become extremely timid. I rarely say a word when I get like this. I feel awkward and my social anxiety amplifies. 

Nothing is spontaneous. I have to think about everything hard before I do, think or behave a certain way, and even when I do, it feels ""not me."". I have a hard time making eye contact. Before it was never a problem because I wasn't aware of it. Now I just stay in my dorm most of the time and never socialize.

 I feel high all the time, but the kind of high where you feel high but don't feel any pleasure. Everything is just hazy all the time, 24/7. I forget everything easily. I have absolutely no friends. I feel empty and lonely being in college. I feel stupid. I know this isn't me, but is it? 

This is more of a rant. I did seek out medical advice. I'm just waiting for the appointment. Has anyone experienced this? I don't wanna flunk ANOTHER semester of college (first year) and be lonely.

162,"I’m 29, I love Harry Potter. I grew up with him. I’ve also grown up with depression. Well since a 2012 diagnosis and subsequent periods of major depressive episodes (like right now). This one has just made me resign from a high-paid but stressful job today. It’s not an out to say a dementor forced me to do it, it’s actually a phenomenally accurate analogy. 

I never stopped to truly appreciate how great this analogy for depression is, until just now. JK Rowling introduces Dementors in the third book, the ghost like guards of Askaban which feed on your fear and command inescapable despair like Medusa’s eyes will turn you to stone. It’s utterly perfect to describe how depression descends and envelopes you. 

You cannot control them. You can’t control it. They can decent on you at any time and feed directly off your fear, growing ever more powerful as they do. You have to conjure something borderline superhuman in order to banish them upon arrival. It takes huge energy, laser focus and strong belief to banish a dementor. Just like a patronus. Without your patronus, all is lost. Sometimes tragically forever. 

It’s such a wonderful analogy. If you ever want to explain what depression feels like to someone who doesn’t suffer from it. I’m referring to depression importantly, not sadness. Describe it in terms of a gang of dementors and you can’t conjure your patronus, or even conceive of one.",12Feb2020,1

Now I have a good job, and I’m going through hell x10 because it is demanding and my brain can’t keep up without 2-3 coffees a day (I’m not addicted to caffeine, but I literally need it to be remotely sharp at work).

Back track to college, I tried Vyvanse one time during finals week. My brain never felt so sharp in my life. I never felt so in control of my own thoughts. It was so satisfying to be able to READ without thinking of some f***** activity I did 2 years ago. Or about a meal I haven’t had in a while. Or about some random current event. These thoughts happen when I speak to people, read, or pretty much do anything.. but that one time when I took Vyvanse, my mind was absolutely focused.

I'm sorry if this isnt the best place to post this, but I don't know any other subs like this

My (18) Dad (38) just had a very bad breakup with his girlfriend. She left with most if not all of his savings and his cat. I don't live with him, but he asked me to, which I'm uncomfortable with, as I'm very close to finishing HS. I don't know how to approach asking him to consider therapy, but I'm very afraid he will possibly hurt himself. He's really afraid of being alone, he texted me saying he ""thinks crazy thoughts"".

I've already offered to let my cat live over there, since he doesn't get as much attention as he needs to here anyways. I don't know how to broach the idea for therapy, and I don't think he'd agree with it either. 

How can I help him through this?",12Feb2020,1

167,"I like my job, I do. It's my first ""real"" job post-grad. However, it's not in a field I studied, nor really had any interest in. I'm not very busy in the position I'm in, so my days are often filled with me reading the news or being on social media until a task comes across my desk. I'm not fulfilled in any way, and there really isn't any room for advancement. I looked at this job from the beginning as a stepping stone, and I potentially have other opportunities coming up. But I've realized that because I'm so bored and unfulfilled in this position, that it's seriously affecting my mental health and depression because it causes me to feel and believe that I'm useless and that all my schooling amounted to nothing, and ... it can get bad. I just don't know what to do right now, other than continue to look for other jobs. I also know that I need to become more social because not having any friends doesn't help either, but it's quite difficult where I live. I've been scouring social media and event sites trying to find stuff I'd be interested in, groups or classes that seem exciting to meet potential friends, but there isn't much for my age range or interests...

I'm at a loss, and that is what is having the most negative impact.",12Feb2020,1
168,"Hey. I've experienced this a few times. I think it might have something to do with concentration or stress. It manifests a little differently. The last time it happened I imagined an object that was infinitely big and it really hurt my head to think about it.

The other times was on a math test and while I was lying in bed and staring at the ceiling (quite literally)

It triggered the symptom, which feels like my every move is echoing. It also feels as if each movement I make is extremely short, and it feels as if I can't speak (I imagine in my head that I can't speak and that only garbled sounds come out if I try) even though I can.

The things that help with the symptom are a change of environment, putting on music (or specifically changing the sounds in the room NOT to be static) or speaking with someone else - sort of to prove to myself that I can talk.

It's so weird because I can't find this described anywhere.",12Feb2020,1
169,"I am hindered severely by my anxiety disorders, depression and trauma. I have been informed my mental disorders qualify me as a person with disability by my doctor but I still feel guilt and shame everyday that may be internalized ableism. I have fears that the government will one day randomly decide I'm not disabled after all and I will be taken off government financial support and become homeless. I can't see a happy future with these problems. I would like to do serious work on my disorders but there aren't a lot of options. I've been waiting to stat sessions with a therapist on a waiting list for several months. During this time I've attempted suicide three times. I'm dying inside. 

Anyway, all that aside, I wish almost everyday that I had a physical illness like a cold or the flu or something. I would even be fine with something terminal. Whatever illness can elevate the guilt I feel about being housebound and unemployed.",12Feb2020,1

172,"It's just a stupid hentai but the concept of it really really shook me to my core, which is odd because hentai, manga ect is something i can never take serious but even though I never did the extremes the character did to fit in, it just really messed me up inside.

The main characters last thing say she was sorry she couldn't be a mama just hits me, my mother is out there somewhere and she left me when i was 7 years old, I remember the night too, I was sleeping and she woke me up and said she was sorry but that she was going, she had washed her hands with orange hand sanitizer and whenever I smell that a massive FLOOD fills me up.

It's silly honestly, but I just wanted that character to have a happy ending, and I don't know why I can't stop thinking about it. It makes me want to go adopt a girl my age when my mom left and just have a happy life, to have a family.

All this over a stupid fucking porn comic. I don't know if it's too healthy to obsess over this and I haven't really thought of her in such a long time, she had me when she was 18 so she would be 38 now, I never tried looking for her either, when i was older atleast, when I was younger when me and my dad would go to super markets i'd always look for her in the crowd.

I just feel so alone and that fucking comic made me realize how sad life is and how lonely and unforgiving it is, even if it isn't real in the books.",12Feb2020,1

The drive and everything about the location is killing me, I want to be a normal teenager so badly and my parents keep ruining every opportunity for me. We could be living in a house but my parents are emotionally abusive and my mom refuses to let my dad move us closer to my life. I come home and it’s like being a gravitational pull of depression. I want to cry throw things and break down because I feel so helpless and I can’t do anything to change the situation without making my life worse. I don’t know why my parents have to be so stubborn and stupid. I keep on thinking that they’re going to change, but they’re not. They are emotionally abusive and I can’t change who they are as people, I don’t want to live in this crappy hotel forever. I’ve tried to kill myself three times because of my history with this hotel and it’s like my parents know it’s a trigger for me and that’s why we stay, I really feel like they contradict themselves saying they want the best for me and that they’re proud of me over text but do nothing to reflect this their behavior or the opposite. I’m so envious of my friends who have houses, and even more angry that it’s not a money issue it’s a neglect issue. Doesn’t help that I just turned eighteen and because of believing my parents I didn’t get a job and now that I’m trying to I keep getting discouraged and becoming unmotivated because of my mental health and I won’t even be able to afford a place on my own even if I was working all day all night every day of the week.

178,"Anytime negative thoughts, bad memories, or overall being reminded of something unpleasant makes me scream and the worse part is I can't control it. I used to do this occasionally when by myself but it is getting worse and worse to the point I no longer have the ability to stop or prevent it only running out the classroom to avoid stares when I do. I sometimes indulge in constant hypothetical situations that cause me to have to explain the reason why I am doing what I am doing/defending my character or personality over ridiculous things sometimes. I have to hit myself for it to stop when it gets really bad. Politics, people arguing, or just a nasty stare can trigger me to have anxiety attacks I don't want people to tiptoe over my feelings for this to not happen so I avoid social contact. I do think I have a solid grasp of reality and I don't think I have any outrageous delusion or any auditory hallucination. I never think these voices are real but they might as well be because they taken a toll on my life. I have imaginary conversations...every single minute of the day. They can be pleasant but sometimes they're accusatory and I am drain of having to explain myself to them even when it is obvious to me. They usually personified themselves as people I know in real life and they're personalities usually are exactly like them.  I feel so immature when I do this and sometimes it lasts 10 minutes on and off screaming and crying then...I am fine and happy. I even start repeating words and sentences over and over again to calm me down not on purpose but more on impulse. Does anyone know what this could be and how to stop it?

180,"Adult child of an alcoholic, depressed and anxious for forever. 28 now and I've been going to therapy for about a year and a half. Diagnosed today with Dependant Personality Disorder. My first instinct was 'no way, that's not me'. But the reality is that I've been wanting to do the same thing (break up with my controlling bf, move out, start my art goals) for 3 years (1.5 in therapy) and have made no action towards it.

 
Had a harsh therapy session in which I was told my fantasy brain that helped me out of traumatic childhood experiences is making me disillusioned. I disassociate from the reality of not being happy where I am and that I am so fearful of making actions. Even if it's towards a life I want because others will be upset.


In trying to leave a shitty relationship for years, I was mad to hear that I was ""dependent and not willing or ready to change"". I've known for a long time now that I'm unhappy and working on my healing to deserve better in my head.


It makes me want to prove myself wrong. It makes me sooo frustrated that I have the insight but no action towards my goals for years. That I value so much of what others want that I have such a hard time with what I want. 
It makes me so sad that I'm happier and more ""safe"" not making waves and staying in this relationship. That being aware of how unhappy I am seems too scary for my traumatic child brain self  to process so I go back to not making waves. I'm upset with myself and frustrated. Everyone is tired of me being in this shitty relationship but no one more than me. 


It hurts to make goals and now have your therapist tell you that your goals are not set in reality. The reality is that I am incapable of leaving now.


I want it to be now. And it's hard not to slip into hopeless. Just needing to vent about the progression and slow work of mental health. That the mental illness has such deep roots in me that it holds this much power is beyond frustrating.

183,"I feel like this is some higher power telling me that this is it. This is The Point in my life. I don't know what it means. Nothing feels worth anything anymore. I have very few friends, and the ones I do have only pity me. I don't want to die? But I feel like there's no way out of this without a repercussion of some sort. This is my make it or break it moment, but I don't know what ""it"" is. 

I'm worried. I feel as though if I keep going my brain will split in two and everything will come out the middle. But if I stop everything I've worked for so far might just slip between the cracks and disappear,  leaving me with even fewer hopes than I do now. I experience severe depersonalization, but the kind in which I am still lucid in my head. I feel like I'm locked in a body I can't control and isn't me. 

I'm in high school, but I'm 18 years old, making me a legal adult. Because of this, my therapist isn't allowed to tell my parents about concerns without my permission. Yesterday, I was saying such things in a panic that she had to send in the individual at the agency who can... properly decide if I'm a danger to myself? I don't know the title. My therapist wanted to tell my mom about what happened, but I'm not letting her. So now I have to put on a face and act like I'm alright, all while I'm screaming and screaming and screaming in my brain, locked away. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm not to the point where I've been deemed unsafe, but I feel like I have a truck on top of me. I can't breathe and I'm slowly dying, but no one else can see the damn truck, so I have to pretend to be okay. I don't know why I'm posting this. As a vent, I guess? Because I have nowhere else to go? Maybe as a way for me to try to express how I'm feeling because I can't comprehend it internally.

184,"The way I see it is that clinical depression is a combination of genetics and environmental factors. 50% is genetic and 50% is environmental. The problem is, environmental factors are extremely hard to avoid. Even small things that almost everybody goes through like break up, low self esteem, stress, or lack of sleep can trigger those genes, causing full-blown depression. That’s why if depression runs in your family, there is an extremely high chance you will inherit it. Clinical depression can be triggered by trauma, yes. But most people who experienced trauma don’t get clinical depression because they don’t have the right genetics for it. Do you agree or disagree? I know there have been a few cases of people getting clinically depressed without family history but it almost never happens.",12Feb2020,1
185,"Hey everyone, I’m a guy in my twenties and I have been told (and recognize) that I need to fix myself mentally. I used to have so much motivation and was genuinely happy (in high school of all places), however, I’ve found it hard to find that motivation and happiness since. I had cleared goals, worked hard, and maintained the mindset that I could achieve anything I put my mind to. Nowadays, it feels like I can’t get off my ass and go pursue those dreams even though I have the time. I drink and smoke weed and cigarettes constantly and generally have terrible self discipline whenever I get a chance to “feel good”. I’ve gained a lot of weight and the body I worked hard to maintain in high school has all but disappeared. I rarely have the chance to talk to any of my HS friends and find it hard to make new friends at the small college I currently attend. I genuinely think I’m a nice guy and good friend, yet I don’t even know where to begin to get back on track to where I previously was.

Obviously I don’t expect anyone here to “fix” me but I’d really appreciate it if anyone who’s experienced anything similar could tell me what they did to better themselves and where they are today. It would mean a lot to me.",12Feb2020,1
