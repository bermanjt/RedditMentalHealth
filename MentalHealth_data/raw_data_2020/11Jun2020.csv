0,"I really need help right now with my depression and anxiety. I'm not the only one in my friend group who suffers from mental illnesses but usually I'm the one supporting. I always tell them that it will get better and I know that it's true. It's kinda hard to believe that though when you feel empty inside. I see these stories of people actually loving themselves which genuinely surprises me. I want to get better not for me but for my loved ones. If I had no one I wouldn't bother with life or anything. I know in order to truly get better I need to be willing to get better for me but I dont know. I guess my question is how do you stay motivated to love yourself and get better for yourself?

tl;dr: How do you stay motivated to love yourself and get better for you?",11Jun2020,1
1,"I have frequent breakdowns where I suddenly become overwhelmed with anxiety, anger, sadness, frustration, whatever, and it results in my hitting things, myself, yelling and screaming at myself, and sometimes breaking things. This has been happening pretty much since I hit puberty, but I was out on antidepressants after being diagnosed with depression about 3 or 4 years ago which has significantly lessened these outbursts. They are also not nearly as bad, but i feel so out of control of myself.

 I'm going to a new therapist, but I have become incredibly good at ""masking"" and making myself seem normal in front of people for fear of being seen as ""crazy"" or for not being ""perfect"" and this has really effected my mental health being properly dealt with. I dont know how to even breach that subject with him, because I know he'll never see one of my breakdowns since I can usually stifle it enough in front of others to then finally let it all out when I'm alone. I dont know how to get help when it feels like my brain is fighting against me.

I know the internet can't solve my problems, but I've been needing to say this to someone and I just haven't been able to. I'm coming down from an episode right now, and I'm just scared. I bit a fucking pen until it snapped. I just...I dont know. If you read this, thanks. Hopefully you're day is going better.

2,"hi friends!

so for reference i’m a kid, just finished freshman year of high school. i need advice on how to convince my stepmom and dad to let me start therapy.

i’ve been dealing with crappy mental health for a long time, with huge increases around this time last year, and recently. not to self diagnose, but i think it’s very possible i could be suffering from anxiety and/or depression based on my symptoms. i think my mental health has gotten way too much for me to handle by myself.

i’ve been trying to work up the courage for a while. i’m planning on writing a letter for my dad and step (they control medical issues due to the custody agreement we have), but i expect that to be followed up with an in-person talk.

as far as i know my dad just wants what’s best for me, but i’m very unsure about my stepmoms stance on therapy. i know she doesn’t like the use of medication, especially in teens, due to the fact that my brother isn’t allowed to take his anymore, but i’m pretty sure therapy itself is a different story.

i’ve experienced discussions with them before trying to convince them of something in my favor, and it can be a little scary. step is a VP in a company so she knows how to be assertive and sometimes, very manipulative. i know from the past it could easily be switched into them berating me for whatever reason.

i’m not entirely sure what i’m asking for here either. maybe reassurance, or advice on how to be confident and assertive when im already scared of this conversation?

thanks for anything you can do,

6,"Hi everyone, 
I'm new to the whole reddit community but came here because due to lockdown I havent been seeing my regular therapist and I guess im having a hard time maintaining my mental health and processing my often confusing thoughts. Any support or knowledge would be great but I've been looking into the defence mechanism of intellectualizing as I feel it's an explanation for what I've been doing to my thoughts and to myself for longer than I can even think. I have a specific example I want to share and just hoped someone may be able to shine a light on whether it is a case of intellectualizing and just help me understand basically. So I have an irrational fear of death, I have since my anxiety began about 5 years ago. I worry about family members and loved ones passing away and recently my sister became pregnant. I used to worry and worry about her having problems with the baby and my biggest fear was him  dying when he was born- it was so painful I used to push it out my mind. Hes a few months old now and from nowhere I now have this dialogue in my head that babies dont have conscious thoughts like we do and logical thinking therefore they dont understand or 'matter' - I then become so anxious that I've thought this and place the two anxieties of 'well if they dont think like we do they wouldnt even know if they died so it doesnt matter if they did' as you can probably imagine this is such a painful thought process as I pin this onto my sisters new baby who I KNOW I adore but it goes around and around my head and the guilt is so much that I find myself distancing myself from seeing the baby. I dont know whether this is all down to initially my mind trying to intellectualise my fear of death and the baby or what? It's all so confusing to me. Can anyone help?",11Jun2020,1

10,"This last Friday I had an anxiety attack. I spent the night looking for a reason why I always feel like shit and my life has been completely fucked up. I spent hours researching personality disorders and mental illnesses. I came to the conclusion that I am a person with BPD.

From this point I saw the things on the internet that say that it is very difficult to change and it never truly goes away. I then made the conclusion in my head that everything fun my situation is never going to change and I’ll live like this forever. This put me in a horrible head space. I decided I was going to kill myself. 

I don’t know if I actually have BPD or not. I think it’s a possibility but who am I to diagnose myself. I told my therapist that I thought I have BPD and he went on to tell me I reach only one of the criteria. I think it’s still a possibility because I hide a lot of things from him and everyone else in my life like how I’m suicidal at times like last friday or how I will laugh at something someone says when they are talking and then become extremely sad seconds later and be unable to put on a fake smile.

I don’t know what’s going on with me. I don’t know if there is an answer and if there is I don’t think I’ll know for certain for quite a while. It’s just very painful not being sure if you will ever leave your situation. Thinking about it freaks me out. It’s happening again right now. I feel like I can’t think about it or I freak out and then become suicidal. I’m just gonna stop rn while I’m ahead.",11Jun2020,1

I'm just so down. I'm not even sure how I'll turn to normal life after this. I feel like my own mental health has hurt me so much that I cannot imagine being a functioning person after this. And with everything going on in the world rn, I just feel like shit. I want to die so badly, but I don't have the guts to even hurt myself let alone kill myself.

13,"Idk what the fuck i did or why it happened bc i can only google vague shit as i don't know the name of the pill (my mom won't tell me) But a few days ago i took like a quarter of a mild sleeping pill bc i was going to a protest n wanted to be well rested. My mom gave it to me since she's a nurse n takes sleeping pills herself. After i took it i like, felt so good? like i went to bed abt half an hour after i took it and my mind was just CLEAR i could think cohesively and i actually had ideas again?? I'm a v creative person and i remember being in this like mindset a long time ago. I really can't explain it but i think it somehow either helped my anxiety or depression idk. And now I'm just so sad because if that was really it, then holy shit would it be awesome if i were allowed to get on meds. My Mom won't allow it bc, even though I got diagnosed, I'm not depressed enough for her bc I'm not acting like my grandma whos depression shows way more louder than mine. She also says she knows for a fact that people in the hospital would treat me worse bc being on meds for anxiety or depression would make you seem unreliable or insane so doctors n nurses won't take you seriously. So idk what to do. I'm genuinely struggling so much and my therapist has expressed concern that, esp. since my mental illnesses are genetic to a point, therapy without medication would be very difficult. It's so hard to function istg every day is just a struggle and i'm just so sad and angry that I maybe could fix it or at least make it easier but i just am not allowed to. I keep crying thinking abt it. fuckvsagsjka i hate this so much like my parents don't even understand how draining and exhausting and sad it is i don't feel like myself most of the time i don't have any energy and I keep worrying so much the whole time bc of various reasons.

I had to know everything he did and checked which photos he liked or not. I had no feelings whatsoever, I just wanted to 'own' him. Basically I didn't want other people around. Thag friendship ended abruptly because of those reasons. 

Now, 2 years later, I find myself doing the same. I'm new to Instagram and found randomly a person on my feed that I really seemed to like. It is a quite famous person (200k followers). This person lives on another continent, doesn't know who I am, doesn't care about me whatsover. Still do I find myself constantly checking up on that person by checking all of the photos, checking which photos this person has liked and so on... For one reason or another, this person plays a role in my daily life and I'm disgusted by it. I know how irrational this is, bc we don't know eachother at all, but still I can't stop it. I've never been tested, but I guess I have a mental disorder. I'm not lonely at all. I have a lot of friends, work hard for school and try to enjoy life.

I've always had problems with my attendance required classes because sometimes I don't even have the motivation to get out of bed. There's been times its gotten so bad that I don't eat...cause I don't wanna get out of bed. Yes, I've seen a psychiatrist and therapist. My therapist dropped me cause I missed 3 appointments cause i couldnt get out of bed. My psychiatrist recommended I get a dog. It helped, especially during the quarantine. I've been going out on walks and taking care of him. Because I have a cute tiny dog (slight brag) people stop to pet him and talk to me. but when it comes to myself...nothing has really changed.

I went off my meds (Zoloft, Seroquel) in February with a plan to try out something new but I stopped pursuing that due to the pandemic-I didn't want to take resources away from people who needed them more than I did.

My brain feels empty and so so numb, when I don't feel numb I'm overwhelmed with the deepest feeling of sadness and isolation and all I can do is cry. This isn't anything new as I've always dealt with severe depression but I always felt like I was on the path of getting better, whereas now I'm at a complete standstill. When I think about this it feels like I'm being crushed and I just want to die.

Even when I'm talking to someone I feel like I'm probably getting judged or in probably wasting their time, I just feel worthless. Why do I feel like everyone hates me, is this normal? I don't talk about my issues with anyone ever. Plus, I'd like to add I was bullied back when I was in school and uni so I have very low self esteem and confidence plus trust issues thanks to all of those mean people who exacerbated it. For instance, I get severe anxiety when someone leaves me on seen during texts, like why these things bother me so much? Why am I not like other guys or people who don't give two fucks about these things?

23,"At the start of April, everything was mostly normal except that we just closed school at the end of March, one of my three dogs had to be put down and buried (which also started giving me major guilt because I always loved that dog but never was close enough to it since it was more of my father's dog). When May came, I realized that I was seriously lacking at my online schooling (essentially none because I was being very lazy and bit worried of the virus), so I had to rush all of the school work in 3 classes. I also wasn't able to get my instrument for the school band before the lock down, since it closed over the weekend. That gave me a lot of anxiety until, because I took the class the previous year as well, I wasn't required to take it again so it was dropped. The anxiety of that with the other school work, the coronavirus, staying home and not socializing how I normally did started to extremely increase my depression and I started to think about really dark things like death and me and everything I love, my future and purpose, my current self image and if I'm going to actually be successful in my life goals. Starting later into May and continuing to increase into June, I've started to develop many of the symptoms of General Anxiety Disorder such as being scared for no reason and knowing there's no reason to be scared, waking up in the middle of the night nauseous and whole body shaking, drastically furthering my depression, and the occasional vomiting, feeling fake and disconnected from reality.

Now I'm constantly second-guessing myself about whether the things I went through were abuse and if I'm currently in an abusive relationship.

25,"My depression and anxiety are increasingly getting worse the longer quarantine lasts and I was toying with the idea of trying to go to therapy once this is over but realized I'd have the same problems I always have when I start trying to seek help. My biggest anxieties are around money, driving, and general social anxiety and trying to access therapy plays into all three of these categories. Therapy already costs a lot of money but I can't find a therapist in this region that has evening or weekend appointments meaning I'd have to take off work, I could use my sick time but I'm worried about how unprofessional that looks and the questions my coworkers would ask about me always taking off, also once the sick time runs out I'd have to have my pay docked so yet an additional cost. Driving also makes me very anxious, even in perfect weather conditions I'm scared someone will crash into me or won't let me change lanes and then I'll miss an exit and get lost. Most of the year driving conditions here are poor, winter tends to last from November to April and when it isn't snow and ice it's rain. Random construction is also a thing, one day you'll be taking your normal route only to suddenly come across a road closed sign, no warnings posted before you happen upon it. Every therapist's office seems to be downtown and when I Google directions it involves roundabouts and highways and poorly lit back roads that never get plowed.

I tell myself that maybe I should just do it but I went to a few therapists when I was in university and it just didn't seem to help. Therapists aren't supposed to give life advice and they aren't supposed to be your friend but I feel like that's the kind of support I'm looking for. I feel like I don't know how to ""adult"" taxes, health care, insurance, finances, what to do when something breaks down, how to ensure you're getting good service for a good price, all things I've needed to know and yet I don't and I would have loved to have had someone to go to for advice. But I have no one. I had a few friends in high school but we all went to different universities across the country and lost touch, and I'm sure I lack social skills as well because while I was friendly with plenty of people at university I never made any friends. Sometimes you want friends so you have someone to give you advice or help you out but other times you just want to share experiences with someone and I don't have anyone. I suppose the point of this ranting paragraph is that I'm afraid if I ""just do it"" and go to therapy despite all the anxiety associated with it in the end I'll just feel worse because not only did I lose money and respect at work and put my life at risk driving to their office but it just won't help me because it isn't the kind of help I'm looking for. 

I wish therapy was considered healthcare and that services were offered outside of business hours and that offices were more conveniently located. I could at least give therapy a serious chance if I felt there was less risk associated with trying.",11Jun2020,1

27," 

28M here. Over the past 6 months I have been facing a lot of mental turmoil. I have feelings of being nervous about my future wife, career, job, money and even health (not even sure why, i'm young and in pretty good health).

There were times when i found it hard to focus. The worse thing were body aches and neck pains which I now realize might have been due to anxiety. I had stiff necks and back pains every now and then. Mornings would be so difficult, as in, when i wake up i take too long to get ready and I can see dark circles below my eyes that look so tired. I really never felt like the sleep I had was enough. To compensate for the tiredness, I used to sleep in the noon or evening for a while and I would still wake up tired. I realized that I found it difficult to walk or sit for a longer period of time without my body giving me signals to change the current position. I never told myself to calm down or \*breatheeeee\*

I told this to myself about 2 days ago, to just calm down. And, yesterday I slept so well that I could work for 5 hours straight today without the need for rest. In the morning, I got ready in 20 minutes (and that includes shower as well) which would take me more than 45 mins before. I didn't sleep in the evening because there was no need to.

Now that I look back, nothing has changed in my life from the point of circumstances. But, what really made me anxious? And, what is that which is NOT making me equally anxious now? In the past 4 months there were times I wanted to just pour my feelings of confusion and sadness out and that even meant by crying. I neither just couldn't \*feel\* my emotions completely nor let it out by crying.

What I just typed here...i'm either too shy or too afraid to say it out any of my closed ones. Thanks for listening to me. Appreciate it.",11Jun2020,2
28,"So, I've had mental health issues my whole life, and while anxiety about sleeping has always been an issue for me it's gotten worse recently as I've begun to have more and more frequent nightmares. I don't think they're associated with any real trauma so I kinda don't know where they're coming from.... Anyway, I'm finding it increasingly hard to sleep at night. I also have an intense and I do mean intense fear of being dead, so sleeping just reminds me of that. I also have an incredibly hard time falling asleep- generally it takes 1-2 hours for me to actually fall asleep after I've turned out the lights and closed my eyes. This is usually the period where I have most of my panic attacks and really horrible intrusive thoughts, so even the process of GOING to sleep, let alone BEING asleep, is stressful as hell. Basically, nothing good comes out of being asleep in my mind. 

I'm planning on reconnecting with my therapist soon, but in the mean time, is there anyone out there with a similar issue who has any suggestions for coping with it? My shrink suggested some other medication to ease my nightmares but I'm on enough meds as it is in my opinion.",11Jun2020,1
29,I have done my damndest to be independent and to survive. I'm so tired of trying. There is no point.

Theres no point now. I'm literally killing myself just to keep a roof over my head. I'm at that point where I'm realizing it isnt worth it. I keep fighting so hard.

30,"Hey everyone,

I really have been struggling to find a place to talk about this... hope this is the right spot. Basically the past year of my life has been nothing but head pain and weird feelings of unreality. I graduated college last year, May of 2019. After graduation, a lot of my friends came back from college to hang out and I began running constantly and lost a decent amount of weight. All good stuff and I felt the best I'd felt in my life since high school probably.

Before I talk about when the problem started, I should note a couple things. I grew up in a healthy environment, have a large group of friends, and a loving family. I am truly grateful for this and this is all anyone can ask for in life. It makes me feel crappy that I feel off and unhappy considering these circumstances. I am also financially stable and have (somehow) completely paid off all remaining student loan debt (as of now).

Early July I began working full-time. I had two internships in the past, which while not exciting, didn't have any impact on my mental health or perception of life. This new job was, and is, a software engineering position that pays very well for just out of college. However, like most corporate jobs, I sit in an office chair starring at computer screens all day. I also work in a pretty high-pressure environment and since we deal with specific information, I work in a closed off room that is reasonably dark with absolutely no windows. It's pretty safe to say that I'm not wild about the work environment and I don't really like what I do at all.

Right away, I started to feel a bit off. Coming home from work the first week I began to feel super tired (naturally from sitting in an office chair for like 9-10 hours a day) and going for runs with my friends felt fake and static-y. Hard to describe. I initially thought it was just a short transition period or a shift in sleep schedule and I'd get over it after a couple weeks. Boy was I wrong.

I should also note that early July began a short period of time where I went on a vegetarian diet. I was hanging out with a lot of my vegetarian friends at the time and decided to give it a go. I stopped the diet around late October in fear that it was causing my head issues. Also, right before I started going vegetarian I got a piece of steak stuck in throat. I doubt that has anything to do with it as it's probably well out of my body by now but for some reason that always lingers in my head.

Back to work stuff though. Throughout the rest of the year, the feeling kept getting worse and worse. Everything began to feel like a dream, I couldn't think or control my thoughts at times, I felt detached from the world. I began developing this feeling that everything was over even though I wasn't thinking that at all. It's really difficult to describe, but I found things online that point to it possibly being feelings of depersonalization and derealization. I can't say these definitions fit my feelings 100%, but they are the closest things I could come to describing them.

Eventually, I began developing serious head pains. Like REAL serious head pains. I was already seeing a doctor at this point and I eventually got to the point where I was recommended to get both an MRI and an EEG to make sure nothing was physically wrong with my brain. Fortunately, the results were fine. I also got blood work done a few times and nothing was off with that either. So yeah, I was healthy but still mentally messed up.

This led to my primary doctor putting me on medication, Lorazepan to be exact. There were a couple other pills I did try but they completely screwed with my head and made my feelings worse. After trying the Lorazepan for multiple months, things just didn't improve. I began seeing a therapist and talking about my issues for a few months.

Now we're at present time. Nearly a year since I started working full-time. I'm trying my best at work but my work ethic has fallen off a cliff as my head pains and sense of unreality just get in the way so much. I'm currently seeing a different therapist (still keep in contact with the other) and a psychiatrist now, too. He has put me on Clonazepam and Desvenlafaxine. Things seemed to get a little stable but eventually crashed. I'm currently trying a higher dosage and it ain't doing much. I still go for runs, and the run I went on yesterday just felt like a dream and I felt detached and concerned the entire time.

I understand most people here aren't going to have a magical tip that will cure all of my problems. However, this has been going on for so long that I just need to get it out there to more people and see if anyone can relate. I understand a lot of it is depression and anxiety. Will it go away if I quit my job? Will another job trigger this same thing? Is it just my brain refusing to want to grow up and transition to adulthood? IS IT BECAUSE OF THAT PIECE OF STEAK (lol)? I don't know what it is but I just can't shake the feeling and it impacts me everyday. Everything just feels fake and dream-like, I feel not present, I constantly have head-pains, and a lot of times I feel static-y or dizzy. Pretty much any responses are welcome.

Anyways, thanks for ready my super long post. I hope everyone stays safe a mentally strong during these tough times :)",11Jun2020,2

33,"Hello! I am currently in Montana and I am looking for a sliding scale psychiatrist. I tried searching online, but I didn’t have much luck. The psychiatrists that were within my price range said they don’t prescribe medication, only manage. 

I’ve gotten a diagnosis in the past, but since I moved I have stopped keeping up on my prescription and I’m thinking I should start taking it again. I was on fluoxetine before and it didn’t do anything, so I’ve been wanting to go to a different psychiatrist to see if something else would work or to see if the previous diagnosis was incorrect. So, I’d really like to be able to find a sliding scale psychiatrist that will also prescribe medication if they believe it would be helpful.

Are there any resources where I can see a list of sliding scale psychiatrists? Would it be weird to just call around and ask about prices or possibility of sliding scale?",11Jun2020,1
34,"Hello all, so for a few days now I've had panic attacks everyday from Sunday til today (wednesday). It started when I came back home from finally seeing my family (who live almost 4 hours away from me) after almost 3 months because of shelter in place. When I spent the week with them everything was fine! Even before seeing them I had no issues. Ive been home alone for those 3 months because school and work were all either paused or online during shelter in place. Yesterday i went to a walk in mental health clinic and spoke to someone who gave me coping strategies and today I finally saw my first therapist for our initial meeting. I told him what was going on (panic attacks daily for 4 days now). He suggested I contact my Primary Dr. To get anti anxiety pills, but I can't get an appointment til Monday. I feel so hopeless and angry. I've tried to seek help with only the suggestion for anti anxiety pills and with coping strategies that help but my worry is that its happening EVERY SINGLE DAY! my bf thinks its because I miss my family and I should go stay with them to see if it alleviates the anxiety since it started after coming back from visiting them. Is there anyone who can put their two cents in? Thanks!",11Jun2020,1

You don't care enough to interact or just don't want to so you just sit there and stare until the scene changes. Now you're watching an interaction with someone else and you're responding to them but its like your body is on auto pilot and you're simply sitting at the locked wheel.

38,"I've been diagnosed with histrionic personality disorder while being treaded in mental hospital and since I couldn't get an appointment with a therapist in the year since I've been released, I hope to find some answers here. 
I've been told not to look up this topic on the internet and I honestly regret doing it. Most things I found were articles on how to deal with people that have it, which makes me uncomfortable to think, that interacting with me might have always been annoying and exhausting to people in my life so far.

Does anyone know details on what I could do, to ""soften"" this behavior in social interactions?
I honestly don't know, when and how to show my emotions at all anymore. I try to avoid it at this point, since it backlashed repeatedly and painfully, but that's problematic as well, as I seem to appear shallow and distant.
How can I check if my emotion is appropriate? And how can I get them delivered to people without annoying them, nor getting laughed off?

39,"Hi,
       New to this group, decided to look up and join because it's hard to find general answers online.

For as long as I can remember, I have feared my own death, it really takes its toll, but, much like bipolar, it comes in episodes. 

I have depression and Anxiety with signs of bipolar (not gone down that rabbit hole as of yet, older sister suffers too) I tend to have my ups and downs, my ups consist of me being really hyperactive, almost like a manic burst of energy that lasts maybe a week or so, most of the time I'm where I'd consider myself as 'normal' kind of that middle ground where I just kinda don't feel anything, like I'm just, kinda, going with it and other times I'd consider myself normal but my girlfriend is always checking up in me asking if I'm OK, I seem off, irritated, disconnected etc, this is how I know I'm going through a low depressive phase, I don't notice it but my girlfriend can really tell (I feel really lucky that she can see this)

As of late my girlfriend has been asking me if I'm alright because I seem a little snappy or down, I honestly don't know why or what but I have kinda felt low, anyway, as of recent I have had returning thoughts that, one day, I'm going to die, not exist, boom, gone, that's that, this is something that I always seem to go through phases of and I physically can't get the idea out of my head when it's there, it's been like that for years, my most memorable experience of this is when I had a panic attack, sat at the top of the stairs and just cried, I was between 12 and 14, my parents heard me over the TV, 2 rooms away, my mum came through and just hugged and comforted me while I sobbed, repeating over and over ""I don't want to die mum, I don't want to die."" as I have got older, 28 now, I don't get emotional about it but when I tend to have an 'episode' the idea comes into my head, progressively gets worse until my entire body shudders, kind of like shock or a mini panic, I have no idea why or how this happens but I really struggle to understand it, I kind of feel like, when I get these thoughts, they are triggering depressive tendencies and that's when I start going low.

Has anyone had, experienced or know a term for this, I'd love to research it and kind of get an understanding for this.

Sorry for such a long read, I felt the need to add some context to my initial question. 

Thank you

40,"I haven’t slept alone since mid August 2019, when I moved into my now-fiancé’s parents house. In fact, I rarely slept alone before that even. Once we got his car running, we were always together. 

We moved out of state last month. 350 miles away from our parents and all of our friends. And we’re doing great still! Our relationship is healthy, I’m happy with him. 

But I had to come back, to stay with my mother, for oral surgery. All four wisdom teeth need to be removed, and apparently there’s an unusual mass near the front of my mouth, causing a molar to be sideways. Depending on what that mass is, I might need a much more invasive operation. Maybe not, depends on what the CT scan says. 

It took over a month just to get this first appointment. I’m nervous it’ll be another month or more before the CT scan, and longer still til operating day. 

I cannot be away from home for multiple months.

We both have been crying multiple times a day, though we’re trying so hard to stay sane and busy and keep our mental states in check. We chat as much as we can without being too obsessed with our phones, but it’s not enough. 

I don’t like being touched by anyone as much as I like being touched by him. I don’t really ever hug anyone for very long. But him, god I can never get enough of him. It’s one of the few things that reminds me I’m actually alive, that brings me back from a dissociative state. And yet here we are, several hundred miles apart, absolutely touch starved.

I’ve been doing my best, but it’s getting to me. I can’t damage control from so far away so I feel like I can’t tell him the awful intrusive thoughts I keep having. Walmart sells straight razors for less than $3 and god it would be so easy to hurt myself. Nobody would ever know until I went home and he got me naked. It’d be too late by then. But I can’t lie to him, I can’t keep secrets like that from him. I trust he’s been gentle with himself so I have to be trustworthy too. 

I just wish I could cuddle up to him at night. It’s so exhausting being so stressed out all the time and I know that as soon as he kisses me again it’ll be like coming back to life. 

Sigh.",11Jun2020,2
41,"I'll try not to make this too long. If it ends up being too long, I apologize, really.

I've been this way my whole life. I've never considered if I have any type of mental illnesses or if something is wrong with me, and I still believe nothing is wrong with me. I've heard people say that saying you have depression is only for attention, which I could see and is why I don't think I have it. Never thought about genuine suicide but I have been pretty hard on myself all my life.

I got a girlfriend about 10 months ago. She's brightened up my life and has made me the happiest I've felt in a while. She's amazing and I couldn't imagine anyone else. But occasionally, she'll jokingly say stuff like ""You're stupid"" or call me different types of names. This doesn't bother me a whole lot unless she gets serious about it. She also gets in these moods where she won't talk about what's wrong with her and instead shrug her shoulders and stay quiet. This bothers me. It makes me feel like I've hurt her and I have butterflies in my stomach (not the good kind), I start overthinking everything and wonder what she's thinking, etc. Yesterday, I was helping her and her grandma cook some food. They had me grab the greasy bacon and I accidentally dropped it on the floor. My girlfriend turns around and says, ""What is wrong with you?"" in a stern sounding voice. Her grandma said, ""Really?"" I felt awful and my face instantly turned red. I got a teary-eyed but managed to hold it back until I went to the bathroom. I was thinking that they were upset with me, why did I drop it, just beating myself up while I wash my hands. When I was drying them, I called myself useless and that hurt more than anything because I feel that its true. I feel that I am genuinely useless. They tell me to go grab that bowl over there, and I end up bringing the wrong one. They tell me to cut these onions, I mess it up, they tell me something that kinda hurts and end up doing it themselves. Why am I like this? My best guess is I'm just too sensitive and take things to heart too much. It's just the repeated insults and making fun of that gets me. I can take a few things here and there, like friends will throw mean jokes at me because I'm kind of overweight for a 15 year old (5' 9 and 180-190 pounds.) I dunno, maybe I'm just bad about overthinking. I just want to make sure I don't have any illnesses, that's all.

Thank you for taking the time to read this! I'm sorry that it was long, I apologize, I really just needed to put this out there. Have a good week!",11Jun2020,3

45,"I (35M) suffer from bipolar disorder with psychotic features and chronic depression. I was diagnosed with depression at 18 and bipolar disorder at 29. For years I was on Paxil of various doses and I think I had slight bipolar episodes even at 18. As the years, have passed Paxil failed and I started other medications. Some would last a year. The doctors would have to keep upping my dosage as I seemed to develop a tolerance to it, and eventually we'd have to switch medications. As time passed the time span between starting them and developing tolerance gradually shrunk more and more and my symptoms have only gotten worse and worse. I have been on Paxil, Depakote, Wellbutrin, Abilify, Zoloft, Prozac, Zyprexa, Latuda, Geodon, Effexor, and Lamictal. I've been on max doses and sometimes we've even went above the FDA approved dosages. 

In the last six months, it's been the worst. I had to admit myself into a psychiatric hospital for 5 days because my hallucinations and paranoia and suicidal thoughts hit an all time high. I tried going back to work, but I was still struggling. (I've been with the same company for 16yrs). I took a medical leave in late February and filed for short term disability, so I could focus on finding a medication that worked and so I wouldn't lose my job. I switched doctors hoping that would help because my last doctor wasn't even taking me serious. Then Covid hit and my doctor's office closed to the public and they've been doing phone call appointments, so that slowed my progress. I've been researching about filing for permanent disability because it seems that in the last 8-10 months its like no medicine is working at all. I'm still on medical leave and I'm starting to accept the possibility I'll never find a medication that will help me be a little normal. Thus the permanent disability. 

Is that possible could I never find something that works? If so will my mental health continue to deteriorate? What does that mean for my life? Does anybody know? Do you have experience? I ask my doctor, but she just says we'll try another medication or dosage. It's so frustrating. It's so lonely.

So I knew it was coming, and was surprised it didn't happen sooner but I finally broke down. I am severely depressed, have no motivation, no creativity, and feel completely and utterly alone because of quarantine. I'm feeling guilty because I am privileged enough to not have to work right now (I work at a restaurant), but I feel like I should be working. I don't go out, except to exercise because I am petrified of the virus and I feel horrible for not going to any protests for BLM :( I just feel like I'm making no contributions, I'm just a waste of space. I'm a college student and I guess I'm just really disappointed because prior to quarantine I was the happiest I had ever been in my life.

50,"First off I am from Pennsylvania in the United States. My brother who is over 18 has been acting very different for honestly the past few years but it seems to be getting worse. 

Especially as of late he is getting very paranoid of what others may or may not be doing to him, sometimes it’s paranoid of other family members and other times it’s strangers. Different times he would try to point out things showing that something is being done to him but the things he had pointed out to me are completely fine and are not harming him or his devices in the way he thinks. He acknowledges that he is somewhat paranoid over things but still believes something or someone is out to get him almost. 

I believe that he needs mental help and medical help. He has threatened to hurt himself and has talked multiple times about having attempted to take his own life more than once. Some of the details he tells me about the with the times he says he tried to take his life are lies. Also with his paranoia he sometimes blames things on other family members or their significant others. Im both scared for his safety as well as others. 

What is the best course of action to find him help? My family is afraid that if we were to try to put him in an involuntary stay somewhere that once he was able to leave he wouldn’t come home or talk to us.

He is back home now with my family (mom, dad, and sister who just finished college - I am older and living in a different state) after going to school in a different state. Our family is very close. He has always been the most happy-go-lucky person I’ve ever known and we have always been very close. 

About a week ago, my parents were made aware of the fact that he was retaking a class this summer because he was caught plagiarizing. Since then, he has spiraled completely out of control. It started with him expressing that his mental health was not good, and has slowly turned into him not talking or eating. He will say maybe 5 words a day. My mom has to physically feed him food. He thinks that he’s done a ton of terrible things, many of which do not make sense (i.e. stealing from my parents *because* they helped pay for school and he got in trouble, or stealing from his work *because* he got an employee discount). 

He came out to us as gay yesterday, which we all already knew (and I am also gay so it wasn’t a big deal). I think that is most likely completely unrelated to whatever else is going on. He seems to be feeling *extreme* guilt. I don’t know if he did something to someone else, or if something happened to him, but it seems like a traumatic experience took place. I don’t know how his symptoms relate to what could have happened, though, which is why I’m posting here.

I am in a different state and very, very concerned. He talked to a psychologist and will be talking to a psychiatrist in a few days, but I’m worried that’s not coming soon enough at the rate he is noticeably deteriorating every day.

If anyone has any ideas on what he’s going through, thoughts on how I can help, or anything else, I would really really appreciate it.

60,"I have had so many mental health diagnosis over so many years (11 when first diagnosed with anything) and I'm 30 now. I have a 1.5 year old son and am 5.5 months pregnant.

After my son was born, I had some issues with PPD. It was discovered I had hyperthyroidism and it kind of helped knowing that was the issue. My mom and sisters all have thyroid problems, so it really did seem like that was something that I could really say was a certain health issue. It could explain why I had so many issues for so very long! I was incredibly relieved.

On Google, depression can be caused by many things, but since all of these things look different for everybody, it was never easy trying to get someone to understand mine. Also on Google, you can see exactly what a thyroid looks like, and it is similar for many people.

Due to different diagnosis and meds over the years, I've become exhausted trying to find at least 1 way to live happily. I had hope with the hyperthyroidism diagnosis because there's really very few treatment options, because 1 of those options will almost definitely alleviate any problems. It's not a needle in a haystack.

With this pregnancy (having a girl!) I had bloodwork done to check my levels of everything and all that jazz. My results came back just the other day.

I have e-coli, which is currently being treated. 

I called my OBGYN the next day and asked if any other results had come back, particularly interested in my thyroid hormone levels. 

The woman on the phone said ""there are so many results we got in from so many women just this morning, let me check""...""oh I'm sorry, yours aren't in yet""...""oh wait...here you are..."" 

""Thyroid levels are PERFECTLY NORMAL""

I kept my cool in order to just get off the phone. After I hung up, I began quite literally WEEPING. 

The hyperthyroid would have explained so much, and been fixed so easily. I was HAPPY being under the impression that my thyroid WAS ALWAYS the issue. It made sense with my family history, and lack of testing in the past.

I have been called ""crazy"", ""insane"", ""uncontrollable"", ""weird"" and so many more. My thyroid being the issue explained ALL of it and gave me peace and relief thinking it was the root of all of it.

Now...without the thyroid being on the top of my list, or on it at all, I've gone into such a deep depression. I only found out just the other day, but all the hope I had in being okay is now just erased.

Life is good now, low stress and Im not struggling in any way.  Good health typically and I try to maintain positive and healthy mental health.  I am very open and reflective typically.  Nothing in particular is making me sad or moody, but I definitely noticed a change in how I feel.   It’s all day.  When with people. When alone.  At work.  At home.  While doing things I enjoy or just relaxing.  I’m not due for my period anytime soon and I don’t typically experience PMS.  No significant lifestyle changes.  

Has this happened to anyone? Or know what might be causing it? I hate the feeling and want to work towards overcoming it since it’s been awhile and I can’t shake it.",11Jun2020,3

Due to Covid-19, like majority of the world, I am stuck inside my home. This has me stuck with my parents who constantly argue and get angry at us over absurd things. My brother (20) and I (17) have agreed that we live in a terribly toxic household - but that’s too much to go into right now - But being stuck in this house is destroying my mental health. (side note - I am not allowed out of the house for walks or anything) The second my parents yell at me I snap and can’t handle it like I used to be able to. I turn to self harming or throwing the nearest object or punching the nearest wall. I cry more than I used to and my panic attacks are worse and everything is just dwindling. I am losing strength and don’t know how much longer I can do this. My obsessive thoughts and constant panic attacks are taking over my life.

I’ve come to terms with all of this and I have decided I need help but I don’t know how to do that. I tried an app that connects you to a real therapist but it costs money and need parent consent since I am not an adult yet. I talked to my mom about it and she completely shut me down immediately. Please help me, I don’t know what to do. Any advice helps, cheers.

71,"Ok so, this is going to be a bit of a rant but, before I begin I just want to start by laying out the main point of my question. 

Also I’m a 25, almost 26 year old man who lives in Alberta. 

Mainly there are two things I need answered, how “abnormal”/unhealthy or otherwise problematic are some of the things I’m going through? And, do I need to seek professional help or can I manage on my own? 

So now that I’ve laid that out I’ll begin. I’ve been struggling with a lot of this on a “tolerable” level for years. But The past few weeks I’ve been dealing with an extreme sense of, I dunno, dread I guess. 

I question my self worth, where I’m at in life and where I’m going or not going. I constantly feel as though I’m replaceable to the people who I hold dearest to me and that I’m only kept around for what I can do not who I am.

 I can’t sleep for more than a couple of hours most of the time. When I do get more than a few hours of sleep I’ve been having dreams where I’m invisible to my friends or where the people I love are talking at me not to me, almost as if there’s someone behind me and when I reach out to them they walk right through me and away. I’ve always dealt with pretty minor insomnia (2-3 nights a week of restlessness about 2-3 weeks of the month), but lately it’s been bad... like haven’t slept properly in 5 days straight bad. I’ve gotten roughly 16 hours of sleep in 2-3 hour spurts here and there. 

I’m not sure what the term for it is, but I blank out constantly. Again I’ve always “daydreamed” a lot. But lately I get caught staring at nothing for minutes on end. I’ve had several people ask me “you doing alright?” And I can feel myself mindlessly respond that “oh ya I’m fine” while not breaking my trance at all and barely even really hearing what they asked. 

I’m always thinking, thinking thinking. A million miles a minute, making plans, laying out finances, questioning friendships/job security/future prospects...I think about things so much it seems to create tension in my closest interpersonal relationships. I’m always worried that I’ve annoyed someone to the point of not wanting me around anymore, or that I’m not to them what they are to me... even if they tell me otherwise. 

I have terrible self talk. I kindve can’t stand myself some days and feel like I deserve every bad thing that happens to me. When I look in the mirror I’m so horrendously cruel to myself. I’d say the biggest recurring comment I give myself is “you’re stupid for thinking x good thing could happen to you”. But it’s hard because it seems like that’s always the case. No matter how hard I try, I fail. And try again and fail. At everything I’ve ever tried in life. 

 I haven’t been able to manage to have an intimate relationship in almost ten years, the last time I even came close was a horrible mess where I was lied to and heartbroken that I still haven’t recovered from I don’t think. 

I experience emotions on an intense level compared to my peers it seems. It’s not sporadic or anything like that. But I can become emotionally overwhelmed or overstimulated very quickly it seems. It just feels like I feel things turned up to 11. When I’m sad I’m devastated, when I’m happy I’m completely euphoric, same goes for all emotions, anger, jealousy, etc. It never seems irrational to me or for no reason, I can always clearly lay out what it is making me feel a certain way at a given time. But this emotional intensity also leads to insecurities in my relationships where I constantly feel like my feelings and thoughts for others aren’t reciprocated. 

I also struggle with an incredibly pervasive sense of guilt. Everything is my fault all the time. I always feel like I could’ve done something different and I always struggle on an intense level with knowing or making sure I did the right thing.


So, with all that said I’d like to say that a lot of this I’ve been attempting at sorting out for years now. I feel like I was doing pretty good too but I guess there was a trigger or something and now I’m in a very dark place I thought I walked away from years ago (not suicidal, just saying). I can’t shake this feeling and I’m very confused about it all. But I do think I was able to get to some sort of point where I was sorting it out and making progress of my own before. Do I need to seek professional help or do I just need to find the proper steps to take inOrder to move past from this feeling I have? 

If someone here could maybe tell me what’s wrong with me that would be pretty dope too, I guess. Not asking for a diagnosis but maybe a personal anecdote or something for guidance.",11Jun2020,1

I always made sure I was too drunk to remember why I felt sad, but I also did know at the same time. Now here I am, years later, sitting on the back porch, a little bit buzzed. Only this time I'm not sad. I'm not making reckless decisions because I'm unhappy.

I went to the police and gave a statement about what happened, and we went through criminal proceedings. This included them capturing the guys who assaulted me, going to court as a key witness and one of them got a year and a half in jail.

This happened 6 years ago and is over now. I think it would be beneficial to discuss it with a professional.

My mother's always been a very timid person who had a very closed upbringing. In short, she's scared of a lot of things that she doesn't understand or has a dim view about. One of them is Allopathy.   
Which has made it difficult over the years to get her to take her medications.

Is therapy really helpful or am I just drinking the koolaid? 
I understand medication doesnt work for everyone and I dont think he needs medication at all, but I think he needs to learn how to properly communicate how he feels rather than holding it inside. 
His sister kind of reinforced these ideas that therapy didnt help her marriage or through sexual abuse, and that its a waste of time, we should just work it out ourselves, and I have friends who dont believe in therapizing either that are giving me a lot of doubts.

89,"I don't know where to begin and I feel really lost right now.. This is going to be a long story.


I haven't ever officially been diagnosed with anxiety or panic disorder, but I know I have both. It all started about 3-4 years ago when I had my first panic attack. I was so scared, because I didn't know what was going on. My biggest fear was that I was going to die and my heart was going to explode. I then went to therapy and quickly figured out what I was dealing with. I didn't have any panic attacks after my therapy and I felt really good. I started enjoying life again and everything was great. 


Everything was great until about 3 months ago when I had a random panic attack out of the blue. I had never felt this before. Usually when I had a panic attack, it felt like adrenaline was rushing through my body and my heart was racing, but now I got really cold and started shaking and I felt like I was going to black out. This feeling came out on of the blue when I was going to sleep. I got really scared and I called the ambulance, because I was afraid that there was something serious wrong with me. The paramedics told me that everything was fine and I was probably having a panic attack. The next morning I had an anxious feeling the whole day and I remembered how this felt back when I used to have panic attacks nearly every day. I became afraid that all of this would come back and I would have to go over thid again. I then remembered how I got over it in the first place and I just didn't react to the feelings and thoughts that I was having. I tried to focus on something else and just calm down. I tried meditation and going for walks. I was doing all of this but I noticed that I was always thinking about my anxiety. I then tried to distract myself and tried not to think about my anxiety. I tried really hard not to focus on my anxiety and not to think about it. I was trying not to think about my anxiety and trying to push the anxiety thoughts away.


Skipping some stuff, I for some reasong thought that it was a good idea to turn to Dr. google and google my anxiety. I found every possible disorder imaginable, ranging from OCD all the way up to psychosis. I then for some reason started fearing all of these conditions and I started fearing that I would go crazy. I then started doing more and more research on these disorders, and I think that I would be a good theraphist by now, because I now know every symptom of every mental disorder there is... At least it feels like it.


I now can't sleep well at night. I have trouble falling asleep and I usually wake up at night. It feels like every thought that I have is an intrusive thought. I keep having a constant loop of music playing in my head (like a normal earworm but on a constant loop). I am hyperaware of any sound and I keep thinking if I really heard it or if I imagined it. I feel really lost and I don't know what to believe in. Deep down I know that I am not psychotic, but for some reason I still have constant worry and fear about it.

93,"My parents divorced when I was 11 I believe, that is definitely not my problem, I even am kind of grossed out by the thought of them being back together, my problem lies in the new partner of my mother. Him and I have a, let's put it this way, a rather complicated relationship. He had been part of some trauma of mine, whilst never really the aggressor,  it was because of him and he never did anything against it so naturally I hold a grudge against him. And he does too, only difference is that I choose to ignore him and want to achieve that whatever it takes(I'll get to that a bit later on) he on the other hand often throws dumb remarks at me because, for example, turning around and going back into my room when seeing him. When I accidentally close my door too hard and we are both home alone he will do so too in response to me and a lot more. This has been going on since I believe I was 12 or 13, not sure, I am 16 now and the lengths I am willing to go to not have to see him are getting increasingly unhealthy. 

In the past I'd avoid going into the living room when he was there and only come out when he was in his room. Now, of course it's hard to tell where someone is without seeing him so I remembered certain audio cues that tell me about his location.
At first it was his voice, then his laughter, then his breathing, then the way he walks, then the way he closes and opens doors, then the way he rolls around on his chair when working and the way he switches off the lights. I also am starting to remember when he leaves for work and when he comes back. I am pretty much always aware of where he is, and if not I will wait behind a corner to somehow figure out if it's ""safe to come out"" And that is really where the problem is. 
When I was a bit younger, I wanted to avoid him because I disliked him, but it has developed into a crushing fear that is now starting to bring back my really bad anxiety. If I'm going to get a snack and hear him opening a door I get flooded with this overwhelming anxiousness, I want to cry, I don't feel save anymore, I feel as if I am in a tight space and I get really REALLY angry. Just now I had a situation where I thought my mother was him and I had to catch my breath for solid five minutes. 

Just today I waited two minutes in front of the entrance to the living room because I thought I heard someone and even after hearing NOTHING for MINUTES I had to really build up some confidence to enter - Even though I knew nobody was awake then. 
That motivated me to hide a little mirror in the room that is just at the right angle so I can see from the door if the living room is empty. 

I know this is crazy, yet I can't stop, I can't leave my room normally anymore, I feel as if in a cage and my mother is asking me time and time again if something is wrong but I can't really talk to her about that and I just feel so lost.

95,"yes, my mom has the emotional maturity of a teenager, and i'm so sick of it. it's like one day she got up and decided she didn't want to parent anymore-- and for that exact reason my mental health has been crumbling since the seventh grade. it also doesn't help that i tend to be a more logical person. i have a really tough time letting things that don't logically make sense slide, but all my mom speaks about is utter bullshit. for example, the other day she asked my brother to go get her a plate. he got her a plate, and suddenly she starts yelling at him for bringing a glass plate instead of a paper one. so my brother tells her that if she shouldn't be yelling because if she had clarified beforehand, he would've gotten her the right plate. after hearing this-- this woman starts yelling at him more, saying, IF YOU DIDN'T WANT ME TO YELL AT YOU, YOU SHOULD'VE ASKED WHAT PLATE I WANTED. so in that moment i spoke up because, i've already been so accustomed to this shit so, the least i can do is help my brother out (he is on the sensitive side ). but then she starts yelling at me saying that she has all right to yell at him. she is literally insufferable. she always plays victim, never blames herself, and has a 2 millimeter fuse-- not to mention how easily she gets jealous and defensive. situations like these happen too often for me to function.

but the thing i hate the most about her is how she treats my dad. thankfully, my dad is a great guy-- truly. but over the years i've seen how he changes because of her-- and it makes me incredibly sad. his temper has gotten shorter, he's gotten more violent, more stressed, more sad, more everything negative. he also gets super sensitive about food because (they work together) if my mom isn't hungry, no one eats. i hate watching it. she is the reason that he nearly left us all and killed himself one day. she caused him so much pain and so much stress, i've had to sit on the side and witness it all. i've had to hear them bickering about each other to me-- i'm just caught in the middle of it-- expected to deal with it, expected to understand because i am older than my brother. but the reality is that i'm only a highschool sophomore.

(TW) because of her i've had a lot of problems regarding my mental health, none of which are diagnosed because she doesn't want to believe that there is something wrong with me. i've told her about it too. i've told her that i hallucinate things, i've told her that i'm overly stressed, i told her that i get overly anxious and hopeless, and more importantly she's seen my scars. she won't get me help. she doesn't believe me. because of that, my grades took a massive toll in the eighth grade, and unfortunately that shit is on my transcript.

recently my grandpa, from my dad's side, moved in with us-- and he's also a great person. but my mom treats him like shit too. he's lived 72 years now, does he really deserve that type of treatment? my heart breaks every time i see him being cautious of her. his health is not that great either-- and all my dad wants is for him to be happy until he has to go. i know it makes him sad too-- but its something he speaks to me only sometimes about. and so as a granddaughter, i try to please him the best i can but-- its not like i speak my native language well-- communicating with him is hard for me... actually, my dad's sister took my grandma (she did not go willingly), sold their house, and left my grandpa all alone. i haven't seen my grandma or my dad's sister in years. my mom hasn't seen them either. we don't know where they are right now. but even without contact, my mom talks trash about my grandma. she did nothing wrong. she cared for me when my mom couldn't, she practically raised me for 7 years. and she tried to tell me now that she was a terrible person-- that i shouldn't like her. and when my dad hears these things-- he get disappointed of course. my mom refuses to understand the amount of sacrifices they made to raise me and my brother.

i know her behavior has affected me and everyone i mentioned above a lot, but it really doesn't affect my brother. she is not half as bad to him. and now that i'm older i understand that that's a good thing. but in the past i held a lot of resentment against him because he didn't have to go through some of these things. i prefer it that way now. the last thing i want is him turning out like me. my mom has changed the way i act and behave, and as i've gotten older i've started to realize these things. i shut down all of my emotions until i'm alone, i don't like being around people (at one point i was deathly afraid of them), i don't like being touched, i can't show affection, i don't like being in close proximity with other humans, i don't understand other people's emotional cues... i'm a wreck. all these things have been grabbing me by the neck for the past two years, but slowly as i understand my situation-- things are getting better. my mom however, will always remain the same.

i'm sick of this. i'm tired of putting up with her immaturity,her anger, i'm tired of putting up with the stress-- i hate it here. 

and if you took the time to read this, sorry about the chunkiness. its 3 am. i just needed to rant. have a good day 

i love you &lt;3",11Jun2020,7
96,"rejection is a term we all are familiar with. it happens on a regular basis, suppose you are offered something that you don't like so you say a no and walk away, but there are certain rejections that hurt.  [https://tickle.life/why-does-rejection-hurt/](https://tickle.life/why-does-rejection-hurt/) as human beings we all love to gain attention and have a feeling of being wanted. rejection is very subjective as not everyone would like the same thing about you. sometimes your family doesn't even like half of the things about you. in no circumstance can you be loved by everyone or feel wanted in every situation, and that's okay. you should be aware of who you are and never let anyone else make you feel otherwise.",11Jun2020,1
97,"My friend came to me before the lockdown started about her mental health. She was really struggling after a break up and I took her to the doctor's where she got antidepressants and then to a drop in counselling session. The plan was to support her through all of this but then we went into lockdown and it was no longer possible. I later found out that she had stopped taking her tablets (but she is now on new ones that her mum is giving her every day) because they weren't working and then she lost her job and things got worse. She stopped talking to people and she has been afraid to leave her house because of the virus.

She started talking to me again but only a little bit and then one day she tried to call me but I wasn't doing well in that moment so I didn't answer and I tried to call her back about an hour later but she didn't answer and she hasn't spoken to me since (she did message me a day or two later but she removed the messange so I don't know what she said) and I feel like by not being available in that moment I have unintentionally made things worse 😣

Her mum has messaged me this morning asking me if I will come and see her as things have gotten worse. She's not eating, she's been self harming and she won't talk to anyone. Her mum has said she's going to ask her about me coming to see her and she'll let me know later... I really don't know what to do. I'm also anxious about going to her house in general because you're not allowed to visit people during this time. I don't know what I'd even say to her as I'm not good at talking or dealing with emotions... I don't want her to get any worse 😭",11Jun2020,2
98,"When I was a child my mother was addicted to drugs so I lived with my grandma until I was about 10, but I remember saying I love you a billion times. Every few months my mom would stop by randomly at 11pm to shower and eat and I just remember it going like this. 
“Hey mom” 
“What” 
“I love you” 
“I love you too” 
*2 minutes later 

“Hey mom” 
“What” 
“I love you” 
“I love you too”

I have no money for a therapist and I’m tired of taking pills. Had 2 Valium in the last 48 hours and if the doctor would give me a regular supply, I’d just take them all the time.

105,"Hello!
I have a question and I need some help. The problem is I think I don't deserve anything good in life and that I should suffer. I feel guilty if good things happen to me no matter how small they are. For example I sometimes feel guilty for having food bc some people in the world starve. Its basic things like this. Any time I feel happy and relaxed I feel extreme guilt. I know it sounds crazy. I've tried to persuade myself that I deserve happiness but I just don't really believe it. Thoughts like ""some people are going through horrible things why would you deserve to be happy"" occure in my head. Idk where its coming from neither does my therapist.

My best friend is beautiful and I worry for her mental health sometimes. I have known her for a few years now and just last year did she tell me she thought I was ""cute"". It was really a suprise to me and having feelings for her myself made it really weird.
Of course I did not tell her that for a long while when she had already moved on.
I have still loved her this entire time she had one boyfriend and a breakup and now has another who is probably 19 now ( we have never met). She is younger than me  by 2 months.

110,"Sooo this is my first reddit post and bear with me if I post stuff wrongly or whatever... because I’m really at my wits end and quora people are scary lmao

I’ll just sum up everything as fast as possible (although I would like to turn this into a Ted talk)

I’m born in the Asian family, and I’m bisexual but Asian standards so I’m closeted. Which sucks since my mom( who used to be the closest until recently) is against it too but oh wells

At a rather young age I have been abused by my second sister like she would beat me in public or pull my hair hard around my cousins etcetcetc. And my mom used to say (ps I’m around 15 now)  that I should let it go because my second “sister” is depressed and all that stuffs and that I suddenly came into the world and took all the attention away yadayadaya 

Then in primary school I also got bullied by this girl who I used to look up to a lot.and in the end I was alone for group projects which started my first depressive phase at 11-12. I would come home and burst into tears in the shower because friends were important to me at that point of time because all the abuse was still going on and.... I tried telling my mom but somehow she was too busy and I ended up just talking to my teddy bears at night but eventually I stopped because i knew it was useless and just became this sad, moody , and emotionally numb zombie.

Time travel! Woo and last year I self diagnosed myself with bipolar disorder— I know this isn’t healthy, but i realised that sometimes when I feel like disconnected from my body and I throw and break things or just have this huge ass surge of energy I know that it’s not normal . Then in a span of just seconds I can be crying and screaming bloody murder at how unfair my life is while sitting on my window ledge.And my depressive episodes are spent in the shower with a penknife or other stuff... and yea. Second sis is still openly discriminating against me— buying cookies for everyone except me and all those small things. A few months back to cope with all this trauma and stress I found an online friend whom I used to call and he would talk to me (but I never opened up to anyone, not even him) and just talking to someone made me a lot better. But recently we stopped talking and he leaves me on seen which is... great for me I Guess—I just lost my last pillar of support. And to add on my only friend in secondary school backstabbed on me after I called her out on some issues (IN PRIVATE I don’t know why she’s so mad) and started talking shit about me to others. There’s that. Overall it’s just a shitton of stress bottled up in me. Did I mention that my mom mocks at mental disorders? Kinda hypocritical lol


story time over! Finally. Now here’s the real problem
There’s a breaking point for everyone and unfortunately I’m gonna snap and pull the trigger soon . Recently my second sis started her own business and all my family helped to promote and my mom even offered to bake with her (it’s a baking kinda shop) but when I started my own small shop my mom just threw me a bunch of money and I was left to figure everything out myself... and when I asked my family members to promote they would just brush it off and say “oh it doesn’t fit my story theme today I’ll do it tomorrow honey” and they never do . So at this point I’m just really confused and heartbroken at everything because I was legitimately the victim of the abuse and all other stuff.

The sight or even just hearing the voice of my second sister makes me want to puke and it triggers me a lot because of all the shit she did (she strangled me in front of my mom and no one fucking did anything) and it just brings me down into this deep deep depression zone that I struggle to come out of.

I really don’t have anyone to talk to, not even my mom or that dude who disappeared. I’m like a closeted bipolar(or whatever issues I have) and I cant come out because of the stigma in this household and I’m just feeling so lonely. Any suggestions?",11Jun2020,1

112,"I’ve been struggling with my mental health since my dad died when I was 11. As a teenager I was very reluctant to seek any sort of help and pretty much hit rock bottom. As I started college I finally agreed to get medicated but still resisted therapy. Now I’m 21 and although I can stay afloat with just the medication I also feel the need to work things out in therapy that I have been repressing over the years. 

The problem is that I have no idea how to go about that. How do I find a good therapist? How do I open up when I usually shut down when being vulnerable? I often just mask over my problems and pretend everything is fine for a while and then have a big breakdown and start all over.

I know I might have worse years coming but so far this has been the most difficult and I wish I could properly celebrate having made it this far.

115,"I've always been very academic and my teachers, parents and friends have had very high expectations of my grades. I started having panic attacks in my mock exams which resulted in me under-performing. Despite this, I got straight A\*s in my GCSE exams (UK exams you take at 16) and got the highest marks in my school.

I moved to a larger school to study for my A-level exams (university entrance exams). This school had a lot of very smart people, including many Chinese students who had already been taught most of the content. I was no longer the smartest person in the class and didn't always get A\*s. I particularly started to struggle in maths and continued to have panic attacks and do badly in mock exams as a result. I got A\*AA in my exams and felt I had underachieved by not getting an A\* in Chemistry (I know objectively that these are good grades but I was aiming very high). A lot of people I know got straight A\*s and I can't help but feel inferior to them.

I applied to the University of Cambridge and got an interview but felt completely out of place there. The other students being interviewed were much better dressed than me, seemed confident and had posh accents or were international students. In the interview they started by asking me a basic question but I completely forgot everything I knew and spent most of the interview crying. I am now at another university and feel like I disappointed my parents by not going to Cambridge. At university I am surrounded by a lot of very smart people who got top grades. I feel like they understand our lecture content immediately but I have to do lots of extra work to understand it. 

When I was younger, my whole self esteem was based around the fact that I was smart. Everyone would tell me that I was smart which made up for the fact that I am not particularly good looking, funny etc. I think I was able to trick people into thinking I was smart when I was younger by working very hard but now that I am older people can see through me. Now that I'm surrounded by people who are smarter than me I've lost my sense of self worth. I am extremely anxious and was so scared during my Christmas exams that I didn't even go to one them.

Those are the symptoms but this is the story. So I take chantix occasionally before I sleep. It tends to cause nausea so I figured night time was a good time. Well I couldn't sleep. First the nausea then the paranoia. It started slowly first just feeling strange. Then it got much more intense, to the point I got scared that I was going crazy. Imagine when you're a child and you wake from having a nightmare, you tell for your mom, the fear you have while waiting for her to wake, or there's someone or something in your house but you can't see them, and they shouldn't be there. I got a text and was to scared to open it. The whole ""out to get me feeling"". My boyfriend came back to bed and saw me like this, I told him what was going on before it got bad, then he lied on my chest which really calmed me down. 


Also this sort of happened the other day. I got really paranoid all of a sudden while I was alone in my apartment. Like I was dreaming or something from my nightmares were there. I saw a hoodie in the dark closet and freaked. I ran to the kitchen and stayed doing the ""no no no"" thing while crying. Just frozen. I opened my window and got out on the roof porch. Still crying, I remember the sky being so vivid. I kept looking in the window feeling like I wasn't safe in there. I don't remember taking my chantix that day but the one thing these two episodes have in common was before hand I was watching/researching interesting videos on mental health disorders. I honestly think I'm possibly slowly going insane and am definitely seeing a doctor asap. I'm just hoping for someone who knows what this might be. Maybe help point me in the right direction so I can somewhat explain what's happening to my boyfriend. Also I've been diagnosed with bipolar/ major depression.

123,"Hi,

I've started to get anxiety over a course I chose to be on. The system seems to have removed me from a module, which has triggered me to think that they have prevented me from applying to that module. The reason being is that in the lecturer's previous module I would ask lots of questions (not stupid questions, more so difficult). I get the feeling that the lecturer have asked for me not to be able to take that module in order to avoid any more awkward confrontations.

I am struggling with low self-esteem, and I know people can tell. Is the lecturer avoiding me or is this just my low self esteem telling me people don't want anything to do with me.

I've excelled in this years module, receiving 80% average on each of my assignments.

124,"So this happened a while ago, before the lockdown, but I can't stop thinking about it.

I (Male, 20)am part of a national youth jazz orchestra  where a lot of people applied but not many got selected. I had my first experience with it before lockdown.
After an intense week of rehearsals we had two concerts. Before the 2nd concert, I tried calling my Girlfriend a few times but didn't reach her.
During the concert I sat off stage for most of it as my section doesn't go on stage that often. 

I was feeling a bit off, a bit excited and listened to the great music that everybody's playing, and getting sad, like really, really sad. And suddenly thoughts like ""you don't belong here"", ""You're the worst musician in this room"" start popping up in my head, and it gets worse, my head is literally screaming at me, it's getting really scary and I feel like the smallest person on earth, just wanting myself to stop thinking these things which only exacerbates it.

I feel tears come and try to stop it, try to breathe calmly, and try to be as unnoticed as possible, but also kind of want to be noticed, at this point my whole torso and face are prickly and tingling, and my hands are really cold and sweaty and I notice this, and I read somewhere that these are symptoms of a panic attack. So I keep thinking this can't be happening now, and I only start crying very softly, wiping away the tears as soon as they come.
It subsided after maybe 15 minutes and I breathe slowly and rub my hands together, getting ready for my part on stage.


I don't have a history of mental illness (I think), but I've noticed that I've mostly been very bottled up and distant/neutral since I was about 13, I was bullied by a lot of people for a very long time before. 
I started crying a lot when I met my gf about 1 1/2 years ago but that has also subsided and it was never like this.

126,"WARNING, THIS CONTAINS ANIMALS DYING/GETTING HURT


Do you ever look at your pet then see them die is the worst possible way? I do this constantly... I just imagine the worst things happening, but mainly to my pets. It started when I was younger (around 14; I'm 16 now) I had two fairly large pet rats. They were very aggressive, but I took the time to still socialize them and sit by their cage. One morning I woke up to my mom screaming and when I ran to see what was going on she told me my rats tried to pull our kitten into their cage. 

The next incident was when we were feeding our snake in the bathtub but I decided to clean my rats' cage, put them in their carrier, and into the bathroom. I obviously didn't see the snake. Again, I heard screaming. I asked my brother what happened and he said our snake got into the rat cage and the rats killed her. 

I physically couldn't move. I don't know what emotions I felt, but I'm struggling to keep calm while writing this out. Ever since then, I've been terrified of leaving pets alone, especially with each other. When my brother got a rabbit, I got so upset when he wasn't careful enough with her. I'm genuinely afraid. 

I have these strange flashes of visions in my head of my pets getting seriously hurt or dying because of me. I stepped on a chair to reach the top of the fridge and imagined one of the legs breaking and crashing down on my bunny. She wasn't even near me. 

I would get rid of them all, but I have severe agoraphobia and can barely leave the house. They're the only things that provide a relief, my rabbit especially helps me stay grounded as she's something I can focus on. I love them and am so incredibly careful, but to my family it feels like in hogging them and being controlling....

I have these awful flashes all the time, and it's making my anxiety so much worse... They're so vivid... I really wanna throw up... Is there a term for this? What am I suppose to do about it?",11Jun2020,1

I’m not depressed. (Never have been).
I live a happy life I’m reasonably popular and have many close great friends. But recently I keep experiencing “the call of the void”  like when I’m out cycling to see friends I’ll think “hey why don’t I just  cycle into on coming traffic just to see what happens” or “why don’t I just stick my fingers in a blender for fun”. “Why don’t I jump out the window and see if I’m ok” I don’t want to self harm.

132,"So, I need abit of help here.

I got discharged back to my GP from the psychiatric hospital about a week ago, the doctor from the hospital upped my dose of quetiapine and venlafaxine and also recommended that I stay using zopiclone.

But now I'm back with my regular GP, he seems to be put off by the idea that I should be taking meds that are only for short term use, for a longer period than advised.

Now this has put me in a situation where my doctor won't prescribe the medication that I feel I still need but he also won't refer me back to the psychiatric hospital to get the prescription on hand, as you can only see a psychiatrist with a referral on the NHS. 

I understand where he is coming from and I also don't want to be reliant on drugs for the rest of my life but I was told that zopiclone is used as a non-addictive alternative to benzodiazepines and if my psychiatrist says that I should carry on with them then why is my GP going against it.

I'm definitely still having troub with night terrors and they subsided when using zopiclone, within a few days of stopping them, they've come back with a vengeance so God forbid I get more than 4 hours of sleep per night.",11Jun2020,1

137,"I've been experiencing this weird mind state since I was a kid, and I'm wondering if anyone can relate. It's extremely hard to explain and I can never find words that properly describe it, but I'll try.

It's where my thoughts and/or something I hear starts to echo in my mind, but in slow motion, and kind of becomes choppy-ish. It's not a negative experience at all, more soothing if anything.

For a short period of time (maybe like a minute or two), anything that I hear through my ears or in my mind just slows down and sort of repeats.
(I can't remember if this is always the case, but I sometimes also feel a bit outside of my body at times, especially when thinking back about it.)

It doesn't affect my ability to function at all. I have been able to complete a college education and am successful in a career, etc, but I just have always wondered if I'm the only one who experiences this, and would love to get some answers.

It probably started when I was around age 6 and definitely happened more regularly when I was younger. I remember thinking it was normal and would try and explain it to classmates, but they never knew what I was talking about.

(I also grew up with a lot of trauma and severe child abuse, and I've wondered if it is a form of dissociating or a coping skill I may have developed at that time. But now, I experience this just as randomly as I would Deja Vu.
In fact, it is similar to Deja Vu -- only in that it's a very temporary state of mind, and it isn't negative at all.)

If anyone knows what I'm talking about or has theories of what this could be, I'd love to hear from you!

138,"I used to, up to as recently as last year, be a very social person and actively seek out doing activities with my friends circle. Hanging out and playing multiplayer games online. 

This year ive started to refuse invitations to go out to do activities with them as I'm just not interested anymore and i don't bother inviting them to do anything, ive stopped playing multiplayer games and get stressed at the thought of being pressured to play them now so only play singleplayer games. I dont feel like I'm depressed but its fucking with my head because i used to really enjoy hanging out with people. Im only young too, in my early 20's. 

Im still happy to talk to people at work and message friends on social media but actually doing activities I cannot be bothered at all.

148,"For over a year I've been struggling with mood swings and lately they've been worse than ever. Every time I've asked for advice I've set my depressive thoughts and eating problems as the priority, but I think I finally know what the real issue is. 


My poor eating or lack of motivation are not the cause but the effect of my problems. The cause is anxiety. I've been diagnosed with both general and social anxiety disorder and lately they've been insufferable. I'm lucky to not have physical symptoms of anxiety but instead the mental symptoms are doubly bad. 


I compensate for my stress, a lot. Anything to hide the dread and existential crisis I feel constantly. Today I noticed I was getting stressed about starting uni and I reacted by binging and purging. I tend to have mood swings about every two days, as if my mind has a bit of time not worrying about anything and then all the stress starts to pile up until I do something self-destructive. When I'm in a bad place the stuff that usually makes me feel better, like art or exercise, don't work, and I resort to something damaging...  and it's as if my mind resets.


It feels almost liberating to find this out about myself. Now the only thing is: how do I stop? Healthy lifestyle choices don't seem to cut it, I can only manage for those few days before my anxious thoughts come back and so do my unhealthhy coping mechanisms.",11Jun2020,3

""Are you gona kill yourself? Yes i am""

155,"My boyfriend has OCD and tends to obsess over past mistakes. Recently he became really upset over erotic fiction he read online at 13 or so. He recalls very clearly reading fiction of around his age and he found it easily on Google, he did not have to search hard at all. He is super scared that he somehow read a story where the characters were way younger and he's scared that if he did and just didn't remember or repressed it out of guilt, that it automatically makes him bad and unworthy of love, hence he told me this. He's scared that ""who is to say a character wasn't 9 or something and I just ignored it at the time and forgot I did it?"". 

He is extremely guilty. He is adamant even if he did, he would only have pictured people his own age or older anyway, as that was what he always was and has been into. He has had false memories before where he takes something bad (like reading these stories where they were around his age) and made it way worse. He feels that logically this wouldn't have happened, he would remember and surely he would be weirded out back then by by much younger in a story but what if?? I feel like this might be a false memory again but what if it isn't? In 2 years of dating I've never noticed anything off but I'm so scared this makes him a bad person.

156,"I (19F) have a really terrible amount of guilt for something that is really stupid and done with no bad intention, but is pretty terrible. I don't think this is for relationship advice reddit since it's not really a relationship problem, it's mine.

I got in my firat relationship when I was 15, and it was kinda okay but went really toxic in the last few months, so we broke up after a 1.5 years. The guy and me were in the same class together, and breakup was fine but I was really bitter about it, and after realising how toxic it was it wasn't really hard for me to get over it.

After two months I met an incredible guy that I clicked with instantly. We began dating, and we are still together after almost two years and I couldn't be happier. But, there is one problem that I have. I couldn't stop talking about my ex in the first two months. And I honestly say, I never wanted to get back together with him, I was just really, really bitter because I was hurt, immature, naive and stupid, and my incredible boyfriend went through it with me, and I feel so bad. To make matters worse, last year around this time, I started being friends with him again, because naive as I was, I thought being friends after almost a whole year of hating each other would be nice because I hate fighting and I don't like being on bad terms with anybody. And again I want to say, I didn't want him back, and I never would, I just thought it would be nice to finally be on good terms again. He apologized and all that stuff , we were talking more etc. And the whole time, I was telling my boyfriend about it, and at first it seemed like he was fine, but then of course he told me that he is not and he thinks it is weird. And that's when I got a little defensive because I couldn't understand why would that be weird. Again, I was really stupid and naive. He was actually mad because he had to listen to all the bad things about my ex, and it is pretty understandable, and I can't forgive myself for it. I really easily forget or forgive someone who does something bad to me.

In the end, that guy just wasn't worth it. We are okay when we see each other, talk normally but not often, and it is really what it should be like after everything. And my boyfriend and I made up the day after that fight, so it's not really big of a deal, and it was a year ago, and I didn't think much about it until few days later, can't remember exactly why. I have that habit of lying down in bed and thinking about embarrassing things or bad things I've done, and since we had some exams after quarantine, I saw my ex in school and remembered everything I've said to my current boyfriend, and how much I couldn't understand why he did mind me talking and being friends with a guy that just wasn't worth it. 

And since then, I just can't stop thinking about it. I told my boyfriend how sorry I am, how terrible I feel for doing that to him, and he being kind as he is, told me it's completely okay and that it's the present that it's important. And I understand that, but I can't stop feeling guilty. It is one of the most stupid and immature things I've done in my life, and I am well aware that I had (and I still have it a little) a very naive perception of life and relationships with other people. I don't know how to make that feeling go away, I've had some really childish moments and my boyfriend helped me through all of them, he is just so nice and good that I feel even more guilty. Just to make things clear, we don't fight often, it's really rare, and I am not petty or try to pick a fight to make me unbearable, we have a lot of fun and get along really well, but I just can't help but remember what I did to a  guy like him, even though it was more than a year ago.

Also to mention, I usually have feelings of guilt pretty often, not onky about my boyfriend. On of my deepest regrets in life is ignoring and being irritated whenever my younger brother approached me. He is 8 years younger than me, and it took me about 9 years for me to stop ignoring him and be a better sister. We have a great bond now, but I still feel terrible. I've never liked kids too much, but it's still not an excuse to ignore my own brother. I've always been an introvert stuck in my room and hated to be disturbed, but again, I am aware that it was so not okay. I apologized to him over and over again, and he also said it's okay (though he uses it sometimes when we argue, but I know that he doesn't really mean it anymore).

Also, what I'm about to say now is incredibly stupid. I can't lie to my mum or anyone important to me to save my life. I don't need to lie, but I feel guilty even telling my mom that I arrived to my cousin's apartment (I always text her whenever I go somewhere so she knows I'm safe, cause she really allows me to go anywhere as long as I text her) which is on the last floor, and if I am in an elevator and I send a text that I arrived, I would feel anxious suddenly and start thinking like : What if I get stuck but I texted my mum that I arrived?
Or when I have to lie for small stupid things, white lies basically, I can't do that, not to my parents, not to my friends, I am so paranoid that I wouls betray their trust even if it is not a big deal, and it eats me alive, guilt eats me so much and I really don't know how to help myself. Also I would remember a random non intentional stupid thing I said to someone, and feel terrible even though the thing wasn't that terrible. I don't really hate myself, I am okay with who I am but I can't believe how many stupid things I said unintentionally. In any other area I am happy, I have a nice life, incredible parents, brother, boyfriend, family and friend... My biggest problem is myself, and I don't know why. I just want to stop beating myself up about some stupid things I've done but I don't know how.

Please, if anyone has the same experience or a way to help, tell me, and thank you for taking your time to read this:)

I'll just jump right in. I was severely abused throughout my life. My father had sexually abused me starting at a young age, as well as physically and mentally. My ex had sexually and the occasional physical.

I had my daughter (She is now a year old) through rape by my Ex and was too mentally ill to abort her. I'm doing better now and Have worked hard to love her and I love her to no end.

I have Dissociative PTSD with trauma based hallucinations, GAD and depression. I get nightmares, flashbacks, visual and sensory flashbacks. Yet, last night I had the worst nightmare I ever had. One of them was in the normal range. 

The normal one- We were changing my daughter and she cracked the back of her skull open and was bleeding everywhere. We had to rush her to the hospital. 

Not even the worst nightmare with gore in it. I've had a lot worse.

Yet... This nightmare... I don't want to look at myself. I hate myself for this one. I can't even fathom why I would ever dream this. It breaks my heart so much and I can't take it.

Nightmare- I was holding my one year old daughter, talking to her when I (I won't go into detail) sexually abused her. She pushed herself away from me, crying, Into the arms of my boyfriend (Who I started dating before she was born) and refused to look at me. I just played it off as it was nothing even though she was screaming, trying to get away from me.

164,"Hey everyone! I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\* and I'm a 15-year-old guy just about to finish his sophomore year of high school. My current situation, in a nutshell, is that I've been mildly depressed for quite some time. It's not to the point where I'm thinking about really dark stuff but I find myself constantly anxious and spiraling into my thoughts. \*Hard to explain, I know\*  This has had an impact on my personality and the things I do and say.  Just know that I'm about to summarize my entire life in this little post so if you don't want to read, it's completely fine with me.

For about a year since my freshman year, I've tried to keep my impulsive side in check and stay reserved and not talk too much.  This impulsive side is one that has been with me as far as I can remember and I don't know the exact reasons why it sprung up in the first place but I know what made it worse. As a  young dumb prick in elementary, I snitched on people not because I wanted to watch the world burn but I was insecure that the other children wouldn't play with me. At the time, I had just moved to a new country and I was completely new to Western Culture and the English language in general.  As a result, I didn't have many friends, and that frustration sort of bubbled my emotions to the surface.  At age 4, I was the short scrawny kid who got picked on and ostracized by the rest of the students. My anger was up to the point where I would tell on kids who didn't want to play with me and I flipped out on a kid who was pushing me around in the bathroom.  I'm not trying to put the blame onto the kids themselves but they might have been a side factor. Luckily, I made a few friends here and there who I regularly contact to this day.

I stayed in this country for about 4 years before my parents moved back to my native country and I was enrolled in another international school.  This was when I was around 8 years old and I was fluent in English and I was getting more comfortable with hanging with students from other countries. My first few years at this new school were pretty great compared to the life I had in the other country. I wasn't a notorious snitch anymore and I got along well with most of the people. My social skills were still level 0 with the other kids but that was fine because the people I knew were mostly super nice and invited me into their circle very quickly.

Being back in my home country, I got a bit complacent so I put on some weight over the years.  It got to a point where my cheeks were bulging and my stomach was sticking out. This was around middle school and around that time one of the people in my grade who I had long thought was a friend started ribbing me with fat jokes. I initially brushed them off as slight taunts but as time progressed, they got increasingly cruel so I shot back and made fun of his height.  This back and forth thing became quite a spectacle in my grade where people would laugh at him taunting my weight over and over again. I would try and mask the pain I felt during these times but inside I would get emotionally devastated. This abuse carried on for about three years but I was too scared to fully confront him and tell him to just stop this endless fiasco. I also didn't want to sound butthurt for not ""appreciating a light-hearted joke"" as some of the other people thought.  None of the people at school were really helping me with the situation because they didn't know what the issue truly meant (I don't blame them: who would?) but my parents were with me every step of the way. My mom consoled me when she could and made me feel a little better during the times the jokes got too out of line. I tried to find other ways to vent my anger. I became increasingly insensitive to others around me and made crude jokes as a stupid coping mechanism. Some of the comments I made during this time might have hurt some people but we've more or less made up with what happened today. As a result, my already low social standing took a big dip. I remember on the first day of freshman year, someone wrote a question on their Instagram story asking who the rudest person on the year group was and lo and behold, my name was up there.  I tried exercising and shedding weight to divert the abuse away from me but I always ended back on the same spot.  These early stages of depression also took its toll on my grades. I stopped studying and my test scores evidently showed this. My parents were getting concerned that I wasn't going to survive high school. Meanwhile, my ""friend"" was tormenting me up until 8th grade before he left to go to another country.

&amp;#x200B;

Flash forward to high school. Now with the guy off in another country, I decided to finally get my act together, and I did. Much better than I thought I would in the first year. Without some prick taunting me, I changed my personality for the better. I stopped with the rude comments and complimented people when they could. I spent my hours studying instead of watching youtube videos or playing video games. And my grades steadily rose.  I also signed up at the local gym and managed to slim my body down by 15 kilograms. Things seemed to be working well for me and people were starting to like me a little bit more. I was getting invited to hang out with some of the guys and another friend of mine also invited me to an after-school debate team where I had a lot of fun. The one issue was, my anxiety persisted and grew. I got so uptight with what people thought of me because I had unintentionally cultivated a reputation as a do-gooder student all in one year.  By sophomore year, years and years of complicated emotions slowly started to rise to the surface. I grew increasingly angry and lashed out at my parents for stupid reasons I can't even remember. The ""friend"" visited my school again a few months ago and my egotistical side got the better of me and I treated him like a complete asshole. The sad thing was, he seemed to be remorseful of how he had treated me but I still brushed that off and unloaded all the anger I had. This didn't give me closure: it made me feel emptier than I had before.  He seems to have gotten some of his shit together and has matured a little bit but I'm still struggling to forgive and forget which is a dick move on my part. The guys at my school must have noticed this side of me because they started to ask questions like ""are you happy?"" all the time. I simply replied with ""I'm not sad"" but in hindsight I was lying to myself, convincing myself that I was happy and had everything I needed for a well-balanced life.

&amp;#x200B;

As the sophomore year comes to a close I find myself asking the question: why do I not develop emotionally?  Why am I stuck in the same place?  How is everyone else not uptight and get along while I don't? I am coming to the realization that in about two years, I will be an adult venturing out into the real world where my emotions and my perseverance will be put to the test. With these complex issues constantly plaguing me, I feel like I need some form of closure with everything that I've experienced so I can move on with my life. Even now, I find it hard to explain my situation because I'm confused and don't fully know what is going through my mind.",11Jun2020,1
165,"My mental health has been deteriorating so much over the years, it’s got to the point where I lost the man I’m in love with and let a relationship with so much potential that could’ve been not just great but freaking amazing go to ruin because I didn’t get my shit together or actively work on it, I just hoped that everything will pass by itself and somehow things will get better. Not only I was hurting or sabotaging myself, but I let all that misery spill on other people, leaving me unable to fix or erase the damage. Isolation doesn’t work or it’s an answer either. 

I’m trying to come to terms with it. I’m responsible for my actions and the way I deal with things. It’s no ones business to do so but mine. I just deeply regret I got to hurt the people I love the most,  especially him. 

It gives some sense of comfort, in a twisted way, knowing that it only depends on me. It’s only me who’s in control of that, and in the grand scheme of things, where most of the times it’s the control I’m lacking over my thoughts and feelings,and ultimately over my life, I find myself at peace and with a little bit of hope.

167,"22 Male. 6ft. 326 pounds  


IMPORTANT INFO: New medication is Escitalopram (Lexapro) 10mg. Old medication was Sertaline (Zoloft) 100mg  


I recently went to see my doctor because my anxiety was feeling a lot worse than usual as of late, and it was always worse than my depression was. I wanted to know if there were any anti-anxiety meds I could take. He told me that the sertraline should of been helping the anxiety as well, and so instead of putting me on anti-anxiety meds, he decided to take me off the sertraline ALL TOGETHER and trial a new antidepressant...................... oh my god I FEEL MENTALLY HORRENDOUS!  


The pain I feel inside is like nothing I've experienced before, at least for a very very long time. The depression and emptiness I feel is horrible beyond words, and I've become very suicidal. Honestly all I want to do is cut and stab myself, and find a truck to jump in front of. My anxiety is still awful and it's causing me to struggle to breathe at times (not GENUINELY, just bad shortness of breath symptoms).  


Earlier today I had a breakdown caused by the pain and despair and got so infuriated at my apparent fate that I put my fist through my bedroom window, shattering it. I then proceeded to burst into tears, though not because of the physical pain my hand felt, but because of the whole damn situation I was in.  


All I can think about is past trauma I went through, and suicidal thoughts plague me constantly. I've been told by friends and family that these new medications can take up to 6 weeks to work. I can say with utmost confidence, that I'm not going to make it that long.  


Please advise, I can't deal with this much longer.... :(",11Jun2020,1

I would love to hear some tips on how I could cope with the side effects and how I could possibly avoid becoming numb. also, what would make withdrawing from this medication easier for those who have managed to ease off the meds without too many problems?

175,"I'm new to Reddit so I apologize if I'm writing weirdly. I will be spilling out my experiences of child abuse, traumatic relationships and fraudulent doctors, so please turn your eyes away if this will trigger your own memories. I am a 20 year-old woman in Japan.

My father and mother were married but lived separately for my education reasons, and I lived with just my mother for most of my life. She was very strict and emotionally unstable. She expected perfection in return for everything she did for my education and out-of-school activities, and yelled at me for every single mistake I made: a bad grade, a one-second angry look, forgetting to pin my hair the correct way. This yelling would go on for hours, literally hours. The longest was 8h, from 4PM to 12AM straight with a dinner break.

She got angry whenever I spoke up during her scolding, and also angry if I said nothing.  She also sometimes slapped me, shook me and dragged me around the floor by my hair.  Everything was wrong about me: being a woman, having no siblings, crying a lot when I was a baby, being short, and so many problems about my personality. Sometimes she was nice, but there were too many landmines that would abruptly turn her off; no joke, she would enjoy playing with a stuffed animal, then wish to kill me five minutes later.

My worst memory is an errand I did for her; she asked me to buy a folder, I bought it at a bookstore, she got hysterical because that was an expensive choice, pulled out a kitchen knife and said we were going to jump off the rooftop together. Second-place memory: shouting my suicidal thoughts and getting ""I raised you, so saying that is rude to me"" in return.

What kept me alive in the worst times was my ex-bf, 3 grades lower than me but very kind and mature. He guessed something was wrong at my home and asked to date me while wanting to help. I had trouble being affectionate, but he always asked if I was alright, said that he would be there for me, and never turned me down on the rare occasions I was able to open up. He even once called the police for me in a dangerous moment. His only shortcoming was a monthly bout of depression, and I would be there for him in return for how he helped me. I loved him, I trusted him.

Then, when I was about to enter Grade 12, my mother was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer. She said that it was because stress had weakened her immune system, and the stress was obviously me.

""You're the one who killed me, how worse can you get?""

""I'm going to stop treatment because it's not worth living, since you're so cold.""

On her last day, I was suddenly woken up by my father's shout (it was a family of 3 after I entered uni) to get the phone for an emergency hospital call. I was drowsy, and I couldn't make the right choice of being beside my mother in her dangerous state, and I feel like that's why she let go. At least, her final thoughts for eternity was either despair or cursing me, for sure.

She had done much to me, but I was still shook by her death. When the funeral was over, I was feeling down, so I texted my bf that I wanted to see him. We were long-distance at this point, and of course he said he couldn't come until spring break, and I got sulky. I swear to God that was the only time I said something that selfish during the entire relationship, and I apologized the next day. But then he said ""Enough, let's break up."" It seems like he was in his monthly depression at the time, and he was also busy studying for his IB diploma. But still.

He wanted to break up on the day after I went through my mother's funeral.

I was able to convince him to think twice that day. Of course he'd done so much for me, and of course I would have forgiven him with a sincere apology. But when I later told him that this incident had hurt me, he was suddenly a different person.

""I'm sorry, but can I say something that'll hurt you?""

""I know I did something wrong, but was it really that bad?""

""I vomited/collapsed during school because of you.""

""I have a best friend now, so I don't need you anymore.""

I analyzed my own faults and did lots of apologizing, he said ""thank you but I don't want to see or talk to you anymore"", dumped me, blocked me, and now I've entirely lost touch.

Around the same time, I had developed a sudden fear of mortality and I went to a psychiatry for help. I did careful research, found a place with good reviews, and went there. The doctor didn't give any diagnosis, gave me about 20 pills that he invented, and I had to go every week. He didn't even remember my condition, thinking I had suicidal problems, and when I corrected him he laughed that they were the same thing. It turns out that the ""good reviews"" were because he forced his patients to write them. I was too gullible to notice something was wrong, and I learned that lesson after ending up in an ambulance because of the pills.

My mother, my ex, and that psychiatrist have shattered my trust in people. The good and bad memories of the first two tear me apart, and still haunt my nightmares today, a year after it all happened. They have taught me that love is frail, conditional, and temporary. One single mistake can ruin it all. I refuse to trust people anymore because protecting myself is the most important, I've bled enough. I know I'm unhealthy and that I need help, but because of that darn psychiatrist, I can't trust mental experts the most.

I'm sorry that my story was this long, and thank you for reading this much.",11Jun2020,3

My fiancè and I have been together for 4 &amp; 1/2 years. I'm 22 and I've had depression/anxiety for as long as my memory goes, and I can even remember having it in elementary school when I would cry by myself because I felt I wasn't worthy of new clothes for school. Anyways, besides the point.

He has been showing zero affection towards me anymore. I noticed this happening late last year, but ever since 2020 started, its been so much worse, even to the point where we will go days without a single kiss. We don't sleep in the same bed because I have sleep apnea and he can't sleep well when that happens. But he doesn't even come over to my room to hang out and watch TV, we have sex only about every 1.5 months, and he only hugs me about once a week.

A little bit of background may be helpful? He shows his love through doing things for me, and I show and receive love through affection and physical touch. He has diagnosed (untreated) OCD, which is why it is so hard for him to show love in the way that I need. It affects his life so much to the point where its difficult to watch sometimes, but he refuses to see a therapist or even his PCP for help with it.

I had a friend and we dated a bit a few months ago but broke it off, very... roughly? It was not an easy break up. But recently we chatted a small bit and it seemed she (I’m a guy) missed our relationship despite already being in one and saying over and over again that I’m a “trap” though messages me bi-daily. The other day I asked her if it hurt her for us to talk as friends as I’ve gotten over us, and as I said, she talked a lot about our old relationship like she missed it. At which point she said she didn’t know and asked if I’ve gotten over her. I said “Yeah, I reminisce every now and then but nothing serious or worth acting on” at which point she said “That’s all I needed to hear” after that she became really cold saying that she was “emotionally detaching herself.” I offered that rather than folding away those emotions that she should face them, she brushed me off saying “I’ll be fine.” And I’m thinking this is exactly the problem. During the breakup she closed off and hid her emotions only for them to re-emerge when we became friends and hurt her more. I try to get her to see that but she still brushes me off and self pity’s herself saying things like “I've already accepted the fact that no one will truly like me and want to date me, so I’m set for life” despite being in a relationship during the conversation. After that I tell her to stop self pitying and that there’s 8 billion people, it’s nearly impossible for her not to find the right one. She jokes about commuting suicide, which isn’t new behavior as she’s done it before, and then makes remarks about her parents “moving the gun.” 
This was last night, she didn’t commit suicide, she viewed my insta story this morning but She’s so unstable and I want to steady her but I don’t know how to do that without hurting her or that she even wants help. 

TLDR: My unstable ex gf that’s now my friend misses our old relationship despite being in one already. I confront her about it and she closes off and threatens suicide (she’s threatened it before and is fine as of this morning). I want to help her but don’t want to hurt her nor do I  know how to help. 



Issue #2: 

Also if you’re still reading, I truly thank you, I know this is a lot. 

My friends accuse me of being narcissistic and egotistical. Nearly daily. I often make jokes about myself saying I’m the “sexiest man alive” or haven’t “largest ass ‘round town” fully knowing I’m actually a low 3 with a tiny ass. And it usually gets a number of laughs. I always carry myself strongly and don’t take insults, like actual insults and not jokes, well, usually placing a well aimed insult back on the other person. As well as when I play games I’ll fight hard until I die, not the type to give up. As well I’ve slapped people for touching my hair, which is the love and pride of my body. I don’t think I’m either. I understand where they may be coming from but the difference is I don’t believe I’m above other people, I’m fully aware I’m below a lot of people as well as I empathize with those below me and as you’ve seen above that I care for people. What do you guys think? Am I narcissistic and egotistical? Willing to answer questions, just take it easy on me though because I’m also known to be oblivious at times. 

TLDR: My friends think I’m narcissistic and egotistical due to my jokes about being an attractive person despite me knowing full well I’m not, and unwilling-ness to lose. Though I don’t see myself that way as I’m empathetic and understand I’m below a lot of people, what do you think?

How will I do that? I like to write stories and stuff, so I will write and listen to MY favorite music instead of my friend's favorite music! I will communicate only with people who I believe will not make me feel crappy, and avoid social media and the news. I will spend time with my father as often as possible and work toward making myself more mentally stable! I won't let others push me around and if they do, then I'll tell them to back off and that I'm not a puppet anymore! YOU WILL NOT WALK ON MY BACK, I WILL WALK ON MY OWN! Thus it begins.

I plan to avoid the news all together because it contains nothing but stressful and upsetting things, and I wanna be happy for the first time in about a year. If anyone wants to join me on the endeavor of improving your day, let me know and I will gladly talk with you and count you as a good friend :)",11Jun2020,15
202,I don’t really know what to do but I’m in a really bad place and I don’t know what to do about it. I’ve just broken up with my girlfriend of 2 years which is something I’m obviously very upset about but I know I will eventually get over it to a certain extent. I joined the military last year and I love my job but I live on my own and I hardly have any friends outside of work and I really need that to change. I don’t know how to go about this I’m so isolated and the friends I do have I don’t see them I only talk to them over text etc. I’m really lonely and I’m only 17 and I don’t want to be like this for the rest of my life it’s just miserable.,11Jun2020,1
203,"I'm having a sort of panic attacks, I have the feeling that something will go wrong. Like my mom is an alcoholic but she's clean for a really long time now. But for some reason I have this feeling she'll relaps again. I also have this fear that my brother will become agressife to me and my little sister.

I also have a dad who doesn't seem to Care about me. He's only happie if i'm the perfect kid. And if i try to speak up against him (which i almost never do because i'm scared of him) he'll just yell at me.

I'm trying to give myself some space but it doesn't help.

204,"Some intro about my mother; she is narcissistic, emotionally manipulate, a true definition of a Bitch, she lies so much yet she loves to call me the lying one and always says how she ""has zero trust for me"", she gaslights me a lot, she deflects responsibility and deflects blame on me for everything, she plays the victim card the second she gets the chance to, and I am starting to get extremely tired of all of her bullshit.

My mother has been acting this way for as long as I really remember, but it got even worse when my dad passed away, but the best part is, I didn't even know that her behavior was ""bad"" or ""abusive"" until I met my boyfriend around 5 months ago, and he just opened my eyes about everything because he himself experienced something similar with his mother although even her case isn't as bad as mine. 

So far I'm just planning on trying or starting a more independent lifestyle while still living with her until I can pack my bags and move to live with my boyfriend, though I'm having a hard time with it because of my severe social anxiety, on top of a lot of other things that are currently undiagnosed and untreated because of my mothers lack of understanding the importance of mental health. I've have self harmed in the past and the reason I started to is because for at least 2 years in a row I would tell my mother about my struggles and issues and of course she told me to brush it off because I'm young and I can't be depressed or ""crazy"" (her words), and it really had to get to the point of her finding out about my scars for her to say that she will 'eventually' take me to a therapist [which to that, I asked her if she could take me to a psychiatrist but she said those doctors are for ""crazy people"" and not for me] and before someone says ""oh, she actually said that she will get you help"", no she won't, what she does now is she just uses this as a way to pressure me into doing things the way she wants them done and if I don't listen to her then ""youre not getting any help"". 

It got even worse when I kinda told her about my boyfriend [ I lied and said it was a female friend that I met online for my and my boyfriend's sake, I had to tell her because she heard me talk with someone all the time and thought I was insane] because now she blames him for literally anything that I do, which to be fair, I know I've changed after I met him but in a good way, because I've learnt how my mother actually is, I've matured a lot, and of course my mother wouldn't like it because now I know what kind of piece of shit of a person she is and I actively go against her and do as I want, but to her its the classic ""that person changed you for the worst"" which I've even heard her say about my friends before but she says she ""never said that"". I can see how she is becoming very jealous of my boyfriend in the sense that I pay waaay less attention to her and I make it very obvious, and she loves attention, and its getting to the point of where she is threatening to cut off my WiFi in my room so that I wouldn't ""have fun"". 

She's also threatening to sell my cat, going off on her excuse, how I'm too insane to handle a cat, she has threatened to kick me out or make me move to live with my grandad who is also abusive, told me to never eat anything because she is the one paying for the food etc etc.

My biggest problem is the fact that I still love her [I don't mean respect, I have no respect for her because she doesn't for me] and I feel guilty quite often even though I know I shouldn't because I don't do anything wrong. She doesn't realize she is manipulative or abusive, she is so oblivious to it because no one taught her any better and no one probably ever will. She has this dumb complex in her mind that makes her think that she deserves more respect because she is older and is my mother, which also includes how she can curse me out and I ""shouldn't be mad because she's my mother and she is allowed to"" but when I do the same she cries and yells and etc. 

Either way, the jist of it is I have no clue how to deal with her. Boyfriend constantly tells me to not pay attention to her cries, but its hard because I feel trapped both mentally and physically by her, she can do some petty shit to me, which includes not buying food or giving me money to get food or constantly threatening me and all of that stuff. If anyone has any advice on how to deal with this it'll be very much appreciated.",11Jun2020,1
205,"Just when I’m starting to think it’s all ok and my medication is working, (it does help a lot) to stop me having suicidal thoughts. I get called a “faggot” by my best friends, friend.

I’ve had an argument with this person before, and I blew up, shaking and sweating, shouting at him. And then I blocked him so I wouldn’t have to hear him ever again.

Last night (this all happened over Xbox) I was in a party with my best friend and his three friends, one of them says to the blocked one, “he’s not here, he won’t hear it if you say anything.” Well little did he know I was there and heard them laugh when he called me a faggot...

Today I told my friend that, him telling him he can say what he wants just because I’m not there and laughing at his homophobic comments towards me and letting it happen is homophobic/encouragement towards it...

Anyway sorry for the rant, I just feel like no matter what I do I’ll never be able to get away from hate for who I am... I don’t know if there’s any point in life. I just want to be able to be myself and love who I want to love...",11Jun2020,1

207,"My dad got diagnosed with cancer recently. He has to go through chemo now. and my mom keeps asking me how I feel because understandably you would assume it would affect you deeply when your dad’s super ill (provided you have a ‘good’ relationship with him). But the thing is… I don’t really feel anything. I worry more about not being able to show empathy/love towards him than him being ill and I’m aware this is messed up. I’ve always been an emotionally detached person, especially when it comes to my family. I didn’t grow up in a traditional loving household. Don’t get me wrong, my family are really nice people but we’ve always had more of a peer relationship. Living together always felt more like living with roommates. We’ve never really been openly affectionate with each other unless something terrible happened (and in those cases I never initiated affection), we never say “I love you” to each other. All this never bothered me. Affection has probably always made me rather uncomfortable (affection among friends is a different story. I tend to enjoy that most of the time). But that’s not all. I get along with my dad, he’s a good person. But I don’t feel like I have a connection with him (my relationship to my mom is way better). At all. I’ve always hated being alone with him. It’s always awkward. I feel estranged from him. Sometimes I’m not even sure if I actually “like” him. All that doesn’t really make sense, since he’s not a bad person. I think those feelings have only worsened over the years (might have something to do with my depression or whatever mental illness I have that I still don’t know about, cause something must be seriously wrong with me being this emotionally dense among other things) and I feel unable to change. My mom keeps telling me “Please be nice to him and hug him” but I just CAN’T. He’ll come home over the weekend and I’m already dreading the (alone) time with him. Believe me, I’m aware of how assholish my behavior is, and I really wish I would feel differently. But it’s like there’s a barrier in front of me that I can’t break down. 

I need to know if there’s other people out there that feel similar, having trouble showing empathy at all, and perhaps give me an idea what the cause of all this might be?",11Jun2020,3

But when I lived with my mom. I felt and I didn't have any depression and felt free. And it's the same way with my Grandma. at both of their houses. My mom shot herself three years ago.

215,"Hello dear people!

I‘m trying to help out a friend of mine, that has just opened up to me about his mental health. It started by him saying that there was a lot wrong with him, when I asked him to get a bit more specific he said something like:
„I know I should only have positive thoughts and be happy, but a lot of times I know what decision would be right to make, and I feel like I need to make the wrong decisions on purpose“
He also said he usually switches from this depressed state to a really self loving state with no in between.

216,"I have another message. If that's what you want to call it. but it goes along the same lines as this one. My dad is very manipulative and always is it being rude to me and calling me names brings me down. He's very mentally abusive. But I can't escape. I live with him. And cant Bring up the courage to run away or ask if I can move out. I love him too much and I wony to be able to do that. And ever since I was little I've hated living with him. I feel like there's a brick wall anytime I'm at his house. The only way to break that brick walls to go with my aunt, grandma, or my  mom. But my mom shot herself three years ago. When I'm with my dad I feel like I'm in this cycle. Stay home all day and not getting out of the house. I hate just sitting here all day I feel like I need to go out and do something. And going with my grandma or my aunt is so way out of it. I also have anxiety when it comes to asking you if I can go hang out with them. and I just want to figure out how I could either  A) ask him if I can live with my grandma. Or B) makes my anxiety  go away or C get rid of my depression about living with my dad. And one of the ways I think I can get rid of my  depression is moving out of the apartment that we live in right now. It is right down the street from my grandma's house and it will have three bedrooms instead of two. But it is way out of my price range. I think financial stability we have is the cause of my depression. My dad makes $1,500 a month and it is not nearly enough money to afford the place I want us to move into or even moving anywhere that is more than $900. I have a job and want to help him out by paying the bills.But I just can't do it. I need to figure out how to get out of this cycle. Or how I can live with my grandma.",11Jun2020,2

220,"It’s hard to figure out where to start, but I’m just gonna start. I made a reddit to hopefully find people who can relate. 

Ever since I can remember, I’ve had an uncontrollable hate towards my family. I guess when I was in the midst of being traumatized as a kid, I was more depressed than anything. But when I reached 12 I realized that started to turn into anger. I started screaming back, breaking things, writing “I hate my dad” all over my walls. And no one did anything. It just got more toxic, more frustrating. Just thinking about it makes my chest heavy. 

And I had no way out of this situation. My aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, all out of the picture. All we had was each other, and we somehow managed to ruin that completely. 

I’m not *trying* to write a book, so i won’t go down the list of reasons I have to hate my family. But I do. I hate them. I hate everything they put me through. I hate waking up knowing they’re in the same house as me. I hate listening to them talk to me. I hate it. I hate everything about it. I hate it when they look at me. I hate them. one night my dad collapsed and seized and I laughed. I have thoughts of killing them. “If my dad raises his voice to my mom one more time I’m gonna stick my thumbs in his eye sockets and beat his head in until it cracks”. Sometimes I just wonder if I’m the problem. Maybe I should just get rid of myself. Maybe it’s me. Maybe everyone will be better off without me. 

Then I realize I hate myself as much as my family. I can’t even look at myself in the mirror. 

Anyways. My oldest brother has become a mediator for the rest of us. Apparently my family tells him how much they “miss me”, and how much they wish I wasn’t so cold towards them. And how much they love me. 

This sent me in a shock. They love me? How? There’s no way they do. I mean I don’t feel it at all. Am I that broken? Am I that convinced they don’t care? Hearing them say they care about me doesn’t make sense. I can’t believe it. Because that means I am the problem. No one has a problem with me, but I’m over here with a really strong foundation of hate. How can I break out of this. I hate them so much and they love me. I can’t fucking stand even having their last name and yet they love me. I don’t know. I don’t get it.

Now they’re expecting me to patch things up. He said “you know this is all the family we have. You really don’t want to fix things?” I don’t. But that’s not the right answer. 

I don’t know what to do. Am I wrong for hating them? It’s all that’s ever been programmed into my head. I’m not really sure if I’ll ever be able to break the cycle. I don’t know what to do. 

To be honest this is all scattered. This is what my thoughts look like currently. If I feel like it’s worth it I’ll post something that makes more sense. But for now, here’s my though for today.",11Jun2020,2

Idk anymore. It’s been about 6 months since we broke up. Still not over her, atleast that’s what the counselor says. I think she’s right too. Been thinking about her pretty much every single day, can’t even take her off my mind. Idk what it is that I’m feeling. It’s clearly not good that’s for sure. 

My mind keeps creating these scenarios. Like what if she goes with someone else. What if there is someone else making her laugh. What if she starts laughing at me with her friends or someone else she found. And all this is killing me on the inside. I can’t even fall asleep it’s so bad. It’s so hard to actually get into the rhythm of sleeping and when I do sleep I wake up in the middle of the night of some fucked up nightmare. I’m afraid to SLEEP. 

Maybe I need closure? Maybe I’m just afraid of getting with someone else or getting hurt again? Maybe this is really what life has to offer... idk how to stop thinking about her. How do I even move on? Literally everything reminds me of her, even music. I can’t even listen to music without dying on the inside. 

Sometimes I just think to myself I should just walk away from life. Maybe suicide? Or maybe I should run away, start a new life somewhere. I can’t even cry. For some reason I can’t cry. I envy those who do ngl

She was such a beautiful woman. Srsly she was and she used to say such random things that just made me smile. Well I mean I have her everything I had. I was willing to fix the issues but well she gave up on me. And you know I had hope that maybe in the future it could happen again? But even that’s gone now. I’ve lost all hope and well I want to punish myself.

231,"I'm considering seeing a doctor, however, I find it so hard to explain and describe my symptoms. More so, I'm finding it damn near impossible to identify with any specific mental health disorders. I've made a list of a few of my symptoms. 

\- **Cognitive brain fog** \- inhibited visual imagery when thinking. It feels a lot harder to think and recall things. Feeling of being brain dead when going to sleep, unable to control thoughts, unable to analyze them. Recalling thoughts that stumble into my mind after they happened takes some effort.

\- **Ringing inside the head.**

\- **Persistent low mood**, even simple things feeling like they require considerable effort when they really don't. The ringing and constantly feeling spaced contributes towards this.

Sometimes in the morning, the chamber of getting sensitive and vibrate to create a weird tension and sound in the ear.

\- **Constantly feeling 'spaced' and 'out of it'** \- I get these moments where I can just position my eyes and stare for a good few seconds. Doing it oddly feels good.

\- There not floaters, I don't think, but during the night I see a very light static, almost unnoticeable static in my vision. Night-vision seems really bad. 

\- If I make a sudden movement, and this generally happens at night time again, like getting out of bed and going to the toilet, then returning, I notice my pulse getting stronger in beat. The speed seems to stay the same, but the active strength of the beat increases. Lasts for a minute, I'm not obese or anything like that. ",11Jun2020,3

I'm also on my mobile so please excuse errors. 

I overdosed on Monday. It was planned, I wrote letters, I did everything I could to make sure it would work. It didn't, my other half came home from work, called an ambulance, and between taking the tablets and waking up in a ward the next morning, there's about 14 hours where I don't remember anything.

I got put on a drip to hydrate me, I got put on a different one to help my liver cope with what happened to it, I have been having a horrendous reaction to it. I am itchy, I am in pain, I am being sick, I am uncomfortable. The only thing I honestly regret, is that it didn't work and I'm still here.

I had a psychiatrist come round and talk to me on Tuesday afternoon, we went through what happened and what led to it being that particular day, and she explained that they wanted me to go into the mental health ward and they wanted me to agree to it. If I didn't, they'd section me under the mental health act. I agreed to it because I'd rather be seen as trying than resisting. I moved wards about 36 hours ago, I saw another doctor today who wants to increase my antidepressants and get me started on anxiety management with a view to seeing a therapist later on. Tomorrow I get to meet with the senior consultant, I'll also be seeing occupational therapy at some point to start the anxiety management.

I am going out of my mind. I am still in so much pain and I can't sit or lie for long periods, some of the people in here legit scare me, and I feel very pressured into joining in classes and activities.

Appropriately once a month, I get slammed by sudden paranoia and rage. I yell, I make accusations, I furiously hate everyone around me, and I hate myself for the way I act.

More often than not, these episodes coincide with my menstrual cycle, which usually begins a few days afterward. The outburst lasts for no more than a few hours, and I feel profound guilt during and after the event. My paranoia, resentment and distrust, on the other hand, last for as much as a week.

I was cleaning the dishes and stopped to text someone. I looked over to the range (it's a ceramic flattop) and noticed a spider dangling down from the hood vent. It reached the trim of the counter which meets the wall. I grabbed a paper towel to squish it. It was on the trim, I tamped down on it and when I opened the towel there was nothing. I never looked away from the spider. It wasn't a tiny thing either. With legs it was about the size of the nail on my middle finger. I've spent the last hour and a half scouring the kitchen but can not find any trace of it. There is no place for it to hide in the immediate vicinity. Either this spider moves faster than light or I'm losing it. I really want to tell myself I simply misplaced it but that's just not what happened. I haven't eaten anything strange, have not had any alcohol, and am not on any drugs prescribed or otherwise. I'm not freaking out, so to speak, but I do feel a little unnerved by this. I have never had a hallucination before. I hope I'm wrong but at the same time I definitely don't need a FTL spider in my house lol.",11Jun2020,1

240,"Hi! First of all, I’m on mobile, and english isn’t my first language, sorry if this hurts your eyes! 

So, my boyfriend is suffering from phagophobia. It’s been worsening lately, up to the point he barely eats anything. He does eat a little bit in the morning, but struggles for the rest of the day. Most of the time, he just doesn’t eat. 

I’m trying to be as supportive as I can be, trying to find triggers and what can actually help, and I’ve been doing a lot of research on this. We’re adapting our meal schedules, so he can eat almost a full meal in the morning, so he doesn’t pressure himself into eating the rest of the day, and I tried to make soups and other things that are easy to eat. I don’t want him to stress even more over it.

But I really want to help, and I feel like there’s more that I can do. I have no idea what I can do to help him deal with it. He’s otherwise feeling fine, but eating is a struggle. 
How can I help him with this phobia? Did anyone have to deal with this personally, or through a relative? Any tips and tricks that might help?",11Jun2020,1

242,"Hi all, 

This is my first post to this subreddit, and I wished I came here earlier. Today, I'm not going to shy away from seeking help. I lost my best friend from my life. No she's not dead, but no longer part of my life and it feels like I'm completely empty from within. Figured I'll pour my heart out here.

Background about myself : 26M, Educated - masters in EE, working in tech, earn pretty decently. Have a bunch of hobbies - playing instruments, cooking, woodworking etc.

I met my best friend about 5 years back. We instantly clicked and became thick as thieves. We spent several hours talking to each other everyday, sharing every minute detail of our lives with each other, up until september of last year. We molded each others thinking, saw our own success in the success of the other person and really wanted the best for each other.  We were there for each other at every single turn in life. Never had arguments or fought. Felt comfortable enough to bear our naked souls to each other. All in all, it was the most beautiful equation I had shared with anyone, till date. 

Every thing was picture perfect until last march when she asked me out. This was the first time I ever got asked out by a girl. To be honest, I've never been in a relationship until then and this kinda freaked me out. I do admit, as a teenager, I did dream of getting a GF, but in the end, it felt like I was a dog chasing a car - I wouldn't know what I would do if I caught one. As much as I wanted to say yes, I just couldn't. Being a BF felt like a completely alien thing to me. I know things were gonna be the exact same between us, but I just couldn't get that word out of my mouth. At the same time, I didn't want to lose her, no matter what. 

In midst of all of this, I started withdrawing myself from her. She used to complain that I'm pushing her away. And she was right. I've always suffered from low self-esteem and self confidence issues, despite being  ""successful"" in life - in terms of education, job etc. I was going through a lot of pressure at my work place too and was spending 12+ hours a day at work, sometimes including weekends. In retrospect it was partially due to my inability to cope with up with all the stress. I found some solace in the solitude of my cubicle. She was excelling at her work place and sometimes, it made me think she deserves someone better than me. My life long low self esteem issues crept in, giving way to such fucked up thoughts. Though she vehemently argued against it. I started getting panic attacks. Whenever we met, I never wanted to talk about these things because those moments with her were like my escape into paradise. I didn't want to ruin them by addressing the elephant in the room. And these issues were just the tip of the iceberg.

 All in all, I couldn't give her any answer while continuing to be selfish to make her stick with me. In the end she snapped. She decided to move on with her life and I don't blame her one bit for the decision she made. I figured she needed some space for herself and decided to keep my distance for sometime, but never did I imagine that this silence would continue on till this date.

I recently got to know that she found someone else and now she's engaged. As much as I am happy for her and wish her the very best in life, I'm just not able to come to terms to the fact that she's won't be there in my life anymore. I saw a million dreams with both of us together. And all those dreams got shattered. In retrospect, all the fault lies with me. I could not give her the confidence and hope to stick with me. I didn't know how to deal with stress and depression and I pushed her away. But today, I feel completely empty. I used to share everything with her, and now I so badly want to just talk to her tell her everything I've done. I want to sit with her and laugh again. Hold her face in my hands and tell her that she's the most wonderful person I've met and everything will be okay in life. I haven't slept properly in months - I wake up numerous times every night with some dream about her. The rest of the day is shit, and then the story repeats again. At this point, I'm really tired and I don't know what's worth living for. I did contemplate ending all this pain once and for all, but the thought that my mom and dad would just completely break down if I ever did anything like that stopped me. I'd most definitely lose them  if they even know that I thought about ending my life. But the thought that she's not gonna be there anymore is sometimes unimaginable. Feels like my stomach's churning inside. I feel like I lost a part of me.",11Jun2020,3

If post is too long, just read bold.

**Hey, I'm a 15-year-old black female.** If it weren't for two seconds of allowing my head to clear this post would be a ramble about how much I hate myself and how I want to drink bleach. Basically, the past few days have been rough. 

I've been struggling with my mental health and self-esteem for a while now, but I don't think it's ever gotten this bad. I cried so hard that I just wanted to punch a hole in the wall and other stuff. 

For a while I've been encouraging myself to engage in anorexic behaviors. I'm not clinically anorexic or depressed, but I've been starving myself from time to time in order to be skinny, and reading stuff like meanspo to encourage harm to myself.

My brother has a lighter complexion than I do. And he's a bit racist (""or ""colorist"") he constantly makes comments on how my skin is darker and how ugly I am. It hurts a lot. Especially coming from my black brother. The fact that he feels like more of a person and more acceptable because he is slightly lighter just hurts. And to be frank, he's not wrong. **No one likes dark skins. People lie and pity and beat around the bush, but the truth is: dark skin is ugly. And there are people who would rather die than be dark.**

All around me I see media saying the black women are ugly. No one would ever want to date a black girl, not even their own race. ""Black girls are ugly and ratchet, stupid..."" etc. I get it, having dark skin just isn't seen as attractive. If you don't like dark skin no one should force you to date a dark-skinned person. But damn, these stereotypes just, hurt. Like, a lot.

**When my family and I got home from the beach I went straight to my room and looked in the mirror. I wanted to kill myself on the spot. I had gotten darker. It was disgusting. Every time I see myself in the mirror it just hurts. I cried so hard. My eyes hurt. I wanted to scream and yell, I almost did. I couldn't breathe. I'm no longer lovable (not as if I even was in the first place).**

**Black people aren't just losing their lives to the unfair racial profiling of police brutality. Because of my dark skin I feel like a failure, and subhuman. I am unlovable and hideous. I don't deserve to be alive. Everyone has told me so and I only agree with them. What's the point of living when you can't even love yourself. I just want to die. I don't care how painful it might feel to die, I probably deserve the pain anyways.**

Can Someone just give me a reason to live? Please? Cut the ""love yourself"" BS. It's so difficult to love yourself when no one loves you. I just want to be liked. I just want to be accepted.",11Jun2020,26
249,"My mom is back in the hospital again after only a week of being out for hurting herself. I have dealt with mental health issues, hurting myself and have been in a position where I was trying to end my own life... but I still don’t get it. 
I think I’m just upset, and I’m reacting out of anger. I just don’t understand how she was doing so well and then tries to hurt herself IN the outpatient program facilities. I just don’t get it. 
I’m not mad at her, I’m just... I don’t even know. This just fucking breaks me that she’s not ok. 
I understand self harm is an addiction because same... I just wish she would stop. I just wish she was okay and loved herself. I can’t stand the feeling of knowing that one of the people I love the most, hates living.

I don't live in torture anymore nor have recurrent suicidal thoughts/extremely negative thoughts. However, as many people know, medication is not some magical solution: I'm still very insecure and have low self-esteem. This prevents me from believing in my capacities (I'm an EN&lt;&gt;SP translator) and being able to look for jobs. I waste a lot of time comparing myself to others instead of beginning my journey for once and for all. Last but not least, I have gained some weight due to the medication's side effects and it really sucks.

251,"That like even when you're with people, 99 % of the time you're not really there and something in your heart is resisting you from being fully yourself? 

So that you cannot ever fully relax into your being and instead are always as if holding yourself up somewhere outside of your body, always psychically hanging on a ledge of fear?

That Even when you're on your own and can be yourself youre still not really ""your self?""

This is how ive felt for as long as i can remember. The times when it didn't feel this way in my life have been as few and far between as sunshine on a cloudy day.

I feel fucked up somehow, like this isn't what human life is supposed to feel like. I can't imagine why human beings would exist to feel this way. It feels criminal.

The only times that I feel OK are when I'm stoned, like right now. And - rarely- when very comfortable with friends in a loving home environment. I never felt like this once while I was living with my parents.

I gave up a lot to feel better, I even quit my job and left everything behind on a spiritual journey, and yet after a lot of (enjoyable) adventures I still feel the same. Like life is just a movie playing in front of my eyes, as though a dream which I have no will over. I never felt in control of my life, really. I have always been along for the ride of whatever my impulses tell me. Sometimes they boss me in positive directions and sometimes negative but at the end of the day I still feel like I'm only holding on to the reins of my life which is living itself. I don't stand up for myself when verbally attacked, I just go silent and dumb. I've never been able to release myself completely to romantic love, just half way, never committing to anything that concrete, just like I've lived my life.

I don't know why I'm posting this, it's just a strange little thing, that now I finally feel okay, because I'm stoned, that this would come out. That a healthier part of my is crying out for some help because it's never expressed and always imprisoned behind this sort of crystalline, blurred window that seperates me from the life around me.

Idk. Does anyone relate? Is this something that happens?",11Jun2020,440

253,"This is a strange feeling. 

I had been at the park with my dog and had just driven back. She's very excited and nervous about being in the car, and was as usual super excited to get home. In the process of getting out of the car, she somehow slipped out of her harness and bolted into a busy street. In a quick moment I saw a coach bus coming across the intersection and towards her, and I jumped into the street yelling with my hands up. She panicked and ran onto the opposite sidewalk. I was in the street with a bus coming to a screeching halt feet in front of me. I was yelling and yelling at the couple on the sidewalk to grab the dog, which they did as I started swearing and just yelling, I was terrified. I scooped up the dog, hurried upstairs into my apartment, and just started yelling ""I just jumped in front of a bus chasing after our dog!"" My spouse said my face was stark white. It took a while for me to tell the story and calm down. I'm still shook. I was useless last night, just staring at nothing and not really being able to focus. I've been completely out of it today.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this PTSD? I feel off, disinterested, struggling to focus on work projects. My spouse can see I'm feeling off. I'm not sure if this is just a day of feeling blue after a high adrenaline moment, or if I need to address this deeper. Regardless, I threw out that damn harness. It was too big on her, and my god was that dangerous.",11Jun2020,1

256,"I've been paying for and attending weekly therapy sessions for the last 5+ months and nothing ever gets any better. I started therapy because I wanted to improve my friendships and connections with others, and I wanted to overcome my long history of trauma from my abusive family. I've tried talking to my therapist about it but often we end up talking about the same stupid advice over and over again.

I tell her I want to actually bond with others and make friends but I'm scared and all she tries to teach me is ""mindfulness"" and how to not panic when people seem unlikable early on. Not how to spot healthy vs mentally unhealthy potential friends, not how to rewrite my mental narrative of feeling like even great people aren't worth befriending because I'll inevitably lose them to arguments down the line. But just how to be calm when processing small things that upset me. I'm so furious. None of it helps.

When I tell her I can't connect with people on an artistic level she just encourages me on doing a hobby other people would like instead. Not how to present the things I love in a relatable way. Not to value my life's passions and improve upon them and find a connection on that level. To reinvest my valuable time into shit I dont care about to draw in more people. Because I guess my hobbies are not valid and not worth sharing. 

I talk about my attachment issues and my broken love mapping that causes me to be drawn to shitty people that abuse me and how I want to learn to be interested in healthy people that are better for me and she just agrees but offers nothing. Not advice on differentiating the two. Not ways to remap my thinking and finding new ways to view people. She just tells me to be nicer and more compassionate to the inevitable trash that keeps coming into my life.

I broke down. I yelled. I cried. I said I dont want to learn how to be a better victim all I ever wanted was just to be happy. I dont want to be taught how to put up with people that make me miserable I just want to be a better person that meets people who act decent to me. I dont want to give up my digital art and animation I just want to know how I can be understood for loving it and how I can share it instead of feeling so alone in my passions. 

I explained I've heard all this before and I'm so sick of it. I'm so sick of being taught how to tolerate more bullshit and be happy with dysfunctional friends and half assed partners, instead of change it to be a truly happier person. I'm sick of therapists telling me to just ""be mindful"" when I'm trapped in a very clearly toxic cycle and I'm begging them to help me get out of it. I dont want to be better at just regularly tolerating my own misery and symptoms of abuse. I want to improve so I dont suffer with them all. The. Fucking. Time.

All she did was nervously suggest that maybe therapy isnt for me and I could cancel my next session if I wanted to. I want to give up. I really do",11Jun2020,2

I never talked to anyone about concerns regarding my mental health. 
I never visited a therapist either.

It sometimes feels like at least some of the people who have known me for a while do. 

I don't want to do stuff with people most of the time and if I do, I am never sober. And I don't talk about my substance (ab)use either. So most of the people I know can't really know what I am actually like. I have been around people without being on benzos or kratom and it is just weird.
I don't know what I am doing there, how to really interact and so on.
Its kinda bearable being around guys only but as soon as I have to interact with girls my social skills just drop beyond sub zero %. 
Its not like they don't like me or something, I do get attention regularly but as soon as that happens I just completely switch characters and I am insecure af. I always feel like everyone is always hostile, trying to find something to pick on and I don't know how to react. Benzos kinda eliminate that for me. 

Sometimes I think people might be asking me If I want to do something
because they realise I am depressed and think that it's going to make me feel better or stg when they do that. I also have these almost manic phases as well where I am texting with people and talking about stuff we gotta do sometime and as soon as it's Friday 3pm, and I come home from work, I just say I don't feel good all of the sudden and I just crash on the couch and die inside. Thinking about how tf I was so dumb to arrange something again even though I know I am going to be down af as soon as I get the possibility to just sleep the time away again.

270,"TLDR: My (25M) girlfriend (24F) of 3 years has battled through severe mental illnesses before our relationship. Tuesday night she suddenly had a mental breakdown, resulting in total relapse of her symptoms from about 3-4 years ago. Manic episodes/depression are the only two terms I use, but there may be other illnesses as well. We are taking the steps to get her back on medication with proper dosages, but it seems this will be a lengthy recovery for us. I would really appreciate any kind words, advice, a prayer if you're religious, honestly anything to occupy my sleepy brain.

Hello fellow Redditors. I'm not sure if this is a common thing around this sub, I genuinely did not research on this subreddit before deciding to post this, if this breaks a rule or is generally frowned upon I will delete. 

I apologize if this ends up as a wall of text full of grammatical errors, I'm running on approximately 6 or 7 hours of sleep over the last two nights while doing my best to tend to my girlfriend suffering from manic depression and potentially other mental illnesses. As I touched above, my girlfriend is the one suffering at this time. I have dealt with bouts of depression prior to our relationship, but nothing I've dealt with seems even comparable to what she is experiencing in the last 3ish days. I guess one last little background fact is I specifically use the term Manic because that's one thing I know she was diagnosed with when this happened to her about 3-4 years ago (prior to our relationship... I was aware she had dealt with mental illness, but I did not pry and I felt that I had enough information about it. I was wrong I wish I would have inquired further with her family.)

Timeline: Tuesday night was when she had the initial mental break down. She had been generally feeling down for about a week prior to the breakdown (something I made mental note of and tried to be extra sensitive and supportive). The minor depressive stint before the breakdown was not particularly alarming, we have bounced back from worse. I understand that the feelings on the outside =/= feelings on the inside, this is just my perspective. It was a normal tuesday night for us, Broad City on Hulu after a long day of work and dinner/dishes as well as a couple dabs (concentrated marijuana for the uninitiated) for me and one dab for her. We have been smoking weed almost daily for about the most recent 2 years of our relationship. When the breakdown started, she just immediately stood up from the couch, shut off the TV and the light before going to bed. This was very very uncharacteristic for her, so immediately I was alarmed and began checking on her. She didn't acknowledge me much at first, then abruptly asked to be held. Of course I obliged and began to hold her and she explains to me in a panicked fashion ""this is very serious, /udumdumstoopid, I'm starting to feel manic again."" I have never heard this term used, and I certainly had never seen someone experiencing these issues. I was confused, but immediately did everything I could to comfort her. She went through the waves of the manic episodes for about 1.5 hours. I am estimating because my adrenaline was pumping so I had no real sense of time passing while this was happening. Eventually we managed to calm down as she stopped going through the cycles. She was slow to respond to me and generally seemed quite numb, which I thought was a result of using so much mental and physical energy in such a short time. We fell asleep cuddling.

I set an alarm for Wednesday morning approximately an hour earlier than normal in order to check on her and have time to act accordingly if she was feeling poorly. Long story short, she was feeling poorly. Sort of the same symptoms as after the episodes, maybe slightly worse, however at that time she could fully focus and still hold a conversation despite being a tad delayed. Unfortunately I did not know that Wednesday morning would be the last time I had anywhere close to full conversation with my girlfriend. I spent the rest of the day comforting her as well as I could, while also scurrying to get paperwork and things taken care of so if need be I could take the rest of the week with vacation time. (Fortunately I have a job where I could do 90% of that from home on my laptop, and the other 10% I just asked a favor from someone at the plant.) As the day continued, her ability to focus on anything plummeted. It seemed that her internal dialogue was a lot stronger than anything else I could get her to focus on. She started making coffee and only got water into the machine before wandering off elsewhere. This is about the time I realized this problem was bigger than anything we could solve together and that I needed help. I couldn't do it alone, especially when I needed to step away just to cry my eyes out every so often. While I was still able to hold her attention for some basic answers, I made sure that her mother was well equipped to deal with problems like these. I couldn't stand the thought of bringing someone in the picture who would make matters worse, that's why I asked my girlfriend first. I was able to convince her to lay down in bed and relax while I made the phone call explaining the situation to her mom. Her mom reacted as most moms would and immediately packed some things and drove over. My girlfriend had been taking medication to keep her levels proper since we have been together, but after some investigation we realized she stopped taking them completely. I feel that I have dropped the ball for not realizing she stopped. Her mom and I spent a couple of hours with her, but her focus was only getting worse and it seemed that she was having some of the conversation in her head assuming she was actually speaking to us. This eventually escalated as the day went on, she would become extremely zoned in on her own thoughts, to the point where I had to physically touch her and say her name loudly just to snap her out of it. As the zoning in escalated, she was becoming harder and harder to take care of. She would only take really really small sips of water after an hour of trying to get her attention and also we made (I think) 3 different things in an attempt to get her to eat, none of which were successful. She had about 1/3 of a banana and 1/4 of a piece of peanut butter toast. Her mother convinced me to take her to the nearby hospital later that night, despite me wanting to pursue other options before taking that measure. Her mom mentioned they waited too long to take her in last time and also made the very valid point of her being incredibly dehydrated. As she has experience with this and has gotten her daughter through this before, I agreed. I bawled my eyes out outside of the hospital for a few hours while her mom stayed with her. They did tests, she spoke with a psychiatrist over video, and offered to take her as inpatient in another hospital in a nearby larger city. My girlfriend was terrified to go to the hospital from the very moment she started having her breakdown, I think she knew it was inevitable. Naturally she declined the inpatient and said that she just wanted to go home and be with me. (Her mother could not overrule apparently, as my girlfriend is an adult) They sedated her in order to calm her down during the testing, which in turn made her mental situation seem much much better than it actually was. She was calm and able to clearly hold a conversation, just a bit slow because of the drugs. Because her vitals were fine and she declined the inpatient, they discharged her and we went home. I had a bad feeling about the sedatives being the reason she was seemingly okay, but I didn't have much say in the matter from the outside and honestly I felt good about us sleeping together that night. I helped her rinse off, put on PJs, and we went to sleep. She was okay mentally, but clearly still feeling the sedatives and possibly exhausted from the day.

Thursday morning (today), approximately 3 am (2ish hours after I was able to calm down and fall asleep) she woke up for the first time. She was pretty confused, slightly trembling, and that was enough to reconfirm that the sedatives only calmed her down for the time being. I was able to calm her as she woke up every so often, until it essentially picked up where we left off before we took her in to the hospital last night. She has only been feeling worse today if anything. It's harder to get her to focus and is clearly struggling to determine what conversations are in her head and what is real. She was not eating or drinking anything still, and has even become incredibly defensive at times when she is lost in her thoughts. I know she is just scared, and unable to understand what is going on because of the mental illness, but my heart has been aching for her non stop since this started.

EDIT: She will see her psychiatrist tomorrow in order to be evaluated and restart her meds. This is most likely the cause for the relapse.

And that brings this incredibly over-detailed story to a close for now. I honestly do not know why I spent so long writing this out and I do not know why I'm about to post this. Thanks again.",11Jun2020,4

I have a lot of self esteem issues, and feel lame when I hear about other people's fun stories, like, ""Oh i was out drinking with a friend, and this happened,"" type of stuff because I don't have any experiences like that. It makes life hard because I can't even socialize without feeling like a lame piece of shit, and it's especially hard because my girlfriend has a lot of stories like that and she doesn't want to share them now in fear of upsetting me, which also makes me feel even worse because I am now limiting her fun, if that makes sense. Feedback, advice, or resources would be very appreciated. Thank you all",11Jun2020,1
