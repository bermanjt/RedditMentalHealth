1,"Hi, I’m from the US, 21 years old and a female. 

I have diagnosed ADHD, anxiety, and depression and take medication for my ADHD and depression. I cannot take “real” anxiety medication because I have a past addiction to benzos, so, substance abuse is another mental health struggle I have too. 

I had acute stress disorder after a traumatic experience over a year ago and recently was physically and sexually assaulted. 

I have developed Dermatillomania very badly. This started after my traumatic experience about a year ago when I picked at my skin a lot to cope. Now I pick at my scalp. I am finally trying to stop because it has gotten very bad and I think it is gross but I do it unconsciously. I am losing so much hair and have big huge scans on my head. I need to stop. 

This alone doesn’t make me think I have OCD but I have recently been having really violent intrusive thoughts and it is really scary. I also get very angry at the person who did the physical and sexual assault to me. I will just be walking along and have incredibly violent and intrusive thoughts and I am not a violent person. I hate watching violent movies or seeing suffering and I don’t even eat animals because I love them so much. I also get irrationally angry at my roommates animal I live with and it really bothers me because I love animals so much. 

Every time I feel like I’m losing my marbles and I make a google search ocd is the first thing that ever comes up. I’m just wondering if anyone has ever suddenly developed ocd? I definitely have had ocd like symptoms before like they are so weird idk how to describe them. Idk why I’m making this post I just feel like I am going kind of crazy and don’t know why I am getting such scary thoughts. If anyone has any advice or anything like that or thinks I’m overreacting I would really appreciate it. 

The Dermatillomania could also be me searching for stimulation bc I am very very adhd. I’m trying to replace it with rubbing my hair ties instead.",01Mar2020,1
2,"I can ignore it most of the time, I live a pretty normal and happy live now and id think I'd make my small self proud.

but sometimes the fact that I've been abused consistently for the first 16 years of my life still creeps back up into my chest and heart and makes me feel like I can't breathe, and that I don't deserve to, my memories haunt me just well I thought Id escaped it all. a new chapter of my life has started and im so much luckier than most people that have felt the way I've felt in the past, because most people don't survive. I'm loved now, or so I hope, and my life finally has happiness, but my past self, the little me that was a burden to all, taken advantage of by so many, that me haunts me, reduced me into a ball of fear and hallucinations and I'm starting to think I'm crazy

idk if this is the right place to post, but I just needed somewhere",01Mar2020,1
3,"This is my first post and I'm not even sure what I'm looking to get from it but my struggle with anxiety and depression has been getting overwhelming lately and I needed to vent.

I woke up later than I wanted to and it took a while to get out of bed but I got up, got dressed and went out to run some errands. The sun was actually out for a bit and I listened to some happy music and actually felt okay for a short time. Did my shopping and returned home.

Had a dream about my mom being over my house this morning and texted to tell her.

I was met with a cold response. And I can't even blame her, I haven't reached out in a while. I don't talk to friends or family often and when I feel the urge to, the overwhelming guilt and shame from the gap in contact mixed with the repeated apology I know I owe them stops me from even sending a short text. 

Most of my family does not take anxiety/depression seriously and my mother has been seeing counselors for years so thinks what may have worked for her will work for everyone so I avoid telling her. Her overwhelming concern just feels embarrassing and intensifies my anxiety. 

I know I need to be open with people close to me about what's going on in order to have even a chance to repair the damage I've caused to our relationships but I'm not sure that's even possible anymore. Every day I find myself isolating more and more. I have tried to seek out professional help but the people I've gone to so far have been terrible for me and I'm so scared and anxious to try again.

I just don't know where to go from here.",01Mar2020,1
4,"i’m a 20 F and a junior in college. i have bipolar type II and ADD. I dont take meds for bipolar disorder because they kept making me gain excessive amounts of weight. i’m still recovering from that weight gain.

i got a dui about 3 weeks ago. i had always had an issue with alcohol but never thought i’d drive until one night i did. thankfully nobody was hurt and nothing was injured, i just hit a curb. but the experience in jail traumatized me. it was beyond inhumane and disgusting. i have been washing my hands so much since getting out that my knuckles are dry and cracking even though i moisturize. parents are covering the lawyer, i’m paying for everything else like the breathalizer ($75/month for 6 months), victims impact unit ($60), counselling ($60 every other week), probation (dont know how much but not cheap for 18months-2yrs), and the impoundment of my car (~$180). 

and yes i know i shouldnt have done it. i feel nothing but shame and regret for the incident.

i’m a full time physics student and work a minimum wage job 4 days a week. my manager is a dick and minimum wage here is 7.25 no tips. i started off this semester ready to get my shit done. i’m repeating a class i failed last year and a class i dropped out of. after all this shit thats happened, my focus has been severely altered. i’ve been trying to shift it back to school. i studied hard for a differential equations exam (who i pay for a tutor in -$40/hr) and made a 55. i don’t know what happened. i know the material. i genuinely do. well it turns out i have severe test anxiety and my mind just blanks. i talked to my professor and showed him i can do the math correctly and he just said that next time i need to work on the anxiety. 

i also got a strike from my university for the dui. that’s another $75 to them + i have to take a class on alcohol and substance abuse. 

i’m sitting in the bathroom stall at my job and just crying. i was cleaning and just thought about the ways i could kill myself. my life is going downhill. everyone around me is doing well. i’m mentally suffering. i thought about running away. i just want to be happy. i’m tired of this and i’m tired of hurting.",01Mar2020,1
5,"So a little background, my eldest sister suffers with a lot of mental issues one being borderline personality disorder. (21)
My brother has anger issues. (20)
I suffer with anxiety, panic disorder, depression and an eating disorder. (16)

So my sister and brother argue a lot, and it gets very out of control very quickly, tonight they kicked off, ended with my sister pulling a knife out on my brother while my younger sister (13) was with them at their house. I had to get to there’s very quickly baring in Mind I was just calming down after a major panic attack, you know the slowly coming back to reality phase.... 
police were called etc.. 

These situations happen too often but I am always the one my elder sister calls, she depends on me too much and I’m only 16. But tonight, after it calmed down a little, that my anxiety was spiking again and my brother told me to “stop making it about me when it’s not about me.” I am never the person to cause a scene I’m more of a ‘suffer in silence person’ so I was kind of hurt by him saying this, I ended up going outside because my blood pressure was going high and my chest was getting tight (my first sign of a panic attack) I had a full on meltdown, no one checked to see if I was okay, not even my mum. I dried my eyes went back in to the house and I lay down on the floor because it was cold and felt nice since my body temp was high and she laughed at me and said “go and take another pill” (on about the anxiety medication I used to be on) 

I feel bad that I made a point that my anxiety was bad but I equally felt like I needed to say something about it, to let them know that dealing with them constantly is affecting me severely. 

Do you think I shouldn’t have said anything? Any advice? X",01Mar2020,1
6,"Eventhough i have been dealing and struggling with mental issues for quite some time already I feel like this is the thing that I really don’t know handle with mentally. I guess I’m not the only Asian person who has experience this kind of racism since Corona “trended“ but it’s really difficult for me to handle this particular thing.A teacher I never had before in any class expelled me from his classes (dunno if this is the right word) with the reasoning being that he doesn’t want to risk getting infected with “The Virus“. I honestly didn’t attend school for the past days because of this and I am honestly afraid to go there, because Eventhough I know that the people in my class are probably on my side I really can’t handle bullying that well. I just don’t know what to do and nobody this far was really able to help me, so maybe someone over here might have a suggestion?",01Mar2020,1
7,"Since the 7th grade, my mental health has just deteriorated and no matter how many times I've tried to get help, my parents brushed it off. My self-esteem is low and I'm awkward and quiet. I can't concentrate and it's hard to remember anything because I'm constantly thinking about things I don't need to worry about. I get jealous easily when it comes to my boyfriend (m15), but I feel like there's an underlying cause. I constantly get misunderstood and I take everything to heart, I don't know what to believe or what not to believe. It never feels like I can be myself, I forgot my true personality. When I try to be nice in hopes of seeking validation and hoping to make friends, people think I'm odd or they simply don't care. I don't know how to get better and school stresses me out. I want to cry every day and my motivation to do anything just diminishes.",01Mar2020,1

9,"I've been depressed since I was a little kid. I remember vividly from Kindergarten to now, that I was never able to get along with the other kids. All my interests were outside and foreign to the norm. I was never taught how to socialize with others and understand body language and social cues, which is disconcertingly difficult for me, knowing how to filter and think before I say things. I was always extremely sensitive to others yet I would pretend to be tough and rude to others just so I could feel stronger and more secure. And I would cling to friends or anyone who made me feel worthy and secure. But then hate them whenever I was excluded, humiliated, betrayed, insulted. I felt everyone was either good or bad, hated or liked me. But I think that I was mostly hated. I would always be dependent on everyone liking me and wanting me around to survive. There were plenty of times where I considered suicide and was hospitalized once. After that hospitalization, I knew that I would only get worse and would never be fixed. I just want to be normal and likeable. I paid people to like me, I bribed people to like me, I tried guilt tripping people to like me, lying, manipulating, etc. I just really wanted friends who would really want me around just as I did. I know thats pathetic. But I hate being mentally ill, it makes me feel disconnected, flawed, worthless, stupid, and it makes me not live any longer even while Im writing this. I wish I could tell someone this in person but Im so afraid to be judged and Im so ashamed of myself as a person. Other than Depression, I probably developed all sorts of disorders too. I did self-assessments and found BPD, DPD, and other problems. I just wish it could all go away.  Sorry about this elongated text. But how should I open up to my doctor? What problems or illnesses should I bring up? Thank you for the time. But in the end, knowing my past and luck, I might never be helped.",01Mar2020,1
10,"I am looking for advice and maybe insight if anyone here can relate to my problems. I have always been a little ‘off’, and all of my close friends acknowledge that, but I have still been able to do relatively ok in most areas of my life. As I get older, (21), I have started to pay more attention to some of the kind of trends that have been messing my life progress up and just my general functioning. I have been diagnosed with adhd when younger, but I am fairly sure that I have also had a few periods of decent depression. That much is clear to me, but then there is this ‘other stuff’ which gets me the most because it is all so embarrassing and plain confusing.  I am very unsure if this is related to mental problems (my poorly handled adhd? Or even bipolar/autism?) or if these issues can be derived from personality flaws and poor work ethic. I don’t know what to do, if I need to do anything, and feel lost. 


The life problems: 


• Periods of feeling unmotivated and depressed
 - Don’t care about anything, mostly not sad but life feels meaningless
 - Very hard to eat, almost have to force feed myself to not lose weight. Food = disgusting
-Isolate myself from friends. Have ended multiple relationships because I get flaky and go ghost mode
- Depressed feeling times last for a few months I think, but normally are only very bad for a week or two. During the very bad times I think about suicide sometimes and feel really empty.


• The ‘weird stuff’ 
-Sometimes becoming enraged over tiny things, like chewing sounds, someones presence, or other tiny things other people do. Sometimes find myself getting really angry because I feel like whoever I am talking to is speaking too slowly and I know what they will say. Like want to claw my eyeballs out angry. 
- Days where I feel extremely angry and aggressive for NO REASON. Like, walking through the supermarket fuming over nothing. 
- Impulsive drug use. I normally only drink once a week and smoke marijuana occasionally, but sometimes I go through phases where I do lots of dangerous hard drugs on impulse. Its not an addictive thing imo, just concerning to me that I make those poor decisions. 
- Weird sexual stuff. Sometimes I will for seemingly for no reason get fixated on a sexual idea and I feel like I am ‘driven’ to achieve it right then. This is what makes me feel the most crazy out of all of it. Like, weird kinky stuff that can be unsafe and also leaves me feeling ashamed after it all plays out. Have had times with really high sex drive (need to get off multiple times per day) and sometimes have times where I have no sex drive whatsoever for week(s)
-Small problems with insomnia and maybe anxiety


•Personality duality
-The ‘good me’ is charismatic, sharp, funny, and very good socially. Very extraverted. This person can make friends with anyone, loves socializing, and is good at talking to women. When I am like this I am successful at everything I do, happy with my life, and start romantic relationships. Very motivated academically and socially. 

-The ‘bad me’ is awkward, introverted, and quiet. When I am like this I do not like to socialize or go out. I mostly isolate myself, and this kills my relationships because I flake out on plans and become distant from everyone. Gets the bare minimum done to continue functioning, barely goes to class. The days seem to blur together. 


Is this stuff objectively cause for concern? I feel like I am making myself have these problems by thinking about having them, and it is all just made up by me subconsciously. How do I even approach this?",01Mar2020,1
11,"Hey guys,

I just wanted to see if others are in the same situation.

As a 29 year old female I have been single for 5 years (prior to a 2 year relationship) but have had lots of short term relationships in that time.  
I just got broken up with again ( iand can see that my mental health, recently being told it was too much to handle is definately a big part of this.

13,"Hello everyone, I will try to keep this very brief. My whole life I have grown up with a very overbearing mother. I would go as far to say that she is emotionally abusive to both my sister and I. However, she is emotionally abusive and manipulative in a very sly way. Always dangling money and gifts over our heads. My father and I have no connection. He makes no effort to try and get along or even talk with me. For instance when I told him I applied to grad school all the said was “yea”. Tonight my sister and I both took a mental health quiz and it said we were both suffering with dependent personality disorder. We are so codependent on our parents. Keep in mind I am 22 and my sister is 33. Every thought or action I have is ran through the lens of what my parents would think about it. Neither of us have any self esteem or worth. We are living in the south. A very conservative and redneck part of the south. I am also gay (parents do not support this at all) and stick out like a sore thumb around here because I take pride in how I look. I have a BFA in art from a private school. However, I constantly feel like I am ignorant and viewed as a loser/idiot. My degree is not good enough or valid for other people. Recently I applied to an art graduate program in St Louis. This would be a ticket out of this hell hole for me. However, when I tell people St Louis they tell me I will hate it and should move to New York instead. So now I feel like St Louis is not good enough. However, it is too late to apply to other grad programs due to deadlines passing. Overall I just feel like a total waste and that I am never going to be good enough. Please give me advice...I also apologize in advance over spelling and grammar errors...I wrote this in hurry on my phone.",01Mar2020,1
14,"I'm a freshman biochemistry major in college who's passion is science, writing, and volunteer work. While I haven't really made many friends here, and miss my best ones who are far away it's been okay. I focused on writing a book idea that was very passionate for me. Spending maybe 4-5 hours a day along with my classes, writing. And having a ton of fun. 
One week I had a bit of a medical incident that was very minor, but kept me from writing for a week. And then it was just bad... I've always had chronic depression and at one point planned to kill myself. But that was in HS and I've learned a lot since then. I've been questioning my religion and choices, college and major, and honestly every time i try to pick up my story i just can't. All of a sudden it kind of fell apart and I don't have any energy anymore. I can barely put up the face i used to. I just can't seem to figure out why I'm so sad. I don't hate myself and I have a mission. But for some reason it just feels not even worth it to get out of bed.
Maybe I'm just adjusting to something or need a break but. That one week off kind of broke me.",01Mar2020,1
15,"So I have been diagnosed with ADHD-PI (ADD). I am getting really frustrated and disheartened with medication. Feels like every time I make progress, I take another two steps back soon afterwards.

Here's the summary. 

* After **Ritalin failed**, I got switched to Dexamphetamine.
* **Currently titrating on Dexamphetamine.** Been on it for five weeks across various doses in titration.
* The **previous dose** was **not starting to be as effective** as it was prior, so I figured now was the **time to move up.**
* **Bumped up yesterday** and it was great! **Best I've felt on Dex** \- perfect clarity of vision and mind, no tiredness, more motivated, and the happiest I had been in a while. Getting things done that I would never normally do. It's like a subtle compulsion, I see something (dirty room/sink) and WANT to do something about it (clean them.
* Finally felt like I had found what I needed.
* **Today, I kept everything the same.** Same sleep length and quality, same water intake, same meal before the dose, same dose.
* **I didn't get the same positives I had yesterday**. I instead became sleepier and more sluggish - more foggier, less alert, less motivated, and definitely less happy. Don't want to do things as much, avoiding doing things.

Why does this keep happening??? I'm at a loss. Feel like I'm just going around in circles and it's incredibly disheartening.

Any insight or words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.",01Mar2020,1
16,"I was in Group Therapy at Program when we started talking about how people don't take the time to understand a problem (like depression and anxiety) completely and therefore act very ignorantly, which hurts the friend or loved one who is suffering.

I was half-listening (trying to battle a freaking urge at that moment) when my ears pricked up and I caught this part of the conversation. I said ""same thing with my disorder...I get so much ignorance. People think I am just this violent, crazy arsonist who goes around burning buildings and stuff for fun (I burned a rag on the porch of a house but caused no damage at all, and that is the closest I've ever come to burning a structure) but I am really not. I can't stop myself when I need to burn something. It is like an itch that has to be satisfied or I get more and more irritated, restless, angry, and depressed...so I burn and the relief I feel and the pleasure I get are overwhelming and calming.""

To my surprise, I didn't get hate or ignorance. This was the first time I had actively talked in Group about what it is really really like to be me. To my surprise, the therapist said to me, ""You know, you said something to me that really stuck with me. You said 'the only way to relieve the tension and the anxiety is to burn' and that is really interesting to me. I would like to know more about this disorder...""

Wow. Then, again to my surprise, all the other people in the Group started asking me real, honestly interested questions about what I feel when I need to burn and other things like that...and I was flattered and embarrassed at the same time. I answered as best I could and the attention made me feel so wanted and valuable and...dare I say, almost normal. Well, normal in a psychiatric setting. I know I have a problem now. My friends have made me see it and hearing it from a professional hurt me deeply, but also let me feel those feelings and realize that I DO have the potential to be dangerous, but that as long as I am actively going to my Program and the Groups, at least I can start to understand why I am like I am. The prognosis for someone my age with this disorder is abysmal, but I have a tiny glimmer of hope that I am at least accepted for who I am. My family accepts me of course, and even though the Program is just a micro-universe for me, it still feels good to be able to be myself...

My strange, funny (I am the ""class clown"" for real lol), valuable, loved, pyromaniac self. :) I am good with that...at least for now.

Hi everyone,

I wanted to do something more. I'm a mental health nurse. I have seen friends and acquaintances suffer as their family members took their lives and I was also frustrated by how drama (TV and Film) always presents mental health as just Psycho Killers.

I wrote a novel, HELLO LARRY BARRY, it is funny, clever and inspiring. I want the general public to understand and view mental health positively, I want mental health people to be viewed in a balanced light. Magnificent Mental Health.

26,"Hi guys, I had a very strange experience that included tactile and visual hallucinations today. So I have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder for awhile now. It comes and goes (I was in a psych ward last year for 2 weeks due to this) recently I have been noticing random things. I remeber I was in class when I saw a man walk through the door to the class and I turned and realized nobody was there. Anyways, fast forward to today. I started off feeling extremely and unusually optimistic after a period of isolation and depression. I was laying in my bed listening to youtube, and suddenly felt strange, kind of “off” I guess? I sat down to play some games, but just couldn’t for some reason. I had to go and lay in my bed because I started feeling very off and not right. My heart began pounding extremely hard, my veins in my arm protruded more than normal, and my thoughts became nonsensical, just complete and utter gibberish, and surreal, meaningless thoughts. I began looking at my wall and ceiling and noticing strange faces and patterns, like I could see someone’s face made out in the shape of the texture of the ceiling. I also recently have been having wild thoughts and noticing strange, meaningless patterns in everything that I can come up with in my head, it’s like an ability that I have or something, or I’ll be able to tell how everything is connected (as strange as it sounds), it’s hard to describe but basically I can look at a completely normal mundane item and connect it to another normal mundane item (for example: you look at how your bed has a part where the sheets kind of are bunched up, and I’ll think “oh that’s just kind of like how everyone bunches up their problems together into one giant hill” or some random shit like that.) anywho, I began texting my friend ava and felt sort of “delirious” in a way, like I wasn’t all there as I was typing and was just completely going off of course about how her and I have more insight than those around us because of our illnesses or something, then realized how strange it was halfway through. I kept on noticing things out of the corner of my eyes (my boots seemed to become very long and black as that were sitting there and it scared me) or I would see a black figure out of my tc reflection dart across the road. I was in my room and was completely out of my mind on edge, I felt like something was crawling on me in a way, and every little noise sent me into the air from fear. Then, I look up at my room ceiling, and there is this circle where the ceiling is swirling in a liquid, clockwise motion, but then fades as I look directly at it for a second. I kept on noticing these black dots at the top of my ceiling moving around but they weren’t anything. I was getting paranoid as hell and heard “Brock(my name)” then “what was that?” in a whisper in my room but I figure I just imagined it. I decided to take a shower and I was frequently looking out of my curtains and was looking all around as I felt very wired. My mom turned on a tv show or something in the other room and it sounded completely terrifying, like a woman was talking in a robotic voice through the wall or something. Everything began to feel like it was “false” or how I was realizing just how strange our “existence” is, like I look at the ground and I just think how do we see this, it’s hard to describe. I looked at myself in my mirror and I looked like a different person somewhat, I then had a quick sensation of a bug in my ear (even tho I knew there was no bug), my dog barked outside and it send me jumping into the air gasping because I was in such a strange stare of panic. I sat down and saw a black little animal or something briefly pop up behind a bush across the street but quickly disappear. After sitting down for a bit, I began to calm down. It is not over yet (almost). I was in the car going to an eye appointment, and I saw this weird faint black “circle” that was made up of portions, it was transparent, and the different sections kept on getting sucked into the middle of the circle. It went away and wasn’t a bother, but finally at my eye appointment, they covered up one of my eyes to test it, and my entire vision in that eye because distorted in color and these black lines engulfed my vision but quickly went away, they looked like veins almost.

Sorry for that wall of text, I’m just at a loss. I don’t know what to think of that since it was completely uncommon and I had never seen anything like it before. I feel a shitload better now as I type this (it happened at like noon), so don’t worry about me too much. Anyone have any ideas?

I have a primary and a psych doctor monitoring me. I feel like I ATA, because I really feel like this was crossing boundaries.

28,"This past year I thought I got “brain fog” due to using roaccutane pills for acne. I completed the whole therapy and I thought the brain fog will go away but it didn’t. I started feeling this way when I started using the pills, like two months in. So i thought it’s gotta be connected to the roaccutane. But I started questioning it.

I started questioning if it even is a brain fog. As the time passes by I feel like I am just going nuts. The feeling I have all the time is just undescribeable. 

I feel like I am not as alive as I was before the therapy. I feel like my emotions are fogged (although I was always introvert, but I did feel everything back then, I just wasn’t showing it)
, like the connections between my friends,family, girlfriend is also fogged. 

Since I had depersonalization and derealization, this feeling kinda reminds me of that but I know it’s not, because I would feel like I’m watching my lif as a movie. 

I have so much to say but so little to worss to explain this chaos in my head.

Sometimes I wonder maybe everyone feels like this, maybe this is how it feels like to grow up and face the real world. (I’m 18, anout to finish high school, and have no idea what to do with life)

33,"[heads up, you may have seen this exact post before - i created this alternative account for things mental health related so this is a repost from my main account]


I know there’s something not right with me. It bothers me everyday. Just some of the things I can name are:

•I never feel like my thoughts are my own. It feels like someone is putting them there.

• I feel the need to censor my thoughts and change them and explain them in my head, so that people don’t judge me for them

• It feels like everyone is listening in on my thoughts and I live in constant fear of thinking the wrong thing and being mocked and ridiculed as a result

• I constantly have to cancel plans with friends because I’m in a dark spot but I don’t want to unload my problems on to them so I say “I’m tired” and sound like I don’t want to be around them

• It’s really difficult to understand the world around me. I can’t comprehend how other people so seamlessly can tell what their peers are thinking, and make a spontaneous, yet appropriate response. I have to think incredibly hard about everything I say and do, and this often results in inexplicable, painfully long periods of awkward silence between me and others, even some of my own friends.

• People tend to assume there isn’t much to me, when in reality I have lots to say, I just don’t understand how to express it.

• The only way I’m able to truly express myself is through my art.

• I live with constant paranoia that everyone is after me.

• When I was 13, I began to self harm to deal with my issues, and now have to live with scarred arms which I dread to have to explain to anyone. It also becomes extremely easy when I’m in a significantly rough patch to fall back into those kinds of habits.

• I live a lot of my life in complete numbness. I only long to feel real, full emotions, rather than faking them for the sole purpose of fitting in.

• Insomnia. This is a big one. It’s rare for me to get a normal amount of sleep. I’m forced to tell everyone I’m just tired “because school” and “I’m not sad, just didn’t get much sleep last night” when inside all I want is to finally be able to relax again.

Most if not all of these bother me EVERY DAY and constantly drive me over the edge, yet I’m terrified of telling my parents. They already found out that I tried to hide my first suicide attempt from them so I promised to tell them if I ever feel that low again. So now if I tell them about everything that’s going on I’m scared that they won’t be able to trust me anymore since I hid this all for so long. Since I haven’t been able to tell them I haven’t been able to go to a professional and get a diagnosis. I’ve been debating whether I should open up to them for a very long time despite all the seemingly detrimental cons (loss of trust, fearing that I would get anxious, freak out, and start lying while trying to explain everything to them, etc.) but what doesn’t help making this decision is that I don’t have any first hand accounts of how helpful getting a real diagnosis has been to other people. So if you’re comfortable, would any of you guys mind telling me how your diagnosis process went, and how helpful it was? (e.g. were you able to get the correct treatment following the diagnosis, did having a definitive diagnosis to explain your symptoms help you cope with them, did finally opening up to someone feel as freeing as you imagined it to be, etc.)",01Mar2020,1

35,"So I think I might have BPD and I need opinions...

I don’t want to self diagnose myself or anything, but recently I’ve become increasingly aware that I may have BPD. I seem to be very good at hiding it, and I only allow the symptoms to come out when I’m alone mostly. Here are my symptoms:

-sometimes feel suicidal
-sometimes feel chronically empty 
-sometimes I get very angered by small things, and not angered by big things that I SHOULD be angry about
-I have had many romantic relationships and all of them have been unstable
-I seem to have a distorted sense of who I really am


Those are all the symptoms I have that relate to BPD, I don’t seem to have a fear of abandonment and I don’t think I have paranoia. I also do not have impulsive behaviours with drugs, gambling etc. I would say I’m impulsive in my relationships with others, but that’s it. Apparently people with BPD don’t experience empathy as much (according to the internet), but I am highly empathic. So, with all this said, do you guys think this is BPD or something else..?

36,"Hey guys, I made a post on this sub recently about how I wanted to go watch a movie by myself for once and how I felt really anxious about doing so, because I didn’t want to seem weird or lame. But I was also doing so because I wanted to get out of another event (my other recent post).

Anyways, I did it! Feel free to not read all of this if it gets too long. But basically I went and at first I was the only one in the theatre. But that’s because I got there a little early. Then it started to fill up. In my theatre there were a lot of people in pairs so at first I felt a little weird but I tried to brush this off and tell myself that literally no one cares. 

When it ended and I was leaving, I was back to feeling a little weird again just because I thought people could be paying attention to me since I was leaving by myself. But this feeling passed and it’s probably normal? It’s okay to feel uncomfortable at first and I don’t regret doing it at all.

But when the lights went down and the movie started, I started to feel really good. I was able to enjoy myself and I wasn’t really thinking about what other people have on their minds. I’m sure as fuck they could care less about me. It was such an uncomfortable but good experience and I’m so glad I did it. I know now I want to do it again in the future whenever I can’t make plans with anyone else.

When I think about sex I feel uninterested and I feel I lost that passion I once had. Just life in general I’ve lost that spark, I feel not happy but not sad. It’s hard to describe. Maybe it’s not called emotional numbness, maybe it’s something else entirely, but I wanted to put it out there to see if others have experienced something similar?

I know that my anxiety is through the roof, and mixed with my already very short span of attention, is hindering me from performing well in school.

I’ve never been diagnosed (I know how that sounds, but I’ve done my research) and I exhibit a lot of symptoms of social anxiety disorder, which are obviously mitigated when I drink (it took me a few to even be able to write this, where I’m anonymous). I’ve noticed that that confidence leads to success with friends, girls, family and the like, makes me more motivated to create and consume art, allows me to order from chipotle, and overall makes me a legitimately happier and more proactive person. I feel more in control of my life despite having less control of my motor function.

But, obviously, I don’t want to rely on alcohol to escape in this way. I have trouble internalizing my drunk self’s knowledge that people really don’t care and that their judgement is irrelevant.

47,"Hello all,

I'm speaking with doctors but I also wanted to get a community perspective on what the hell I'm experiencing. I just haven't been able to figure it out. Basic facts:

\- From the period of February to December I experimented with these nootropic supplements: krill oil, l-theanine, alpha brain, piracetam, CBD oil, CVS Cognizin citicoline, Nootropics Depot Cognizin citicoline, l-tyrosine. However, from February to September I rarely used any of it. It was only from September to December that I did, and the only two things I used regularly were CBD oil (5-10 mg before bed) and both brands (interchangeably) of Cognizin citicoline (250-500 mg). I at first thought they were helping but later felt like I wasn't quite myself with them in my system. So in December I went off all of it cold turkey and haven't used any of it since. 

\- I afterwards still didn't feel quite like myself, couldn't see the world the same, and had pervasive memory loss. My phenomenological tint had changed and I often obsessed over whether or not I was ""looking at the world through a stranger's eyes"". \~90% of my memories were lost and still are gone. 

\- I've been trying to manage as best I can and some days are better than others, but I'm constantly trying to recover my memories and sense of self, with little success. 

\- Reality during the day takes on a gray tint, feeling empty and decontextualized. I don't have the beautiful and sublime encounters and understandings of the past to orient me. I also am more pessimistic about the future. I used to perceive myself within a complex and variety-laden continuum linking past to future. Now every day feels like my first and last day on earth. There is no past, there is no future, there is only this insipid moment.

\- At night often, reality shifts from feeling empty and textureless to feeling sinister and angular. I feel like something is pressing up against me (not physically, but psychologically) and have the urge to jump out of my skin. I often have to drink wine and put myself to bed because it's all closing in on me, this suffocating and oppressive vibe. The best way I can describe it is that reality is too 'sharp' to inhabit comfortably. Simply sitting around and being alive, with nothing else going wrong, makes me uneasy. 

I'd like anyone who might understand what I'm talking about to give any perspective that they're willing and able to. If you can only comment on one of the things below, I'd rather you comment than not. Of: 

1. This memory loss (not being able to mentally relive most of the moments I've had) 
2. This identity loss (feeling like I've died in my own body) 
3. This phenomenological shift (not feeling like my consciousness/observer's lens has the same tint) 
4. This perspective shift (not being able to see what I saw before within my physical surroundings and mental landscape) 
5. The ""empty feeling"" in the air most of the time 
6. The ""sharp-seeming reality"" that I have to inhabit sometimes, often at night

Have you experienced something similar before? What do you think it is? What do you think caused it? And would you predict that it'll be permanent? 

I'm especially interested in knowing what #6 is about. My mom has schizophrenia and I'm awfully worried that I could've triggered psychosis with the CBD. Does what I described seem like psychosis, or rather something else?",01Mar2020,1

50,"This article is so true. So sick of society trying to sell us shit with the promise it will bring the happiness we are ""meant"" to be feeling.

https://bit.ly/32wNsWS

""A huge happiness and positive thinking industry, estimated to be worth US$11 billion a year, has helped to create the fantasy that happiness is a realistic goal. Chasing the happiness dream is a very American concept, exported to the rest of the world through popular culture. Indeed, “the pursuit of happiness” is one of the US’s “unalienable rights”. Unfortunately, this has helped to create an expectation that real life stubbornly refuses to deliver.
Because even when all our material and biological needs are satisfied, a state of sustained happiness will still remain a theoretical and elusive goal, as Abd-al-Rahman III, Caliph of Córdoba in the tenth century, discovered. He was one of the most powerful men of his time, who enjoyed military and cultural achievements, as well as the earthly pleasures of his two harems. Towards the end of his life, however, he decided to count the exact number of days during which he had felt happy. They amounted to precisely 14.
Happiness, as the Brazilian poet Vinicius de Moraes put it, is “like a feather flying in the air. It flies light, but not for very long.” Happiness is a human construct, an abstract idea with no equivalent in actual human experience. Positive and negative affects do reside in the brain, but sustained happiness has no biological basis. And – perhaps surprisingly – I reckon this is something to be happy about.

Nature and evolution

Humans are not designed to be happy, or even content. Instead, we are designed primarily to survive and reproduce, like every other creature in the natural world. A state of contentment is discouraged by nature because it would lower our guard against possible threats to our survival.
The fact that evolution has prioritised the development of a big frontal lobe in our brain (which gives us excellent executive and analytical abilities) over a natural ability to be happy, tells us a lot about nature’s priorities. Different geographical locations and circuits in the brain are each associated with certain neurological and intellectual functions, but happiness, being a mere construct with no neurological basis, cannot be found in the brain tissue.
In fact, experts in this field argue that nature’s failure to weed out depression in the evolutionary process (despite the obvious disadvantages in terms of survival and reproduction) is due precisely to the fact that depression as an adaptation plays a useful role in times of adversity, by helping the depressed individual disengage from risky and hopeless situations in which he or she cannot win. Depressive ruminations can also have a problem solving function during difficult times.
￼Where is happiness located? Gutenberg Encyclopedia, CC BY-SA

Morality

The current global happiness industry has some of its roots in Christian morality codes, many of which will tell us that there is a moral reason for any unhappiness we may experience. This, they will often say, is due to our own moral shortcomings, selfishness and materialism. They preach a state of virtuous psychological balance through renunciation, detachment and holding back desire.
In fact, these strategies merely try to find a remedy for our innate inability to enjoy life consistently, so we should take comfort in the knowledge that unhappiness is not really our fault. It is the fault of our natural design. It is in our blueprint.
Advocates of a morally correct path to happiness also disapprove of taking shortcuts to pleasure with the help of psychotropic drugs. George Bernard Shaw said: “We have no more right to consume happiness without producing it than to consume wealth without producing it.” Well-being apparently needs to be earned, which proves that it is not a natural state.
The inhabitants of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World live perfectly happy lives with the help of “soma”, the drug that keeps them docile but content. In his novel, Huxley implies that a free human being must inevitably be tormented by difficult emotions. Given the choice between emotional torment and content placidity, I suspect many would prefer the latter.
But “soma” doesn’t exist, so the problem isn’t that accessing reliable and consistent satisfaction by chemical means is illicit; rather that it’s impossible. Chemicals alter the mind (which can be a good thing sometimes), but since happiness is not related to a particular functional brain pattern, we cannot replicate it chemically.

Happy and unhappy

Our emotions are mixed and impure, messy, tangled and at times contradictory, like everything else in our lives. Research has shown that positive and negative emotions and affects can coexist in the brain relatively independently of each other. This model shows that the right hemisphere processes negative emotions preferentially, whereas positive emotions are dealt with by the left-sided brain.
It’s worth remembering, then, that we are not designed to be consistently happy. Instead, we are designed to survive and reproduce. These are difficult tasks, so we are meant to struggle and strive, seek gratification and safety, fight off threats and avoid pain. The model of competing emotions offered by coexisting pleasure and pain fits our reality much better than the unachievable bliss that the happiness industry is trying to sell us. In fact, pretending that any degree of pain is abnormal or pathological will only foster feelings of inadequacy and frustration.
Postulating that there is no such thing as happiness may appear to be a purely negative message, but the silver lining, the consolation, is the knowledge that dissatisfaction is not a personal failure. If you are unhappy at times, this is not a shortcoming that demands urgent repair, as the happiness gurus would have it. Far from it. This fluctuation is, in fact, what makes you human.""",01Mar2020,1

Just this horrible scream that I’ve heard from too many people who attempted suicide but weren’t successful. I’ve heard numerous stories from people who attempted suicide and were so grateful that they had a second chance at life, but then there are people who will keep trying until they succeed. I felt like I was being cruel by doing my job to keep him alive because he was clearly suffering, and who am I to force him to live if he doesn’t want to?

I’ve helped resuscitate multiple suicide attempts. The looks on their faces when they realize what is going on is terrifying. I don’t want to inflict pain on someone who is already suffering, but at the same time I want them to have a chance to get better. Still, the screams are so much different than the screams of people who are in physical pain and it honestly haunts me. 

Do you think it’s cruel/out of line for healthcare workers to “bring someone back” after a suicide attempt?",01Mar2020,1
57,"Hi Reddit,

TLDR; I see monsters and don't fucking know why.

I know I shouldn't get a diagnosis online, and I don't expect one, but I'm wondering if you or anyone you've met has experienced something similar? 

Basically, I've seen ""monsters"" since about high school.  I'm in my mid twenties now.  They're usually the same ones, about 5-6 of them. Always based on some sort of memory. For example, one is very similar to the dementors in Harry Potter. That one in particular will hover over me in bed. They're not COMPLETELY there. It's hard to explain, but I never think they're real. (So for that reason I don't think I'm schizophrenic, because no part of it feels real)  They're fleeting, kind of like a projection that I can't directly look at.  They don't touch me. I don't feel them, but you can imagine how terrifying it can be at times.  At my worst, I used to see them everyday. Nowadays it's only if I lack sleep or become very stressed that I get extremely paranoid of them.   My best comparison would be how you feel after you watch a scary movie? Just extreme paranoia of the paranormal. I avoided scary movies for a long time because I didn't want to trigger another ""Monster"" to be created in my head.   Most days i just dealt with it, ignored them. They didn't really freak me out unless it was at night and I was alone. If it was day light and I was in public, I could still see them but I wasn't too bothered. The more distracted I am, the less likely I am to see them. 

I have tried to see a therapist/psychiatrist once on campus, but he was very dismissive and basically just said ""well, why are you scared if you know they can't hurt you?""  So I gave up on that a long time ago.

Thanks Reddit :)

58,"Don’t know how to write this cause I’ve never told anybody this cause I’m so ashamed but the stress, anxiety and depression is really getting to me so hope someone can give me advice.

So I’m a 23y old girl and I’ve never had sex or even kissed a guy. I’ve always been a really shy and really insecure person so when everyone else started experimenting I was and still am unfortunately too shy to kiss a guy because I don’t know how to kiss or how to have sex (sounds stupid ik). I’m just so embarrassed because I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to explain it but when someone gets close to me physically ór emotionally I freak out.
I’ve struggled with this a lot and thought I might be gay or a-sexual but the thing is I do want to but am too scared, shy, embarrassed, unexperienced whatever.
The thing is I’m not really an ugly girl so I get stopped on the street or guys asking for my number quite regularly. So that’s even more embarrassing cause people see I get attention but I don’t do anything with it.

There is this guy I’m in love with and I’ve pushed him away because of that reason. He was into me but I pretended I wasn’t. I’m so lost right now cause all I want is to be with this guy but I can’t because I have some mental blockade and I don’t know how to get over it.

It’s even so bad that I ‘escaped’ my life and have been traveling for a year thought things would change. It’s been over a year now and i have to come back but I’m just too afraid to come back because people are going to ask about boyfriends and because I have to leave this guy on the other side of the world.

So, I'll be 30 in two days and I am not excited as other people might be. I'm struggling with depression, I don't have a job, I'm living in my father's house again and, to be honest, I have no willing to live. My birthday gives me anxiety, because I never thought I was going to be like this at the age of 30. When I was a child I used to think that I was going to be successful, that I was going to be settled but the reality is so different... People say it is just a number, and I know it, but the only thing I can see is my failure. Nothing motivates me, I mean, I need money, I need to get out of this house, but every time I look for jobs it seems that I won't be capable of doing even the easiest thing. And I really want to do it, but the only thing I see in the future is me laying in the couch. I feel hopeless and stupid to think about me this way. I'm currently seeing a therapist, clearly not doing any difference. I have suicidal thoughts every day but I haven't done anything yet. I just feel like people doesn't understand what is like to feel this way so they just think that I am lazy or seeking for attention, which is crazy because all I want to do is disappear. Last time a told my mom that I think I need antidepressants she implied that I am an addict (last time I took those pills was a year ago). Right now I can't see a psychiatrist because is too expensive so I am in a vicious cycle.

63,"Hey r/mentalhealth, 

I will start without getting too deep into the situational aspects, I have a long distance girlfriend who is having some suicidal thoughts and battling bouts of what seems like some deep rooted depression. 

I have made the mistake of being considerably ignorant to these issues, either getting irritated, arguing, asking her to simply stop these issues and all but being 100% supportive mentally through this process. This is not a lack of care, for I love her deeply, but I have never battled depression or had the single instance of suicidal thoughts ever enter my mind. 

When these issues spring up, panic attacks and she starts to overwhelm herself with these feelings I do not know how to support or talk her through the issues, and not knowing and I do what I can, it usually resorts in an argument with both of us more steamed and her feeling all the worse as a result. 

What frustrates me most is that I have no idea what to do, how to be the number one support she needs without her being left by herself. 

She doesn’t have friends to reach out that she is comfortable speaking to about these issues and the family is a bit distant. 

I wanted to reach out to mental health and see what solutions, processes, guides, all in all everything supportive tips I can use to help my girlfriend through these issues and hopefully within time, help her out of this condition (if possible, with all prayers in order) 

Any advice would be appreciated, thank you.",01Mar2020,1
64,"I have been depressed since high school, attempted to be placed on several SSRI medications with no avail, between junior and senior year of high school I had not experienced immense depression, but still experienced anxiety.

However, now that I am 22, I experience anxiety every single day, anxiety attacks which hurt me to my core. I fidget, I hyperventilate, sweat, look around at everyone, shake my legs immensely, and feel like my heart will explode. My depressive issues have been intense, but I dont feel suicidal.... i just feel immense anxiety and depressed as that my anxiety negatively effects me.

66,"18F, no prior history of mental health issues. I have troubles identifying what I’m feeling sometimes and I generally don’t have much empathy so I’ll try my best to explain what’s been going on. 
The past week I have been having some big mood swings; I’ve been very happy one moment, and it could be five minutes later and I am feeling very tired and depressed, or angry. To give some context, here’s what my week has generally been like. 

I’m a grade 12 student who’s taking some IB courses so i’m naturally stressed all the time (I also tend to be quite high strung), and I had a busy week with some tests and extracurriculars. I was extra stressed as I was waiting to hear back from one of my universities for early admissions. All this being said, I didn’t feel like I was any more overwhelmed than usual. 

I’ve noted that I usually hit the “lows” when i’m not focusing on any tasks and i’m left alone with my thoughts. I also found myself zoning out more and feeling very energetic one second, and then absolutely exhausted the next. I think I also experienced some anxiety that came out of nowhere. I hit a crazy high after finishing a moderately stressful task, and then went to a party with my peers where I did not drink but was extremely talkative and excited as though I were drunk (I’m usually pretty introverted). I hit these highs maybe two or three times a month, lasting about 30 minutes each time, but they generally just result in me being more talkative and aloof than usually. 

I did some research on bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder, and I don’t feel certain that either of those are what I’m experiencing. My mood swings feel too frequent to be BD, and I don’t have the impulsiveness and other symptoms associated with BPD. I have spoken to a few close friends about this, some who do deal with mental health issues, and they think that I’m likely just going through a typical rough teenager patch, but I feel like it might be something more. 

Today was the first day I was mostly stable- I worked out early in the morning which I think may have played a role, and I was generally quite pleasant all day, with the exception of two little lapses of sadness and a bit of random anxiety around midday. 

I’m not great at talking about emotions and I’m kind of known for being kind of emotionless, so if anyone could help me out, that would be great :)",01Mar2020,1

Last year I self harmed, quite a bit and missed a lot of P.E despite being my favourite subject. I was going through a rough patch and felt so painfully numb, so it made me feel. In the end now, self harm doesnt hurt me. Cutting myself doesnt even make me feel anything anymore. I feel numb to it because im so used to the pain. Right now, nothing bad is happening apart from feeling useless, and having a friend die a while ago. I sometimes bite off skin near my knuckles, and it feels more like a stim then anything else?

68,"As a junior in Highschool, things are becoming overwhelming and reality is starting to hit, leaving me with the feeling of being lost. If there is anything I’ve noticed change in myself, it’s feeling melancholy every single day. I have two loving parents, two supportive siblings and a roof over my head so I can’t seem to understand what could be this underlying issue. I don’t want to go far enough to say that I have depression, but that’s a possibility. And as a child of immigrants, depression is out of the question. Even though my mom is a nurse, as mother I am sure she wouldn’t want to believe her own child has depression. But once again, I still don’t think that’s the case. Let me explain a series of issue that has been bothering me lately and even though these are small matters that will pass one day, they make me feel like absolute shit. 

Growing up in a Buddhist household, I was naturally altruistic. All my friends would always praise me for being so lenient (saying ‘no’ was also scary for me especially because of my anxiety). However, this year I became afraid of being taken advantage of (ex: giving people my homework answers or just saying yes to favors in general), so I became a little more stern in saying ‘no’ in the most polite way possible. All of a sudden, I feel like a villain for saying ‘no’. It’s also as if my ‘friends’ try to guilt trip me for not agreeing and it makes me feel like a punching bag. Along with this, we would all joke around about each other but, when it comes to me, all their jokes have some sense of seriousness to it. I know I could easily just make new friends as someone who is a little more on the well-known side, but everyone already has their set cliques and I want to have nothing to do with that. I can only stand one girl out of my friends and one of my good friends does pseo so I rarely see her :/ The rest of them are just boy hungry and I’m just trying to focus on my academics and get out. This all sounds like a typical Highschool issue, but it really affects me on the daily in a way that I’d never imagine. It feels like I don’t have a sense of place, no one appreciates me, and I am never taken serious. I genuinely do not want to be a burden to people by generating negative energy at school, but that’s all I feel in the inside. It just confuses me when people say they only see me ever smiling and laughing. I’m in a place of confusion where I don’t know what emotions I am feeling. I’m sorry this all sounds so disorganized and maybe a little dumb, but I just need help understanding why I am feeling this way. Feel free to ask questions, I’m more than happy to clarify.",01Mar2020,1

I felt it was very awkward to do that.  Yes, I'm an introvert too, which made it miserable for me. Though I enjoyed the event, I was deeply disturbed on how I'm
becoming numb. Especially during events that have more people. I'm not sad, but I'm helpless. Should I work on it or just be the way it is? I don't want to feel that negative energy again.

My “friends” there nice to me when I’m around them but I just feel like they’re just being polite or something really just hate me as much as I hate me. I don’t know if it’s paranoia or something but I just feel like they probably talk shit behind my back but I don’t know I don’t have no evidence or nothing it’s just a gut feeling. They’ve said things like “Matt we love you ” but I just feel like they’re being fake or trying to manipulate me or something. I just feel like I’m not a good person. I don’t talk about this kind of stuff with people even online I’ve never opened myself this way. I try to live a healthy lifestyle you know I eat healthy and working out lifting weights is pretty much all I live for. It’s pathetic the one thing keeping myself from just ending it is lifting and the prospect of getting gains and getting strong. Outside of that I just hate life and I hate myself. It makes me so angry too I just get bouts of anger where I just lose control of myself. On top of that I think I’m starting to become an alcoholic and I’ve developed a full on nicotine addiction. Drinking and smoking is the one thing besides lifting is the only thing that really numbs the pain, those little moments where I just feel numbed are really just the only thing (again besides lifting) that keeps me going it really goes a long way because in those little moments of bliss just lets me forget about this huge burden I carry. Everyday just feels painful to me. I can’t even look myself in the mirror any more. I’m a pathetic monster. I don’t want to talk about it to anyone because as I’ve mentioned I suspect that my friends secretly hate me too so that makes it hard for me to open up like that, plus I just feel like it would be a burden to them. I’m just too nervous to talk about it. I feel like no one really cares about me and I don’t blame them because I don’t care about be neither. I just don’t know what to do, I despise myself the man I see in the mirror is pathetic and weak. It’s a huge burden I carry and it’s starting to interfere greatly with my life. It’s painful to me it hurts that I hate myself so much but I don’t know what to do about it I feel like I’ve reached a dead end. If it wasn’t for my passion for weight lifting I would’ve killed myself by now I really would’ve. Even then I still think about it but it’s just a thought I entertain, no actual urges to do it. If I died I feel like it wouldn’t affect anyone like they might talk about it for a day at best but they probably wouldn’t care, don’t blame them neither. I don’t know what to do, I guess I just have to wait until I die to be relieved of this pain, death must be such a relief especially for an individual such as myself, not a care in the world. I don’t even know why I hate myself so much I mean my so called “friends” say they like me sure but those are just words, and words are useless. I can just have this gut feeling that they secretly hate me. Life just feels so cold and empty to me. What do I do? Nothing that’s the answer fuckin live with it I guess. 

Tldr: I hate myself, everyone else probably hates me, no one cares about me, I’m angry about it and I can’t talk about it because the only people I can talk about it with are the people who probably hate me.",01Mar2020,1

She asked me how I was eating and I told her I stocked up last night on a lot of frozen fruits and vegetables. She was concerned that I was eating fast food without her around, but I didn't have the heart to tell her the truth that the virus had hit near us and I wanted to be prepared for quarantine. I didn't want to spread fear on the floor. She already expressed that she isn't safe in a mixed space.

77,"So I’m not fully concerned about this , it happens kind of often but only in certain situations.
Basically in situations there’s, well not a voice but more like, a thought telling me “what if you just did so n so right now” or along the lines of that.
So I’ve been like in the car with the window down and it’s like “what If you just threw your phone out the window like right now , why not do it , like go” and then I have to like grip my phone really hard and it makes me on edge. I’m not afraid of heights but similar things happen when I’m on a bridge , so the phone thing and as well it’s like “what happened if you just like jump off right now , why not” and like I get kinda stressed (I’m not depressed and the thought of killing myself has never ran over my mind so it’s not that).  As well as that a more serious one is when I’m near roads , I get this big impulse to just run across the road and some times I wait until there are no cars and like walk back and forth so it like get rid of the feeling and I like get this adrenaline rush when It like comes to it. Around roads I usually cross just like really quickly and my friends are confused to why I just randomly crossed instead of getting to the crossing and this is why. And I think the only other one I’ve experienced is recently with like large kitchen knifes i feel like “ what if I dropped it right no on my foot or like just stabbed myself “ and it’s got to times before I’ve like had to put the knife down because I get so anxious though I’d doubt I’d ever do that. Same happens with scissors.
In the moment it just feels like a really over whelming feeling of you should do this and usually goes when I get away from the thing or the area or safely do it , like run across the road when no cars are there. It’s never been dangerous except from maybe this one time when I was younger , was one of my first experiences of this , and I just felt an impulse and was waiting to cross but then I just like ran and this car was coming round the corner and it got really close like I missed it by a second. But apart from that it’s never got dangerous because I think I’ve learnt / am learning to avoid the impulse , sometimes though I do get scared I might just do it but I doubt.

I made stuff up to get a diagnosis of schizophrenia while I was pretty sure I had ADHD I was a child I didn’t know what to say so excuse me for doing that I was a child. I always struggled because of attention I usually daydream most of the day, I go into fantasy worlds where I fight monsters and stuff or always have some sort of super powers, I get yelled a lot because of my attention problem because I can’t pay attention to normal conversations, either I’m fidgeting my hands or making weird things with my hands or I’m just into my fantasy world or completely distracted with my phone or something else. When I study I can’t read without checking my phone and losing track of time and forgetting that I was studying, or I just stare into the book or paper for minutes to an hour and forget what I’m supposed to do. I can’t handle myself in public because I’m always awkward and doing random things, when I go out my headphones are in my ears because I can’t pay attention to anything or can’t ignore boredom, I can’t go a day without being so bored and it gets so bad that I need to smoke weed to pass time, I can’t handle patience or wait for something without going insane about my thoughts. And I have really bad mood swings that last for minutes to hours. I forget what to say when I have a normal conversation. And I’m really speech is really disorganized, I jump from one thing to another and people say I’m really rude for it, when someone is talking I usually interrupt them and be really awkward because of how fast is my self awareness I just realize my actions right away. When I was a child I was really smart and on top of my class, in high school I was taking AP/IB classes but struggled with my attention but still managed to pass and still be on top. In sophomore year I was hospitalized for suicide, I was going through seasonal depression but the doctors didn’t know it because I was never diagnosed with any mental illness before, when they asked questions I told them I hear voices which was a lie, it’s my own voice talking to me in my head, usually people with schizophrenia hear things outside their head. Furthermore I told them I see stuff that are not there, which was also a lie, I wear glasses and usually have migraines and when I get a headache I see colors and shapes because of the headache, it last few seconds and goes away it’s not related to psychosis. And than they put me on antipsychotics which didn’t do anything and gave my bad side effects, I was still convinced that I had schizophrenia, after I did my research on adhd and schizophrenia I found out the truth, I just wanted to get diagnosed with schizophrenia because it felt good, it was so dumb to think that way, I was literally brainless to think getting a diagnosis of schizophrenia will make me feel good. I was 14 years old and didn’t know how to think probably I made so many mistakes and got myself into so many loopholes. I stopped the antipsychotics when I found out that I was just a dumbass trying to be diagnosed with schizophrenia. Everything was a challenge for me and so many people reward me and put in high places and it made me feel good so I guess I wanted the misdiagnosis to take on the challenge. I’m now 18 years old still trying to convince every psychiatrists that I don’t have schizophrenia but I can’t and it’s on medical records, I can’t get the right ADHD treatment because of the misdiagnosis and I can’t live like this anymore, I don’t know what do, I blame myself for causing this loophole, I deserved what I got I guess. I just feel so awful because I’m not getting the tight treatment, I’m emotionally burnt out and so angry with everything that I can’t control my words and impulsivity toward people.

I daydream about what it´d be like to live in the '80s, 20´s or in the 15th century in france. Honestly, it´s a lot more detailed in my head and I really can´t go any deeper than, that I really really sometimes believe that I either already lived in those times or will in my second life'20s which I somehow believe can happen in any time (like I´ll be reborn in the eighties for example). 

It´s gotten to the point where it affects my life. I write about, I talk to myself about things that never happened as if I was having an interview with myself or something in that matter. I totally see what I am doing and I am fully aware of it but stopping it is impossible. It´s like a coping mechanism for me. Probably. I don´t even know it might also be something else but it doesn´t feel normal. I don´t think other people do that. Or has anyone else done something like this before?

81,"I wrote this on another subreddit and I'm sorry to be annoying but I really need people to know.

WARNING: LONG READ 
Hi Reddit. I'm not giving my name or any hint of it for privacy reasons. I really don't anyone knowing me to find out I wrote this. For some background, I am a religious 14 year old living in a good country and home. 
I have a wonderful loving family and I am very fortunate. The only problems I have are with myself.
I cannot live with myself. Don't worry, I won't kill myself and I will never self harm, my faith in God won't let me do it. I think I have mental issues and nothing is really helping my mental state.
For one, I am really ugly. People say to me I'm not, or, I'll grow into my looks, but I know I'm ugly and accept it, but I hate the fact it is true. I get frustrated when I go out in public and see people prettier than me.It makes me angry and sad, and I don't stop thinking about my appearance. It keeps me up at night and I can't focus on anything else. Not school, not hobbies, not eating. This makes me slow at everything. Things I learn do not stay in my head and I have terrible memory.
For another, I think I have a mental condition of some kind. I may not have, heck, there's a high chance I don't but what I feel is so impulsive and  constant. Whenever I'm at school, every little thing annoys me and makes me angry. When someone slightly nudges me by accident, when the annoying girl in front laughs too loud, when someone trashes my table. I've even considered beating people up, but never acted on those urges. Something else is how I feel detached to everything. Whenever I am talking to a friend and they turn to talk to someone else who called them, I feel totally abandoned. I don't want to, but I can't help any of these problematic feelings I get. I'm not a loner, but I'm not popular either (which I have no problem with, I like it this way) and I am on great terms with many of my peers. I feel so sorry for my friends when I lash out at them, and I apologise most of the time (which I should do all the time). I always feel like crying and breaking down, but I know I don't have depression or what an edgy teen would claim to have. I am always changing emotions, of which I don't intend to. Happy one moment, agitated the next. I don't know what to do and it's becoming too much to deal with. Sometimes I wish I was not born with emotions. My brain is like another person sharing my body. It's like its only purpose is to make me feel insecure and angry. I always wake up in the middle of the night and stare into space, begging my brain to shut up. It is very much like a noisy, manipulative roommate with no respect (you know, like the ones that don't flush the toilet and bring home noisy party folks). It feels like a nightmare. I know I'm not a special person or amazing or superior in any way but whenever I am near anyone, there's always this side of me that says ""you're better than everybody else"". I know I'm not! I feel like a disgusting person when these ugly thoughts come out, but I can't help it. I curse internally at others for outshining me but I don't want to. I want to look up to people for being great, not hate or envy them. My confidence sucks so I don't know where this all comes from.
I told my parents only the part about getting mad and the ugliness but nothing else like my constantly shifting feelings. They gave me a wonderful talk about loving myself and my talents and how I should not compare myself to others. Mum offered to move schools (if I could find a semi-selective one near us, which I can't) and for a counsellor. 
I'm going to ask for a counsellor visit (I'm very nervous to as they don't recommend it), but, if anyone knows anything about psychology and can tell me what the hell is happening in my brain, it would be appreciated.
Thank you for reading and please don't think I'm an attention-seeking teenager. I am not edgy, I do not have the ""I am 13 and I am the darkness"" syndrome, nor do I want to cause drama or harm to anybody. A lot of other people have it worse than me, I know that. I want help. I just want to sleep again.
Thanks, I love you all.",01Mar2020,1
82,"TL;DR: Friend had a mental slip leading to sudden enlightenment. He has been (questionably) diagnosed with schizophrenia, prescribed REXULTI for a full year even though it is harming his mental health. He wants to give it a reasonable try, but wants to be off it ASAP.

Please consider reading the rest of the post as any other information would be really valuable to me.

-

I'm posting this on behalf of my friend. Recently, he had what I would describe as a mental slip, which manifested as sudden and intense spiritual enlightenment. 

He describes this time period as the most meaningful and purposeful he has ever felt, and sees the experience almost entirely positively. Due to his change in personality, his family were worried and he relented to seeing a psychiatrist to ease their worries. He was then hospitalised against his will, and diagnosed with schizophrenia. 

My opinion is that his diagnosis is not very accurate. I will admit that after his slip, he has started believing in spiritual woo-woo (like astrology, numerology, butterfly effect), and I think that he gave them too much information about these abstract ideas, leading to the heavy diagnosis.

He has been prescribed REXULTI for about a month now, and it has done nothing short of make him miserable. He seemed overall healthy before, but is now experiencing depression  and complete hopelessness.

He is reaching his wits end as to whether he should continue the drug. His doctor said that he should use it for a full year, but that is the last thing he wants to do. I suggested he stick with it for at least a few months as I know mental health meds take time to start working.

How long would constitute a reasonable trial of the drug for him to then decide whether to continue with it or not?

Do you know of any resources or other useful information that could be helpful?

Thanks for your time, and sorry for the essay of a post.",01Mar2020,1
83,"I shoot myself in the foot and act like a moron to lower people's expectations and try to get fake diagnosis for depression, ADHD, Aspergers, or ADD. It's a way of victimizing myself. It's like I'm trying to mooch off alimony or welfare but I'm in no position for that bullshit. I also blame it on my dad dying a few months ago. People who know me aren't buying my bullshit and now everyone hates me. It's just raw delinquency. I have no respect from anyone left. I also got 3 misdemeanor charges for trespassing and IEC. They've been dismissed and expunged but it doesn't mean they don't exist. Hospitals, schools, government jobs, etc all can still access them. It still reveals my poor character. 

I used to be a decent student and got into a top 5 public university (if anyone cares about those rankings) so that just means there's even less tolerance for me backsliding like this. Where's a good place to start or a decent goal to focus on? I feel like all my past goals in life are unreachable now and I need to adjust my outlook. Things can't go back to the way they used to be, but at the same time I need to stay out of trouble and keep busy. I basically screwed up my life with no back up plan. I think I could have a dissociation disorder. Sometimes I rant at people but then forget about it. Then they come to me later to talk about it and I 100% think they're screwing with me. Then the next day I'll remember. 

If more context would help, I'm asking online specifically because my parents and family have become increasingly unsupportive and I can't trust too many people when I'm this vulnerable. Going online preserves my anonymity. I also feel vulnerable to grooming or other kinds of sexual exploitation. It's already happened once. I was too apathetic to care though so I'm not milking for pity here.

I also can't seem to get hired anywhere. At this point I don't have much dignity, integrity, or social inhibition left. I'm kind of getting used to people not caring anymore. I feel like I'll end up getting mugged and killed soon. Some female friends I knew said I'll end up becoming a gigilo or gay porn star soon. It was half joking, half cruel.

84,"Hi, I never made an account in reddit before but I've been reading threads of chosen subject before since 2009. So here I am doing this for the first time as right now I kinda have nobody to talk to about my problem.  


I am 22 years old and I'll be straight forward, my problem is kinda childish but its bothering me somehow. To start this, here is my background. Our parents dislikes me and my brother and always hates us so to escape the depression from our family, My brother always goes to a gaming cafe and play games. He then made me come along with him when I was 5 years old (2004) because he wants me to have the same interest as him which is gaming and also give me another way how to escape sadness. He always invites me to play this game called **""DOTA""** everytime we go there but, I was just a small kid and doest know how to do things yet. I suck in games like **REALLY SUCK** and everyone doesn't want to play with me because I'm so bad unless my brother tells them to let me join. It kinda hurts my feelings every day I think about it back then so, I start setting up my mind to get good in everything that I do and I will give my very best into it. I'll admit that I really wanted people to like me or like playing with me. I trained and trained being better in **DOTA** as well as everything I do. I didn't gave up no matter what and took everything that it takes.  


Fast forward to present time, I have gained this personality of wanting perfection in things I do. ( I don't know how to explain this but I don't correct other people. I don't focus on their mistakes but only focus on mine and I'm always self crytising myself such as ""I could do better than that. Keep trying and dont stop until you got it right"").   


I have made friends online that has the same mind set as me and went playing LAN E-sports tournament when I was a teen-ager. But for me, they are just online friends as we dont have the symetry of IRL friends. I have reached the highest rank/medal in DOTA (*Immortal rank 1700+ EU*). In the end of the day I still feel lonely after achieving those. So I qut the E-sports scene and just play games for fun.  


Now this is where my problem starts bothering me. My IRL friends also play games casually and they invite me to play games from time to time. I go play with them to have fun but then, every single time they I play games with them, they stop playing with me and still play with each other. This has been going on for almost 2 years now and I had enough of it. So I asked one of my friends, ""why do you guys not play with me after a few games I play with yous?"" he then answered becasue you are too good and its no fun. Now I'm so confused because back then people does not want to play games with me because I suck and now people does not want to play with me because im so good? It is driving me crazy and I really feel like I dont belong to anywhere. I really think I need some mental health advice right now...  


*TLDR: Back then no one wants to play games with me because I suck and now, no one wants to play games with me because I am so good.*",01Mar2020,1
85,This guy friend of mine and I had sex a couple hours ago. During the act I'm happy and having a good time and all that. However afterward I just feel so awkward and guilty. He has a collection of shot glasses (he travels for work and always gets one from all the places he visits). I told him that instead of cumming in the condom he should cum in a shot glass. So I put a shot glass between my boobs and he came in it and I drank it lol. It's not the first time I had sex with him but I just feel so awkward and weird especially the whole shot glass thing. After we were done we laid in his bed and we kissed and he told me that he loves me then he fell asleep.

89,"This is a related post to one I made recently and has to do with my experience of living with someone who is mentally ill and how as a result, I felt coerced and forced to live with her.


My mum is diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but there is good reason to believe she has borderline personality disorder, which makes a lot of what has happened somewhat understandable. 
I have never been made to feel so guilty over making a decision, being told how it was a bad decision, being told go go fuck myself, told how  I'm in the wrong here and now getting texts asking me to talk to her and that she misses me. 
She said that ""no one is there for her"" which isn't true. 
She is a diagnosed alcoholic and has gone from fully quitting to going straight back. 
I'm so hurt by all of this, I know that I'm allowed to make decisions and that I'm not to blame for her feelings, but I keep second guessing myself and am just sat in bed feeling guilty and anxious. 
I think my inability to put my foot down and be confident in my decision is a result of the guilt and I can't decide if it's a calculated act to keep me around or if she genuinely doesn't realise that she's making me feel bad. 
Over phone she tried telling me that I should ignore when she's having an episode, which I don't see to be fair when the one she had the other night involved her barely conscious and swallowing down every tablet in sight, I can't and don't want to see that. 
Everyone I've spoken to agrees with my decision, yet I'm just drowning in guilt right now. 
I am really confused by how she went from angry and telling me to go fuck myself to being nice over text and apologising straight after, it's odd. 
I'm scared that she'll hurt herself, I don't know what to do.",01Mar2020,1

After two weeks she grew distant and I knew something was wrong but chalked it up to her soon to be ex husband (at the time) and brushed it off. Eventually she came to me saying he ""wanted her one last time"" before they were divorced. She promised me she wouldn't. A week later she went out to drink with some co-workers. I went to go give her some money for drinks in case she wanted to pay for a round or two. I drove up to the bar and saw her vehicle. Next to it was another vehicle.

I pull up in front of the two vehicles and caught her in the act with one of her co-workers. I dont know what compelled me to but I screamed no and lost it. I collapsed and crawled back to my car finally speeding off with no intention of getting anywhere safely. I get to a stopping point and sit there for a couple minutes just staring.

100,"The mental health training in schools is an absolute joke. They recently tried to address the growing issues by making us watch videos on mental disorders twice a week for a month. It didn’t help. 

At my school we’ve lost 6 students in the last 2 1/2 years to suicide. We’ve lost 2 in the last two months. I lost a friend last week. 

She told me she was going to commit suicide Monday morning. She wasn’t here the next day. The kicker is that my friends and our reported her 9 times. 9 times in a span of two months. Two times the safe line was called. One time we were hung up on. The other time we were yelled at. A series of emails that resulted from our administration were all dead end. 

One of my friends sent another email to admin on Monday essentially explaining that the situation got more intense. She was given the response, “We’ve already talked to her.” That was it. 

Naturally, that raises the question what are schools expected to do? If we are injured at school, legally all the school nurse can do is give us ice, call our parents, or let us lie down for a while. It’s messed up. So if they can do anything for physical injuries, does that translate to mental injuries as well? 

That raises another question. What can change? Things like the baker act are absolutely terrifying and don’t do much to solve the problems.

102,"Bit of background. 
I have been dealing with my mental health for the last four years. Starting as depression has now developed into severe anxiety. I grew up in a home where my dad dealt with everything with shouting and being angry. The anxiety of living like this has (as my therapist put it) put me into crisis mode constantly, that has meant I have started to react in fight mode to protect myself, and the way I have been taught through example is to shout. It’s meant I now react aggressively, cry at the drop of a hat. I’m unbearable to be around. I basically spent a long time trying to not be him to realise I am entirely him. 

In my undergraduate degree I made friends with people and became close with them, I would spend my time with them everyday, we eventually decided to do our dissertation research together. The whole class had to go and do our research of geology away from the uni, which meant we lived together for 6-7 weeks. Months prior to that my first ‘episode’ of mental health really happened, I explained to them what had happened and I was on medication to help it. However my anxiety, depression has made me act still like an awful person. I would snap at the them, say things I didn’t really mean and just break at small things that hurt me. I couldn’t brush things off. They retreated from me and I had to spend a lot of time repairing that relationship. 

And now.
Fast forward I am in my postgrad degree now, one of those girls is at the same uni and she and I had become close again, slowly making up for what I had done. Two weeks ago I snapped as I was tired and stressed. I should have recognised this and removed myself, but I just didn’t and had to then apologise later. This weekend the pressure has mounted, she sent me a message about a job she might apply to and I sent a message back that was a little blunt. I later responded that I didn’t mean it quite as blunt as it came across and she sent my back a message saying I’m using her as a punching bag and maybe if it ‘wasn’t me it wouldn’t have seen it as rude’. I basically have reduced the bar so low that she just assumed I’m trying to be hurtful. 

On top of this I live with my boyfriend who I can snap at any moment. He’s the most understanding person but I can tell he takes it personally when I raise my voice (because who wouldn’t?), he feels he must walk on egg shells because I’m so sensitive to everything. He sometimes doesn’t know who he’s getting that day, there is no consistency with how I react. 

I am at CBT and have done therapy for so long. Nothing is changing, I’m trying my exercises from therapy, I’ve tried meditation, I eat better than I ever have, I run most days. I am trying everything people suggest and I still seem to blow everything up around me. Everyone I love get the worst of it and I’m going to end up alone if this carries on. And I know there’s giving myself a break and a bit of self love, but it’s very hard to do when you’re constantly ruining you relationships with everyone. 

I just need help, I want to shut myself away so I can stop hurting everyone. 

TLDR; I seem to have a major short temper and no exercise, diet, meditation, therapy seems to help. I’m awful to all my friends, family and boyfriend. If you’ve seen bojack horseman, it’s like that but without the drugs and illegal stuff, I’m just an arsehole.",01Mar2020,1
103,"I am currently taking Risperidone, 0.5mg twice a day. I know it’s a low dose but I’m experiencing severe constipation that I’ve been taking medications for, for months now and the risperidone is also affecting my libido. The sex drive problem is probably because of my current mood, but you never now.
I’m trying to come out of a severely low period which I cannot say was depression, because, here’s the thing: I’ve been going to different doctors, 3 therapists and 2 psychiatrists but none of them have diagnosed me, so I decided to see a new doctor, a psychiatrist, and try to sort things out.
To be short, I’ve had fluctuations in mood for the last three years, which is not a lot but keep in mind that I’m 17. 
During the more elated periods I also experience psychotic symptoms, and I’ve had those same symptoms also during one low period.
I’ve been prescribed the antipsychotic I talked about but they’ve never told me anything about a possible diagnosis, except one therapist who used to say I was bipolar as if it was obvious but never formally diagnosed me.
I am struggling and I wonder if I might need something to keep me from going down as well, maybe a mood stabilizer but I’m not a doctor so I don’t know. Also, I don’t think I can keep taking these laxatives for my constipation because they ruin your intestines’ tissue in the long run, so maybe I should change my antipsychotic?

104,"I always feel like Ben in Parks and Recreation. ""What do I do? What do I . . . what do I DO?"". It's kind of hard for me to even articulate the problem.  But basically my brother is frequently suicidal, does not take care of himself, hates mental health treatments for the most part, and is often unkind.  I have poured in massive amounts of time and energy into trying to help over the years, and it has not paid off at all.  I would say that relationship is a big part of what took me from being the happiest I'd ever been to now probably mildly to moderately depressed.  He calls me and yells at me that he needs help, and why aren't I helping him, and says he's going to kill himself.  But he won't say what help he needs, or when he does, it's either something I cannot control or something where when he gets it it makes no difference to his mental health anyway.  Sometimes he has been actually on the phone about to jump off a bridge.  Sometimes I call the police and he is held overnight, and he comes out even more furious at me.  In the town where he used to live I called so often the police told me to stop calling.  Also, he thinks he dies whenever he goes to sleep so he won't do anything that might result in sleep, which adds another level of impossibility to the situation.  I used to spend maybe 2 hours a night to four hours a night talking to him plus driving 8 hours round trip once a week to talk him off a ledge and clean his super unsanitary apartment, but now I have a daughter and I'm down usually to about an hour twice a week.  That doesn't sound too bad, but even talking to him pleasantly makes me extremely stressed out because I've built up such a feeling of hopelessness and panic and anger around him.  And I feel like I can't talk to him about this because it makes him extra suicidal and you're not supposed to tell depressed people they are a burden.  But he is a huge burden and I feel like I can't take it.  

What the hell can I do?  My mother is dead, and my father is getting older and doesn't have the physical health or inclination to deal with this constant crisis.  I have talked to therapists, but they just tell me not to talk to him if he is being like this, and that feels wrong to me.  I don't love my brother anymore.

I noticed I've been doing that a LOT and LOT after me and my mom lost our housing and had to move, I'm thinking it could be a sign of loneliness.

106,"I'm so annoyed seeing people on social media and such throw around mental illnesses so casually.

Everyone makes it seem like they suffer from ""depression, (social) anxiety, mental breakdowns"". They make light of what it truly is and make it seem like it's nothing at all.

I really do want to believe that these people are suffering like they say. But to say stupid shit like if they were making millions of money, they wouldn't be depressed or socially anxious, then chances are the severity of their situation is probably very minor or they're wrongfully self-diagonising themselves and trying to make it seem like they know everything that they're talking about.

Making it seem like it's so easily fixable with money and ""just cheering up"", or forcing yourself to socialize when you have social anxiety and stuff makes it hard to truly see those that are suffering.

Ignorance truly is bliss. Mental illnesses is one of those things that you'll never fully understand unless you've been through it yourself... hence why it's so hard to even explain to people. What's the point in trying to explain something that just can't be fathomed from the outside? I wouldn't want to wish it on anybody. How could someone who's so cheerful and genuinely happy with life believe that there's a life out there where somebody is alive, but not really living? To suffer from being depressed, more so apathetic and anhedonic?  That things in life are dulled to the point of no reward, no satisfaction, no motivation, etc.? It's just not something that's comprehensible from an outside perspective. But I'm not trying to kill nobody's vibe. These are my problems to deal with, why try to bring the mood of others down?

And I don't blame them I suppose... it is what it is. This is just the stigma with mental health, and we just gotta learn to live with it I suppose.

Still, people annoy me. The know-it-alls, the people that offer suggestions (but could mean good intents), the deniers.

110,"Pardon if this is the wrong place for me to ask this question. I have been wondering what’s been “weird” about me for several years and never gotten an answer that helped. I feel like it has to do with my social anxiety.

I’m currently a freshman in college. I have always been fearful of social interaction so I primarily kept to myself all throughout school. When I sought out attention (usually joining other groups) in my early years, my classmates either ignored me or said something rude about my personality. I was the weird girl because I drew cats a lot and hardly spoke. I was confused and basically shrugged it off every time. I started to believe I was a burden to people. The people who I did see as friends never usually paid attention when I spoke. I just wanted friends to hang around others for their company. I never asked for anything, I just wanted people to rely on if I wanted to converse. The rejection of others began to slowly chip away at me that I had a time in my life where I shut down. I was an afterthought in every group I joined. Why did the people I trust not care? Is it because I have a hard time speaking? 
My speech is often made fun of because I “mumble” when I swear what I just said came out crystal clear. 
I stutter and struggle to pronounce words under stress and I find it really embarrassing. When I speak sentences, I sometimes blank out and forget what I was about to say. (This happens often) I do a lot of calls with people online and I get worried that people will see less of me when it happens. I’m really worried about this if it ever comes up during a professional setting. 

Is there something mentally wrong with me or something more? I don’t understand what makes people want to stay away from me. Never once have I gone out to make someone uncomfortable or force a situation on them. I’ve felt so alone for such a long time. I’d get the same answers of “Oh, you should reach out more!” ....when I already do.",01Mar2020,1
111,"Just another day. You wake up, not really sure if the day is really worth abandoning the bed. Okay, you say to yourself, let's give this a try. Maybe, just maybe, today might be different. 

But then there it is again. The lump in your throat. The lightheadedness. The absence of appetite. Suddenly you end up crying. Hyperventilating. Your mind goes overdrive. You feel unworthy. You feel useless. You feel you're never enough.

They say, talk it out to a friend. But reaching out means accusing yourself. You are again bothering someone because you can't get your shit together. So you isolate.

Eventually you will be reminded, that accepting your vulnerability is the first step. You chat a trusted friend, and feel a bit better... Calmer. And hey, you feel okay again, somehow. Then the cycle repeats.

God damn it's so tiring. Having to live like this. That's why I am deeply grateful for communities like this one, because it makes me realize that I am not alone in this fight.

114,"okay now that ive got your attention, i have a million questions. let me start off by saying This is a long, depressing, complicated story involving events that are relevant to my mental health that ive told only some details about to anyone due to thinking it's a burden to hear and also I have no desire for sympathy. I'm honestly just putting this here in case someone happens to stumble upon it and give me their opinion on my story/possibly some HELPFUL advice.. (i try very persistently to NOT need help, so ive got the high functioning thing down to where no one suspects I have any issues besides being ""quiet"") so read at your own risk lol. im a 22 almost 23 yr old woman who's dealt with trauma most of my life. I've always knew i was different and not in a ""Im special and smart"" way Like i was told, but like an ""I am having a terrible time but i have to persevere because this is my life"" kind of way. 

One of my early memories is of me in the winter of 2000 when I was 3, in my dad's truck wearing pink Barbie snow boots and staring down at them while he asked me if I wanted to live with my mom or Aunt M. I said my aunt for whatever reason, and my aunt's house is where I moved. (I wouldve had to move regardless btw, my mother was too poor/had drug, mental health issues to be able to support me.) I was also coerced as a toddler (idr what age, maybe 3-4?) to touch my dad in a guessable area i don't really feel like mentioning specifically. My dad and mom divorced when i was 1yrs old, he then lived in my grandma's house across the street from where I lived at my aunt's for reference. age 7, my dad had been arrested a couple times for stuff I didn't really know too much about at the time, (Mostly drug charges.) also, February 14th of my 7th year my mother died via overdose on crystal meth. I have a memory after this age where i woke up to my dad carrying me outside and dropping to the ground outside in the snow. He had started a fire at my grandmas house and the entire garage was engulfed in flames. not his first fire, he also recently got out of a 10 year sentence (i was like 11 at the time) for manufacturing meth in his house and it exploding.

Almost forgot to mention when i was 10 i started cutting myself and the school counselor called CPS on my aunt. I started going to therapy then stopped. This may have been when she really started fucking up my perception of reality. I was grounded for cutting myself. A 10 year old trauma survivor. I was punished for the most... ridiculous things. I put on a little black eyeliner my friend had on one day as a 13 year old at school, went home and because she had told me a year or two earlier i couldn't wear makeup, she justify taking every single thing out of my room except my literal mattress, 5 days worth of clothes, a sheet and a pillow. I was excited to be able to receive my favorite fucking stretchy spiral keychain i used as a bracelet back. Also got grounded harshly when my aunt saw i had a facebook. It was like the end of the world when i got in trouble. My cousin, however, never received remotely as harsh punishments and was never grounded, though some things he did like drive 3 hours away at 16 years old, went punished with a stern scold and some laughing. 

At 12, i was cutting myself again except way more eagerly (id always look for jagged broken things on the ground to use) and id cut anything, id shred my knuckles, carve stuff right under where my pants rose so no one would see, arms/wrists, my upper thighs ended up being the most used to where i had enough cuts and scars from my hip bones down to the middle of my thighs (still have all the scars) i went to therapy until my therapist switched professions literally, then stopped going. It was more like someone i could just have as a friend. 

Fast Track: 1am, I'm 14 years old. Always been a night owl since it was the only peace and quiet I usually got. Im watching tv and my uncle who, up to this point, had seemed normal enough.. maybe a little more strict but not weird, comes busting into my room and says how he knows what Ive been up to and he knows what I do. Visibly confused, i question him, and he goes on a rant about how he knows i stay up and masturbate. (I had discovered masturbation but definitely was not doing it every night or even on any regular basis at all.) I dont really remember much of what happened next but he eventually left me alone, but i do remember the feeling of crippling fear and confusion. He would begin to come in my room and stand near me by my bed when I was watching tv or playing a game during the day and would obviously be staring at my breasts, which i caught on to and would pull the cover up. This gets much weirder.. i cant and won't name everything he did, some things include: trying to slyly feel my boobs while hugging and asking for hugs all the time (sometimes hed have an erection), putting random sexual objects in my room (a WHIP, a vibrator that looked used, clothespins) which all of, upon discovering, i would immediately take the item and run crying outside and throw it over the fence in the alley behind our house. My aunt caught him looking in my window and had him explain why she had to put a piece of material to cover the open spaces.(relevant because later when i finally told her about it, she didnt believe me and said I would've told her way before if it was true.) i would hear him outside my window jacking off. He told me before i could watch and he wouldnt stop. He tried to make me kneel in front of him. He would come into my room every night towards the end of it (when i was like 16-17 before i moved out) and I would barricade the door and hed still fucking come in there somehow. I fucking cant stand the thought of someone watching me fucking sleep. If i wake up to someone looking at me i will be pissed. I was late for school or overslept so many times due to lack of sleep because of that. Id sleep in class. Looking back, some teachers who didnt say anything Im truly grateful for, I think they may have sensed something was wrong. I told my friends about him and actually detailed events in real time to several people which really should've maybe told their parents or something but whatever.

One week before my 18th birthday, at (deja vu)around 1am. Here it comes, busting into my door. Only this time with a new delusional exclamation. He accused me of raping and molesting HIM completely out of nowhere. He was clearly having some sort of mental malfunction and I will never in my life forget the look in his eyes when i had enough and finally just started SCREAMING at him, At 1 am, while my aunt and cousin are asleep. He was pissed. Never seen anger like that in someones eyes. I however, felt no threat anymore. I hadn't said anything those 4 years due to being the reason i fucked the family up, i was trying to protect them and they crumbled me up and threw me in the garbage. So I'm hysterically sobbing and my aunt comes in and asks what happens and i try my best to tell her about all these things hes done and not being able to even SAY some of the things. He left that night and when i came home from work the next day.. i found out they had for some reason raided my room and found a roach blunt and my aunt went absolutely ballistic on me. Going through my phone and laptop, seeing all the things i tell my friends about wanting to move out. I guess she ""just happened"" to skip over all the detailed encounters i sent friends also.. which was the whole reason for me wanting to move.. she angrily tells me that if I want to move so bad then I need to move out. I pack my shit right then, just for her to tell me ""Oh i cant let you move out until you're legally 18.."" so I suffered another week.. Of being judged, condescended down to, my cousin even told me Id end up like my mother. If they only knew how completely fucked their mindset is...

Ive lived on my own since then and have absolutely zero contact with any of them. 
I worked at target when i first moved but the pay wasn't adequate so i willingly and shamelessly decided to be a stripper. (Side note, but this single decision has led me to meet some of the best people i know now)
I suffer from debilitating, undiagnosed/untreated mental illnesses every single day. I dont want to be on a set medication due to possible side effects and the possibility of something getting increasingly worse, but yet i do self-medicate. I fell into a very deep depression after the honeymoon phase of being free on my own. I think it was the realization of the trauma I've endured possibly. Either way, i had to cut most all social/work interactions and only work friday and Saturday. Sometimes thats even exhausting. Before the depression hit, weed would just make me tired but now i find it to be one of my only joys in this world. I also take a vyvanse (kinda like adderall) when i go to work the two days i even go because Im just so tired. Ive been exhausted my entire life i feel like. I have NO motivation. I dont want to kill myself but i do fantasize about death. I do feel my depression is very slowly but surely getting better. I used to not be able to get out of bed for an entire week. I would only shower when I absolutely had to, i also lost 35 pounds from lack of appetite. i had developed a worsening insomnia and currently still have to smoke before being able to eat or sleep. Btw please understand i only started self medicating with weed after i noticed its positive effects filling almost* exactly what I need to not feel the weight of never ending dread. it gives me slight motivation which is better than none at all. But not enough, and i refuse to let myself take stimulants more than a couple times a week, even though that's the only thing that makes me feel alive and motivated. I have always had; (keep in mind this is self diagnosed but all i do is wonder wtf is wrong with my brain so I research all the time) moderate-severe anxiety. Small and insignificant things such as planning a trip or seeing a doctor seem like a huge obstacle. i try to just mask everything around others to not seem completely out of tune, but have always in a way felt that anxiety and depression have been present. In 4th grade i recall hearing a teacher telling my aunt about how she thought I have symptoms of anxiety and my aunt just ignored it. She always just simple-mindedly blamed it on my mom dying at a young age and thats it.

I've always felt like something was wrong with me but thought that I was just making things up in order to get attention or something like that. I know that you're not supposted to 'diagnose' yourself by taking tests on the internet but all of those tests actually revealed to me that I might have ADHD. I'm very forgetful, meaning that I can forget something that has been told to me a few minutes ago. I can never finish what I start and it makes me feel like I'm a failure.Sometimes I get super excited about an idea or a task, I think about it for weeks and then, out of the blue, I find it boring and completely stop thinking about it. I easily get distracted, for example I could be painting something and then a new idea pops up in my head and then I start rushing the process of painting just to get it over with. I also can be very moody, my boyfriend actually thinks I have some kind of form of a Bipolar Disorder. Even now, writing this I have so many thought in my head that I don't know how to express them all. Also, I have trouble falling asleep because of the amount of things I think about.   Here's the thing, many of these tests talk about 'poor time managing' but I feel like I'm the opposite of it. I always  start projects on time and finish them at least a week earlier. I'm never late and always too early. It might have to do something with my anxiety but I just feel lost at this point. Can anyone tell if I should take this situation of mine more seriously?

He and mum started arguing (what else is new) and he shouted a lot, more than mum even though he doesn’t understand that his voice is louder. I don’t know how to explain this but I was sort of trembling and just holding my head in my hands facing away from him and I really gasped when he snatched my phone from my hands bc I thought he was about to grab me or something. Idk. Then he said I was being ridiculous by clutching my head and being like that or whatever but he told me yesterday that apparently he thought I was being dramatic and apologised. Dunno how he thinks i would be in that situation. I really don’t like loud noises some of the time. I think it’s misophonia but I don’t want to self-diagnose. And yeah, sometimes I feel like I’m stupid for thinking I’m depressed. Idk I feel like I should go to a therapist but I feel like my dad believes the stigma around it, though apparently he is going to look for a psychologist to go to so he can stop being angry for little things.

122,"It has been eleven years.

This is hard to write. The words do not come easily.

As I reflect on how I have changed and grown since that day, I feel both empowered and inadequate. Empowered because I am a survivor, a thriver, a better-every-day-er. And inadequate because it still crosses my mind and cripples me, disorients me, and better-every-day only applies some percentage of the time. 

Some days, I do slip. I slip back to where I was mentally and emotionally on day two, or seven, or 365, or 1,234. It does not equate to much - the momentary backsliding. But it exists, and the mere existence of trauma can be a disability of its own right.

Some nights, I still awaken in a terror thinking no time has passed at all. Some days, I feel like I cannot breathe, cannot speak, cannot exist.

But the frequency is on a downward trajectory, on average. It's true that it rears its ugly head more often at times, generally when it's the same time of year as day one. But the slope of the line is angled ever lower, approaching, I hope, an asymptote of zero.

124,"TRIGGER WARNING ⚠️ 
GRAPHIC DESCRIPTION OF RAPE + INTENSE EMOTIONS

when I was 17, I was raped vaginally, anally, and orally over and over again for about 3 hours. I was a virgin saving myself for marriage and had never been kissed before. I have healed so much in the past 10 years... which I think is why repressed memories are starting to resurface.

the other day, an absolutely horrific memory suddenly came back. as he brutally raped me orally after he had raped me several times, he told me over and over, “you’re a slut. you’re a whore.” he also forced me to repeat it and say, “I’m a slut. I’m a whore.” when I had this flashback, it was like I could feel the filth, the disgust, the self-hatred, the shame all over again. 

for so many years, deep down I have felt like a slut and whore because of what he did to me and forced me to do. that he ruined me and made me a whore. he knew I was a virgin and I believe that his goal that night was to make me feel that way. he told me, “no one will ever want you after I’m done with you”

the emotional pain is resurfacing. so much shame. it’s unbearable. his words echoing in my head as he raped me repeatedly in every way possible. “you’re a slut. you’re a whore.”

128,"**\[I mention the names of a few apps and online services. It is by no means an endorsement\]**

Roughly 1 out of every 4 Americans suffer from some kind of mental health issue. However, taking care of mental health issues like depression and anxiety takes a sustained investment of time, money, and sometimes meeting multiple therapists. Not everyone has the necessary insurance coverage or financial resources to access or afford individual therapy from mental health professionals whose rates range anywhere from $150 - $200 per session. I personally know of several people that have faced these challenges and read quite a few posts made on Reddit and other online forums about the same. Fortunately, there are alternatives that might fit better within the budgets of financially strapped folks. Let’s look at some of them.

Mental Health Apps and online therapy ($$$)

Just about everyone has a smartphone and many use them to download games and apps for entertainment and learning purposes. One area where apps have made significant inroads is in the health and wellness space including mental health. Mindfulness and meditation apps like [Calm](https://www.calm.com/) and [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) have become quite popular but they do come with a steep annual fee putting them out of reach for many. Besides apps, online therapy sites like BetterHelp and TalkSpace have become quite popular. These companies offer subscriptions anywhere from $50-$100/week which allows one to text or chat with a therapist at any time. Some even offer telehealth which is very convenient for folks that cannot travel or do not have access to therapists where they live.

Therapists that charge on a sliding scale ($$)

It may sound unusual and also surprising to some that there are therapists out there that will charge a fee based on your income hence the term sliding scale. The best way to find a therapist that has a sliding scale is to check out their website or simply call their office and ask. You can also check out organizations like [**OpenPath Psychotherapy Collective**](https://openpathcollective.org/) which provides affordable, in-office and online psychotherapy sessions between $30 and $60 (between $30 and $80 for couples &amp; family sessions). They do however charge a one-time fee of $59 that gives you access to licensed therapists at these reduced rates as long as you can show a financial need.

Free or low-income mental health services ($)

Low-fee or free community mental health clinics are a great option for those that don’t have health insurance and/or are unable to pay out-of-pocket for the mental healthcare they need. These clinics are usually run by charities that may be associated with [**large religious**](https://www.archindy.org/cc/bloomington/programs-mental.html) or public health nonprofit organizations. They provide a wide range of services including individual and family counseling, medication management, and drug addiction counseling. They’re also equipped to treat a wide range of psychological concerns, like depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. These clinics are staffed by psychotherapists and psychologists, and also employ psychologists, mental health counselors, and social workers that are still in training. Your local public library or NAMI chapter should be able to provide you more information on how to locate these services.

Crisis and suicide prevention hotlines

Mental health emergencies like [suicidal thoughts require](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/) immediate psychiatric care and attention. Hotlines staffed by trained volunteers and professionals can be called 24/7 and are able to provide emotional support and can usually help locate the necessary assistance.

Local support groups ($)

Support Group can be defined as any group of people that meets regularly to support one another through a difficult time or issue that can be considered a support group. Many are aware of Addiction support groups, however, there are groups for all kinds of issues and illnesses such as depression, PTSD, victims of domestic violence, and people with sick parents or children for example.

Support Groups by nature are very flexible and work around the schedules of participating members. There are very expectations around regular attendance or time commitment. The composition of the groups can vary from meeting to meeting and the topics may be very different from week to week. There are no special qualifications or training required to facilitate a Support group. They may participate but mostly take care of keeping the group organized and keep the discussion moving forward in a positive direction. The power of Support Groups is really quite simple - it shows people that they are not alone in their struggles and learning from other people who have had similar experiences on how to cope and keep moving forward in their own lives can be quite powerful and effective. Some support groups like AA are usually free or charge a small fee to cover for administration costs.",01Mar2020,1

I’m a 19 year old guy but I have to constantly stop myself from throwing temper tantrums when I’m alone in my car because of past events and just self hatred in general.  I think I have a fear of abandonment and a lack of object permanence, which doesn’t make relationships easy at all for obvious reasons. It makes me controlling when in reality I know there’s no reason to be, but I haven’t been able to stop it over the past 4-5 years.

132,"My husband had a rough childhood,  which involved being dropped off at a boy's home with his younger brother when he was 8.  It also involved a lot of family counseling which didn't help reunification because his father is a narcissist and wouldn't pay enough child support so his mother could afford to raise him and his brother.  His mother also, after her divorce from his father, put her significant others before my husband.   There's one instance which he keeps bringing up, where he was out and needed a ride home, his mother pulled up to talk to him, and she refused to give him a ride home because she had to get home to her girlfriend.   His mom is bi.  

In my 20+ years with him, his issues with things from his childhood have become more problematic.   He refuses to go to therapy to deal with these things.  He still has nightmares several times a week where he wakes me up because he's yelling at his parents. This has gone on the last 25 years.  And, our 13 year old daughter us battling anxiety and depression and she and her dad have a tumultuous relationship.  She thinks he hates her.  She has sensitivity issues-mostly with loud noises. If I even raise my voice a little, it's like yelling to her.  She has expressed suicidal tendencies. 

I want my husband to go to therapy with her to try and understand what she's going through and work things out.  I even gave him an ultimatum to go to therapy or move out.  He said he'd rather leave.  He is the one who triggers her suicidal episodes, so that's why I want him to go.  I already go and meet with her therapist.   He says she's being a drama queen and this is all for attention.  She has said that she has tried to strangle herself and suffocate herself. I don't know if that's true. 

I am at a loss of what to do.  I feel like I can't reprimand my daughter even a little without her blowing up over it.  I have to be able to be a parent and not let her do whatever the Hell she wants.  Is it possible my husband has had trauma related to therapy and that's why he's so resistant to it?  He is taking antidepressants and antianxiety meds plus adderall.

Any input would be helpful at this point.  I am going back to my therapist to see if she can help me sort this out.  I am seriously looking at ending my 22 year marriage over this.  I am also going through treatment for breast cancer and will be starting radiation at the end of the month.  My life is kinda shit right now.",01Mar2020,1
133,"So a few years ago I made a friend over discord whom I have been talking to ever since. We have never met in person as we live in different countries. I am about a year older than them and a few months ago they tried to commit suicide. Before this we had often had long talks about depression and suicide, and from what I’ve gathered from them their parents are quite neglectful, and are in a pretty bad environment at home. Almost always I had to try and convince them things would get better and that suicide was not the answer. Despite being hospitalised and undergoing therapy since their failed attempt they still feel the same and their parents don’t seem to be any better. I have constantly been trying to convince them to hang on a little longer, to see the therapy through, but I’ve just found out they have decided a date to do it. I feel like I am unfit to support them and that I am the only one doing anything to stop them from committing suicide.

Sometimes they’re just talking to each other, whispering, gossiping or just chatting as if they’re in some party/club scene.

Today I made the decision to cut off my father. He is the true source of all of my problems, including my depression and anger issues. He has a psychological effect on my brain that no one other human being is capable of. He makes it impossible for me to voice my issues when we're in an argument, leading him to believe that I'm so far gone and a baby. He has said some of the most unspeakably horrible things to me, the most recent time being when my car broke down on a very busy major road in a dangerous area. I don't know enough about cars to find and fix the problem. People were screaming and honking at me, I was absolutely terrified. My father is the only parent I have down here as my mom fled to NY after he cheated on her for 20 years then divorced HER. So I call him in desperate need of help and support, and he starts screaming at me, telling me to shut up and that I'm ""getting him in trouble"" by leaving and coming to help me. I was already so terrified, and the feeling of my own father screaming at me to shut up and that I'm ""acting like a girl"" was so unbelievably heartbreaking. I just let him yell. He shows up, I immediately start thanking him, he says ""shut up, get in the car"". We push the car out of the way, I thank him again and he tells me I'm a bitch and not a real man. I say ""I thought my father would be the most supportive person to contact in this situation"" and he again tells me to shut up and that I'm a pussy. Sounds like I'm joking huh? That's how ridiculous he is. Today, I voiced my displeasure about how he talked to me that night, and he took my fucking car from me. My CAR. Now I have no way to and from work, and I'm likely gonna get kicked out of my apartment because I was recently unfairly terminated and can't pay rent. He knew I was in a bad spot too, and he just blatantly made it worse. I feel so lost and defeated. Why does he have to treat me like this?

He was recently kicked out of his apartment and while he has been able to keep a fairly successful sales job, I worry that his career will become the next casualty.  In his latest impulsive decision, he purchased a gun, which prompted increased alarm from me and his other friend. I don’t believe he is a danger to society, but he surely could be a danger to himself if his mood abruptly turns (as it often does).

I’ve got so many voices inside my head,
my Schizophrenia’s keeping them fed,
I’m starting to feel lost within myself,
think I’m turning into someone else.


I’m always planning my escape,
before my brain can escalate.

“I can’t find it,
where’s the door?
I don’t think we’ve been here before.”


Fight or flight is kicking in,
I can feel it in my skin.
My heart is pounding through my chest,
what is this?
I feel possessed.


“They’re out to get you,
stay at home,
you know it’s best to leave them alone.”

I can feel the panic taking over,
struggle keeping my composure,
start to shake uncontrollably,
I think the demons got ahold of me.


I’ve tried to drown them out,
but my head is in a drought,
my mind goes blank,
I’m in a daze,
somehow my body operates.


What was that?
I heard the door.

“Maybe you should go explore.” 

The hallucinations are back again,
no one’s there,
there had never been.


It’s okay,
I’m not crazy,
things are just a little hazy.

“Who are you kidding?
You’re so deranged,
stop walking around like anything’s changed!”

but these voices are getting so loud,
they push me down,
to the ground,
I think I hear them laughing now. 

What’s so funny?

“It’s a game,
if you want to win you’ve got to play,
so pick a card and roll the dice,
Maybe tomorrow we’ll be nice.”

I picked a card,
they flipped The Fool,
I guess that means I’m just a tool,
a vessel meant for them to rule.
Which means tomorrow they’ll still be here,
emphasizing my every fear.

“Just close your eyes,
and relinquish your mind,
it’s time for you to say goodbye,
put that gun to your head,
we’ll be gone once your mind is dead.”

I’ve got the gun,
now there’s one in the chamber,
but let me leave you with this one disclaimer.

When I pulled the trigger,
my body collapsed,
then somewhere between life and death overlapped,
and my demons found their way through the cracks.

F(17) I honestly don’t even know what I’m trying to achieve by writing this post but I don’t know how to help myself. I think I have anxiety and depression, and some sort of CPTSD. (I know it’s not right to self-diagnose but I’m not saying this lightly). 

I’m constantly in a state of mind where I overthink everything and make my “depression” worse by degrading myself and my actions. I have extremely low self confidence and compare myself to others everyday, undermining my achievements/intelligence/hard work. I’m always reminded by my classmates that I’m extremely smart but I just don’t agree with them. (Please don’t take this as bragging, I am being genuine.) I’m simply good at beating the curriculum but I don’t feel a sense of real intelligence. 
I mispronounced a word a few days ago in class and I am 100% positive that no one noticed and I keep telling myself that but the scenario keeps replaying in my head. This is a more minuscule example of something that clouds my mind but the most recent one. I could go on and on about which issues have occupied my mind for days on end but I think you get the point. I cry myself to sleep every night and it’s almost like an automatic response to let out all the sadness inside of my body. It’s not a wailing type of crying, I’m completely silent and I simply let my tears roll down and soak my pillow. 

I’m nearly sure I have anxiety because of the racing thoughts in my mind and I’m careful of what I say because I’m afraid of being ridiculed. I make an effort everyday at school to say only what I think will receive a good response (laughter, approval, etc.) I revise everything before I say it and play possible scenarios in my head and my mind reminds me without fail what happened that last time I tried to make a joke. I don’t feel a real connection with any of my friends but I do like them. However, I wouldn’t miss any of them and I don’t make efforts to get to know them better and certainly do not tell them about my mental state. I never tell anybody about what goes on in my mind because it always comes out sounding like I’m making excuses to be sad. But then I think about how shitty everyone’s life must be if they’re going through the same thing as me. I don’t know, it just doesn’t seem normal but what if I’m just being over-dramatic?

That’s not nearly half of what I want to say but I don’t want to bore you guys. Any idea on what to do in my situation?

Since around November, the majority of days I've been feeling pretty sad for no reason and not like myself. Though, two months ago I got this game and I got into the fandom and become completely addicted to it. There were so many videos and things to watch, and it really helped distract me during those off days. Whenever I would feel depressed I would think about this fandom and it would instantly cheer me up. I can't think of another fandom or game that's made me this happy in years.

The past couple weeks or so, though, I've found myself not as interested. I am craving that excited feeling but I am rarely getting it anymore from watching the videos about the game, or reading fan fiction, or even playing it sometimes. I'm trying so hard to make myself feel the same way I was feeling about it before but I keep feeling like I've overloaded my brain too much with the game and now I have nothing left to watch or see about it that will make me interested.

I heard that if I become interested in something else then come back it will be interesting to me again, but I really don't have any motivation to become interested in something else. Not only that, but like I said this game has made me so happy lately that I don't want to let go, even if it's not as fun now as it was. I just want to be excited about this specific game and fandom again, but I don't know how. Is there anything I can do?",01Mar2020,1

166,"So I am a rising junior in college. I am a very quiet and isolated person and have very limited friends. Freshmen year while everyone was off making friends and doing fun things, I was always doing my own thing and being isolated and staying in my room. I have always been really shy, and doing new things gives me a lot of anxiety, so I always avoided social situations instead of fighting the anxiety. I did a lot of stupid things freshmen year and I was just always quiet so the people on my floor didn't talk to me much either. The few friends I did make, we just did not get along very well in the end. I did make a close friend who introduced me to all the cool and crazy things and I realized that I actually enjoyed doing fun and new things, even though I may be uncomfortable at first.

So now fast forward to present day, I have a very bad relationship with my suitemates and we do not get along and my roommate who is my close friend is never in the room so I barely, if ever, see her. I really only have probably three friends total. Now I have sort of come to the realization that I need to change something about myself, be more outgoing and open to new things and battle the anxiety that I get instead of avoiding it. I don't want people to be stuck with that bad impression of me from freshmen year because I have learned and grown since then and learned from my mistakes. However my concern is that is it too late? By now people already have their friend groups set and I feel like they wouldn't wanna include more people in their friend groups. Has anyone been in a similar situation and can give tips on where to start? And on how to battle this social anxiety and shyness that I get? Any help or tips would be appreciated :)

This is honestly really starting to affect my mental health because I constantly feel anxious, I think oh am I stuck like this forever? Will I ever grow out of this phase in my life and make lifelong friends? Sometimes it really just makes me feel like I can't do anything in my life and I am just stuck with people having bad impressions of me or spreading rumors and I just wish someone could help me out or give me tips on how I can handle this. I feel so alone and it's making me feel so depressed and anxious everyday.",01Mar2020,1

168,"I believe I am an empath and am very sensitive to the reactions of other people. I've learned to be present overtime, but later on, when I am alone, I tend to overthink situations. I have always faced a good deal of social anxiety throughout my life, but I think I know how to conceal it well. 

Over the years, I've been thankful enough to have both my parents and a loving sister. My family has been there for me. They are sometimes overprotective, but overall, I am allowed to be independent and have never been controlled or forced to do anything. My parents always gave me the freedom to make my own choices. 

I also used to have a childhood best friend, and she was some times manipulative, but I never thought of myself as the type to get stepped over. I guess growing up, I did have many fall outs with my so called "" best-friends"" and was kinda bullied by my 1st grade friends group, but nothing serious. I remember spending days on the playground alone and feeling upset about it.  Always feeling abandoned by my previous ""best friends"" the next year. Eventually, I also fell out with my childhood best friend and we ""broke up"". It was pretty painful for me. 

Following that, in college, I had a few fall outs with other friends due to drama, and now...I don't really get too close to people. I enjoy their company, spend time with them, and have fun - but I feel that they don't know the real me. We also don't hang out that often for me to call them a close friend. These days I feel hyper sensitive when people don't respond to me, or they blow me off. I feel so hurt and alone, even when I have my family here with me. 

A couple years ago, I started talking to some guy online, and when I met him he wasn't what I expected. He showed me narcisstic behavior, and couldn't tolerate it. So I cut him off. I still feel like the abandoned one though. I keep crying over him and feeling upset, when he was just a jerk to me. There is nothing to like about him, but I keep wishing I could get that close to someone again. It doesn't seem to happen. All of this just makes me hopeless.",01Mar2020,1

Im average build, fairly tall, been told im good looking but dont see it and I have decent social skills and know how to dress.

But, I just feel like I’m worthless all the time.  I put far too much emphasis on what people think of me and I seek their approval to determine my worth.  So,  how do I learn to like myself?  Do I try and meet my high expectations for where I should be?  Do I lower them and become more content?  Do I ignore all that and just go out and try to enjoy life?

172,"Hi, I am a high school student in an extremely competitive county (aka if you have below a 4.2 gpa and 1450 SAT you are considered stupid which is a whole other problem but not the point of this). Despite this, I have never really gotten too stressed or had a mental breakdown or anything of the sort and I’ve always felt that I‘be been pretty stable and happy in terms of mental health. However, two weeks ago my grandmother died, which completely shook me to the core. I’m not even sure why because we weren’t that close but it shattered me. As a preface, I never cry and I’m the person that my friends come to for emotional support, but for the past two weeks I’ve had no motivation to do any work and I cry every other day. I am a straight A student and I have my SAT coming up in a couple of weeks, but because of this, I can’t concentrate and I just don’t know what to do. My grades are dropping and I put on a front at school because I don’t really know why but I don’t want my friends to know. I guess I just don’t want their pity because if anyone hugs me and says I’m so sorry I will instantly burst into tears. I just don’t know what to do. I talked to two of my teachers and they are both amazing to talk to and offered to give me on extensions with whatever I need, but I feel like since I’m barely doing any work, I shouldn’t get even more behind on my assessments and work by taking those extensions.

175,"I can’t  seem to get over my ex girlfriend no matter how hard I try. We went out for about a month and broke up seven months ago. Everyone I talk to says it’s ok that I’m still not over it but let’s be honest, that’s not normal for the length of time involved. I still look at her Instagram almost daily and last night I got so sad that I drank alcohol to try and feel better. I’m so ashamed of that and I don’t want it to become a habit. I’m 18. This has been plaguing me for the last seven months and I just don’t know what to do, it makes me feel so small. Any advice you can give would be so very appreciated. Ever since we broke up I’ve been going through the worst mental health battle of my life, felt suicidal a few times and been depressed more times than I can count. I see a therapist every two weeks but I’m too embarrassed to admit to her how much I’m not over this. I seemed to be making progress and I don’t want her to think I’m some kind of stalker or weirdo because I’m not. I’m just a kid that went through his first break up and just can’t deal with it.

180,"i'll start off by saying that there is nothing in my life i'd say was a traumatic experience. i come from a military background in life, and thus, grew up without a father figure as he was deployed during my early childhood. 

&amp;#x200B;

i've always had an interest in odd things, not the normal playful kid. i'd stick around in the classroom when everyone else went outside and spend time exploring imaginary concepts in my head. this obviously reflected on my relationship with my father, as he felt as if i were antisocial. both of my parents were always very critical of my grades throughout my education, if i brought back home anything less than an A, i'd be told off because 'it is not my maximum potential'.

&amp;#x200B;

eventually we packed up our bags and moved, leaving behind our old life and starting anew in a new country. i slowly found myself growing more and more careless about school, and no matter how hard i were to be grounded, i really had no reason to bother improving.

&amp;#x200B;

shortly after, we moved yet again, to a bigger city. i left behind my friends and my first serious relationship. slowly i plummeted into ""depression"" as an angsty teenager and didn't bother socializing. my toxicity and selfishness caused the relationship i had to fall apart, for the better, thank god. i slowly discovered how substances like alcohol can act as vices for whatever i was feeling during the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

relatively shortly after me graduating my second to last year of high school, we moved again. i discovered marijuana and i've been using it to relax my mind ever since the mid-term of my last year at high school. that being said, i didn't do it all too often due to lack of money, and my parents not letting me go out and find a job of my own, saying that my studies should be a priority.

&amp;#x200B;

fast forward to the end of the school year, i've graduated (barely) and i didn't bother showing up to the graduation ceremony. we decided to move yet again, to a small city where tuition fees for university would be much cheaper.

&amp;#x200B;

i really had no motivation to enroll to university, but i was forced into it regardless. i am studying a subject that i should enjoy, considering my hobbies and my background. hell, i even picked subjects that i'm somewhat remotely interested in. i haven't made any friends since the start of my bachelor's degree, and i don't feel like there is that many options here for me to meet people. sure, i can try the bar, but i'm not in the mood for continuous one-night stands nor do i feel like i am capable of managing, or even deserving of a relationship. even if i do try to just meet new people to hang out with, i can't due to lack of money. and yes, i still get cockblocked from getting a job.

&amp;#x200B;

lately, it's gotten a lot worse. i can no longer focus in class, i can no longer focus on my hobbies. even if i stop smoking marijuana (which is the only substance that i consistently abuse), it doesn't improve by much. i've taken numerous breaks and even reduced how much i am using in an attempt to taper off completely but to no avail.

&amp;#x200B;

currently my daily routine consists of at least two panic attacks (on the way to, and back from university), procrastination and sleep. i have an amazing opportunity to start life right at 18 and build a safe future for myself, but i am unable to take it due to my lack of focus and motivation.

&amp;#x200B;

my main issue is the blissful ignorance everyone in my family is embracing, throughout the years. i've not once been shy to talk about my problems with them, they're my family for god's sake, right? i love them with all my heart and i'm pretty sure they have no bad intentions either. but whenever i do bring up my issues, it falls off as me ""making excuses for problems that aren't real"". for the last four years this has been the norm for me, and i've realized that asking them for help or even attempting to talk about my issues will lead to nothing productive.

&amp;#x200B;

i've booked an appointment with my general practitioner this week, so hopefully something useful surfaces from that. i do feel like i am wasting their time, maybe this is all in my head and i should let real people with real problems get help instead of wasting everyone's time.

&amp;#x200B;

i'm just unable to tell what's my problem? why am i depressed / anxious / whatever? am i even experiencing problems with my mental health? or am i just being a lazy fuck looking for an excuse out of life

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr:

my parents have high standards and dad is ex-military. moved about four times in the span of four years. don't care about how well/bad i do in my education anymore. unable to focus on hobbies i used to enjoy. family doesn't seem to give a shit about my issues, still love them to death. booked an appointment with doc. what do?",01Mar2020,1
181,"I just feel like I have no idea what's going on with my head and I can never tell if I actually have symptoms or not.

Thought I had depression in high school. Got diagnosed with depression anxiety. Meds didn't help. Had mood swings. Therapist noticed me talking fast (I was excited about a new pet snake, idk I feel like everyone talks fast when they are excited) my thoughts were racing and I had lots of energy and hyperfocus. I thought I was on the autism spectrum because I stim a lot. Therapist thought I had bipolar. Primary care thought I had ADHD. Got diagnosed with adhd and bipolar by psych. 

Was later hospitalised and diagnosed with ADHD bipolar borderline personality eating disorder social anxiety and probably more I can't remember.

Just all of these illnesses have so much symptom overlap and I feel like I have a lot of symptoms from all of them, but am also missing key symptoms for all of them.

182,"Hey folks.

Im a tough man. Just wanted to admit for the first time ive spent the last month on the knife edge of crying without realising why but more importantly being unable to cry. I havent cried in years.

Im currently suffering from insomnia (never thought that would happen) searching my soul to finally turn my brain off and sleep. The answer seems to be that im striving for unrealistic expectations of what i want. Plus noisy neighbours.

That comes from the internet and the instant access to standards i will never meet. The perfect post of 55 deleted photos, the lack of willingness to show vulnerability. Im old fashioned but having a phone eats away at my curiosity and raises my expectations of real people. Its unfair on all of us. 

Collectively we are dealing with a 'rising' standard we will never meet because were too scared to recognise it for what it is.

Even being aware of this i still i cant cry and i know as soon as i do and let go for the first time in along while ill sleep like a baby. Ye i still cant let go.

Please set your own goals and sometimes realise that if you open a box (whether it be a new kink or jealousy or inferiority) it will never be closed and you cant impose that on somebody else. Its unfair, imoral and cheap.

Not long ago you died of war before you laid with a woman or had children. We have too much time but its your time and the more you define yourself with half arsed curious browsing you giving in to something youll never achieve.
