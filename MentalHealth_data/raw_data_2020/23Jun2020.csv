0,"so i daydream A LOT which i would say is normal for most people but i also tend to randomly zone out and i even zone out when people talk to me and it happens very often. an example is one time my step mom was giving me instructions on a certain way she wanted the bathroom arranged and cleaned and i just zoned out and i have no idea what she said and then she as asked did you get all that? (i think my family kind of knows this habit of mine so they always make sure they know if i was listening) i replied with something like no could you explain again and she explained AND I ZONED OUT AGAIN and i just told her i understood and managed to clean the bathroom somehow(this happens very often even during my counseling sessions i do this lol). another thing i do if i’m not daydreaming something random is i imagine i’m talking to strangers i see or my friends(it’s usually my friends i imagine most of the time) but it’s kinda weird: if i’m in my room i will randomly sit up and pretend a friend of mine is across from me and i literally start moving my hands and moving my mouth like i’m talking to them and when i’m in public i try not to do this but sometimes i move my head or eyes weirdly because i’m imagining i’m talking to someone (no one has ever pointed it out tho so i think it’s pretty subtle) lastly, sometimes i lose focus and just stare at things literally as i was typing this multiple times i just decided to stare at my TV which is literally not turned on rn and i started staring at my cat who is asleep. does anyone know if this is normal or maybe some kind of adhd? i do plan on bringing this up to my counselor but i won’t see her for awhile it’s bugging me that i don’t know why.",23Jun2020,1

2,"Hi, I'm an 18 yeard old boy (man?), I haven't been able to sleep properly since I was 14, sometimes it gets better, some other it's worse, I remember a time when I would see horrible disturbing things when I closed my eyes but only before bed, never during the day.

I have experienced what I consider to be the worst kind of loneliness, feeling lonely even when you know your parents love you ( on their own special way).

Relating to others has always been hard, I can't truly say I've had real friends because they always seem to be arround to get something out of me.

I've never had a girlfriend, never kissed a girl, I don't even think I've touch a woman who's not part of my family. Of course I've been attracted by some girls, I've even ""tried"" to get something with them but  I've failed every time, it always seems like I'm not good enough or I came too late, whenever a girl said no I walked away and stopped trying, didn't want to bother anymore nor being the creepy guy who stalks the girl.

I feel so lonely because I came to the conclusion that there's no one like me, not even alike, believe me I've been to many places, all with diferent kinds of people and yet I can't find someone remotely close.

I'm about to start my second year in college, I always tought everything would get better with college but it's still the same.

I tend to handle things usually by myself but the current worldwide situation has done nothing but making this problems worse , so here I am, asking for help to anyone who reads this. I don't even know what kind of help I want but I can't live like this anymore, I don't want to feel like this anymore.",23Jun2020,4

13,"As the Netflix show is renewed and airs its fourth season, I wish someone would say what I feel mutually about the damage and the benefits of this series. I believe, as someone who has been through more mental trauma than I can say, that this series wrongly gives viewers who don’t suffer with this degree of mental health the impression that they understand what it’s like to feel/be suicidal or depressed. I believe that Hannah baker can make some immature minds believe that suicide is the best way to gain attention from those who don’t notice your struggles, I believe that hannah’s behaviour stands for the opposite. I disagree that she should represent the true repercussions of suicide. The attention factor is infuriating for those who feel suicidal for true and valid reasons. I know that a person who is suicidal (like I myself am/ and have been) is suicidal for more than simply gaining recognition. I think this show triggers people that never thought they could be triggered, and it makes people that don’t understand what it’s like to be mentally ill feel as if they understand it. You cannot understand the true feeling of being mentally ill by watching Hannah Baker leave tapes and kill herself believing that when she is dead people’s lives will revolve around her. I believe it is wrong to make suicidal ideation a common ground among those who have never truly felt it before. Just my Experiance with the darkest mental health issues talking.",23Jun2020,3

21,"I can’t cope. I feel like I’m running on empty and I’m just always horribly depressed. I have depression, PTSD and OCD and they are making my life hell. My OCD compulsions are ruling my life, the PTSD is disrupting my sleep and filling my head with disgusting memories and flashbacks and the depression is just... there. All the time. It’s suffocating. The only break I get is when I drug myself to sleep. 

The only way I can see to get it all to stop is suicide, and the idea is so intrusive. I can’t drive to the store without thinking of crashing my car, or take my meds without seriously considering taking them all, or self harm without thinking of going further. It’s not even that I necessarily want to die, I just don’t see a way where I can live and be okay, but I’m scared I’ll fail again and make things worse or end up stuck back in hospital again. 

I have tried dozens and dozens of combinations of medications, I’ve been in therapy, I’ve had multiple rounds of different kinds of TMS, I can’t have ECT due to a heart condition. I spent the first 5 months of the year in a psychiatric hospital and it achieved nothing other than not letting me die. This is not how I want to live my life, dreading waking up every morning and hating who I am. It’s been so hard for so long, and it’s just getting worse. Every day is a little harder than the day before, I have to push myself to breaking just to achieve the bare minimum. I can’t work, I have no hobbies. I just exist and it’s painful.

22,"So, I don’t know what this feeling is, but it’s so strange. I know I’m about to sound very “out there” with this, but I haven’t been able to really explain to anyone how I feel. 

For most of my young adult life (I am 24-ish) I have felt like the “me” from the past lives inside my body but doesn’t get to pilot it. Whoever I am now actually stole me-from-the-past’s body from her and is now masquerading as her, holding onto her memories. 

I get very sad because these memories are so lovely but I will never get to experience anything like them. This makes me very jealous of the “real” me, who is forced to stay quiet and dormant in my head. Sometimes she tries to get out by scratching at my skin, and I so desperately want to let her take over the body again. I don’t even want to be here, I want to give it back to her. But I don’t know how. 

All that being said, I know I sound absolutely bonkers. I’m afraid to tell my therapist about this for fear that I’ll be sent to a mental health institution and I’ll have to miss this upcoming semester of grad school.

23,"Hello everyone. 

For the past week, I feel like I hit a huge wall. I usually have this routine to wake up everyday at 6:30am, wash my face, journal in my daily planner, make a to do list, brew up some coffee, and then for the rest of the day I work on getting all my tasks done for the day. I’ll even incorporate running in the morning before my tasks as well and I’ll walk my dog in between tasks so I don’t feel too cramped up inside. 

I don’t know what happened. About a week or so ago, all my motivation just left. 

I can barely get out of bed, I struggle with making food for myself, I spend hours on end on my phone watching YouTube videos or movies and when I try to do my school work I feel this huge amount of annoyance. It feels like so much more work to do the things I was already doing during my 6 week summer school course. 

Right now I’m left thinking: What happened? Why am I feeling so drained? I’m not even enjoying school or anything anymore. 

All I can really do right now are simple things like brushing my teeth and washing the dishes but even then it feels like going over a mental hurdle to do so. 

I don’t want to do badly in my classes that I’ve been working so hard on but right now it feels like I’m in this blocked off state where I can’t focus on anything or even have the desire to do anything except lay in my bed and sleep.

I'll other keep quiet and not do anything, or most of the time I'll cry and slap or punch myself very hard. Needless to say I dont vent it visibly.

But on the day of her recent outburst, Idk why but I was fuming. I went into my room, locked it and I just went into this really psychotic rage. I couldn't describe it. I was screaming and throwing things around and saying things like just kill me and you dont need to have a child like me.

I confided in a family member. I said I was scared of her when she slam things around and it affects me. This family member talked to my mom. And guess what? My mom said it's the other way round, she's scared of me when I slammed things around.

32,"Hello, \*swear warnings\*

This is my first time on reddit, and unfortunately I'm not on here as a shit poster or to find memes. I'm on here because as of right now I feel completely and totally alone in life. I'm a recovering addict who got out of rehab over a year ago. I worked my steps and helped others work theirs. Recently I relapsed but ended up kicking it before it grabbed a total hold over me. Where I worked my steps was in a sober living. There I had friends and people who understood pain on a spiritual level. However, that sober living got shut down and I was forced to move back to parents house. I'm in my late 20's going to college. This is the issue though, In rehab they say drug addiction is a symptom of a problem. A disease that manifests itself because of certain things that have happened or a person lacks. I just so happened to have a horrible childhood. I was molested on 3 separate occasions when i was between 7-9 years old. One of which is a family member that I currently live with. After he did what he did he would commence to call me a F\*\*\*OT and a ""pussy ass bitch"" up until he could not anymore due to my age. These experiences and others left me with complex PTSD and major issues with depression, anxiety, identity, and panic.

My parents didn't know about this until I was 18 and when I told them my mother just pushed it out of her head and my father didn't believe me. I still don't think he does to this day. By the time I was an adult I was already using drugs heavy. Specifically opioids and benzos. I've always felt I could not trust anybody and those that I did trust didn't protect me when I needed it most. After many suicide attempts and mental hospital visits I decided to finally go to rehab. When I was away at rehab the family member who did this to me got out of prison and my parents gave him my room to sleep in. ""Assuring"" me it was only temporary. Backing up, the family member in question has always been the scapegoat of the family dynamics. He started getting in trouble with the law at 16 and was in and out of prison his entire life. On more than one occasion he wished my mother dead from cancer and threatened to kill us if he was kicked out. He cooked crack and sold drugs his entire life.  To be completely frank he is the definition of a terrorist. He's an abusive person with severe control issues and that control is held on to with fear. That hasn't changed to this date. He still acts this way and I'm stuck with no money living in my nieces room because he still has mine.

Lately, I've been thinking about suicide a lot. I relapsed but after working the 12 steps drugs don't do it for me anymore so I kicked them. They say it ruins getting high and they are correct in my experience. My brother has been raising hell lately because he married this woman for her inheritance. He even locked it in with a child. But because they are drug addicts themselves that money has been spent and he takes no responsibility. Just the sound of his raised voice makes me physically ill due to the PTSD. I can't get a break I have no where to go. I have literally no friends because they were all my drug buddies and I have irrational fear of meeting new people. I've been stuck in a room unable to leave because of the monopoly his energy has over this house. Keep in my I live with my 2 parents, my niece, him, his wife, and his newborn child. In a house that is 990 SQ FT. 

It builds up resentment in my heart but my anger and rage is only pointed at myself. This is because I've realized that bad people will be bad people and its my responsibility how I decide to respond to their actions. I'm not owed anything in life. I just feel weak. I'm petrified by fear and trauma that i've worked through already. I wake up sick to my stomach every day and fearful. I honestly just want it to end. When I say I have nowhere to go I mean it. I'm penniless and have nobody. My parents just sit there and take the abuse day in and day out without taking any action to get him out. He's on community control also and still sells drugs. I'm just fed up. I want it to end.

I'm having a hard time getting my point across or even describing my situation. I just want to dump this here for anyone to read. I just hope my words, however dark, may reach someone in a similar situation so they can feel like they aren't alone anymore. I love you all. I sincerely do.

33,"I have BPD which explains a lot of my ups and downs but havent had much professional support about it and am experiencing a lot of things to the point where I’m worried there’s something else. They are as follows: (apologies about the formatting but this seemed the easiest)

- Feeling complete disconnection from/negative feelings about someone I genuinely care for 

- Going as far as to attack those people verbally even though they have done nothing wrong for some perceived slight

- Connecting with people I really don’t like and disagree with just fine (at certain times)

- Not remembering significant portions or my life especially interactions with people or rash decisions like taking pills drinking a lot etc

- Talking about/thinking about/enjoying things I find repulsive at other times 

- Feeling like I’m in a extremely different mindset sometimes even within the same day

Well, I just finished a fifty minute breakdown in my room and I’m scared and lost. I’m shaking, and the skin on my thigh is red, scratched, raised, burning, and has indentations from my nails from scratching it. Only thankfully not bleeding (though blistery looking.) It feels so cold in my room so I’m sitting in the dark under my comforter in a sweater watching tv to calm down. I just need to vent all of this, the causes, and what I plan (yeah I don’t have a plan spoiler alert) on doing. 

So backstory: divorce in the family, entrapped by mother’s creepy boyfriend, lots of money troubles, ongoing struggle with anorexia and feeling of loss of control. You’re pretty much up to speed. 

I will be the first to admit, I have a lot of anger issues. I get in fits of white hot rage when things aren’t organized or coordinated, and that’s a frequent source of stress in my life. (Seriously, I wake up at the crack of dawn to have as much time as I can with a clean house before my family wakes up.) 

Today, the tv was too loud, the living room was messy, and my brain was in the mood to get fussy, so I got unreasonably angry. Learning from past mistakes I left and went downstairs to avoid lashing out. I sat in my room and swore under my breath for what must have been ten minutes before the breakdowns started. I looked around. My bedspread doesn’t match, my closet is a bit unorganized, my tv has too many cords, my top dresser drawer is in disarray. I tried to calm and made an impromptu punching bag out of a metal bar, belt, and pillow, which worked for a time before it fell, and I did not have the patience to put it back. 

I was overwhelmed with emotions and locked my door and started pulling my hair and scratching my thigh and calf, breathing heavily. I bit my nails and my lip and threw things. Then the tears came. 

I hid in my closet and closed the door so that my clothes would muffle the sound of my crying and cried in there for thirty minutes, scratching my leg and pulling my hair. Paranoia crept in and I checked in the cracks between the doors of my closet frantically, though I know I never heard my door open, and it’s locked anyway. I checked around my room constantly and obsessively to make sure no one was watching me while still crying and rocking back and forth. Some of my already thin hair started to come out between my fingers which only made me panic more so I switched to more scratching and biting my nails. I thought briefly of going to the bathroom to throw up my dinner (that whole eating disorders thing I mentioned). If I can’t control my room’s cleanliness and the level of organization I want, why don’t I go back to trying to control my weight? (No issues with that logic.) 

Finally, I overcame the attack and calmed down enough to see what I’d done. I moved a few shoes in my closet and wiped my tears and tried to stand but my thigh was burning and my calf did **not** want to support me. I stumbled out of the closet to clean up what I’d thrown and calm my rage. 

So now that brings me here. Terrified of myself and the fact I’ve now resorted to self-harm after avoiding it for so long, and not knowing what to do next. For reasons too complicated to explain I can’t tell my mom what’s happened, and I’m very emotionally guarded, so pretty much most people I know are out of the question. 

I don’t know what y’all do when this happens to you. All of you guys in this sub are so strong and get through these types of things (granted with some issues along the way). Do y’all know anything to help me? I’m just a bit shaken and I need some support. Thanks y’all. I’m gonna go get an extra blanket and a scarf, and stay in my room for the rest of the night. I need some alone time anyway.",23Jun2020,2

39,"WARNING: mention of self-harm and suicide.

I am feeling so utterly lost. 

I want to be better. I want to get allow myself to get help...

But I'm petrified. Every step I take feels like a step in the wrong direction.

I am 19 years old now and my first year of college is over-- my psychiatrist at the children's hospital said I could be his patient until the end of my first year of college. 

I don't know what to do next. Do I look for a new provider in the midst of a pandemic? Do I wait it out? How long will it be before it ends? 

I'll run out of medication soon. On one hand, I can't stand the thought of going without it, but on the other, is it even working? I'm not so sure anymore...

I've gained so much weight. I don't feel beautiful anymore. It eats at my confidence. My psychiatrist says it isn't my fault, that this is an unfortunate side-effect of the drug. Why, I wonder, do I continue to take a drug to make me feel less anxious if the side-effect of the drug makes me feel more anxious? 

I want to cut this extra flesh off of me. I want to take a knife to the bits on my arms that make my t-shirt sleeves tear, to the chunks on my thighs that stop my jeans from meeting my hips. Maybe I can't cut it off, but I can cut it. And I do... nearly two-years of cutting sobriety gone before I can catch my breath. 

Everyone keeps telling me therapy will help. I want to believe that that's true, but each time I try to call to make an appointment, my mind flashes back to that nightmare of a day. 

My first therapist screamed at me. She screamed at me for not being able to speak, for not being able to find the words. Mere hours after I was released from the hospital after the 3rd attempt on my life, she screamed at me. Relentlessly. My mother didn't stop her, no one stopped her. I tried to jump out of the car on the way home...

I hang up before the call can connect.

My eyes fall upon the bumpy red scars on my wrists.

I feel hopeless.

How do I make myself jump this hurdle? How do I force myself to dial the number and talk to the receptionist and commit to a date and time? What happens when that day comes? What happens when I can't get out of bed? 

Is it worth it to break down the wall that is protecting my heart from the avalanche of emotions I've yet to deal with? How will I know what to say when I do? How to act?

Does therapy really help?

Please.

I could use your insights. 

Thank you for reading.",23Jun2020,3

I misplace things extremely often. I literally cannot put my phone down to do anything, without having to take a few minutes to search for it afterwards. If I need to do something, I will forget, every single time without fail. Sometimes I forget to eat, sometimes I forget to sleep and end up awake at 4:00 AM 

I’ve just decided to start writing notes and literally taping them to the door. And while I make them, I need to look for a pen, and when I finally find it I’ve lost the paper. Then I need to do the same exact thing with the tape. After I write the note and put my phone down for 5 seconds just to tape it to the door, I’ve lost my phone.

I can’t remember what happened a few hours before, and I can’t remember how many days it’s been since any particular event because over half my days get completely forgotten within less than a week

Never had that, parents made themselves feel good by supporting me financially, directing my life, trying to enforce hardcore christianity upon me until 18, so turning back to religion now for me is big fail, means i cant do squat by myself or smth...thats my only hope to have that small light each dark day here...

No job...not because of the beer virus

This beautiful soul killing morning after calling suic helpline, I understood that I am sad :) because: Maslows basic needs are met- 1.shelter (parents bought me an old apartment), 2.basic food and so I get &gt;&gt;no goals &gt;&gt; no motivation &gt;&gt; no self discipline &gt;&gt; no self esteem &gt;&gt; no sex, no health but get depression and personality disorder. Is this is whats killing me??  you guys agree with with this thought process?? parents are subconciously been killing me for 10 years so as I did myself???

How do I break the cycle??? Any of you had this evil thing??? As I said should I give away or return the old flat, used car and a tv which my parents bought me and through myself into the cold or just continue tough love therapy which so far gave me herniated disc, feeling impotent????

It’s 4am. I can’t sleep but my head is all over the place and I’m on mobile so apologies for the incoherent post.

I’ve just remembered something I had blocked out for years - my first attempt.

I’m a middle class white guy growing up in the UK with 2 decent parents and 2 fairly standard brothers. Literally dripping in privilege. So what could possibly have led to my suicide attempts at Age 8, Age 9, Age 9, Age 9, Age 13, Age 14, Age 14, Age 15, Age 16 and Age 16?

I can’t remember what led to me trying the first time but I do remember the scene vividly - tying a noose out of a red and black scarf and tying it over my door, panicking when I couldn’t breathe and realising oh shit I’m terrified of death.

I think it’s why I’m so freaked out by anything right around my neck these days and why I couldn’t hang myself if I tried.

She never had her own choices either,  who ever I was friends with so was she even if she didn't even like them. she wanted everything that I had and had to do everything I was doing it try to do it better than me.

51,"I have a diagnosis of BPD and anxiety. I see a therapist 2-4 times a month and am currently waiting to get in with a new psychiatrist. I don’t have a PCP. Currently the only doctor of any kind that I have that can prescribe me medications is my obgyn. My OB team prescribed me mental health drugs before. 

I woke up yesterday feeling awfully nervous and on edge for some reason. I couldn’t tell you why. I ended up going to the ER hoping for some help, thinking I was just having an episode, but started to panic while waiting on the doctor to see me and left AMA. As I sat in the parking lot, my panic attack grew worse until I became very confused and disoriented. I was lucid and aware, but my brain just wasn’t putting things together the way it normally does... for instance, I kept thinking that I was supposed to be at work soon, but couldn’t for the life of me remember how to get there, and when I called my manager to let him know I was having an emergency and wouldn’t be in I stumbled over my sentences and couldn’t get the words out straight. I called my boyfriend and he came and picked me up and took me back to his apartment. When he found me I was hyperventilating and he said I was hot to the touch. 

I do have the occasional bad day, but it’s bad again today. Everything puts my stomach in knots. I feel generally uneasy. I feel paranoid and afraid. I called my OB office to see if they can prescribe me anything new, as the Zoloft I was prescribed before doesn’t work, but my doctor won’t be in the office until Wednesday. Even then, they aren’t sure they’ll be able to help me. When I called today I was told it may be a matter for my PCP, which I don’t have. I’m terrified. I don’t know what to do.",23Jun2020,1

53,"I've already posted most of the text below on r/teenagers but I felt I had more things to get off my chest. I've decided that this may be a more appropriate sub to post to.

  
A year ago, I was on the edge of a building during a school trip in Japan, ready to jump. At the last minute, I saw a teacher coming to where I was and immediately got off the ledge.

  
Nine months ago, I was on the side of an 80km/h road ready to jump into traffic. I made the mistake of sending a final goodbye to the old group of ""friends"" I had. They didn't even have the decency to come themselves. They called someone that was even further away to come and check on me. I didn't kill myself that night.

  
I've been on six different anti-depressants, only one of which ""helped"". I put quotes there because all it does is numb me. It makes me unable to cry, unable/unwilling to have an orgasm, and gives me migraine-type headaches.

  
I've been having stomach problems for over five years. I've complained to many doctors about it, but I was only just referred to a gynecologist, for September. Even if I get officially diagnosed with what is the most common culprit, the medicine would make me immunocompromised. That means COVID-19 would most likely kill me anyways.

  
My university grades are in turmoil, and having online classes is not going to help that. I've been contemplating just simply dropping out (even with the 25k debt I've racked up from it).

  
I live in constant pain, sadness and loneliness.

  
My current plan is just to max out my credit cards for a plane ticket to Japan and a hotel stay. I want to eat some wagyu beef and then go off myself in some remote area. I wouldn't tell anyone where I was going, nobody would know what happened to me. They would just know that I disappeared. My parents would get a cool 20k from my life insurance.

  
I don't see what the point of continuing life is.

  
People don't talk to me if I don't talk to them, I only get invited places when I'm present when plans are made. I tried to talk to them about it, but they only just got offended. Nothing changed.

&amp;#x200B;

Being from a catholic background, I was never taught what sex was and what it entailed. I learned about it for the first time in tenth grade, when I was fifteen. I'm eighteen now, and I'm still confused about the whole thing. I am still a virgin. I was excited to maybe experience something in my first year of uni, but that never happened because of all the anti-deps I'm on make me not want it. My ex that I thought was going to be my first ended up cheating on my on prom night. Plus, to make matters worse, I've come to realize that I'm bisexual and that's just another added stress onto it.

Ive tried telling her to start over the relationship when they're older and more mature and can handle things but her bf says if they break up they cant get back together. She isn't even in a good position to begin with because her years of middle school were all online so coming into freshmen year she was all destroyed and socially inept in a way. The last straw that made really pissed is that her bf said that she cant have more than 1 best friend and u see the thing is she only has 3 best friends that are really really close to her one of them including me.

56,"I’ve always dealt with this but it’s becoming a bit more prevalent lately. I struggle doing things like painting, writing, drawing, or reading books because I feel like there would be no benefit or gain from it. It’s gotten to the point where I either overwork myself for money or I just lay around and do absolutely nothing. I recently went on a bookstore date with my lovely partner and felt some spark of excitement seeing and smelling all the books I used to dive into as a child. He bought me two beautiful poetry books of which I’m familiar with the writers and watch videos about their lives. I know the books are good but every time I pick it up I ask myself if it will benefit me physically in any way and I end up putting it away.

And partially to collect my thoughts. 

After 3yrs of weekly theraphy I was given a pat on the back and shown to the door and told they had done what they could, and good luck. 

And I don't want to downplay my progress, because it have been huge, and I know what I have left will be with me for the rest of my life, but some days it's just so hard. 
I am still an anxious mess, I never got a diagnosis for that, just anxious with some compulsive tendensies.
Like if I don't tell my cat I love him and to have fun, I'll find him beheaded in the road. If I kill a spider and don't do x,y and z, it will burst into hundreds of eggs/hatchlings that will crawl all over me. If I shower too long the lightbulb in the bathroom will get moist from the steam and explode - so I only take cold short showers. And it goes on and on - some days worse and some days better.  

A way I cope is by eating ""treats"", but with sugar tax and other ""healthy"" initiatives, they are super expencive, so it becomes an issue when I worry about finances/bills. Then cope with a snickers bar, and then worry more x repeat. So some days I will eat 2 -3 bars and no food to try to make it go to zero wasted $$

I realize I probably sound far more mental than I normally am. But it's been one of those nights where it's only nightmares (rooted in stress/anxiety) and no sleep.  
But I just want one day, a single day withouth worrying about money, the cat, having someone knock on the door unannounced etc. I get why people turn to drugs lol, but I know logically it would probably make whatever I got far worse + I can barely afford chocolate, forget drugs or alcohol. 

So far what works is stroking my own forehead (lame I know), and if I am at the computer, put a song on loop so I don't subconciously track time and get stressed about be late for ""something"".  I have tried exercising, but since I have to do it at home I keep getting distracted about everything else that need to be done, so it's rarely I am able to. But the money issue is become real as I am sick and tired of throwing away nearly $120 a month on candy, it makes me fat, it costs far too much, and it only works as long as I am eating it. I asked if medication would be a good idea, but my therapist just shrugged and said we'd see at a later date. My GP thinks I need to develop a healthy sleep schedule and get a job so I can spend my energy on something usefull during the day - and I kinda agree, but that doesn't help me now.",23Jun2020,1
78,"My relationship with my parents is shit, my dad's abusive and incompetent and my mom's just really hard on me, but has also said worse things to me than my dad? Also abusive but overall nicer? It's been like this since I was little. I just felt like venting about this, I'm not sure if other people are like this too. I have an almost fear of liking anything they do. I guess I'm scared it'll somehow make me like them. For example - I love plants and painting, they're one of the few things that make me happy. My dad loves plants too, and I have this weird thing where I can't have any plant he has. My mom used to paint, and I actively try not to paint like her.

I'm 18 years old. I'm not sure if I have OCD or its something else.
It all started around 2015. It wasn't that bad then, and no one seemed to think that it was wrong. 

Fast forward to today -

I don't remember what normal is. If I did would know what to do to fix this.
I have extreme obsession to keep things oil free. Be it my phone, laptop, pen, bedsheet, my hands, anything. I have to clean it.
For example- today my father came to my room and sat on my bed, he puts moisturizer and oil so my bedsheets got oily and my pillow cover feels oily too, now I have to change it (I will change it after writing this).

My friends tell me that I have OCD.

But I'm fine getting my hands oily while eating. And dirty if I'm outside. 
I'm fine being dirty, it's just when my things get oily and dirty I clean them so so much.

1) Every day after bathing I wet a handkerchief and clean my phone and my laptop and my stuff
2) If anyone touches my stuff I clean it after they leave.
3) Every time I bath I use almost 1/3 a bar of soap
4) I shampoo every time I take a bath
5) My skin is very dry and its painful but I can't put moisturizer (I'm fine putting moisturizer if I'm going outside)
6) I don't let others touch my phone (their hands may be oily so my phone will get oily)
7) I'm obsessed with closing every app on my phone every time (even though I don't need to)

I understand that what I have written may not make much sense (I don't understand what's wrong with me enough to articulate it)

86,"I started seeing a therapist about a month or a little less ago. She asked me if i have any suicidal thoughts and/or thoughts of hurting myself or others, and I lied. I said no but I get those thoughts constantly. They haven’t gotten so bad to the point where I actually do them but it makes me feel like a monster and I’m never going to get help because I can’t stop lying. I lied about my eating habits, I lied about my sleeping schedule, I lied about my friends, and they believed me.
A part of me is glad they believed me because i feel so embarrassed to have these thoughts and these habits but a part of me also wishes they keep asking about it until I tell the truth.
I could just tell them but I’m scared they’re gonna be mad because I’ve been lying to them for so long. 
Another reason I keep lying is because I want to keep this stuff to myself, or share it with people but keep my identity a secret like on here. I made the mistake of telling my mom about my depression a while ago and she keeps trying to get involved. It no longer feels like I have depression and feels more like we have depression. I wish I just lied and told everyone I was fine. I don’t want help anymore. I don’t mind feeling constantly sad or eating all day. In a way it makes me feel safe that I get to keep some of this stuff to myself. 

You can tell me to come clean to everyone but don’t expect me to actually do it, because I probably won’t. I just want to know if anyone else feels like this about their mental illness.",23Jun2020,1

I realize no relationship is perfect and I've managed to avoid having very many due to some irrational fears. Yes, I have been in therapy for a very long time and I self manage pretty well most days. I'm 28 and currently been with my SO for 7 years now. My last boyfriend chased me for several years before finally giving up on me and going off to find a wife. Both of these men truly loved me, supported me and never did anything to hurt me. I genuinely start out in my relationships feeling like I'm madly in love and then a few years in...I get an insatiable urge to run and get out of the relationship. It starts out with a slow detachment from my partner, where I stop connecting with them both mentally and sexually. This is fueled further by the natural decrease in attention they give me (when the courting phase is over). Basically, as soon as things get in that comfortable stage, I panic and want out. I have tried to force myself to stay and be a good partner, but, I get more and more reckless, restless and depressed. I'm literally on the verge of leaving my loving spouse for no valid reason and my family will probably hate me for it. From my perspective, I don't think I deserve my SO and if I leave, maybe he will be a lot happier anyway. I feel that I'm toxic and I really shouldn't be in any relationships.

90,"I understand, time changes people, people move apart, but it's really hard when I realize I could've changed things had I not put myself here to begin with. 

I was brought into an odd group of friends in highschool by a guy named Braden that I played video games with online. The group consisted of about 6 guys, Braden, Garrett, Chris, Jordan, Zach, and Carpenter, (fake names?) a few of them I had known for nearly my entire life but hadn't become good friends with them. We all became best friends, and for a few years we would all hang out all the time outside of school and videogames, party, go be idiot highschools.... But like most friend groups, there are seemingly ""inner groups"" inside of that. Bonds that are stronger and bonds they are willing to sever.

Things were great for a while and then Garrett and I gained the ""healthy habit"" of smoking, while the others werent the most fond of it, they were fine with us and would even sit with us outside or wherever. Garrett eventually stopped smoking, I didnt.

Things went rather south between me and Zach. Zach and a girlfriend of his had broken up after being together for only a few months, and a while after she started talking to me(which I now know was to get back at him). Things never took off between us but friend was mad and rightfully so. To think back that I had done something like that to a friend without thinking of the implications is abhorrent, you just don't do that to a bro, though I know I had made the excuse of ""oh he's just a man hoe and goes after any girl and cheats on them with the next"". Along with that and me vomitting in his yard and falling asleep drunk in his shower, we don't talk much now. I don't drink much anymore either. 

I have suffered from ""moderate to severe"" depression for maybe 8 years now (which even though I never make it an excuse, damn can it be crippling) and it eventually caused me to become much more introverted and secluded, and I feel this is the largest shift in the whole of our shared friendships, but none of them ever asked me if I was okay. They just let me float away.

Once highschool was over and college began, they all kept in touch. Kept hanging out in the summer, always doing things on spring break together, why wouldn't they? They look so happy all together from the pictures I see posted on Facebook of them 5 minutes away from me, alone in my room I never leave, and I'm somewhat happy for them. I've only ever been able to get a few short conversations out of a few of them, a photo together at a graduation, but it's not like I'm trying too hard anymore either unfortunately. I didn't even get an invite to Chris' wedding and he lives only a few streets away. They've seemingly severed their collective friendship with me, and I for some reason thought it'd be better to be alone.

Now all I wish for is the bond of a few people I could really call my friends. Now, as I sit in my room looking at a photo of yall by the pool, I'm happy for you guys, but I only feel pain. Maybe they all thought I moved onto other things, other friends, but no. All I think of is the times we had had together as a group, the trips we went on, the shit we got into. I despise what I've turned into as I let myself fall apart so easily. I hate that my friends didn't realize something was wrong, but I can't blame them for my own actions as I never told them something WAS wrong. I just drifted into oblivion. I have an awful fear of regection now as I feel like I've become an outcast to my former self, almost like a traitor to my brothers, and now can't hold an attachment to almost anything.

To anyone who has read this far, I wish you an amazing day. To my old friends whom I know will most likely never read this, Chris, Braden, Garrett, Jordan, Zach, and Carp, I cannot begin to explain the remorse I feel. It's like looking back on a dead loved one, I'm so full of a mixture of emotion I cannot contain. It is one of my deepest regrets in life, and I want you guys back in my life.",23Jun2020,1

96," It is normal for every individual to experience grief, conflict, and stress. It is very normal to have a phase or off days. However, the way you deal with it should be healthy. Seeking help makes you look at your life via a new, cleaner lense and hence it helps you deal with those issues. In India, going for therapy is still considered a taboo and one fears judgement. It is very important for an individual to understand the importance of mental health. Your mental health affects every sphere of your life. If something bothers you at work, it will bother your personal relationships too. Mental stress is not age-bound. Mental health is significant at any age and hence if you feel the need to visit a [therapist for teens](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/teen-therapy/), you should without any hesitation. Psychologists and professionals are specially trained to conduct therapy sessions for people of various age groups and various walks of life.

**Here Are A Few Reasons Why You Should See A Therapist.**

**1.** **You have been through a traumatic experience recently**

The pain of death of a family member, breakup, losing your job or any other stressful experience can lead to trauma. We often think that this kind of stress can go away on its own. However, that is not the case. This kind of trauma hampers your day-to-day life. It changes the way you deal with people. It affects your social life and keeps you withdrawn from your friends. Counselling can help.

**2.** **You have not been yourself lately**

Being yourself can mean a lot of things. Your personality and behaviours define you. Being mentally disturbed affects the way you live. You do not love the things you like doing. You don’t like having a social life. These are symptoms of depression and you must try [group therapy for depression](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/group-therapy/). 

While these and many other reasons could be your reason to visit a therapy, it is important to understand that you need not see a therapist only when something is ‘wrong’. This stigma around mental health must be eliminated. You can see a therapist if you want to live better and do better.

**3.** **You can visit a therapist if you want to love and accept yourself.**

A lot of people have a difficult time when it comes to accepting oneself. They need not be depressed or any other mental disorder. Therapy can help one understand deeper about themselves and hence boost their self-esteem.

**4.** **You can visit a therapist if you want to be a better person, partner, or parent.**

People fail to understand the importance of understanding themselves, their partner, their kids and their family on a deeper level. The concept of marriage or relationship counselling and [family therapy](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/family-therapy/) exists to help two or more individuals co-exist without being a burden on anyone’s mental health. There need not be anything wrong in your family, it is just that there is always scope of being better together.

The spotlight on physical illnesses often leaves mental health in the shadows. The times have changed and so your perceptions and priorities should change too. Being accepting to new ideologies is important and could be one of the reasons why therapy is important for every individual.",23Jun2020,1

100,"I'm 19 now, but when I was 15, I had sex with a man who had to be at least 10 years older than me. He did things to me that I did not want to do, and acted like it was totally ok. That messed me up a lot, I felt like what he did was ok and I figured I must not have communicated my discomfort clear enough. I felt violated, having lost my virginity to a man I really didn't really have any interest in and who was significantly older than me. 


It started when I got in his car to ""hang out"", and being a naive teenager, thinking I could pick up on bad vibes, got in because he seemed fairly normal. Then when he was driving, he said he had a better idea than just hanging out.
I must have been visibly uncomfortable at this point, because he said that nervous feeling was normal when you're about to have sex. I didn't really know what I wanted, but at that point I didn't want to have sex with him, bit I felt like I must have somehow given him consent non-verbally.


He drove me to the other side of the town I lived in, to a truck stop on the edge of town. I was really creeped out at this point, but I had now realized my only way of getting home was with him. I followed him into the bathroom. He immediately took off his pants when we went into the back room, and told me to take off mine. I did, because he drove me to the other side of town, I didn't have a jacket and it was a cold evening, and I was scared he might do something to me if I refused since he took me to a secluded place. I won't get into the graphic details, but it ended up with me doing something I didn't even want to do at that point, and especially with someone I'd just met. 


I then had to get dressed again and get back into his car to get back home. I felt disgusting, and when he drove me to a gas station near my house, I just stood there while I waited for my ride home, without really thinking of anything. I only did what I did because I was in a compromising situation. I would not have let what happened happen if I didn't feel like there was a reasonable risk of me getting hurt.


But I did get hurt. I hurt inside. After this, I started heavily smoking marijuana, I skipped about a third of school days to stay home for the rest of highschool, claiming I had a terrible headache, but in reality I just felt too depressed to leave the house. I started watching more disturbing porn, almost as a punishment for myself. I withdrew from my social life too. The only times I saw my highschool friends after that was at lunch time, and at the end of my senior year I just stopped talking to everyone altogether. My depression got so bad, and I've attempted suicide a few times since then.


All of this besides the depression started after I was molested, and the already existing depression got much worse. My grades suffered heavily, and I went from an honours student to barely passing because I felt so depressed all the time, and I was self medicating with marijuana. I never did homework, and the only socialization that I got, and still get, is through online video games. I can't even hold friendships anymore, I just flake all the time. I tried making friends at my previous job and it just ended up with me getting too into drugs, and I developed deeper trust issues from this, the one time I tried to reach out and make friends. I was smoking a lot of weed every single day to cope with my depression, something my prescribed medication couldn't even do for me. 


My life got much, much worse since I was molested, and I haven't told anyone about it until today. I blamed myself, and I became incredibly self-hating and self-destructive for it. It's like I became the world's biggest pushover too. I became incredibly conflict avoidant. My parents never knew why I was so depressed and why I was so emotionally unstable. A lot of that could just be blamed on preexisting mental illness, but it became far worse after the incident.


I just can't contain it anymore. I tried so hard to forget what happened, but today I had a major flashback, and I finally realized that it wasn't my fault entirely. I tried telling a friend on the internet (since those are the only friends I have) and they didn't really seemed too bothered by it. So I guess I made this post because I want to tell someone what happened, someone who might care.

I was molested, it ruined me mentally and set me back a lot in my education, and it took me over 4 years to stop suppressing the memories.",23Jun2020,1

102,"I [19M] have been unlucky in love to say the least. I’ve never had a proper girlfriend or boyfriend and everyone who I’ve asked out has rejected me. And tbh, I’m really ashamed of it

I feel kinda jealous of the couples around me, but normally I can just shrug it off. I haven’t had an easy life, and it’s taken it’s toll on me. For some reason people keep flocking to me for help with their shit, and my life feels like I keep having to solve other people’s problems while barely being able to deal with my own. I’m happy to help, but it feels like my life is just one shitshow after another, whenever I start to feel happy the universe decides to screw me over again.  

Whenever I start to get jealous of a couple, I just tell myself things like “Oh, it’s fine, you’re not ready anyway, as if anyone would ever date you with your mental state being the way it is” and hating myself helps soften the blow.

But when I see someone who is just as damaged as I am in a happy relationship, it makes me so confused and angry. It makes all the things I say to myself to deal with it invalid. I have this online friend [17F] who I’ve been helping with her mental health. She’s just as damaged as I am, and I’ve been trying to stop her from making the same mistakes I made when I was younger. She doesn’t listen, and it’s really sad and exhausting watching someone I care about tear her own life apart like she is. However, despite all this, she has a boyfriend. 

I get so jealous and angry at her whenever she mentions her boyfriend at all. I don’t get why I have to suffer through all this shit, actually try to get better and still constantly get screwed over by my life, while she is just as damaged as I am, doesn’t have the decency to even try to get better and she gets be with someone when I don’t. It makes me so uncontrollably angry, to the point where I’m seeing black spots, my breathing feels painful and I feel like I’m nit been in my own body, and I just want to scream at the top of my lungs.

I don’t normally get angry easily, I’m usually a fairly calm and compassionate person, I try to help people whenever I can. I don’t get why I’m getting so mad over this, how do I fix this?",23Jun2020,1
103,"CALLING ALL POPULAR PEOPLE. Top tier sorority girls, frat boys, football captains, you know who you are. I am fascinated with the idea of popularity. I am looking for some answers to my questions regarding the psychological and mental-health underpinnings of “popular” people in high school or college.
Background: I was never a classically popular girl in high school or college. I was average looking then, am slightly above average looking now at age 23. I have always been genuine, kind and more of an old soul. Combined with strict parents who never allowed me to party... this is likely to make for an unpopular person in these years. Who wants to get crazy and take shots and make out with boys ... with an old soul? I have always struggled with low self esteem, feelings of not belonging anywhere... and my mental health issues are truly clear as day to me. Depression during my late teen years molded me to who I am today. I never tried to be popular but always desired it from the sidelines... the social plans, the interactions with cute guys, the constant inclusion and invites to parties... seems like the ultimate form of capital and currency in those years. Even when those very people possessing the capital can be mean, entitled and snobby. And if you think I’m saying this from a place of intense jealousy, then you’d be absolutely right.
So now I ask.... popular people. Are you all okay?  Do you all feel disconnected and struggle with low self esteem? What causes some of you to be mean? Why did that one popular girl from my high school try to befriend me at college and then drop me without warning the next? Why is there a shallow exchange of “currency” consisting of social status and looks? Is that fulfilling? And I’m not saying this to judge. My questions are coming from a place of deep desire to connect with people around me... and popularity/ its superficial rules are incongruent with me being able to empathize with the feelings of others. What are some of the struggles of being a conventionally attractive and popular young guy or girl? Because it genuinely seems like getting invites to all the parties and feeling highly esteemed among your peers/having people value for your looks would really solve all my problems and silence my insecurities",23Jun2020,1
104,"To start off, I work a full time job already. 40 hours per week. The thing is that I’ve been going through some stuff mentally. I actually like my job and enjoy the people and the work isn’t bad. The only problem is that I’m alone with my thoughts outside of work. With more time on the weekends with nothing to do and more to think about. Basically after work now I’ll normally go for a run. a walk, workout, eat dinner watch a show, take care of a couple things and get ready for the next day. I don’t really have any real friends. I just graduated recently and have been putting in an effort to better myself now that I’m out of high school. I hated high school and many factors led to me not liking myself either. I got good grades and it’s not like I’m overweight or anything. Just terrible self esteem and self confidence issues I’ve been fighting. Anyways I’ve realized that during weekends bad thoughts will come back and I beat myself up mentally. I had a part time job before my full time job and I know I could get it back for the weekends if I tried. I was thinking that I should maybe do it because it would take my mind off the stuff I’m battling internally. It’s not even about the money either. Thankfully I have a pretty good mom who pays for my car insurance and pretty much all of my other expenses. My only real expense I have is gas. As I said I don’t have many friends either so it’s not like I ever have plans on the weekend either and I don’t really do anything with money. I turned 18 recently and am now up to almost 12k in savings. I do have some hobbies but they are pretty cheap. I like sports and running. Don’t do too much organized stuff anymore. Just try to push and better myself. I also like reading as well. I like to golf sometimes but you don’t need a whole day off for that. So this would mean I would literally be working everyday but I don’t know if this is something I should actually go through with. I could use some advice.

It is random, when i am alone, and its very quiet sometimes i will get this feeling. Its like anxiety i guess, i just feel scared and i want to hug or see my mom. I feel like crying and i feel melancholic. I dont know why i feel like crying but if i dont find someone i know or distract myself with something fun i will feel this way. If it starts, i cry for about less than 10 minutes, if i find someone the feeling goes away in about 1 minute. Sometimes when i get out of a long hot shower i feel this way.

115,"This is a something i to this very day believe is the deep rooted reason i have so many issues today.. 

At the time that i was around 5-11 years old, my mother was dating a guy that i hate so fucking much to this very day. He was very emotionally and verbally abusive to me, the worst part is i kept telling my mother to leave him throughout their whole relationship, and reasons not to ranged from ""he is nice though"" because she was completely oblivious to how abusive he was to me the first couple of years, then it went to ""i dont want to go back to living with my parents so im staying with him because him abusing you is very clearly better than me having to move back to my parents house"". 

He treated me like trash, and it got especially bad if he ever drank.. He acted almost as if i did something to him (a fucking child) that made him hate every living fiber of mine. I felt scared and uncomfortable in my own home, i liked being anywhere but home. My mother would work throughout the day and he would do night shifts, and he would be the one who would take me to school and back. A couple of times he would purposefully take a reaaaallly long time before getting to get me from school (like an hour at least) and it would trigger really bad anxiety in me because i wouldnt know what to do. 

When he'd get drunk, the second we would all go home (theyd take me to a restaurant with them usually) he would start treating me like shit, disrespecting me, acting as if i was acting up even though i wasnt doing anything out of the ordinary, and no adult would stand up for me, and when we would get home he would go into my room and ruin my stuff and take a bunch of them away from me, even things like my notebooks for school, and my mother barely did anything to stop him.. On top of everything he would often force me to read books to him which i have no idea why, he would cut off any wifi in my room and not let me have an ounce of entertainment. He slapped me once right in front of my mother with no shame, which is the first time my mother actually did something about it. 

Even though it might seem like i remember a lot, my overall memory from that period of my life is somewhat blurry and i dont even remember many good moments if there were any. After he left, i was super against ny mother dating anyone else to which at the time she started dating the guy whod later become my stepdad whom i deeply love and consider as my real father, but even despite the fact that the outcome was good, i was super scared of being treated the same way, i was anxious as fuck about it for a long time.

116,"So you may have noticed my antics the last few days. The reason is I’m incredibly insecure about the size of my penis and thinking for prolonged periods of time makes my head hurt. I taunt others due being too lazy to find other coping mechanisms to support my fragile ego and anger issues that come out by others simply being friendly to me. My IQ ranks in about 65 (67 if I think VERY hard!) so this makes me incapable of thinking before I speak. For this doctors have diagnosed me with terminal “will-get-ass-kicked-if-says-something-to-the-wrong-personistis” so I have to stay in and attempt to annoy decent people online.

117,"Long story incoming.

So in between 5th and 6th grade, I moved to a new state to start middle school. I was scared and didn't know how to make new friends, and I met this girl (we'll call her Julia). Julia was what you would call a bad girl, she broke the rules and 11 year old me thought she was so cool. We became friends, but whenever her other friends were nearby she completely ditched me for them. I panicked. I didn't want to lose her, so I tried doing various things to impress her. Including making a fool of myself. She only seemed to be interested in me when I made myself look dumb, not when I let my true personality through.

By this point depression and anxiety were starting to kick in. I was uncomfortable in this friendship and I missed my old home and friends. So I started getting desperate. All I wanted was someone who cared for me, and I wanted them as soon as possible. So I would talk to random students I didn't know beforehand and try to forge a friendship with them. Desperation and fear of abandonment caused me to rush things, however, so I never really connected with anyone and instead creeped them out. I would jump between various other students over a few months. It was like I was possessed. This deep fear of abandonment took over and I rushed the relationship with no thought of how the other person was feeling and when I snapped out of it I would abandon them in shame of my actions. 

My grades tanked (mainly due to my mental health problems but also a natural inability to focus) and my parents asked me what was wrong. I could only tell them about how I missed my old home. They'd be disgusted if they found out about my desperation or my inability to focus. They scolded me anyway for dwelling on the past and it just didn't improve my academic situation at all. If anything, it made it worse.

Eventually Julia got fed up with me and introduced someone new to me. He didn't know my past but had a crush on me. We started dating and I finally settled down. I was so happy to be with someone who appreciated me. We've broken up since but we're still friends and I've found a bunch more friends who appreciate me too. Julia and I no longer talk.

I still struggle with social anxiety and fear of abandonment today. I'm grateful to no longer be depressed but I look back on those years and cringe because I must've come off as a stalker and a narcissistic asshole. What I'm confused about was the possession feeling. Is there a specific term for that? It really felt like my true self was unconscious and I was blindly running on the desire to be loved.",23Jun2020,1

119,"Hi everyone, 

I am 15 yrs old and i come from a background that neglects and disregards mental health. Nothing is taken seriously in my family and no, i cannot talk to them about this. I havent been to any doctors or any sort of thearapy, after discussing to friends and thinking about it i decided to come to reddit. 

I am not diagnosed and I am unable to seek for help. For the past fortnight i have been acting restlessly doing things i regret. I burnt myself and smashed my hand in doors, voluntarily. I expreience spurts of energy and happiness that make me do things i soon regret. Currently i hate this spontaneous reckless side of myself but there have been days where i praise myself for it. 

I have a high self esteem on days like this and i believe that nothing can stop me, to be honnest days like this feel amazing because litteraly nothing can stop me. The problem in this is that my notebooks in school are empty. I am unable to consentrate in class. I have broken smashed and chewed on many of my stationary including my phone. On a days like this, i have gone out with strangers and smoked weed, drunk lean and alcohol, I have exposed myself (explicitly and sexually) to many people online, I have stolen many things and i belive that maybe half of all my personal possetions have come from me stealing them... i regret all of this. I hear and see things in my room, people and ""inanimate"" objects talk to me and sometimes i engage in full on conversations with them. idk about this.

A month before this spontaneos side reappeared i was stuck in bed feeling sorry for myself. I distanced myself from my family and friends. I relied on my phone and electronics solely and ignored everyone else. I spent days not eating and days only eating. In last years cycle (around december 2019) i tried to kill myself. I locked myself in my room and spent an entire night moments away from drinking the bleach in the bathroom next to me. That was the most recent contemplation of sucide and before that i have tried 3 times( from what i can remember). 

I go from completly hating myself, making myself believe that everyone around me would live a better life if i was gone and fliping every good memory into a moment where i was oblivious to the fact that evryone around me hates me to telling myself that i am the most amazing person and that i am the boss and i dont need anyone else to love me because i am perfect in everyway and i already love myself. Its very tireing but i have to admit that i enjoy days where i am happy, i mean who dosen't

ive always questioned why i have so many mental health problems and why they're so intense. now i can see it all so clearly. today i talked to my sister for the first time in a long time and all of these repressed memories kept popping up the more we talked about our childhood. i realized that we had both grown up in an extremely abusive home.

any time i tried to mention these things to my parents in the past they gaslighted me into believing nothing happened. after a while i believed them. but now i have a witness, and i know it was all very real.

tonight while trying to go to sleep i keep getting flashbacks of my dad torturing and murdering all of our pets. i wont even go into detail about what he did to us. i can hear my sister sobbing and screaming for help like how i used to hear it every night. i cover my ears and still hear it. i can't sleep because im scared of the nightmares i'll have.

everything is still so hazy though, i know there's a lot more that happened but i truly can barely remember anything from ages 1-10 besides being scared. i remember my first long bout of depression at age seven. suicidal thoughts at age nine.

it explains so much. jumping at loud noises, trying to hide and run when someone is yelling, all the nightmares of my parents killing/hurting me or my sister. but part of me still thinks im overreacting by suspecting this is ptsd.

I’m honestly quite scared to post here because I don’t know how this works. 

I have severe OCD since the past eight months and consequently, I frantically clean myself and sometimes, the immediate surroundings around me.

The pandemic has made things worse, for example, I take a shower for two hours, not because I want to, but because I can’t help it. I also find myself in extreme discomfort if I don’t take a shower after peeing/pooping.

Last night, I accidentally peed some considerable drops in my washroom that’s in the living room. However, I didn’t wash the floor with water or my slippers that had pee on them. 

I then walked from that washroom to the one in my room since I feel anxious when I take a shower and feel scared that my family will scream at me for using washroom for long hours. 

Thus, I walked in the whole house and my room with my peed on slippers.

After I took my shower, I had water dripping off me and when I entered my room again, the water droplets fell off me on the dirty peed floor and creates puddles, that again come on me. However, after taking a shower for two hours, I was so exhausted that I didn’t wash myself and came to bed.

I will change my bedsheet in a few days because I can’t right now. Should I also be cleaning my mattress? If yes, how? Or can I just leave it? I’m extremely anxious since the past 18+ hours and I don’t know if I should be worried about using the same bedsheet+keeping myself on it+all my electronics on it+making contact in the whole house.

I've never been good with money and so I realise that when it comes to therapy, not everyone can afford it. However, everyone can afford a good online internet friend that wants to listen and speak to you about issues in your day to day life that make you feel frustrated or hurt.

I'm not a licensed therapist, nor am I a therapy student of any kind - I just want to be an internet friend that talks to you occasionally as I have a free summer and would love to chat to anyone who thinks talking might help relieve them of their issue.

133," I need some positivity and support right now. I just went from really happy, to bawling my eyes out in a very short time. My boyfriend is currently unemployed and has been forced to take a dead end internship, which is making him miserable. To help him I told him yesterday that I'd look over his CV and application material to get the ball rolling on an actual job. I work part-time (not by choice), and have a couple days of this week. I never said when I would do this, just that I had time and would look at it during my time off. 

During work (like half an hour or go) he texts me how it's going. I tell him that I haven't looked into his stuff at all because I just needed a me day today, and that I would check it out tomorrow. He then starts to push, not in a forceful way but still felt pushy for me to make two of his applications that are due today. Firstly, I never said I'd write several applications for him, I have mentioned that I'd look at one to give him an example of what to write - the latter wasn't specified though. And secondly, I feel like he doesn't think about how I had already planned out my day with all the fun stuff I felt like doing today. 

I have been feeling so drained for a couple weeks now, and really just needed a day where I did what I wanted. So far I've had fun going grocery shopping and getting bough Burger King for my lunch. I only got through half of it though when he texted. I wrote a fairly long message to him saying that I would do max 30 min. work on anything for him today, because I needed to relax and take time for me. After sending it I felt like absolute shit and started crying. I do deal with depression and anxiety, but this was just so sudden. I also feel like now I'm spending so long feeling like shit. If he had just accepted my first message of 'no I haven't looked at it and probably won't today', I wouldn't be feeling like this now. It feels like my entire day is just ruined.

I was diagnosed with Severe Panic and Depressive Disorder and after some therapy, my therapist has brought up that she suspects I may have PTSD. I don't think she ever officially diagnosed me with it because of how visibly upset I was from hearing that, but I typically don't mention it when talking about my medical history because as far as I know, it was never diagnosed. 

Growing up, I've had a lot of problems with hyper focusing on certain things or finding myself unable to break behavioral cycles that after self reflection and therapy, make no sense. I started talking about this with my therapist a few weeks ago after I realized I brushed my teeth very regularly and every time, my gums would bleed even though I floss, mouthwash, the works. I thought it might be because of the anxiety and I should try to calm down before I do that. I tried meditation, waking up earlier so I could just relax before my day started and yet without fail, I would always brush really hard for a 5 minutes. I eventually noticed that I couldn't break my focus from it and if I managed to stop brushing before that amount of time, I got extremely anxious and I'd end up going back just to brush my teeth a second time the way I normally did. Once I figured that out, I brought it up to my therapist and she suggested I get an electric toothbrush that turns off after you're supposed to be done so my brain would get that feeling of being done with that task and I wouldn't be as anxious. It worked the first day or so, but after I started getting frustrated when it would shut off and end up turning it back on again. I know I'm not supposed to, but I can't seem to make myself stop without being anxious for the rest of the day.

I've also noticed a problem with my focus on tasks since then. Recently I start something and before I'm 5 minutes into it, I'd switch to another one and keep doing that, cycling through all of the things I needed to do that day, but not being able to keep to one thing for more than 10 minutes or so. My therapist recommended I set a timer for myself for a task (30-45 minutes to give me enough time to finish it or at least make significant progress). I did, but I end up working a little and checking on the timer every 5 minutes and it became counterproductive. I've also noticed that while I love making lists upon lists of literally anything, I end up skipping around and ending up in the same cycle of hopping between tasks before they're done. The only thing this doesn't happen with is organizing, planning, or making lists. I could sit for hours making lists of anything, planning out a budget for literally anything (I'm very lucky with my money and I'm obsessed with keeping track of everything), organizing shelves, books, games, movies, it doesn't matter. If I clean my room or any other space, I'll often start that cycle and then if I come across something that needs to be organized, I'll drop everything and sit for hours doing it until I get it just right.

I'm not sure if this and the other problem are related, but I'm worried that they might be behavioral disorders that my therapist isn't telling me about so I don't get too worried about it. I talked about this with a close friend of mine that I trust a lot because I felt myself needing to talk to someone about it before my next session. He told me it sounded a lot like mild OCD and ADD, but to obviously not jump to any conclusions because neither of us are professionals by any means. My friends and family had always joked around with me ""being OCD"" in the past because I would constantly fix little things whenever I could (items on shelves, dishes on tables, organizing anything and everything) but they were always just jokes and I thought it was just because of my anxiety after a while since it would go down significantly after fixing something. 

While it's nice to have a piece in my mind that makes sense when it comes to figuring out why I keep doing this and why I can't stop, I refuse to self diagnose. I was terrified after being diagnosed with depression and anxiety and going to therapy for it because I thought it would lower my chances of doors being open to me in the future for careers (it kind of did because I wasn't able to join the military like I'd planned to, but I've moved past that). I want an answer for why I'm like this, but I'm afraid of getting more things tagged to my name and with how high misdiagnosed case numbers can be I don't want to be one of them by bringing up that with my concerns.

I went from Florida to California to visit my husband (he's in the military and we didn't live together yet) for about 10 days, but after I got here, I wasn't able to go home because of COVID-19. We got a house pretty quickly and were able to settle it, but because I now live out of state of my original therapist, I have to wait before my insurance goes through for one out here. I'm not sure when my next therapy appointment will be, but I'm worried of how the outcome will be.

I'm sorry if this is a bit long or confusing, but I tried to explain it as best as I could. Any advice on what to do or how to approach this to a therapist would be amazing and greatly appreciated. Thank you to anyone who comes across this and I hope you have a wonderful day :›",23Jun2020,1
136,"I apologize if this is the wrong place to post this. I wasn't sure where else to put it. 

I recently stopped taking Seroquel after weaning off of it from 200mg. I cut it by 25mg every two weeks or so with last Monday 6/15 being the first day I didn't take it in over a decade. I had some initial mild nausea and it was a bit difficult to sleep for a couple of days but everything since then has been fine. I'm a little bit itchy from time to time but even that really isn't too bad. I've read that the longer you take Seroquel, the longer it can take to be purged from your system. Is it possible that I still haven't experienced any of the withdrawal symptoms because it is still in my system after a week due to the length of time I was taking it? I've seen so many horror stories online about how difficult Seroquel withdrawal is for so many people that I was expecting this to be the hardest thing I've ever done and it just...wasn't. I feel like I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop and for withdrawal symptoms to really kick in. Or was quitting Seroquel just inexplicably easy for me?",23Jun2020,1
137,"Hi. Thanks for hearing me out. Her insurance stopped covering the previous one so she switched. She wasnt having any of these episodes on the previous medication. But she wasnt exactly getting great possitive results. But deffinetly seemed better than her current mental state. Her new one is calle viibryo. I think this is day number 4. It seems these meltdowns can be set off by something as a small as a disagreement between us that turns into an argument. 

Example: she woke up this morning feeling gross for not showering the night before, and was convinced she wouldnt be able to stand up in the shower without passing out. I tried to push her to shower because the last several nights she showered she was fine. Me trying to convince her caused a mild argument which led to her hysterically crying.

She started ranting about being tired of feeling like this, has no hope and everything that goes along with that. Along with crying. I felt bad so i tried to push more possitive ""wel work through this togeher and figure it out and everything will be okay""

I apologize for bickering with her when she wasnt making sense or being unreasonable, ive been helping deal with her deppression for our 3 year relationship and im still figuring it out. Before we started dating i had never dealt with real deppression before. Im Trying to learn to be supportive instead of argumentive when she starts having a meltdown (its hard to tell at first) 

Anyways, my question is, could this be a side effect of the medication? Should she talk to her psychiatrist to stop it? This is the 3rd time shes had a melt down in the past hmmm... 48 hours. Shes had them before early in our relationship, but honestly she hasnt gotten this bad in a while. Its been almost a year since she had an episode. Is this a side effect when switching meds?

But when bad things happen the sadness just kicks in, the emptiness just fills in my wntire body and i have no way to fight it. I just will be mopey for the entire week and avoid any type of human contact like not answering my parents and avoiding to talking with them. 

I really dont want to tell them anything about my emotional problems since they think that people who have depression and anxiety just need a little help from god. So when i tried to hint that i might want to get help they just tell me that i have to pray to god. Sorry if it was religious outta nowhere. So anyways i did tried praying. It still didn't help since i was still thinking of dark thoughts that are suicidal and kind of psychotic or cynical.

Because of all this ""men are pigs"", we shouldn't show emotions or get much attention, I'm starting to target myself and give myself a hard time for no reason.  
I'm an over-achiever, I'm more successful than most my peers, but I don't see the value in it. I appear perfectly fine outside, I'm a fun and talkative person around my friends, but it really shows with my significant other. I feel like i ""rely"" on her for emotional support and love, since I don't get it much elsewhere, so anytime something feels off with her, I immediately start getting anxious and turn into this ""babysitter"" partner (which is dumb by itself, because nobody can be happy 100% of the time). On one hand I'm afraid she's going to get used to it and expect me to help her and get upset when I'll step up for myself (it's happened before), even though she's the sweetest person I know and I can't imagine her do that. On the other hand, I instantly feel bad when I talk about it because ""I'm only doing it for attention"". Nobody said that, but because men get put in a bad spotlight, I feel like a scumbag for everything I do.  
And it's getting to the point where I hope my significant other will mess something up or cry or be in a bad mood, so I could help her out and be ""the good guy"", which is DEFINETELY not a healthy way of thinking! She never had a problem with helping me or listen to me rant, she enjoys listening to me and making me feel better, I just feel like a burden and an incompetent, attention-seeking piece of garbage, without really doing anything wrong.

147,"Is my mental illness making me a toxic gf? How do you take care of people around you despite being such a mess?

I know that this is long af but please bear with me I don’t have anyone with whom I can talk about this... 

Hi! I’m f20, bf is m25, been together for a year and a half. I was diagnosed when I was 18, i also suffer from anxiety and depression. All untreated

When we started dating, everything was cool. I was super affectionate, lots of sex, and I was a lot chiller too. 

But my mental health deteriorated within a year.
- I began having multiple anxiety attacks a day
- stopped talking to everyone
- lost a shit ton of weight
- easily irritated
-completely lost my libido
- very foggy memory, constantly overthinking or blanking out
- not being able to communicate and interpret my emotions
- difficulty with speech (slurring, can’t find the right words and talk like a normal person)
- substance abuse (weed)
Yeah...Not a very great person to be around i guess. 

My bf is of course aware of all this, and loves me dearly despite. He doesn’t have a lot of confidence in himself. He puts effort into our relationship, he sees that im very busy so he sometimes helps out with cleaning, making food, he’s always there to listen to me. 

I can tell that there are some things that bother him, but he doesn’t talk to me about it. I’ve told him many times that he shouldn’t communicate with me, but he still doesn’t, he’s not used to it.

I’m a lot less affectionate than I was before as I said, but we still cuddle and stuff, i just dont want to have sex, or make out, or be touched in my private parts. When i show him I need space, I can clearly see that he takes it badly. Like he might let out a sigh or he will hide his face under a pillow or something, it just makes me feel like he’s upset because i have boundaries? So it gets me irritated. His reaction is to completely submit and make a sad face saying that it doesn’t actually bother him so then i get even more frustrated thinking that I overreacted...its so intense I feel like my brain explodes. 
When I’m having one of my “episodes”, he doesn’t know what to do or say, so he doesnt do or say anything. Its hard for me to calm down, especially when there is someone else in the room who’s silently sitting in the background while you sob for hours. 

The physical affection thing is just an example, but its a recurring one. I get my libido comes back at one point, but it wont come back if he doesn’t give me some space. And once again, i have already told him this. 

He also knows about how i was groomed by an adult when I was 11, and later from ages 15-17 blackmailed by that man to send nudes, and sexually assaulted by him a couple of times, and these were my first “sexual experiences”, and ever since that intimacy has always been a problem. 

He tells me how he’s never been in love with someone as much as me, he wants us to move in together, he jokes around about marriage and kids and travelling together... its sweet but most times it makes me feel horribly anxious... all i can think is “i’m only 20”, its this horrible fear of being trapped in a situation i cant escape, like when that man abused me. 

I dont know what to do. Am I a bad person? He told me a couple times that our relationship is one sided, he does all the effort and i dont do any. He says “i know you have problems but so do i” and I agree with that. I feel shitty and selfish. He’s terrified that I will break up with him. But aren’t i just a shitty person if all I do is make him unhappy? Am I toxic? Should I take the time to get better by myself knowing that I will most likely not get back with him once we break up? I don’t know what to do... please help me... like by actually giving advice instead of judging me...

158,"Hey everyone,

So I met a guy in November of last year, and we began seeing each other. At the beginning of January, be broke things off saying that something was missing in the relationship and that he wasn't in love. As he did so he was crying and saying he didn't want to lose me. About a week later, we met up, I stayed over at his and we got back together again. Then 2 days later, he said the same thing, but then was like stay over, and I did, and he have been together since.

Throughout the relationship, we've been happy, although he has been distant on occasions and difficult to get to do things (he doesn't make plans with anyone and doesn't have many friends), although I've met all his friends, and we've seen each other almost every day.

Then yesterday, he said come over, and we sat down, and he started crying uncontrollably, saying that the same thing was happening. That something is missing, and that he's not in love. He is 41 and I am 33. He was never had a partner (we're gay, by the way). He said that what he imagines love to be he doesn't feel with me. One of his messages today was ""there are lots of types of love and we don't understand them all. Things will get better with time and you will always be in my heart"". He was crying and crying saying he didn't want to lose me. Then I left, and that was it. We've texted a few times, and he's like I love you and will always be here for you.

It's left me really sad because I thought we were on the right tracks.

We have never argued and get on really well. I also love him.

Do you guys think this could be an issue in his past (family - he came out at 36, has never had a partner, his father doesn't accept his sexuality and I've never met his parents, his outlook on life is generally quite gloomy on occasions I must admit, he has very few friends, also his sister is 42 and has also never had a partner)?

As I say, when we text each other, al he says is, well we've tried, there are lots of types of love, I really love you, but this isn't the love I imagine it should be. I personally think love and relationships involve work, and I said that, and he just replied saying that it shouldn't be an effort.

Since breaking up, we've been texting each other, often him initiating. This morning he wished me good morning and said he hasn't been able to sleep thinking about his decision.

Do you think this might be an issue with his mental health?

159,"Okay so may be slight exaggeration, but in a sense, most of my memories of those years (PARTICULARLY 2015) are just so foggy, almost as though it wasn’t real? 

I have relatively good memory and remember quite a lot of my child hood, I remember big events, I remember little events, just lots of things still clear enough to recall (obviously not toddler years but maybe around 8-12 is pretty clear). But when ever I try to remember my early teenage years I really can’t. All I remember was that they were absolutely terrible, no friends, new school, new country, moved away from father, crying at my birthday party, crying myself to sleep almost every night. But really.... that’s all I remember :/  

It even frustrates me at times because when looking back at photos, or even reading the 3 birthday cards I received , I just don’t remember them. And it’s not even just that particular moment, It’s people too. Going back to those birthday cards, I didn’t even remember who these people were, it took some social media digging to find them and I remember so little of our interactions. But their cards were so heartfelt? 

I didn’t realise when I moved countries again (back to where I was original from) that I essentially cut out 2 years both of memories and people :/ 

It’s frustrating and upsetting because it feels like I’m missing a part of my life and I feel as though I just cut out those people for no reason.

i was raised by my grandparents and this is where the problem is my ""parents"" were essentially in their late 70s when i was born they're both gone now and the rest of my family for what ever reason decided not to have kids

i had a half sister who is now gone due to drug overdose i have 2 cousins i never met so we are strangers to each other and that is it family wise

friend wise most are dead i was in the military in a particular Regiment that has a high mental stress level i'm pretty much the last one left standing from my section the rest are either in mental institutions or have lost their fight with the black dog i have very few friends only about 4 i talk to regularly and they are split up around the country and only 1 who has the time to talk to me daily

recently i have been feeling incredibly lonely i had a nightmare where i was 90 it was my birthday i awoke to an empty quiet home with not much in it (to be fair i am minimalist) there were some pictures of me through out my life in different places doing different things but always by myself in a selfie style not smiling or half smiling

i fear this is my future something deep within me just feels like something was stolen from me but i can't place it i was bullied out of school for basically being the rich kid in a poor school (i did attend private school but my grades fell and my grandparents did not want to pay for me to ""fuck around"" )

that's when i joined the military at 17 with guardian consent i only left early last year after 12 years and thrust into a world where i felt out of place

i get irrationally angry when i see people i went to HS with (who reconnected with me but don't talk) sharing photos of themselves in large groups they have had since high school or before why is it that the people who bullied me get rewarded with social enrichment and what was given to me? like what fighting in wars since i now realise was a literal kid and all my family and friends dead? was the PTSD my reward?

i get angry because i was never given the chance to form those groups or romantic relationships i was shunned for being different outcast picked on beat up when they were going to their first parties i was being punched in the face for rolling my eyes when they were globe trotting to ""find themselves"" i was fighting in the middle east

i feel robbed but cannot really pinpoint what exactly am i robbed of friends? a family? a partner?

ever since i was a kid i wanted my very own family and something a counseller said to me once used to keep me going ""you might not have a family now but one day you'll meet a girl and you'll make your own family""

but this is no longer possible i guess in a desperate attempt to form a family i dated 3 girls over the years all ended in me being cheated on after periods of domestic abuse i could not realise at the time after the third girl i was wary of Women in general but after i got PTSD that was compounded into a full blown phobia of women i need to carry these little pills around called beta blockers that stop panic attacks because something as simple as a woman saying ""You look nice"" or ""do you want to get a coffee and chat more?"" can cause me panic attacks

i don't know how to live like this anymore i find myself questioning if i have done something to deserve all this i mean i have to have done something right? the common factor in everything is me so i must be to blame some how i wish i could only understand why

and before anyone asks yes i have sought help they were only interested in managing my PTSD after that they said therapy doesn't help me with the other things and suggested i stop since i don't want to take drugs as that is what killed my sister and my mother  


eddit: also i know i'm going to get ""there there you will find some one you don't know what life will find for you"" i appreciate the sentiment but i'm past that to me that is false hope i just don't know how to live my life alone since humans are very social creatures there's not a lot of helpful material about being alone just ""do you have this massive ass family and 50 friends but you feel disconnected? then try being alone 1 day of the week and give yourself a little you time""  ",23Jun2020,6
165,"I have been through a lot in my life; poverty for most of my life, a few hospitalizations, evictions, homelessness, not being able to accept my sexuality or who I am, my parents splitting, a stressed relationship with the both of them, not being able to finish hs or attempt to get a GED, etc.

Before, I used to just hate the concept of going on, it was all so painful, not being able to move on from the past, and just cracking under pressure when working towards my future. I didn't think I'd live past the age of 18. I don't believe I'll make it to my next birthday.

I started taking everything one day at a time. I didn't feel better, but I wasn't in a constant state of being a crying mess. I still feel horrible, always exhausted to do the most menial of things, some days I just won't get out of bed until 9 PM. I have to force myself to eat because I've lost all appetite. I'm in a constant state of melancholy while I still break down and have psychotic episodes. have I have no drive to do or obtain anything in life at this point, I'm just here so I don't hurt those who care about me. I have to be around to make sure those I live with can keep a roof over their heads, because they can't manage their responsibilities or finances. I don't have the time or the ability to see a psychiatrist and get back on my meds that I haven't had for almost a year.

My dad managed to escape the house and make a living for himself despite the odds and is quite different from the rest of his family (he is middle-class compared to them, working-class). He has gone to therapy for many years to resolve his PTSD from growing up in the abusive home. Anyway, my dad isn't schizophrenic and has no huge mental health disorders.

172,"Heres an example of what im talking about:

\- Im helping my cousin book her wedding and this morning we decided that i should call a paticular venue to ask questions about it. And for some reason, it made me incredibly nervous. All the way up to when i called them i was getting nervous about it, agitated, uncomfortable, releasing cortisol so i needed to go for shit twice in just a few hours.

 it felt like i was about to have an interview and if i fail i will die or something, but no, it was sometehing thats completely normal and theres 0 reason to be nervous. 

this happens all the time, and its even worse when its something important (ie an exam, interview etc). once im doing them, im fine, and realise how stupid i was to get nervous. but then, it happens again, and again, even though i know its nonsensical.

I know that logically it makes 0 sense, i tell myself that im getting nervous over the most ridiculous things but it doesnt help.

these events have a big impact on my life, for example with the wedding, i spent around 4-5 hours leading up to the call doing pretty much nothing because i was nervous, i couldnt concentrate on work or anything.

my thoughts about what causes this are about me thinking too much?, i dont have a lot of friends and especially recently im spending a lot of time alone, to the point where im going to work and youd think ive been in solitary confinement for a few months, its giving me a lot of time to think. 

i have a voice speaking in my head for the majority of the day about various things, including having a conversation with myself where i tell myself something i found out (even though i already know it...), i dont know if im going a bit insane or if its related to the issue of being nervous. Ive tried meditation, and in the moment its good, but i dont really see the effects afterwards.

174,"I did make a post before, but it was on a separate issue, and as I was writing it, I remembered I could also ask about this here.

I have lots of people in my head. I've had them for as long as I can remember, and only recently have I realised that they are there, prior to this I've thought I've been talking to real people. 

It's not the kind of ""talking to myself"" that's like, ""Oh hey me!"" ""Hi me how are you?"" 

There are separate people in my head. None of them are versions of real people. They all don't exist. They all have different personalities, lives and appearances which I know. Sometimes it'll just be one person with me, at other times there will be many. 

I've spoken with family and friends about this, my friends laughed it off, believing it to be a joke, whereas my family simply said its nothing to worry about but since then the following happened

I've never been able to actually see them before, however recently I have the memory of seeing one of them. It's not a long memory, and it's not very clear but I all I remember is waking up and seeing one of them sitting by my bedside sleeping. I'm not sure if it was a dream or not, but this has me slightly worried.

They don't tell me to do bad things, its just like having one of your best friends with you at all times.

There are two places they can be, they can be out in this world with me, talking to me and helping me, or they can be inside my head, talking to each other or just doing anything.

There have been some nights where I can't sleep because all I can hear is them talking. If they are in my head I can't tell what they are saying or doing. It's like trying to listen to a conversation on the other side of a door or watching someone do something through frosted glass.

175,"Hi all! As someone with depression and anxiety I'm never really sure if my judgements, decisions, opinions are sound. I find that I often invalidate myself...or am I just arguing with the part of me that takes things too personally? I was gaslite a lot as a child and this adds to my inability to trust myself, figure out what's best for me.

Example, I feel like people don't treat me ""right"" a lot. But I'm not sure if I'm just taking things too personally. Example, I often don't like how my boyfriend talks to me and how I feel when I'm around him. He can be short, snarky, and what I think is selfish. How do I KNOW though? How do I know I'm not just being sensitive and unreasonable? I waver back and forth between being like ""he's so rude!"" and ""you just need to be more loving!"" without resolution, feeling more confused and upset than ever.

I feel this way with friends and coworkers too. And of course seeing a pattern in my life probably means I'm the problem, but generally I feel like I end up in situations I'm not happy in and feel like I can't talk to other people, find a way to work it out. 

Maybe this boils down to me being unsure of what I want and need and how to ask for it/give it to myself. But part of it is I'm afraid what I want or think I need (I.E a boyfriend who talks to me more respectfully) isn't realistic. Or I'm just seeing a situation too negatively and need to change my mentality to be more accepting of others/life.

178,"So this person has been feeling depressed for a while. Symptoms such as no motivation, lost of interests, feeling restless and feeling lost in life.

Then work took a bad turn where he had problems with his boss and being asked to go by his boss with a mistake he made after replying very rudely to his boss offending him further . He felt he was disliked at work. During this stressful period, he started to feel irritable that he felt monitored and lost control by throwing a cup. It was also then that he started to plunge further into full blown depression such as crying almost daily, lost of appetite, insomnia, feeling sad, unmotivated, lost in life, withdrawn. 

He found another job and started to feel better with hopes. But unfortunately, workplace was not all saints. He again felt some interpersonal stress where some people were unfriendly to him and work stress. This period of time, he got very sad again because some small group of people didn’t like him. He got so emotionally affected by this small group of people that his depression came back such as the crying, loss of appetite etc. however, he was also taking things very personally. If a person didn’t smile at him, he would think the person doesn’t like him. during this period of time, he was easily triggered, suspicious of people at his workplace and emotionally unstable such as swinging from up to down. He also offended his boss as he started to behave rudely and weirdly. The bullying was bad and he started to feel very stress at work that he will sit whole day in his cubicle not drinking not going toilet to avoid people at all. He started to felt monitored but I would say with his eccentric behaviors, it was normal for people to notice him more or talk about him. So can’t say for sure, if it is purely the start of his delusions. 

He lost his job again but he felt a relief from it instead. At the same time, anger came to him as he had suffered a considerable amount of bullying at work. He started to feel triggered whenever he saw things that reminds him of his previous workplace such as names, places, people. He will have uncontrollable flashbacks out of sudden and unable to sleep due to these if it occurs at night. He have a strong sense of avoidance to things that will remind him of those experiences. He will feel anger, resentment, guilt and shame

During this period of time, he continued to feel resentful, shame and sadness that his depression worsen. He was also easily triggered by small incidents or criticism. 

At this same time, he started to have delusions that one of his workplace female colleague liked him so much that she was stalking him, monitoring him to ‘protect’ and ‘help’ him behind the scenes quietly. 

Question: 

1. could his delusion be a response his mind came up with to ‘protect’ him from the suffering he suffered? Something like PTSD occupied with delusions as a response to the trauma.

2. Could he has been delusional since the very beginning that he felt he was being disliked by people despite back then this thought was nothing major/serious initially. was he having paranoia delusions? Then later developed a erotomania delusions as well? 

3. He has minor signs of depression way before shit hits. Could that be worsening of depression due to work stress to cause psychosis such as delusions?

4. Could he have borderline personality disorder? A little more info on his childhood. He has anger management issues since young and have some sort of black and white thinking such as if the friends back our from their outing last minute, he would feel betrayed and have outbursts. Or the friends do not have time to meet him, he will feel that way too. He also has extreme thinking such as to cut off family totally when they did things he felt it was unacceptable to him. He will do things that he regret later due to his outbursts. He was feeling empty in life, actually until now too. Doesn’t know what he wants in life. He is very emotional. Up and down swing greatly that could suspect he has bipolar. His black and white thinking caused him problems at work such as he couldn’t understand those ‘wrong’ things in society. He was also taking things very personally. If a person didn’t smile at him, he would think the person doesn’t like him. He did have a bad childhood due to family.

5. Could he be having more than 1 diagnosis? And it helps to worsen each other. 

He definitely has psychosis, delusion, depression. No hearing of things or seeing things although it looks like schizophrenia, so that’s out.",23Jun2020,1
179,"I know this is me 100% over analyzing things, but I've just been running around in circles about it in my mind.

You know how on snapchat you can block people from viewing your story?

I was talking with a friend and they mentioned how X posted something to their story, but in my head I was like ""oh that's weird, I never saw that"" but I have story notifies on for that person and I'm really close with them so I thought it was weird I wouldn't have seen it.

Now since then I have been driving myself crazy wondering if they blocked me from their snapchat story and worrying about it. We're close so I don't know why they would have blocked me

But it's also something I feel like is hella awkward and petty if I go ""hey did you block me from your snapchat story?"" because the only way I would ask that is if I was talking about them to someone, which that part isn't a big deal because it wasn't about anything bad, but it's such a weird thing to ask someone I feel like.

I don't think it would have been on a private story I'm not on, because when I was talking to the other person we were talking about private stories before so I feel like they would have mentioned if it was posted on their private story.

But I also don't want to seem like an ass if I ask why I'm blocked but I'm not blocked I'm just not on their private story if it is their private story...

I just don't know how to make me not think about this anymore or how to ask them...and it's DRIVING ME BONKERS. because I just keep thinking I did something wrong.

BUT HOW DO I STOP OVER THINKING THIS OR SOLVE IT",23Jun2020,2
180,"  For now five years my brother has been stuck in a hole and won’t do anything about it. 
   Five years ago (when he was 18) he was supposed to start uni, but he constantly lied to my parents about it (telling them he was doing alright, he was passing exams, etc) when in reality it was the complete opposite. He went to classes as he pleased, did no homework  and took no exams. This went on for about 1 year. When it was way too obvious he wasn’t doing shit, he told my parents that he had changed his courses and was starting a new career from zero. My parents were not at all pleased but tried to be patient with him as he’s always had issues and told him that it was ok. 
 This same story repeated itself about two more times in the following years, but every time we tried to confront him about it he would get violent (he throws things at my mom, beats my dad) and later play the victim saying it’s all my parents fault for sending him to a catholic middle school (which makes no sense because a) your middle school doesn’t define your mental prowess or whatever b) this school actually had a pretty good level of education.)
 The source of all his issues is that when he was little my parents wouldn’t pay him much attention because of work and weren’t very caring to him at times. My dad, having been raised in a military family and later gone to military school, was very strict and would sometimes use violence on us to teach us discipline and stuff. As a result, my two brothers and I grew up very resentful with him and when we were little we downright hated him and refused to talk to him. However, my other brother and I got over it and now know how to stand up to my father ,with no violence, and can put him in his place. 
  But on the other hand, my eldest brother (the one this post is about) is really messed up about it. Even though my dad has apologized to him years ago, he won’t let go. It’s as if his only response is violence, and not only towards my dad but also my mom (who has always tried to protect and help him). When my mother tries talking to him he always snaps and throws things at her, but later always demands money as if nothing happened. When she doesn’t make tasty food he complains and tells her to do something better for him next time. He is always bugging her and asking(more like demanding) her to search for a job for him (she once did get him a pretty good job, but, as always, he, having no compromise whatsoever and always slacking off, lost it in a matter of days). 
 He’s not a good person tbh. He must be the second most selfish person I know (after my father) and has no consideration whatsoever for other people (not even his girlfriend), stealing money from my mother, my brother and I, eating food we specifically labeled for special events (friend’s bdays, Mother’s Day, etc) and not even bothering to help my mother (50 yo at the time) when she straight up fell head first on the pavement. 
 Also, because of his resentfulness and bitterness towards both my parents, he refuses to help around the house and won’t do even the simplest tasks (such as putting his dirty dishes in the dish washer). The only ’chore’ he does is walking the dog, but you basically have to beg him and most of the times my other brother does it. He’s got all the third floor of the house for himself and stays there all day unless he wants food (he’s overweight). He basically lives in a hotel. 
 At this point I don’t know what to think. I really doubt he has any sympathy, and I’m really worried about what he’ll become once he leaves the house. My parents, especially and mostly, my mother) have given him so many great job and education opportunities but he won’t take them or always blames my mom and dad when he fails. 
 The thing is, I know he’s reallly sad inside but he doesn’t seem to have any intention to get better. Instead of working on his issues he seems to rejoice in pointing out all the things my parents have done wrong.

181,"I’m sure I’ll get some negative feedback about this, but please try to be kind and helpful. I really need some constructive suggestions. We’ve been together over a decade and it has improved at times but only for a few weeks and then it’s back to business as usual. It’s really exhausting for me. I love them so much and I just want them to be able to enjoy life And not worry it away.

My partner has bad anxiety. They claim to never be stressed and be “fine” but from the outside I can see that’s not the case. 

They are a workaholic and constantly talk about their job. To a point where I hardly see them and when I do we can’t talk about anything but work. We tried to only talk about work 15 minutes a night but that only lasted a couple days before it was back to near constantly. 

They can never sit down. Never sit still. Never have quiet. They are cleaning or tidying constantly. Very overprotective about their things. Has multiple vices that they just can’t live without. As in they’ve thrown a fit and we’ve left a vacation after a day because they didn’t have it. 

There are less expensive options for their caffeine (and we need to save money) but they just can’t use anything other than drinks that come in tiny bottles. Even if I make super strong tea and put it in the tiny bottles. That’s just one of the vices - nothing outright terrible for them, well except nicotine, but the way they can’t live without them is pretty bad. 

They are married to their rituals and if something gets changed it’s always a big deal. Can’t watch anything other than the one or two tv shows that they like. Always feels like they are running behind and have to rush to get ready and at the same time will sit in the bathroom on tiktok for 30 minutes. 

Can NEVER be wrong. And if they are in a conversation they don’t like they just shut it down and say “we’re not taking about this,” even when it’s not anything to get upset about. I try so hard to foster good communication and they just get so angry. 

Gets aggravated if I ask for any kind of help - example: I made dinner and had to run to the other room to help our child and asked that they make me a piece of toast. They huffed about it and said I’m going to microwave it. I said can I have it toasted? And that made them mad. And asking for a glass of water with it was upsetting for them too. If I want to suggest a tv show or a song, I get met with aggression. Not violence, just always a bad attitude about not getting their way. They claim it’s always what I want, but in reality it’s always a struggle to have anything equal. 

I’ve gently suggested that they seem anxious and tried to find things they like to do to relax and they will never do it. Getting them to take a walk with me, even if it would feel good, will never happen cause they don’t want to get too far from home. They’ve admitted they would benefit from hypnosis but I think that might be a way of saying - I want to go to sleep and have the problems go away, aka, I don’t want to work on myself I just want it fixed. 

Anyone have experience guiding someone like this to a solution? I know I can’t tell them they have to get help cause they would never do it. They have to realize they need it. And I think they might realize that, but won’t act on it.",23Jun2020,3

We only talk through DMs, since she lives in another state, and she has completely opposite personalities when talking to me there. Sometimes she is really sweet and friendly, sometimes she's completely depressed and sometimes she's very aggressive.

These changes can happen multiple times a day, and are very unexpected.
For example, if I show her one of my artworks she proceeds to put herself down, saying she's talentless and useless unlike me. But if I don't show her my artworks, she gets mad and says that I hate her and that I don't love her the way she loves me.

In between these bursts of anger/sadness she is cool and lively. The pattern that I'm seeing is that whenever I tell/show something I did or one of my interests, she either gets mad at me or proceeds to put herself down (or both).

She is like this with our friends too, saying she refuses to talk to me in the group-call because she's tired of being stupid and getting played by me. But if I don't talk to her too, she gets pissed.

I already told her to stop doing this multiple times. She disregards it either by scoffing, ignoring or saying that it is my fault that I don't like her enough. She changes to the sweet person for a day or so, to then come back to the same habits. I think that she may have been having mental health issues, but whenever I try to tell her to go see someone, she gets pissed.

I don't know what is happening, and I don't feel like she is narcissistic (which is commonly seen in gaslighting) and I really don't know how to deal with her.

TLDR;: My cousin constantly puts herself down, gets mad at me but then acts sweetly as if it was all a joke. I don't know if this is gaslighting and how to approach her about this.",23Jun2020,2
187,"I had a first meeting with a therapist. He started asking me about what makes me worried. He also asked me what my life goal is. Well I said for me it is being able to enjoy my life. For me it means that every facet of my life, including my relationship with loved ones is balanced, so I feel content with everything.

He then proceeded with a monologue saying that I should reconsider my life goals. That I am not a teenager or a young person who just needs to ""enjoy their life"", that I need to feel responsible for my family.

That made me upset for several reasons (One of them is that I felt that he was condescending), so I wrote a feedback letter to him that he upset me, explaining the reasons it made me upset and asking if he thinks we should continue the therapy. 

He responded by saying this is not his speciality, that he is behavioral specialist while I am asking for psychoanalysis.

I am confused now, he was the one that initiated the conversation, giving me life advice. And when I told him how I feel about that, suddenly it is not his job.

The issue is that he is a well respected doctor with many positive reviews on the Internet, with many years of experience (He looks as in late 60s). So I can't just say he is a hack. Is this just a normal matching issue, or is he being rude to me? Or am I the one being unreasonable?

So this is how the difference between psychoanalysis vs behavioral therapy was explained to me https://www.angieslist.com/articles/behavioral-therapy-vs-psychoanalysis.htm.

I wouldn't mind trying any of them. I only fear that if I don't start improving soon, I may relapse into terminal depression again.

Should I expect repetition of this situation again if I go to another behavioral therapist?

I don't know how many therapists I can get through before losing hope with them.

188,"I don’t know a single person in my generation, including myself (25F), that doesn’t struggle with some type of mental health issue... whether it’s anxiety, depression, eating disorders, bipolar disorder, addiction, or a combination of others. What gives?",23Jun2020,3
189,"I’m still not used to reddit and not sure if I should post here but I wanted to get some advice and also wanted to just spill everything out I guess.

This is going to be a little long...
So I (17F) lost my mother a few months back and have been seeing my school counsellor. 

I think on the surface I’m doing okay but sometimes I feel like I haven’t really let the reality set in, that I’m just suppressing my feeling and running away from them. I don’t want my dad to think that I’m not okay.  At the same time, I’m starting to feel like other issues I have are starting to be amplified.

First, I find it basically impossible to open up to people and be vulnerable to even people that I’m close to and I think it’s affecting my ability to form meaningful relationships. I probably wouldn’t have opened up to the counsellor if it weren’t for a teacher who took me out of class and accompanied me to the counsellor’s office (I’m extremely grateful to him for helping me to get the help I needed) While I generally get along well with my friends and classmates, I can’t bring myself to tell anyone about my personal issues and till now, no one knows about my mum’s death. I’m jealous of people who can be honest about their feelings to others. I feel lonely.

Second, I hate myself? I can’t help but feel that when people compliment me, whether about my appearance or character, it’s a white lie and that there is nothing actually good about me. When I see a quality in a person which I don’t like, I can’t help but feel like I have the same problem, and that my thoughts about that particular quality is simply a projection of my own insecurity. 

I tend to get anxious over seemingly trivial things, like asking questions in class, texting people (even if they are really close to me.) I tend to fuss and overthink about things like using a particular punctuation or emoji and what the receiving person will think or infer. Similarly, when people text me, I’ll over analyse the message. Recently, I had a breakdown in school,  I wanted to ask the counsellor if I could talk to her, took me 30mins to send out one line of text. I feel like people have better things to do than to entertain me, I feel like I’m not worthy of people’s time

I have thoughts of hurting myself. I’m too afraid of the physical pain to actually do anything but can’t help but feel like I just want to disappear but if I did I know my father will be devastated.

i’m afraid that I’m exaggerating my feelings, I’m afraid that what I’m feeling is actually normal and I’m just over reacting. I know that I’m lucky and privileged that I have people that will help if I ask for it. But should I even be asking for help? Do I even need help?

193,"So to give some background, my dad has a lot of issues. He’s a recovering alcoholic/junkie. He’s been in 2 failed marriages and has no contact with my older brother, his eldest son. 

He feels that he needs some to be responsible for. He has been taking care of someone since he was a pre-teen. He says he can’t be alone. He got a dog a few years ago but she didn’t seem to help him. 

About a year ago he came into contact with this woman, who is a current junkie. He relapsed and it put a serious strain on our relationship. He even took drug charges for her and now he’s a 3 time felon waiting to be indicted. When he was in jail I happened to find out I was gonna be a father myself. Once he got out he went right back to her and continued doing drugs. 

Flash forward to after my daughter, his granddaughter, is born and the woman ends up screwing him over again and he drops her. Our relationship improves. He gets clean and everything is good. 

Now we’re in the present. 

This woman contacts my dad again. They reconcile. My dad tells her that if she’s gonna be in his life she has to be clean so she goes to rehab and gets clean. Well she got out a few weeks ago and she’s trying to jump into mine and my child’s life and I don’t want it. I don’t like her. I don’t trust her in the slightest bit and my dad is trying to convince me that she’s not a bad person and to give her a chance to be around my kid and I don’t want it. 

So he drops it for a bit until like 3 days ago. He’s trying harder than ever to convince me to give her a chance and let her be around my kid but she’s gone off her meds, I forgot to mention she’s a paranoid schizophrenic, and she’s hearing voices and making insane accusations against her own family and my dad and it’s hurting him. He’s broken down and cried quite a bit in the last two days because of it but he won’t let her go. The weird part that I don’t get is that they’re not together. She’s with another man and he’s a mentally and emotionally abusive person but she refuses to leave him. 

To summarize, my dad is in love and obsessed with a woman that leads him on and hurts him and has ruined his life in multiple ways in the span of a year and he won’t let go. I just don’t get it and I need advice.",23Jun2020,1
194,"I've had suicidal thoughts for years, for as long as I can remember. I've never gave them too much time inside my head, but lately, for the last couple of months, I've had this recurring thought that the only reason I haven't tried anything in this regard is that a lot of people who love me would be very hurt. 

I really don't believe in humanity as a society anymore, everywhere I look I see things I despise, in politics and culture especially, from all the sides. 

I don't want to go back to my country, I don't want to stay where I am, I hate my job, I don't know what to do in the future, I don't know what I like. I don't know who I am or who I want to be, or if I even want to BE.

200,"Sorry for the long post/rant.

My partner and I are both in our 30s. For the last 6 months he has been away working overseas, but we've been texting everyday. I know that he isn't too happy living there because work environment is extremely stressful, laws are strict, and he doesn't have much social life.

Around a month ago I started to feel that he has become more distant. At first, I didn't understand and thought he didn't care much about us anymore. We had a talk, and things seemed to be ok again. One day, he forgot that we agreed to talk, so I was upset. This time he stopped responding for days, which is extremely out of ordinary. When he came back, he said that he's fed up with trying to meet everyone's demands. He feels trapped, sick, and depressed. He just doesn't want to speak to anyone.  

I didn't think I was demanding much more than what I deserve as a partner (I don't ask to talk or video call everyday, just a couple times a week or two; only ask that we stick to our scheduled talk/call). But I had depression before. I understand what that's like, so I backed off. I said that he can take as much time and space as he wants until he feels better. He was there for me when I was dealing with my depression, this time it's my turn to be there for him. I no longer ask for video calls. I talk when he wants to talk. I still send good morning / night texts but not much during the day unless he says something. And because he rarely asks me questions about my day/life these days, I don't talk much about it as I want to prioritise his feelings.

I understand, I do, but now I can feel my mental health slowly going downhill. I know he's having a hard time, but I can't help feeling unloved and insignificant. Whenever I speak to him it's like walking barefoot on broken glasses. I'm constantly afraid I might say something wrong. I feel hurt because between his friends and me, I think it's me he'd rather push away. Feeling that way then makes me feel so selfish, because I'm supposed to be understanding and fully support him. It's such a confusing feeling. I cry almost everyday. I feel like I'm trying to hold to something that I've already lost. (of course I never mention all this to him). 

Am I doing it right to give him space the way I do? How can I do that while taking care of my own mental health, too? We've been together a long time, and I do want this relationship to work. But right now I'm genuinely don't know what to do.",23Jun2020,2
201,"I've been struggling with mental health for a while and my home situation doesn't make things alot better. My mother kind of neglects me. She believes that her senses are super sensitive and even the slightest input from her surroundings is too much for her.

My father, on the other hand, scares me. My parents have never been people I feel comfortable around, but quarantine has been taking it's toll on my dad.

202,"There's something that I want to talk about, which I can't bring myself to discuss with anyone I know, in real life. It's a shameful habit that I can't shake. *I get bored of the people I talk to.* 

The earliest memory I have of abandoning those closest to me, took place as a pre-teen. It was a group of people that I called my friends, online. I genuinely enjoyed speaking to them. I fit in quite well too, yet with no reason or explanation, I left. 

I continue to do the same with anyone that I meet in real life and on the internet. It starts the same- I meet someone, we hit it off well, then after a short or lengthy period, I leave. I can’t say that I entirely regret hurting people when I do, either. My feelings are almost... indefinite? I’m capable of **feeling** and **creating** bonds, but relationships easily mean nothing to me, in the end. They’re discardable and become a nuisance to maintain the longer I stay. 

I started to consider that perhaps this pattern links to experiencing abandonment myself. Yet, I haven't. Sure, my father had no part in my childhood, but he didn't “abandon” us. Does his absence play apart in how I am now, regardless? 

Nowadays, I no longer develop *strong* bonds with the people I meet, leaving me with one foundation; my family. I feel that it’s better this way. A *neutral* ground I can get by.

When I was a very, very young, my father was very proud of my creativity. I used to make crafts, draw and write poems and blogs. But I lost my interest in crafts when my mom said I make a lot of mess. I lost my interest in art when people said I am unoriginal. I lost my interest in writing when I just couldn't feel much anymore.
I'd say the year 2016 was when everything messed up in every way possible. I joined a new school and was bullied. That year was when I really started feeling that I was feeling parts of me. When nothing excited me anymore. I had no actual friends until 2018 but then in 2019, I lost them too and I've been mostly alone since. I gained a lot of weight. My grades dropped.

206,"(17M) So for a good while now I have had a deep uncomfort with expressing my happiness to others, mostly my family which makes me feel really guilty. It not a case of I'm incapable of doing it, I choose not to. Sometimes at the dinner table in attempts to not show I'm about to laugh I'll let food burn my mouth so I no one can see me laugh. Every now and again I get episodes where I'm happy, talkative, joyful and content for days to maybe weeks at a time (ranging from about 2 days to 3 weeks) but then before I know it I'm thrown back into a state of being incredibly sad for no reason. Nothing triggers it, it just happens out of nowhere and lasts so much longer than my happiness episodes do. I don't want to talk to people, I find things I usually like boring, I get irritated easily (especially when people look at me, it really ticks me off for some reason) and of course, not wanting to show any sign of slight joy that may come in those times. 

A new thing that happens when I'm sad now is the incredible urge to give up on my goals for the future. I know exactly what I want to do with my life but now I just see failure in all my plans, I see no reason to chase those dreams and why I should ever try anymore because of the whole chance of everything blowing up in my face. I just feel destined for failure everyday while I will watch all my peers/sibling become everything they wanted in life and more.

Over the past 9 months i've been noticing i worrying trend in my porn consumption habbits. I started watching animated SFM porn a while ago and stumbled upon some animated videoes of a woman having sex with wolves in a forest.
From there on i started watching more and more of that type of thing, and fantazising about turning into a wolf and having sex with women like that.

I've never watched any real videoes of bestiality. The most extreme i've ever gone has been looking over bestiality themed forums and reading about peoples experiences.


All of this has been extremely distressing for me. I feel like that my brain is broken and that i may have contributed to it through watching too much porn and desensitizing myself to normal sex.

So the point of this post is what follows:

I went with our eldest daughter (our car is broken and she had to call an Uber for us because I don't have a debit or credit card) and we had such a NICE day out. :) We went to Subway and ate outside. It was such a boost for my mental health because it was normality again...people walking around on their cellphones, walking their dogs, and skateboarding around Courthouse Square. Normal--wonderful--and HOT. It is supposed to be near 90 F today, and it feels it. Oooof. It was still so nice to be out in the sunshine and fresh air. My psych did a telemedicine appointment with me while I was downtown, too...so I felt so business-like lol. I was walking with our daughter and she was on her cellphone and I was on my cellphone...it was just so good to be doing things I was normally doing.

Anyway, that is all for me. I am hot and tired and my iron is crashing (I pray I don't get my period right now because that would NOT be a good time) and I have to go food shopping as soon as I feel a little better.

213,"Hi all. For the past several years, I've been struggling a bit with depressive thoughts and overall mental health (never attempted suicide or had any severe breakdowns, though). It's been affecting me a lot at work lately (I have zero motivation and feel almost scared to do any work), so I decided to see my doctor and a therapist, who diagnosed me with Dysthymia. I have my bi-weekly meeting with my boss tomorrow (to talk about any random topics related to the job), and am wondering if it might be time to mention it. Some things to note:

1) My work ethic has been in DRASTIC decline the past few weeks. AFAIK, nobody has caught on yet (we are all currently working from home - which has only hurt my work ethic more), but I feel like it's only a matter of time.

2) I'm fairly certain I don't want to keep this job (as my gf and I feel it's the root of a lot of my mental health issues), but I'd rather not get fired, and have no idea where else to go right now.

3) This is my first job out of college, it pays well and has good benefits, but it's pretty corporate and I'm not very passionate about it. I'm early 20s.

4) My boss knows I have been seeing a doctor, but doesn't know for what.

5) My boss is an extreme workaholic and very passionate about their work, and definitely seems to think that I am, too (I am neither).

Based on what I've said, does it sound like it would behoove me to explain to my boss that Dysthimia has been impacting my work ethic, or would that only be to my detrement?",23Jun2020,4

Today I made my way to work and as soon as I got dropped off outside the shopping centre I started crying. This intensified the closer I got to the store in which I work and at one point I was crying so hard I couldn’t walk and then had to hold on to a wall. I decided to go into the toilets and sat down in a cubicle and just cried and sobbed and felt like I couldn’t breathe. My “self” felt like it wanted to run away but my knees were locked...almost like I wanted to curl into a ball. 

I started gently rocking and hugging myself and trying to breathe and regain control and the second wave hit me and I was sobbing again, quietly screaming, pounding the wall with my fist.

I went to my friend’s house and he gave me a hug, made me tea and sat me on the sofa while he worked, then we had lunch and I went home. It helped a little bit but there was this voice inside my head saying, “what if it wasn’t that bad? What if I’m just exaggerating?” 

And I’m scared it’s gonna happen again because it hit me right out of the blue and it was so overwhelming and scary.",23Jun2020,1
218,"I feel terrible complaining as so many have it way worse and my main problem is in my head - I am having a hard time controlling my fear, I keep lashing out on myself and others when people get too close to me or are not wearing masks, I keep getting angry over random things and going into a brief hysterics before I catch myself. It's embarrassing and I hate being like this.

I don't know how to be happy and ooze kindness and politeness and niceness and all the good stuff - I just feel so rotten inside.

I have always been able to fake it more or less but now that I communicate with so much less people I just can't make myself do that as much. I really don't like the person I am right now. I am making others' and my own life worse for no good reason.

Edit: My OCD has also worsened but I know all the tools to handle it so I'm just ignoring all the thoughts and urges. But it's contributing to the 'fun', of course(",23Jun2020,1
219,"My brother is in his mid twenties and has mild autism. He's struggled with finding close friends and currently lives with our parents and works the nightshift at a warehouse so he's awake while most people are sleeping. The one friend he does have is really self absorbed and doesn't seem to care about my brother much, if at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I found some of my brother's facebook posts and they seem very dark and disturbing. In his latest post he says ""I haven't harnessed the true potential because I am a fallible walking corpse with a preset personality that I despise. There are moments of clarity but I am mainly guided by fated vows to the ghastly imagery that unfolds in my perception field as I continue to stimumate the senses that elate me so"". He's posted other things in the past that have seemed problematic but it seemed like it was just an angsty phase and he stopped for a little while. I've continued to occasionally check out his feed and was alarmed by this latest post.  My mother agreed it was serious and started trying to find some resources while my dad seems to think that ""depression = sad"" and went to talk to my brother and concluded that he was fine after a brief chat. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think he'd voluntarily go to a therapist so my mom suggested finding a therapist who can act more as a life coach for him so he can talk to someone and get some advice and help out. My brother is into poetry and philosophy so my mother and I decided that finding a therapist that is versed in philosophy would be ideal, but we have no idea where to start. We live in the Atlanta area in Georgia.

221,"Hey guys. If u don't know me, I'll briefly summarise. I'm not a good person, simple as. I posted before about my anger and hate problems that effectively make me a hostile and disagreeable person.

Basically, I wanna get some help, but for a long time now I have considered therapy to be a 50/50 gamble, in which it'll either help or making things worse, and I've always thought of psychologists as pretend doctors with somewhat meaningless qualifications. I tried it twice with different psychologists, and was sat on a awaiting list for 6 months while my mental health continued to spiral downwards. 

Needless to say, I am not impressed with therapists and as of now consider them ineffective to get me to where I want to be, but I can't rely on myself to make progress, leading me to question whether I need to try therapy again to make progress. 

I would be grateful for any advice should u wish to dispense it. 

Sorry if this was blunt.",23Jun2020,2
222,"Narcissism is primarily characterized by grandiose sense of self, an excessive requirement for validation, and low empathy. It’s really important to understand that this is not an absolute. These traits lie on a continuum or spectrum, and not everyone who displays them warrants a diagnoses. A person can be very grandiose, but have a lot of empathy. Similarly, have low empathy and not exhibit an inflated sense of self. Or have a very fragile concept and need inexhaustible amounts of validation because they can’t generate it internally - but not consciously want to hurt anyone. Look at all the insta gurus. 

What looks like “narcissism” can be learned behavior, self-protective mechanisms, or disrupted development - where a child didn’t move past egocentric ( which all children are) view of the world. It is also very often a trauma  response: a constructed identify that protects a very fragile core. 

The term narcissism has been weaponized. The colloquial narrative of “narc abuse” has led to an unnecessary amount of people being labeled narcissist. There really are not that many narcissist walking around. Nor is everyone who might have a clinical diagnoses of narcissistic personality disorder is a Machiavellian mastermind whose life objective is to shatter other people. It’s not okay to slap the label on narcissist on everyone who doesn’t behave in an ok way.

It makes me really sad to think everyone who receives this diagnosis will then think they must be some kind of a monster. When we use clinical nomenclature like this, we add to misinformation, we shame people with mental illness, we lower our own empathy, and significantly contribute to stigma.

This was made worse with the pandemic, and having limited contact with my girlfriend and not being able to play sports or work out.

Excuse my rant of sorts, I just wanted someone to know",23Jun2020,1
225,"I don't understand why I have to say I want to kill myself in order to get adequate care. How much further do I have to take things to be taken seriously? I'm tired of being angry. I'm tired of having inappropriate, irate, rude responses to people. I'm tired of screaming at my mom. I'm tired of making her feel like shit. 

I started typing this yesterday when I had a clearer head, but now I'm in the middle of an episode so it's more difficult to gather my thoughts and I'm having a really hard time building sentences and trying to organize this in a logical way.

Basically, I moved back home with my mom in the beginning of quarantine. The beginning was hard and I had to do an intensive outpatient program for depression and anxiety. About a year ago I was told I was diagnosed with BPD but they didn't put it in my file, so when I bring it up to my providers, they don't know what I'm talking about and basically doubt me. During quarantine the same thing basically happened as well. I was very depressed so they put me into an intensive outpatient program where I would have phone apts 1-2 times per week. A therapist thought I was bipolar while I thought I was BPD, so she didn't put BPD in my file and kind of just ignored me when I said I felt like BPD was correct and bipolar wasn't. 

So essentially, for the IOP program they pretty much only tried to talk to me about why I'm mad about things and how to like control my anger. Which is fine, great, yeah, I know I have an anger problem. But I need fucking help figuring out WHY I get so angry, not just like fixing the anger once it happens? I come across so high-functioning and nice that I feel like my providers don't think I'm capable of the abuse and rage I engage in so I'm constantly feeling like I'm getting inadequate care. I try so hard to articulate how evil I can be, but I feel like they think I'm exaggerating. Once I stopped feeling like I wanted to die, my IOP ended so obviously they thought I was good, even tho I'm definitely not. IOP was the only way for me to get weekly or even twice monthly therapy through my insuracne, so I feel at a complete loss now. I feel like I'm being given the very minimum amount of care I can be.

I think I'm at a point where I need to just shell out the money and pay for a therapist that I KNOW is experienced with my kinds of issues. I'm verbally abusive to my mom nearly every day. I've told her I hate her, screamed at her, slammed doors in our house, ripped my clothes off my body in front of her, just lowkey pretty scary stuff. I don't understand why they don't listen when I've said that? Is that not bad? What do I have to do to be taken seriously? I feel like I have to hurt myself or someone else to be taken seriously at this point which maybe is crazy but it's just how I feel. I would never hurt someone else and don't want to, but I would hurt myself. I also don't want to do that either, but it's just hard not to feel like maybe they would take me more seriously if I started threatening to hurt myself. It's just not fair. I want to get better so bad, I don't want to be like this anymore. I don't want to scare people or make them not want to be around me. I've been trying really hard to redirect my anger when I have outbursts and not hurt myself or destroy anything important. At the beginning of quarantine, I shattered my ihpone 7+ by smashing it over and over again into my steering while while I was talking on it AND driving. It was unsalvageable and the Verizon guy said he'd never seen a phone so destroyed like that. I lost all my pictures from the last year and had to buy a new $600 phone. This last week, I got into a similar mood but instead of breaking something I care about, I snapped every single hanger in my closet and threw all my clothes on the ground. Stilll a scary amount of anger but I managed to re-direct it all by myself without the help of a therapist and I don't even have anyone to tell. 

I know the way I act isn't normal. I know the abuse I put others through isn't normal. I know all of these things and just still feel like I'm the only one helping myself. Which is fine... I just wish I had help. it's hard to do this on your own. I've spent hours upon hours researching mental illnesses, reading other's experiences, etc etc etc trying to understand what's going on in my brain. I can give all this information to therapists and they STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT TO FUCKING DO WITH IT. Or just don't believe the degree at which things are happening. I don't know. i'm losing my train of thought.

I don't even know what I want out of this. Guess I'm just gonna call an expensive therapist this week that specializes in personality disorders and go from there /:. Thanks if you read, sorry if I didn't give much to respond to? idk. My brain is turning off lol",23Jun2020,1

227,"Hey guys,

So I know that there have been multiple accounts trolling and abusing users. It breaks my heart as I see fragile people reaching out for help getting abused. Some people aren't strong enough to turn a blind eye to that. I think it may be dying down down, I am hopeful, but I think there are some things we can still do about it (and in the case of any future trolls- this is a big community and it will happen again some day).

I have a few suggestions,

1. Moderators, maybe we need more? I think two isn't enough for a sub of huge proportions, maybe an auto-moderator (I do not know how to mod, or know anything about auto mods or if this is difficult to have or not.) Even just with enough mods for one to be on at all times, as soon as an abusive/trolling post or comment is made they can be removed and banned. They thrive off this attention, and if we don't give them it the situation will get better. I do not know how mod recruitment goes, but I think we need more, we are simply too big of a community! r/modhelp and r/AutoModerator may be useful. [This talks about setting up an Automod.](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/wiki/automoderator) (Edit 2: I just found this poll where a current mod talked about their plans to recruit new mods with mental health/ peer support training [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/gz6s0s/mod_poll_how_do_you_think_we_should_improve_this/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) which is great to see, I had not seen this post before-)
2. Making the community private for a while - I don't really like this because if new people seek help then they may feel denied, but it might be a good last resort.
3. Reporting the users to Reddit. [Here is a link.](https://www.reddit.com/report/) I'm sure people have already done this but I wanted to throw it out there.
4. Report comments and posts to the subreddit. I know everyone has been doing this, but instead of responding to them, down voting them, just report them and respond to the OP.  Take some extra time to console the people they may negatively affect, but I'm sure we've all been doing this already.
5. A stickied informational posts by the mods- talking about this issue and warning users. A new user may not know whats going on, heck an old user may not know because there are a lot of members. A sticky post at the top might help users be aware before posting, so maybe they do not feel so taken off guard if the troll attacks them.
6. Please, other suggestions welcome! I want to make sure everyone is supported. I know there have been posts on this topic, but I feel like now is a good chance to improve the community.

I will edit and add more suggestions if they are made! We are a community here to support each other. If anyone is feeling a bit down by the negative comments please remember you are supported and loved here, and I know lots of posts go unanswered but there is a high volume of posts.You can send me a message too, if you need some support. &lt;3

I have pretty bad anxiety that stops me from being able to study/learn as it all gets so overwhelming. I have a dead end job that’s overnights and entails driving all night (so no activity) and I’m living with my family. I only work 3 days a week and on my days off from work I just seem to not feel like I want to do anything besides lay in bed and be on my phone and/or watch Netflix which leaves me feeling weak from prolonged inactivity and makes me feel like I’m not participating in life even though I just want to be in bed. I want to live a more active lifestyle but I just don’t have the energy for it and when I try I usually last for 2 weeks before I lose my energy and revert to my “comatose” state. I also end up distancing myself from friends particularly on my days off because I just don’t have the energy to chat to them. When I’m at work I’m always up for a conversation with friends while I’m driving. Oddly enough my mood seems to be better when I’m at work which is weird coz I hate my job lmao

I don’t have a car because I crashed it when I was trying to commit suicide (almost worked too). So I’m dependent on my parents right now to get me to work and doctors appointments and everything. Well my father and I got into an argument about taking me to my doctors appointment. I got in his face and he pushed me into the wall. I was so upset that I called the cops and told them that he had assaulted me. So while the cops are on their way, my parents tell me that if I say my dad assaulted me and my dad goes to jail then they were going to kick me out of their house (I pay rent there) and I’d have nowhere to go. So the cops come and I had to make a decision. Do I want to tell the truth and get kicked out or do I want to lie and stay here? Ultimately I decided to lie to the cops to get them to go away. My parents told them that I was bi-polar (I have bi-polar depression) and that my meds must not be working (which they are). So now I don’t know what to do.

234,"To the people who are someone's friends, partners, co-workers or family, if by 2020 you still don't realize the importance of mental health and think its a fucking joke, you're a goddamn disgrace.

This especially angers me because my own mother is this way. Telling me to get over depression and just ""be happy"" because i'm young and have nothing to worry about, telling me to stop being shy and acting like a savage around people because of my anxiety, forcing me to be productive and study even though i've explained numorous times how hard it is for me to focus on the task and actually do any work without having panic attacks and verbally degrading me for all of my ""excuses"". Even after all of my cries for help the only reason she is actually considering getting me into therapy is because of my behavioural issues that also affect her. 

My issues are very clearly not an excuse. I didn't choose to be this way and if i could be ""normal"" or healthy id fucking choose that over anything else in the world. Its not fun and quirky to feel the way I and many other people feel. It doesnt take much for someone to understand that. If after all of this you still believe someone is making it up for attention or is just crazy and should be ""locked up"" or are just overreacting, no, no they're not.

By using videos of real people sharing real experiences, I’m hoping others are encouraged to talk about their challenges with mental health and recognize that they aren’t alone.

First, I went to Psychology Today. I filtered therapists in my location who accept my insurance. And I did find one who scheduled an appointment with me. Yay! One session in, and she tells me that she will be unable to help me with my issues and that she would refer me to another therapist who she thinks is better suited for my issues. Fair enough. I wasn't happy, but you can't force a therapist to see you. 

She emailed me saying that the therapist she had in mind is not accepting new patients and that she would try to find another therapist for me. I agreed, but I also restarted my own search because I was tired of waiting.

I went back to PsychologyToday and found a few more therapists and emailed them and haven't received a single response. 

So, I logged in to my insurance and looked up doctors who were covered under my insurance. There was a long list, and I felt there was hope again. Nope. Fuck me. 

The first set of doctors belonged to Hospital A. I called Hospital A requesting an appointment with one of the doctors, and after having been on hold for eternity, they tell me that my primary care provider must be from Hospital A. 

I had no idea what the fuck a primary care provider meant. So I called my insurance. They said that my plan is a PPO which meant that I do not need a primary care provider.

Confused, I called Hospital A again and they said that regardless of the insurance, to see a doctor in the psychiatry department I absolutely must have a primary care provider from that hospital. 

Well, fine. I'll get a primary care provider from you. I asked them how I should do that, and they gave me a number to make an appointment. I call the number, and the earliest available appointment is 25 days from now on a weekday. I ask them how much it would cost, and they said I should check with billing or my insurance. 

Not willing to call billing and waste another hour on hold, I call my insurance and they said the primary care at that hospital would cost $25 out of my own pocket. 

At this point, I thought to myself, well if I'm not going to get an appointment right away, I might as well check with Hospital B (from the lookup on my insurance website).

I call Hospital B and they said the same thing. My primary care provider must be from Hospital B, most of their attending doctors are not accepting new patients and that I would likely receive care from a student-doctor who is doing their residency there. 

I am an international student with little to no money. At this rate, I don't think I can afford the cost and might have to make it through without the care.

I hate the sheer amount of red tape involved in finding a therapist and I hate the exorbitant fees they charge.",23Jun2020,2

I struggle with depressive episodes. Sometimes when it's really bad I just stop feeling the inhibition to not do things that will hurt me. I know people love me, I know they will get infinitely hurt when I do something to myself, but I can't 'feel' that anymore. I just start getting thoughts such as why not jump of this bridge, why not take all my pills in one go, why not jump out of the window. Not even to kill myself per see, just to hurt myself and whatever happens happens. I did horrible stupid things to myself that landed me in hospital a couple of times and in psych ward. I don't want to let this happen again. But i am feeling so terrible, everything is hurting. And that voice to do stupid things is so loud that I end up taking some benzos. But now I just feel more numb.

257,"The increasing emphasis on mental health has led me to some introspection. This has led me to the conclusion that I MIGHT suffer from anxiety. 

Over the years, when I was faced with high-pressure situations, almost always a test or an exam, it would leave me highly uneasy. Now, I'm not talking about general nervousness that all of us go through. But rather, an all-encompassing feeling of dread and doom. I remember feeling trapped and not being able to think beyond the actions of the next few days. It would confine me in this small thought bubble. unable to concentrate even a little bit, unable to even take a sip of water without leaving my mind. I would often immerse in a train of thought gone completely awry. Just a thought after thought, worry after worry, hitting me at full velocity. It is very difficult to gain composure all by myself, without talking it out with someone, which I usually do.

But from all that I could gather online, feeling anxious is an ongoing feeling. All of the ""tests"" and ""questionnaire"" focussed on activities of the last two weeks or months. Whereas, I'm positive that my condition, if it even is one, is always triggered by important tests and exams. I have often been told that I worry a lot more for petty things than the common person. Overthinking is definitely at play, I'm sure. But, can what I mentioned above be described as anxiety?",23Jun2020,1

259,"I made this post on r/advice but I think it might be better to post here

I’m pretty new to reddit but I’ll try my best

Yesterday I posted a screenshot between my girlfriend and I of me being really embarrassed but I thought it was funny, I said “I want to dieeeeeeeeeeee” and this guy commented something along the lines of “u shouldn’t joke about suicide, ur a bitch for this” and I blocked him. My friend went to his account and commented something similar on a post of a baby with water being dumped on its face and the guy blocked her and made a post about me. 

My girlfriend called him out for it and said I wasn’t joking about suicide at all (which I wasn’t) and he called us children even though my gf is 19 which doesn’t make since because he’s like 19-20, and said I have no experience with depression or suicidal thoughts. He also went for my masculinity by saying “you’re not a man” which is stupid because I don’t care about that. At this point I unblocked him and commented “bruh I was hospitalized like 2 years ago so yeah I think I do know the struggles? No one ever said suicide was a joke, I said “I want to die” not “I’m suicidal and I want to die”. Yeah I literally am a child and I never claimed to be a man, I’m sorry that you had bad experience that made you react that way but damn, you know how to talk to people. You could have just said you didn’t like what I said”. 

After I said that he turned the comments off and messaged my girlfriend and I threatening us both, I’m 17 and I’m pretty sure it’s illegal to attack someone, especially a minor but I played dumb and acted like I didn’t know what he meant. I explained that I wasn’t saying suicide was a joke but he didn’t care or just didn’t understand and he accused me of sending people to his account to attack him. 

He asked why I even cared that he was mad and continued to make fun of me for different things like me wanting to join the army and just the same “grow a pair” and “you’re not a man” stuff, he even said that I’m disloyal because I’m friends with a girl, even though I met her before my girlfriend. Eventually it led to subtle threats like him calling me and asking where I am because we’re going to settle this now in person. 

I feel like a horrible person but at the same time I know I didn’t mean any harm. I just don’t know what to do.

I’m sorry for any grammatical errors in this.",23Jun2020,1

I struggle with depression, social anxiety, self harm and suicidal thoughts since my early teen years. I'm 25 now and started therapy last year for the first time ever and took part in a mental ward therapy program for a couple weeks earlier this year. There I also got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. It all suddenly stopped in march due to the corona lockdown and I was sent home with all the open wounds and the blocked out memories that were brought back from the sessions in the open mental ward. I struggled a lot because I live alone and had no one to supervise me and stop me from doing harmful things to myself to handle the pain and anger. Earlier this month I decided to go to my parents house for a 1-2 month holiday to have someone around me. 

Things started to get better. I finally met my nephew who was born in February. I finally was able to decide for a new laptop after spending 4 weeks of daily researches to find the best one but being unable to decide due to heavy overthinking. Same with a new pyrography pen set. Those decisions took a lot of weight off my chest and I don't regret either yet. I'm happy with what I chose. I'm happy here. 

My birthday came and it threw me back a bit. None of the good souls I'm thankful to be able to call acquaintances or some even friends wished me a happy birthday. Even tho we had talks about it just like 2 days before. The only non relatives to wish me a happy birthday were the heavily toxic people that I cut out off my life months ago. Now, for normal people this might not be a big deal. But to me as a borderliner it was hard to handle. It sent the wrong signals to my BPD brain and heart. But I am proud to say I did not start a drama about it to anyone and handled it pretty well. Forgetting is human. It's not the end of the world is what I'm trying to tell myself. It was forgotten but not really forgiven the next day. It was fine. I'm over it. Partly at least.

Then a minor mistake happened which didn't feel that minor to me and threw me a bit back but I was able to solve it a few days later and I calmed down a bit again. 

Just to have my ex boyfriend contacting me again and putting his toxic crap on me again. Like he does every other week. Don't ask why I don't block him, it has its reasons which don't need to be discussed now. I'm used to him harassing me with phone calls, sometimes he rings me up to 20 times in like 5 minutes when I ignore his calls. He also harasses me with millions of texts and calls me every possible name out there. I'm used to be called idiot, cunt, moron, dumb fuck etc etc by him but this time he called me fat fuck and whale. These names hit different because I have a trauma, a history of heavy bullying and harassment back in school about my weight. Just to mention, back then I was normal weighted and was still called a hippo and a lot more, was attacked, openly bodyshamed etc. Now I'm overweighted due to depression and BPD, am even more insecure about it, hate it, hate myself, he knows all that and decided the other names aren't enough anymore, lets get personal and hit her in her weak point. I couldn't smile since then. I'm feeling sick. I'm trying to hide my tears in front of my parents, trying not to self harm, not to freak out or anything. I'm giving my best to not let it on me, to push it away. But its difficult. 

Today someone started an argument with me simply because I responded to his talk about him trying to convert his other friend to his own religion for a year now with he should leave them be and respect them and their religion enough to not force them into his own religion and that his religion might be the right and only truth for himself but not for everyone. I met ignorance. Him telling me his religion IS the best and only and THE truth and I'm the rude and ignorant one for not acknowledging it etc. Now that person also spams me with messages etc while I'm giving my best to ignore them and be nice.

I can feel the relapse coming. I can feel it everywhere. I don't know what to do. I was so happy a week ago. I want that back.",23Jun2020,1

268," Hi. I (24 F) was diagnosed with bipolar 2 at the beginning of 2019. I have struggled with depression and anxiety since high school but first started taking antidepressants in 2015 while I was completing my undergrad. During this relationship with my college boyfriend, a lot of maladaptive behaviors appeared. I was very codependent but I had no idea what that meant or why. I would constantly start fights with him, over anything. I had the highest expectations and I was many times out of line, including telling him I would kill myself if he left. We lived together at the time, moving in together after about 6 months. He broke up with me and that started one of my longest episodes of what I now identify as mania. During this time, I was constantly engaging in attention-seeking behaviors. This included being active on tinder, sleeping around, meeting random people on yikyak, selling nudes on Snapchat, shoplifting a lot, and smoking weed basically all waking hours. I slept terribly and kept odd hours. I was able to work 2-3  jobs and go to school full time, passing all my classes with A's and not missing any shifts. I ended up sleeping with around 25-30 people in a 7 month period. I moved back home for a bit stopped sleeping around and smoking (and selling nudes as that was to mostly finance my weed habit). I was still on tinder but without a car or place of my own my sexual activity slowed down. Until I went to Florida for the summer of 2017 to live with my sister. In that 2 month period, I fucked another 30 people. I was back to smoking all the time. I was going to the beach every day,  which had always been a dream of mine, but I was so fucking sad. I constantly listened to emo music and I felt so alone. During this time I was still selling nudes a lot and talking to guys for money. After I returned home, the sex work escalated into actually meeting up with guys in person. I was also still sleeping around and selling nudes. I met this guy on tinder (26 M) who I went on to date for the past 2 years. The difference between him and others was his interest in me. We slept together the 1st night we met and developed an intense physical and sexual attraction. I actually thought he might have mild brain damage because of how forgetful he was. I later found out he was on benzos and been drinking liquor before the bar. We spent so much time together from the very beginning. A few days in, he told me he was on methadone. I found out he had a long history of drug addiction, dating back about 8 years. It started with weed and then pills, heroin, benzos, and alcohol. He had been at the methadone clinic for about 2 years when we met. He would drink and blackout and be mean and nasty and then be so sweet in the mornings. I knew nothing about addiction. I wanted to save him. He told me all his using war stories. We were trauma bonded at that point. We fought every night. It got physical from both of us. I ended the physical abuse towards him early on, I just did it because I had trying everything else when he was drinking and nothing worked. He got a DUI, lost his job and apartment. He lived with me and drank on my dime throughout the summer. We fought constantly. I went to counseling and they told me to go to Al-Anon (12 step program for friends and families of alcoholics). I didn't. I started seeing a psychiatrist and going to counseling somewhere else. I got my bipolar 2 diagnosis and began a year-long journey of constantly changing meds. Thankfully they have now been pretty stable for about 6 months. But then I was unstable constantly changing them. I broke up with him because he wouldn't respect my boundary of not buying him alcohol. It lasted 3 months and he contacted me every single day. He drank the whole time. We didn't talk. He ended up calling me from the hospital after an incident at his mom's where he fought his whole family and busted through their sliding glass door. I picked him up and we got back together. He moved in with his sister. I would threaten suicide to my boyfriend again. Every day when I was driving home from work. We kept fighting. He busted his sister's door. He eventually got kicked out of there. He punched me in the face and got assault charges. I got a protective order against him but I broke it and later dropped it. He was living in a homeless shelter for 9 months. He assaulted me 2 more times, pushing me, kicking me, smashing my MacBook Pro laptop with years of files, music, and pictures on it, and busting in my front door. I got another protective order but only saying that he couldn't go to my apartment (I have since moved). This order is still active, but not updated with my new address. He kept drinking. He went into the hospital again to detox and started a new medication to help his cravings. He takes it sometimes. Even sober, he wasn't the man I wanted. He never admitted how much his addiction affected me and wouldn't go to counseling with me. The abuse was horrible. There was a handful of physical incidents, but he loved to fight with food. Throw or spit food on me, dump it on my head, dump it on my carpet, throw it at the wall, etc. Name-calling- bitch mostly. But whore, slut, dumbass, disgusting. Pulled the e brake on my car while driving. Opened the doors and jumped out of the car while driving. Threw my stuff out the window while driving. Questioned every boundary I set. Just horrible, horrible stuff. I finally had enough. I blocked his number. I doubt he even thinks I'm serious but I can't let myself be treated like that anymore. But I'm spiraling into my old coping mechanisms and I don't like it. Dating apps, one night stands, looking for sex work, talking to sugar daddies... it's not going to lead me to the type of future or type of relationship I want. But it's soooooo easy for me to engage in these behaviors and sooo hard not to. I'm working on it. I have a good support system, a psychiatrist and 2 counselors, I now go to Al-Anon fairly regularly and I'm a grateful member with a good bit of literature, my mom is very supportive and I have a few close friends. I guess I'm just looking to see if anyone can relate to this, has had similar experiences, has any feedback or advice, or just some positive words to share.

Over the last year my depression has come to the forefront. My wife left me and she took my dog, and best friend, Samantha. I lost my job and home due to COVID a few months ago and reentering the work place is a challenge where I live. 

I want to take a moment to highlight something good though. My friend Ross. I have known Ross since we played hockey together in middle school (both in our 30s now). The day I told Ross about my ex and I splitting he dropped everything he was doing, left work, and came and took me on a walk and bought me groceries. Then every day after that he would show up, help me get groceries, help me cook dinner(I can cook very well but depression was holding me down from doing it), and play video games with me until he knew I was good for the night. That I would be there tomorrow as suicide was something I attempted (and eventually I went to therapy to get professional help). To this day he looks out for me still and checks in on me.

Why is that? Why should I fear fulfilling my potential in this life? Is it the fear that failure is likely? Is it the fear that others might judge or criticize me for simply wanting more for myself? Or is it the fear that no matter whatever amount of success that I reach, it’s never going to be enough.

If you feel this way also, understand that the voice feeding you all these doubts and insecurities, will never stop. Your mind will continue to provide you with an infinite amount of fear and doubt. What's hard to believe, is that even the most successful people in this world, hear this same voice.

So if this voice will forever continue to instill doubt in our minds no matter how successful we become. Why should we listen?

I believe that everyone one us can overcome this self-deprecating voice.

If I'm happy or stable I would rather not drink alcohol but when I'm at my lowest lows I just want to drink to try and distract my brain from my problems.

The last time I drank alcohol was with a suicide attempt. The time before that was about 5 months prior maybe a week or two before a different suicide attempt. (That time I drank was probably much worse because I hadn't really been eating properly for a while and that specific day I had eaten like 4 small biscuits/cookies and that was all).

I haven't really heard of anyone else who only feels the need to drink when they are feeling really low. Also the thing is I live with my parents and they have a decent amount of alcohol in the house. My dad sometimes asks if I want alcohol to drink with my dinner but I never do (I literally have 0 interest in it) instead I drink 1 or 2 cans of diet cola a day. Sometimes they comment on my cola consumption but I just think ""at least it's not alcohol"" like it's only cola.

277,"I was very happy when I started this new job several years ago. The company was great, the pay was more then I expect, the colleagues were smart and passionate about work. The company had a startup mentality so everything was changing fast, but I was completely fine with it.

With time I became an SME on the team and about one and a half year ago a lot of things/people changed. That said, I found myself doing the work of 3 different people for almost half a year. My manager quit and I was reporting to my managers manager, who had close to 0 understanding of what I do or how to make things better. Instead of supporting and helping, he was blocking all my decisions to improve things in my team as he simply was afraid to take responsibility for approving any proposal.

At the end, after half a year like that, I felt extremely out of control, overworked and uncertain. I did a lot for the team and juggled the responsibilities of 3 different roles, but was evaluated as ""expected performance"" at the end of the cycle which was the last straw. During our performance discussion, I felt so tired and powerless that I couldn't even object. For a couple of days I thought I probably got sick and have fever since my mind became really foggy. A colleague of mine who was in a very similar situation said she developed a burnout. That very moment it struck me that the fogginess in my mind probably didn't come from a fever.

I took a 3 week holiday and asked to move me to another team. I felt really well during the holiday, went back to my home town and also did some traveling. The foggy feeling however came back when I came back to work. Even though the new team was absolutely amazing and the work itself was all I could dream about, I found that consciously I would acknowledge that, but in reality I became very cynical about my work and gave 0 fucks about everything happening around me. I would avoid taking initiative or any responsibility and would feel super stressed if I'd have to which is not like me at all. I continued working because my conscience was telling me I should be grateful, I shouldn't miss the chance because this work is very exciting (and it probably really is).

It's been almost a year now after my original breakdown and a 3 week holiday. Just recently I started genuinely caring about my work again, but it's still only about 30% of what I was before all this happened. I still get a foggy head when I get even a bit nervous, I still get weird mood swings when I suddenly feel that I'm totally worthless.

I tried to meditate, I tired to do sports, I tried talking to my GP. What helped is either drinking alcohol, either taking herbal calming supplements, either eating lots of chocolate or sweets, but none of these solutions are sustainable.

Did I have a burnout? Will all of it pass away with time? Is there anything I could do about it? I'm just tired of being tired :/",23Jun2020,1
279,"Lots happened in my life. Sexual abuse from relatives, spouses, babysitters, etc; intense physical abuse from relatives and spouses; and a whole lot of being abused in friend circles. Safe to say I've been through the ringer but I've made it out on the other side, though a little worse for wear.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel very unsafe if my partner isn't striking me or doing things to me sexually. I feel like something terrible is going to happen and I feel like I can't be myself. I am so worried that things are building up to something terrible. Of course these things I want my partner to do to me, I want them to do it with me still able to use a safe word. I don't want to be in any danger, feeling in control and able to stop it at any time with a safe word makes me safe. I can go about my day an not worry about being actually abused.

&amp;#x200B;

However not all partners I've been with like this or are even emotionally able to continuously hit and abuse me. I'd like to work at this from both sides. How can I help future partners understand why it helps me and how can I help them get over hurting me? Also, how can I work to no longer feel the necessity of being struck or sexually touched without needing a partner to always be doling all this out?

I'd like to note that I don't want to actually be abused. I also want to say that, at least for me, real abuse and therapy abuse are very different and very easy to tell apart. I had an SO get upset that I was going slow because my knee was in pain and they shoved me; obviously this was actual abuse (though nowhere near the levels I've had to deal with prior). Her slapping me and saying some stupid line she tries to ad lib helps and is obviously not real abuse. I am no longer with her because, while the abuse never reached high levels, she wasn't a nice person.

Anyway, Thanks for reading my book-long post! Look forward to the response!

280,"my friend is suffering from extreme anxiety and paranoia. He finally built up the courage to go see a doctor today, but all that doctor did was prescribe a weak antidepressant. Iowa is pretty shitty when it comes to mental health, and they don't help because they just assume people are looking to score pills. However, he really needs help, and after the doctor not helping him today he's in pretty bad shape. Does anyone know where he could go to get the right help he needs (besides a mental hospital because he won'tdo well in there at the moment). Before you ask he isn't a risk to others, but possibly himself (I am keeping an eye on him though). I'm willing to travel all over the country to get the help he needs.",23Jun2020,1
281,"Can anyone familiar with the Canadian mental health system give me some advice? I've been (voluntarily) hospitalized for suicidal thoughts, and they're asking me if I want to stay a few days or go home now. But honestly, I don't know what I want. On one hand I'm terrified to go home, I'll probably hurt myself as soon as a get a chance. But on the other hand I've heard a lot of psych ward horror stories and I'm not sure how that would go for me. I don't know what to do here. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",23Jun2020,1
282,"I have dealt with depression and anxiety all my life. As a 27 year old guy I feel the best and most aware than I have since my teens. Around about 18 months ago, my depression and anxiety became so bad that I experienced ""pychosis"" where I was sure I was in a theatre of life and that i was playing a part in the play and that the story became unrealistic to me. Unreal in the way i felt seperate from the world and the intensity of the body/mind being so aware and consumed by thought that I eventually thought I saw god and also the devil in everyone. Obviously I ended up in mental health unit for 8 weeks.

During that time I was obsessed with the duality of things, and over time (also when meds also kicked in) I found the whole thing laughable and the part I played in the play was simple. To experience and be the experience. The fact that i was awareness itself. I started to try and stop my thoughts and after time my mind became quite. Not that the thoughts were not there but like they passed without acknowledging them. However, I was now living in a way where I saw the world as an extension of myself. Almost as my awareness was a singular point or dimention of the dimentionless awareness that is everywhere and we all share.

This has gone on for about a year and a half now. The result: ths world has the most clarity I have had for proberbly 10 years. My mind is quiet. I can see I have a long way to go, but not like life is reasonless and I'm actually coming down on my meds. A new outlook on life in a way that I see the world and everyone at any point of time united in the awareness of the universe/self. My question is do you think from what I have said makes me sound unwell to you.  Transitioning from a firm atheist to becoming a person aware of awareness and counciousness as much as I can can and seeing the world again as I did when I was interested in the world younger in life.

Anyway just wanted to put it out there. I've not worked the courage to really talk about the 'spiritual' stuff with the doctor. It would be interesting to hear other people's stories also. Peace.",23Jun2020,2
284,"I had a narcissist mom who primarily used shame and humiliation for punishment. I’m 20 now and don’t talk to her but still feel guilt and shame for everything.

287,"this past year I've come to realise how much of a problem my mental health really is, I can wake up with no weed and be a massive cunt to everyone on purpose and literally not feel bad about it but then later on that day I regret what I said to people and always cringe about it, but I'm too much of a stoner to give a fuck I honestly can't be fucked to to try and change so what if it's causing me to stand out and causing people to start disliking me, fuck I had a solid group of friends a few months ago but I just got this fuck EVERYONE attitude because shits not going my way, drugs have a massive part to play in this but I'm not willing to stop drugs, what's the point in life without drugs it's such a bold statement but it's fucking true, you're all lying if you say I can find a hobby you're all lying if you say I'll prefer it without weed and most of all you're all lying that a therapist would help, would it fuck!! I don't mean to come across as a cunt but at the same time I mean everything I say I don't know what the purpose of this was but I just lost my apprenticeship yesterday so I'm in a massive fuck everything mood I don't even care about another job",23Jun2020,1
288,"I have some serious anger problems.  I'm normally a very passive, not confrontational guy but I get mad and say horrible, crazy sounding things.  I'm 41 years old, married, with step children.  I don't get violent or physically aggressive, and I'm not angry often, but when I do get angry I say really awful things that I immediately regret and would do anything to take back.  After it happens I always apologize and break down crying, at which point my wife and kids are so mad at me they take no pity on me, nor should they.  Then I sink into a depression and can't shake it off for a day or so, which in turn makes me awful to be around.  I just wish I could take back all the terrible things I've said when I was mad, but I can't.  It's like I become another person.  I feel like I'm going to destroy my marriage and what little relationship I have with my step kids if I keep this up.  I have no insurance and can't afford therapy, I used to be on medication for anxiety which helped a little but made me feel like an emotionless zombie.  I guess I just want to know if anyone else here has had similar issues and if so, how did your deal with them?  I pretty much hate myself right now and just want to disappear and stop making the people I love miserable, but I know that's not constructive.  I just want to act like the person I know I am.
