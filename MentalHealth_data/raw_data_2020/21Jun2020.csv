0,I‘m full of pain right now. All my life I had to endure so much pain and somhow I hoped that one day it will change and be better but now I‘m sitting here again. More than a decade after my first suicidal thought. I know how many depressed and suicidal persons there are and that I‘m nothing special but I just want to write down my numbness. I dont know where to begin. I dont have the power to talk about it right now. I dont even know if someone may ever reads this but I just cant bare it anymore,21Jun2020,2
1,"Im not sure if this is a good post for this sub reddit but I figured id ask here.

My sister is going to move away for school and live on her owb for the very first time. We are not close but we both experienced trama and are both in coucneling. 

To just kinda reach out to her I wanted to give her a giant card some money and a booklet. In the booklet I wanted to put some fun and helpful advice on how to adult. 

I was wondering what are some things you learned from adutling and living on your own that made life easier? Somethings you wished you knew before learning the hard way? Some tips and tricks to stay mentally healthy too?  Id love to stick in as much as possible. So what would you tell your past self as advicre to live your best life?",21Jun2020,1
2,"So after whole pandemic started I've came back from university I'm studying in (different part of the country) back to my home. To my parents and my sibling. For the past 3.5 months I've been half-consciously avoiding any emotional attachment towards them (being at University far away let my emotions cool down a bit), by rejecting their attempts at connecting. But today I'm coming back to the city I'm studying in. And all I feel is overwhelming guilt and fear. I'm terribly scared that it's the last time I see them. It's really common fear for me. Feel it super often when I think about the three of them. When I was a child, my parents would often joke about them not coming back (mostly my father), or insinuate they are going to die soon. My father often after arguments and beating me&amp;my sibling up would go on a long walk and before going he would tell he ain't ever coming back. One time after huge argument he got some kind of asthma attack. He couldn't catch his breath. I was sure he is going to die and he is going to die because of what I've done. But fortunately nice man from the hospital came and made him calm so he could breathe again. One time also after an argument he came back home after his typical never-coming-back walk and took the biggest knife from the kitchen. He said sth about being gone forever before so when he stood there with that big knife I really thought he is going to kill himself on my eyes. He only cut off the cables.
So now, coming back to the main story. I have terrible fear of leaving everytime I'm leaving for university. It happens more often too, like if one of them ain't coming back home early enough. My brain starts to panic and I have the worst scenarios in my head. It's calmer when I'm at University city, I seem to detach from them a bit. But now, I was forced to stay with them, and my semi-conscious attempts to stop attaching back made my guilt and fear even bigger. So for the past week I've been crying myself to sleep and it even affects the only trully healthy relationship I have. I just can't focus on anything without obsessive thinking about my parents dying or sth bad happening and me not being here.
I'm really sorry for the chaos. I just really feel that I need help and I don't have anyone to support me with it rn.",21Jun2020,2
3,This weekend has been very isolating. My parents are gone for the weekend and my brother does not really interact with me when he is home and not at work. So I have been feeling extremely alone today. Anyone have any tips on how to not feel so isolated? I’m honestly open to anything right now.,21Jun2020,2
4,"Howdy. I’ve been on reddit for YEARS and I think I’ve posted less than a dozen times, but isolation has made me reflect a ton on stuff I’ve been feeling recently.

I am 20 years old, I’ll be a senior in college this year. I’m pretty well accomplished and I have a great group of friends, but I feel so so different than everyone. It’s hard to describe. I feel like a don’t have very much agency over the stuff that I do, and that I’m a big ole phony. 

When I was in high school, I had everything pretty easy, I played sports, and my mom was always so proud at how much I “didn’t care about what other people thought”, and that I was fairly independent. I genuinely don’t think I was emotionally mature enough in high school to be introspective though, and I didn’t give a shit what people thought because I was still me own “main character”, and I didn’t even consider those around me.

Since being in college, I’ve become a lot more empathic because I have friends that I have to be there for. I’m sensitive now! Now my mom doesn’t really think that any of my struggles are genuine, and that she wants the “old, badass” me back. 

Because it’s taken me so long to be (what I consider) as a normally mentally functioning and empathetic human being, I feel behind somehow. I genuinely always feel like I’m 17 years old. I always think I’m too young to do cool things like other people my age. I have found that I always freak myself out of going on dates and speaking up at meetings because I am perceived as someone who doesn’t really have the capacity to do stuff like that. 

I’m not depressed, and I’m not clinically anxious, but I want to know if anyone even understands what I’m saying and feeling and if there’s ANYTHING I can do to prove to myself that I take up space like everyone else.",21Jun2020,2
5,"I have these “episodes” and I freak out and uncontrollably twitch with my arms/hands and punch/scratch myself super hard , and i feel really angry and upset . i felt like i was going crazy earlier. it’s usually when i get frustrated , or really anxious about a situation. i don’t reallly know why this happens . i just wanted to share",21Jun2020,2

8,"Feeling full of emotions and unable to get them out. Talking doesn't help because I can't describe them. I feel like screaming all the time.

9,"Grew up not being the best looking and quite fat, and naturally I wasn’t popular and had no friends which people bullied me for. I’m 18 now 6 ft tall and 194 pounds, way too fat for Asian a standards. And all this wasn’t helped by the rejection I faced from girls I asked out.

10,"I was in a very toxic relationship about a year ago and I still question if I'm a bad person because of the things she would accuse me of. I know I probably wasn't the best boyfriend to her but I don't know if the things she said about me were true or not. First incident was when I caught her cheating and she told me I was being overbearing and obsessive with who's she's talking to and who's she's with. Then she would bring in her friends in it and ask them if what she did was cheating and they all side with her and I just didn't know how to feel at that point and honestly I still don't know if what she did was cheating even if it sounds painfully obvious to others. She would also use the fact that she would cook for me sometimes or buy my food/gifts and use it against me saying she takes ""care"" of me. At the time I didn't notice how much she used that word until I looked back at our texts. There's been one thing that stuck with me, when we were breaking up She said I sexually assaulted her. I've tried with everything to remember if I had or not but I can't remember but I'm slowly starting to accept that I did do it, without knowing for certain and I feel so guilty everyday I want to improve as a person but another part of me wants to die because I feel like a horrible person but then knowing it was a gaslighting relationship I won't ever know if what she was saying was true and that's been killing me",21Jun2020,0
11,"My (20) mom (61) is no longer taking care of herself and her health and I don't know what to do. My parents separated around 10 years ago and my mom's health quickly deteriorated, she has depression but refuses to take care of herself because she's ""going to die anyways"". She smokes 3 packs of cigarettes a day, has cardiovascular issues (2 heart attacks), osteoporosis, migrated disks in her spine, basically more issues than I can keep track of. She takes around 20 pills daily. Her body is slowly giving out and I don't know what to do, I don't want to lose my mom so soon. She's the one that raised me and even though she can be disgustingly emotionally manipulative she's still my mom. She's given up on her life and just rots away at home. I managed to get her to a psychiatrist a few years ago but she stopped taking her meds and going to therapy because it wasn't ""helping"" at all. She's playing the victim card and wanting all of us to pity her and what my father has done to her. Every day when I look at her I'm just reminded how she'll probably never see me grow up and it really upsets me, living with her absolutely destroys me but I'm afraid something might happen to her when I'm not there. I just finished my first year at university on the other side of Europe, the entire time I was there I was worried sick that she would die and I wouldn't even have the chance to say goodbye to her.",21Jun2020,3

13,"I really haven’t been one to be emotional or even think about my mental health. Although I have an issue. Basically, for the past few years I feel as if I’m constantly thinking about how fake people are, and why people do the things they do. Which makes me have such a negative outlook on meeting people and even keeping communication with friends.

16,"With this post I seek nothing but an answer to my question. Which is “why?”. I’ll start off with my childhood. My dad left me at age 3, and this didn’t really bother my mom. I was around lots of gang violence and terrible people overall. All my stepdads beat me, but that’s not something that even begins to bother me today. I do feel like I lack the “fathers half” of being raised. Which is all the sports and whatever else. (Sports was an example. I do as many school sports as possible). Here’s where my memory gaps. I don’t remember court or what made me live with my grandma. I’m biracial (African American + Caucasian) my grandma is white. I had heavy slang because I was around “the hood” very often. My grandma always corrected me “it’s ‘with’ not ‘wit’. You aren’t a clown”. Down the line, in elementary school, I remember a girl saying my voice sounds weird. I feel like it’s because of my lack of that “hood slang” that my voice would go hand in hand with possibly. I do thank her, because I wouldn’t be as decently smart as I am today. From 2-5th grade I’d constantly act out and throw very big tantrums. Most were caught on video and we laugh at them today. My sister had also probably caught onto this and her tantrums/fits still continue to this day. I never had a good relationship with my sister. Constant back and forth annoying each other. There were grace periods, but very short. Fast forwarding to my middle school days, I had always been locked in the house in the country, but now I was able to walk to Dairy Queen on Friday’s and then go stay at my biological grandpas in town. I never put the pieces together at the time, but my grandma and bio. Grandpa had split and I haven’t yet asked why. Anyways, this is around the time telling your friends who you had a crush on was a popular thing. I remember I would have feeling for girls pretty strongly, and I was such a decently innocent child. One of my crushes had somehow found out, and not much happened. It was really just awkward between us for a few days. Eighth grade was a year that I’d changed. I didn’t mention previously that from 4-7th grade I’d been completely silent. I would barely even speak when spoken to, and I made no eye contact until my friends mother taught me it was rude. In eighth grade, I don’t remember much, but I finally got a girlfriend and was way more vocal with my classmates. The girl had a boyfriend as we were talking, yet I was completely oblivious. At the start of the relationship  I was warned by a lot of people that she would cheat. I just blew them off and went on with it.  I’m going to skip parts of the relationship, but to sum it up: my innocence was lost to this girl (I was still a virgin though). Nearing the start of the new year Several clues towards her cheating surfaced rapidly. One of my favorite examples, that I like to laugh at today, is when she created a fake message screenshot saying I gave permission to cheat like some cuck. The guy sends me the screenshot she sent to confirm, and It’s a picture of an iPhone conversation. Well, she had an Android. She definitely was not the smartest. This had pretty much launched me into my “I’m 13 and this is deep” fake depression. I started therapy and I was told it’s a type of ptsd, and my next girlfriend mocked this idea. My next girlfriend was this girl who broke up with my new best friend a few months before me and my girlfriend broke up. We were “best friend couples” or something. This girl and I had talked every night about how I was gonna find a better girlfriend, and we’d hangout when we could. She set me up with one of her friends who I didn’t really like, and I had to tell her the nicest way possible. I’m not going to lie and say I had fully liked my friends ex, but I played a game of chess with my feelings.(idk if that’s a good analogy cause I’ve played only once). This girl and I considered ourselves best friends, and I didn’t want to ruin things if she didn’t like me. I basically stayed neutral in showing any hints towards it. It’s pretty hard to describe. I ended up picking up none of her hints though, because she pointed it out when we started our relationship. This girl was actually the greatest I have ever been with, and this time around my ignorance sorta ruined it. We were basically the same as we were when we were friends. Later on in the relationship I did sort of get jealous because I was still inexperienced. After a few good months the relationship came to an end in an unexpected way. I’d recently done a prank on my friend (girl-A) with my other friend (girl-B). We pretended to be a kid in our class, who had legitimately done this before, and we asked for nudes and harassed the people who started messaging us. This was pretty funny at the time, but we undermined the fact that they said they were calling the cops. What was our response to that? We just logged off, and got on with our lives until this kid got punched for it. My best friend since I moved to town had done it while I watched 2ft away. I still wish I would’ve stopped it, but yeah I got community service and any charge I could’ve got was dropped. A few months later in my downward spiral I ran from the cops while under this thing. It was not very pleasant, but I got away. Before that, I was doing great in school, I had no friends, no girlfriend, and everyone called me sex offender for the first semester of my freshman year. No one really knew that girl-B had also been in on it. After getting winter break started. I hungout with the kid who I could’ve stopped from punching the perverted kid. He was heavy on weed so I ended up trying it. I would smoke with him quite a bit, and at one point we did get some laced with meth possibly. We just know it was just weed in that tinfoil crackhead pipe. Around this time I got back with my second girlfriend, and we can just ignore her for a bit in this section. (I did forget: my mom went to jail shortly after I started living with my grandma.). I tried to buy a weed vaporizer online, and my grandpa got the billing info or something. I got caught and was seen on the same level as my mom. One night it was too much and I called my mom to get me and I was supposed to move in with her again until I posted about it. My grandma swiftly changed her mind for some reason then got mad that I posted about it. Fast forwarding another few months. (Very briefly: the second time around with my ex was terrible. She had become very jealous and slightly emotionally abusive.).  I had friends throughout the summer that I’d always hangout with. They were basically a parallel universe version of my friends, but even my friends thought they were weird. I thought they were great though. I’d always smoke with them and we’d go to weird places in the country or show up to school events intoxicated. When the school year started I wanted another relationship pretty bad, and I ended up taking to around 6 different girls with none to succeed. I was pretty close to tying the knot with this one girl, but she was very indecisive. She said she needs a break so I talked to another girl. A few days later she changed her mind and so I was faced with a decision. Instead of being a decent human being i ghosted the other girl. Then a 3rd girl came in and I switched over to her. (This is a moment I regret to this day. I wish I could go back and choose none of them. They deserved to know what was going on, but I decided to leave them oblivious until later on. Nearing present day here, this girl that I chose over the other two was a bit old for me. Let’s just say she just graduated the year before. The main girl I talked to from my “summer friends” said she was perfect and I believed it. So we’ll skim over a lot until we reach the red flags. I got her a few gifts that I actually worked hard to buy. For example, I love guitar so I bought her a guitar with the best painting I’ve ever seen on it. It was themed around amazing grace, and it was just a sight for sore eyes. This girl smoked weed every single day, and I had been clean for months because of my negative experience with it. I did smoke with her a bit, but I feel like that was just a standard I couldn’t fulfill with her. One day she asked for money, so I gave her a 20 and told her keep the change, cause she was buying weed and they could get an extra gram. This gradually expanded into her passive-aggressively asking for money, and me giving her cash. After she got Apple Pay I started sending her money on there. In the midst of this she took my virginity. (I was told her body count was pretty high.. above my moms even, and man.. if you knew my mom.. haha). Anyways, I counted the money I sent her towards the end of the relationship, and I can safely say I spent near $300 on her out of my pocket. One day she wanted a break, and this was the final straw for me. My emotions were caught in a jumble. Swiftly, she changes her mind but the damage was done. This happened a second time with the break actually taking affect. I did get very suicidal, and insane. I sang in the mirror while I cut myself, and it was an odd thing to me after i snapped out of it. This is the first time I’ve ever gone crazy in a way, and it’s over something arguably so little. Things were just very dark for me, and I was too out of it to end things with her for good. Then all of a sudden I picked up a new hobby which was “hacking”. I dual booted Kali Linux onto my computer, and for about a month I was dead set on learning how to pen-test. I wouldn’t be on my phone for hours at a time. My girlfriend was mad and my friends confused. This died down a little bit though. My favorite summer friend helped me through the rough time I was having at the best of her ability, but it barely worked until my girlfriend finally broke things off herself. She did it because of how distant I was. During a lot of my mental breakdowns (basically) I’d mainly just sit there in a hazy state and stare at myself in the mirror. In worse situations I did cut. (I’m fine now, and I don’t do it). One time we decided to shower while on FaceTime, and she saw my cuts. She asked if they were scratches from a girl as if I had some bdsm kink idk. I replied no and she kept questioning but I felt to awkward to say. She got upset and wouldn’t talk to me so I told her finally. Her response: “you should’ve told me that the first time. I thought they were from a girl.” To which I apologized. She asked for the shirt I was wearing and I had to quickly wash the blood off. They were very small patches but noticeable. We never hungout except in her car, She’d been to my house a handful of times and I’d been to her house slightly more, but 90% of the time was outside of my house. When I got into the car to give her the shirt, I took it off, and she touched my cuts (on my left arm and the left side of my chest) and said she was still mad about it. I honestly felt like garbage about that. despite her being quite a toxic person I actually was really sad when we broke up, and I asked for all my gifts back and she gave them. It’s been one or two months since this happened. Ever since I’ve been glued to a computer optimizing my grandpas WiFi, and doing lots of mischievous things with what I’ve learned about pen-testing. I’ve picked up a bunch of healthy and fun hobbies like pen-testing, inventing using things like raspberry pis and arduinos, I still play several instruments, mountain biking, and photography. My Instagram account has never gotten too many likes, but as soon as I implemented some photos that meant something to me and reflected my mind. I went from 90-100 likes down to 10-20 likes. Before school abruptly ended. I had the reputation of the stupid kid that was actually smart. Except, a lot of people didn’t get the “smart” half of that. So I was just the loud and dumb kid for them.  Recently I came across a lot of the people who have thought that, and they seem kind of surprised. However, beyond all of this positivity surrounding me. I still find myself in a dark place more often than not. A lot of my past doesn’t bother me. I don’t like weed, I’m a bit more organized, and much more.  My summer friends all don’t talk to me. Nor do any of my friends. I still talk to my recent ex girlfriend, but I don’t get on any messaging platforms for hours at a time. To me, that feels unusual. I’m happy that I’m doing good for myself, but they sometimes don’t keep me busy for too long anymore. I don’t even answer my mom really. I got a new room inside of our garage storage room also. (A lot cleaner than what you’re probably imagining) I’ve gone days without seeing my grandpa who lives in the same house. He usually only sees me when I go to the bathroom or get something to eat. I don’t know how to comprehend a lot of my emotions. It seems obvious that I’m sad bout my breakup, but it feels like there’s something else. I did get into conspiracy and talking politics with my sister (who is veryyy left wing). I did for a bit, believe that the government does lie to us, and It’s inevitable really, but I believed it to quite an extreme extent. There was some uproar about the kkk coming to my town also (I’m one of three colored people in the town) so I was extra paranoid aswell. I felt like a man had a gun inside of Walmart and he was about to shoot me, and I kept close eye on his hands and such. He saw me looking at him and I think I looked pretty scared from the look he gave back at me. I tried to see if there was any steganography on the printer paper so I could track these people who advertised the kkk. I obviously had no luck. Because of my terrible grades I’ve also been taking amphet which is basically adderall. My grandma told the doctor it wasn’t working so my dosage was raised. I also had bug bites all over me and when my doctor prescribed a pill for it. My “government control” meter when off the charts. I don’t believe any of those conspiracies much anymore because I just gave up. There’s really nothing I can do even if I knew the “truth”. So if this is even able to be posted because of its length. My question is: why? What does it take to completely forget/remove whatever is keeping me in this hole? Is it because of something that happened previously in my life?I’d appreciate even 1 or 2 replies. Feel free to even share your similar experiences. I will try to attach some of my photos here aswell. Also sorry for any typos. Grammar/sentence structure is my strong suit, but I’m better with a computer or paper.",21Jun2020,1
17,"Two years ago, when I was 16 I've done a terrible thing and stopped when my bf told me that's fucked up. I won't go into details but at the time I thought I was doing nothing wrong and I'm super cool and quirky (Jesus Christ).


So I stopped and forgotted about it for almost a year but then, 8 months ago I had a panic attack for unrelated reason and that's when I remembered it. Now I'm 18


 From that day I have panic attacks or crying attacks every day. I fear I'm the same ducked up person I used to be and I'm convincing myself that's true. I have disgusting intrucive thoughts, they're causing panic attacks and I can't sleep because of them but the thought they wouldn't appear if I wouldn't be scared is comforting me.


Recently I almost succesfully convinced myself that I've changed and I don't want to do things I used to do. I thought this will solve all my problems but boy was I wrong. Not only I have to deal with what remained after that but I'm also panicking about cancer and cheating on my bf (he's not controlling at all). 


I'm panicking over things that happened months ago and then overthink it. Today I remembered a year ago I imagined me, my bf and my classmate having a threesome for some reason and I cried the whole day because of it, I feel like a cheater and terrible gf. I don't even like threesomes. I really want to tell my bf about it but first, I don't want to make him tired like I used to and seccond, I don't want to destroy his self esteem. I love him and he'll always be the most fantastic and handsome man in my eyes.


I feel like I should die, like I'm a bad person and I'll be hurting him or others and the world is better off without me. He deserves much much better. 


I also feel like I can't go to therapy because I deserve what I'm going through. I just wish I was dead or my brain would stop functioning properlly and I could just blanklly stare and hear everything but couldn't think.",21Jun2020,3
18,"I’ve kept this secret for a while because I didn’t know how to cope. I’ve always felt like my story was weird so it’s hard telling people about it. After 16ish years, I still don’t know how to cope. Who to hate, who to blame. Anyways, when I was between the ages of 3-5 I was molested (specifically touched) by my female cousin. She is 3 years older than me. So she must’ve been 6-9 years old. I don’t remember how many times it happened I just remember one instance. The reason I think I remember it so vividly is because my grandmother caught us and literally beat us. Which I still don’t understand why she beat me considering the fact I was the one being abused. And when I say beat, I’m talking about she made us kneel on rocks, took a thick electric cable(like the ones on lampposts) and beat us with that for what seemed like hours. Anyways long story short, years later I learned my cousin was being abused by her step grandfather. I don’t know if he just touched her or if he ever r*aped her. I still talk to my cousin. We talk almost every other day. We have never talked about this and I don’t think we ever will. I’m just still very confused about what to feel knowing she probably had it worse.

I feel the last year I’ve actually been really good. However the last two weeks especially the last few days I’ve been fading back into that dark whole I was not my suicidal state I was but my depressed state and just can’t get out of it. I can’t just speak to anyone as I just lie as when ur comes to speaking to a professional I just lie as I know what they want to hear or due to stuff in the past I refuse to go as I don’t trust them anymore. I will go to a doctor for sight issue but I can’t go to a physiologist or something similar and I just feel lost. I feel lost any ideas or advice?,21Jun2020,1
23,"For context I'm a 21 year old male and my mom is 43.




My mom's horrible. She's drunk and yelling all the time and always has been, she gaslights me and says she never does anything wrong, throws fits when she doesn't get her way, smokes 2 packs a day in the house, insults me and puts me down, even though she knows how depressed and suicidal I've been for so long she doesn't seem to care.





All that matters in her world is herself, alcohol, and cigarettes.




She tells me I'm not doing anything with my life and am a failure because I dropped out of college (due to almost killing myself) and now she says I'll always be a nobody. She calls me fat, lazy, irresponsible, etc. When I was in the hospital she came to the rescue like she had cared all along but she never has clearly.




But I can't do anything about it. I don't have the money and won't for so long. First thing is I need a car and don't have that, and I'm working the best paying job I've ever been able to get but it's still bullshit pay. And all my student loan and medical and credit card debt (from me being an irresponsible idiot, yes) means I have almost nothing left over every month to save.




I have all these thoughts of hurting her but ultimately id just hurt myself. I don't have any family or friends to move in with either, but all the places around here cost too much. Even the absolute cheapest shitty places are out of my budget.




Please if anyone has any advice I'm at my breaking point.",21Jun2020,5

28,"At 22 I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety and put on Zoloft. After 4 years it stopped being as effective and my new PCP decided I was bipolar and put me on Cymbalta and Lamictal. A couple years later a psychologist/psychiatrist (I always mix them up lol) said that I wasn’t bipolar, but I was reacting poorly to my anxiety, hence my outbursts. She put me on 3 meds, then took me down to 2. Over the past 8 years I’ve been on several different medications, some worked, some didn’t, some made me sick. This past January my new psychiatrist/psychologist put me on Vybriid and my whole world has changed. I’m cleaning the house and cooking dinner and going for walks. I have motivation for the first time in my life!!! My husband doesn’t feel like everything is on him since we got married 11 years ago. I’m finally an equal partner and it feels glorious. I’m just thankful that he dealt with my anxiety and depression issues long enough for me to get the proper help!!! 🥰",21Jun2020,1
29,"I was at the pool today, watching young people having fun and enjoying themselves. I noticed I was the only person there swimming back and forth because I don’t know anyone at my gym.

30,"I am very prone to spiralling, or snowballing, when something bad happens to me. 

Recently, I've been getting into arguments with my mum and it's been making me feel like shit. She tells me I'm brainwashed, makes me feel stupid, and a lot more. When I brought it up to her she denied the lot and the only apology I got was a 'sorry you feel that way' 

This isn't something small, I don't think, but i also feel as though I'm overreacting, but that just makes me feel worse, and so the spiral begins.

And it always ends with a 'you should just kill yourself'. Almost always followed with a 'no you retard thats a bad idea' 

Because other than little things like that, my life is fine. I have friends, a loving partner (long distance atm), a roof over my head and hot meals. I'm fine. Yet I'm not. And, again, it makes me feel worse that there are people who have it so, so badly, and yet I have the audacity to feel the way I do?

I do not want to bring any of this up to my mother. She would just gaslight me again. My partner knows, though, and is as supportive as he can be in the current situation. That's all I can ask for, right?",21Jun2020,52
31,"(Idk if it helps but for reference I have Asperger’s syndrome and (suspected) ADHD) 

When Quarantine started I was really worried about how I’d cope, my routine at school and regular meet ups with “friends” there are what kept me going. For the first month or two I really struggled keeping myself sane but managed to get through and after that met a group of people online I’ve really connected with and found comfort in.

Only issue is I’m terrified they’re going to abandon me or forget about me. 

Okay, for some more context, I’m an extremely social person despite my lack of social skills, I love talking and hanging out with people who get me. Problem is they never seem to wanna hang out with me. It was probably year 8 (12) I came to this realisation and it kinda hit me like a ton of bricks. The thing is I’ve always had friends but never people who’d talk to me on a one to one basis and don’t get me wrong, I’ve tried so hard to make close friends but no ones ever really cared. 

If I ever want to go somewhere with friends, I’ve got to sort it out, I’ve got to pay or I’d never see them outside of school. And I don’t get why (though that’s an issue for another time).

My current “friends” from school, would never reach out to me and between the three of them over 2 years have hosted like 2 get togethers while I’ve probably organised 100+ because otherwise we wouldn’t ever see each other. And since quarantine started I haven’t talked to them because of my bad state of mind but at the same time it’s been 4 months and none of them have bothered either.

Now I have these friends I met online who I’ve really gotten close to really quickly. When we started talking we’d stay up together all night, talk for hours and hours but over the last month we probably now only talk for like an hour? Half hour every day? And I know I’m overreacting but I’m scared they’re gonna end up ghosting me like everyone else in my life has. They say they won’t but I can’t get out of that mindset.
How do I deal with this? I know they all have lives but I don’t do anything anymore, they are all I have.",21Jun2020,1

I want to get a good degree In physics and need to get into a calculus class next year so I need to get above average grades in math.

All I have been doing is work and That’s about it

I normally talk to my friends and study at the same time but only a few of my friends like doing that so the rest I only go online with if I am playing a game with them.

Not just that but I want to ply some more games by myself like the new last of us game but don’t have the time. I also want to practice guitar cus I’m teaching myself that but again don’t have the time. I just keep on saying to myself it will be worth it in the end but it still depresses the shit out of me that Im not able to do some of this stuff I want to do. My teachers say how well I’m doing in school but I don’t feel achievement on anything. I don’t feel smart enough or I have done enough. I’m not suicidal or anything just fucking sad I guess. 

The only time I’m happy is if I’m talking to my friends and then other than that I’m miserable.


I have so much anxiety as well from school work. So much I feel physically sick everyday. And For about 2 years there has not been one day in my life where I am stress free. It’s mostly school work and that but other shit too

34,"I told my mom I was always sad in 7th grade, all while having a panic attack and sobbing. She said that she used to also, and that everybody does. In 9th grade I would constantly “drop hints” to my mom saying how I was always so unmotivated and tired and just total drained, so she said to “drink more water”. After this summer I’m going to be in 10th grade, and yesterday I texted my mom while at a sleepover (with the encouragement of friends) a reaaaaally long message basically saying that I think I have anxiety and clinical depression and asked her to please not take me back to my pediatrician (whom is friends with my mom and doesn’t take anything I say as serious as it is and gives a weak solution). She responded that she would talk with my pediatrician, and she’s been telling me all day that “she feels bad when she doesn’t get good sleep either.” I’m at such a loss. I have a feeling that nothing is going to come from this, and it’s beginning to feel hopeless. My older brother told my parents and got therapy for like a year and is now on medication for his anxiety/depression (it HEAVILY runs in our family- another reason I can’t understand why she won’t take me seriously.) I’ve literally told her before that she keeps dismissing me, but she still does. What can I do to make her stop making me feel like a little kid?",21Jun2020,1
35,"Hello, I just want to share my rocd stories. And I desperately need help.

excuse my english please since I am not a native English speaker... and I'll talk about sexual topic so if you don't want to read, please skip.

first of all I have huge trust issues against men. from my cheating ex boyfriends and betrayals I've been through...
and, I've been diagnosed as major depression for 10 years, I am on anti depressants.

so, one of my biggest fear is being cheated on.
I have a boyfriend, we've been together for 1 month, recently we had sex. he brought 4 condoms and they were colorful. (purple, green, orange, yellow) lol
we used all of condoms, yellow, orange, purple before and green 2 days ago(sorry for t.m.i.)

but the memory was vague, I wanted to remember that we used the 4 condoms clearly but I couldn't remember clearly and neat, so I got very anxious and paranoid.

so I asked my boyfriend, 'did you use the colorful condom with someone else?, did we use all the condoms?' and my boyfriend dumbfounded and laughed, he said 'what? of course not! and yes, how do you not remember, we used the 4 colorful condoms together! purple, yellow, orange, green!'
and then I asked if he cheated on me and if he used the 4 condoms, only with me. 

of course he said he didn't cheat on me and I actually know we used the 4 condoms together... I really don't understand why my brain is working like this.🙁

after I wrote my symptoms down I am realizing I need help. thank you for reading my story. feel free to tell your opinion about my symptoms... also I give you folks virtual hugs. you are strong!",21Jun2020,1
36,"Ok, so this is a little uncomfortable for me to talk about but whatever... so I’m a naturally very sexual person, I think about it very often and oftentimes sexual/sexually romantic fantasies are my mental safe space and when I’m bored I tend to scroll through or watch porn for enjoyment. I could have some form of sex addiction but that’s not what I’m here about, I think. I always have a high sex drive and am almost always available and ready to do anything with my partner, even though I’m fairly inexperienced and often get nervous. The issue I’m having is that very randomly my self esteem or self confidence will drop to a near zero. I have a very bad diet and I don’t exercise which affects my libido and that definitely contributes a lot to how I feel.

 It’s worse when I’m alone, and since we are both students and live with our parents separately, that’s all the time. When this drop happens, I become for the most part, repulsed by sex. I feel hate towards myself and can’t even masturbate most of the time, and I know that it’s a very good thing to do for stress especially.

 It’s so uncomfortable whenever this happens and I’m not sure how to deal with it or how to build up my sexual self confidence and my self esteem.
My self confidence is low in general when it comes to anything other than sex, so it’s extra low during this time.

Does anyone else experience this? And if so, how do you manage it? I appreciate any input.

37,"I'm in my 20s, so I'm way too old to be posting something like this, but this is Reddit so fuck it.

The issue I'm having is all the people at my job are guys, and with this pandemic all the AA meetings and even churches in my area are closed.  I'm kind of weird and nerdy, so I don't necessarily fit in with mainstream society.  I don't use Facebook because I don't really have a large social group that I care to inform of my every thought and action...and social networks are designed to be addictive and are psychologically unhealthy.  Inadvertently, I'll compare myself to the inaccurate projections of sheeple that arguably don't exist.

I mean, they exist, but the way people portray themselves on Facebook doesn't line up with reality.

I bought new clothes and I'm starting to buy nice shit, but beyond that I'm out of ideas.  Am I supposed to walk around aimlessly until someone talks to me?  I mean, I'm no ken, but I'm not a monster.  Any pointers?

I know this is kind of pathetic, but I eventually want to start a family.  I don't want to die alone, and my isolationist tendencies obviously won't get me there.  I'm no longer crippled by my social anxiety, I just don't know what I'm supposed to do.",21Jun2020,3
38,"Posting on behalf of my partner with their permission and oversight.

When seeking help if my partner mentions their suicidal ideation then they will be pushed towards if not forced into being institutionalized. Taking them out of their life and being put in holding for 72 hours is both not going to cure them nor is it going to help and when it's all said and done it will likely actually be harmful for them. So how do the seek out help and start working their way towards being healthier mentally. 

I've had my own experiences with depression, anxiety, suicide attempts, self harm, etc however mine were never constant and at this point in my life I have pretty good control over my mental health however that's really all I have to go on to attempt to help them on my own. Where do you fucking turn when you have to lie to get any form of help that doesn't rip you from your life and expect that to be the solution because suicidal ideation is just a blip for everyone so you just gotta get through it then you're all good on the other end.",21Jun2020,1

I get called retard everyday, no one cares about me they just use me as a joke. I recently found someone I really liked and they made fun of me, saying I like a man or “oh she’s looks like a guy, your dating a guy”.

42,"I (25f) spent the day with my mom, my older sister, and my niece. In the morning my mom had one of her usual freak outs because things weren’t going her way (we wanted to leave earlier than she did to go swimming) so she was screaming, stomping, slamming doors, etc. While my mom was never physically abusive and never said mean things to us, she always did behave this way and she sees nothing wrong with it. Her and my sister were yelling at each other, my niece was crying, and I was there trying to calm my mom down. 

This whole thing made me really upset not because it was shocking, ‘cause like I said I’m used to it, but because in that moment I realized that growing up in a house like that is the reason that I am the way I am. And on the flip side, my dad doesn’t talk about his feelings. When he’s upset, he’ll ignore you. Flat out. So I had two parents who never showed me how to properly manage my emotions, or told me that my feelings were okay. Any time I was upset I was yelled at or punished for it, which I think contributed to my social anxiety. 

And so to tie that into another problem I have of desperately wanting a meaningful romantic relationship, I also realized that it’s because even though my parents, siblings, and extended family loved me, I’ve never felt truly heard, held, and supported unconditionally and without judgement. So because of that I have sometimes felt like I wasn’t truly loved. And I want to be loved. We all do. I know that my family will not change, so it’s something I want to find for myself. I want to find that security and peace that has been missing my entire life. I’m realizing that it doesn’t have to be romantic after all, but just someone. Someone to help me not feel so alone in my fucked up family.",21Jun2020,2
43,"I’m going to preface this by saying that I do have diagnosed anxiety, and the specific fear I’m going to talk about may sound completely ridiculous to some. I understand my issues may seem minuscule compared to others, but I really need help, and thinking like that only makes it worse.

I’m allergic to tree nuts. I have been my entire life, though the panic attacks are more of a recent development.  It’s never been fatal for me, the worst reaction I’ve had is the worst stomach ache I’ve ever felt. Never anaphylaxis or anything severe. As a kid, I had the same laid back attitude towards it as my parents - I never even checked nutrition labels. I was diagnosed with anxiety in middle school (specifically centered around socializing), but I never noticed that anxiety in any other facet of my life. Until I accidentally ate a bread dip with walnuts in it at a restaurant. My throat got all itchy and, once I was informed on the allergens, I began to panic. That was the first time I’ve had a panic attack over food. Ever since I’ve been obsessive. I check labels constantly, at minimum triple checking the ingredients list and the warnings at the bottom. At restaurants, no matter what type of food, I bring up my allergy somehow so they can warn me about possible contamination. If I don’t check, if I don’t know for sure, I panic. Even if they assure me I’m okay, I worry that they don’t take it seriously. I’ve always been very subtle, i tend to react internally, but I’ve gotten close to fainting. I know, it sounds absolutely ridiculous. Trust me, I’ve heard it all before. 

However, the main issue is that my family does not understand the extent of this fear of mine. It’s been going on for at least 2 years now. They’ve noticed me being uncomfortable, but have done nothing except for tease me and, if I’m lucky, maybe try to ease my anxieties. A part of that is my fault, I’m not very easy to read and I’ve never truly communicated the extent of my anxiety. But at this point I’m too scared. I feel like I’m going to be ridiculed. And I don’t totally blame them, my fear is unfounded and illogical. I know I won’t die. But I’m scared. Every day I live afraid and I just don’t know how to tell them how much it hurts to be bullied for something I have no control over. 

I just want to stop resenting them and tell them the truth. I love them, I know they mean well, but I can’t do this anymore. Any advice on how to express this to them in a way they will understand? In a way that sounds serious that they won’t laugh off? Or, if anybody has any experience like this, how I should deal with my anxiety?",21Jun2020,1

I already did therapy my whole life till I was 18 and stopped there due to several reasons. But i was never actually opening up to my therapists because my parents dragged me there and i was trying to hide a lot (eating disorder, self harm, suicide attempts, etc.). So I barely told them what's going on with me, just as much so they would think I'm opening up but in fact I wasn't...  
To my own unfortunate I'm a pretty good liar.

For the following 4 years life wasn't easy and I've put my apprenticeship over my mental health over and over and thought because of that, I wouldn't have the ""time"" to continue therapy.   
This eventually would make everything worse.

In fact i was trying to avoid it, because I knew opening up is going to be a tough one... (there's a lot of trauma I wasn't ready to approach just yet.) But now my mental health is at it's lowest and I know that I can't go on like this. I came to the realization that I would need professional help to deal with my problems at this point.

So I've made an appointment with a therapist in my area. This time with the intention to actually open up.   
I don't want to be like this anymore. I want to be happy.  


The appointment is in 11 days. I know the first one isn't going to change anything.

I don’t now why, well I do but I just still don’t understand.. the meds I’m on help a lot more than before when I took latuda, I do feel calm, but empty inside.. and I really wish I just knew what this was stemming from. That’s what makes me the most upset, not knowing why besides the fact I’m not getting enough dopamine&amp; seasoning release, it’s just.. pain. I want to be happy like I was when I was 5 or 6, playing light saber battles with my 2 best friends, Lauren, and Weston. We lived on the same street just one house down each way, we hung out everyday. Weston died in 2016 of cancer and  my heart has been sad ever since. Ever since my grandma and popop died. They were my second parents.. they were the best people that ever lived to me. My idols, who I want to form myself after. They were brave, courageous people who suffered greatly in the teens-40s, my popop died at 102, I was told he stayed alive for me. When he had serious dementia, he only knew me. Not his wife or kids, just me.. I loved him more than anything. He’s my hero, my grandma was my best friend in the world, she was so intelligent. She died extremely unexpectedly the day before we were supposed to have our annual Friday night sleepovers. It shattered me to pieces. I fear something bad will happen to my family, my dog, who was my best friend in the whole world died February 16th 2020. I’m suffering inside, I miss them more than anything.

She was the light of my life, my little baby, I would do anything for her, she was with me through every single bad thing that has traumatized me. Anyways.

59,"I don't want to make this post too personal or long but I think for at least the last 10 years I have had depression, and always had anxiety. I've never actually been formally diagnosed, but something I've always suspected. On top of that, I've had sleep issues for at least the last 5 or so years. Also last July I got injured playing sports which caused my leg to be amputated. It wasn't traumatic in the sense that I'm mentally scarred or depressed from that but I find myself having my anxiety, depression, and insomnia increased. On top of that, I think I might have some sort of PTSD as I'm extremely laid back, but I find myself way more inward and outwardly angry to the point where I actively think about verbally yelling (and already have) at my new coworker and boss. Granted there's a long story and a few reasons, but I'm used to keeping my emotions in check. I just moved cross country and my old job and position allowed me to go to unlimited talk therapy twice a week (for free), but this new job I'm struggling to even get approved to be allowed physical therapy despite telling them I'll only take the position if I could continue those things and ADA existing... but I digress.

While I don't think it's super important for me to be diagnosed, I do think it may be helpful from the standpoint of at least getting medication assuming I can't go to therapy. Does anyone know who I need to go to or what I need to do to have a formal evaluation?",21Jun2020,1

70,"Recently reconnected with my ex girlfriend of 3 years. We made out one night and felt like everything was back to normal. I had moved cross country for a job and fell into a bad pit of constant panic attacks and depressive episodes and substance abuse and ended up ghosting her and completely losing myself for a few months. 

I had to move back home bc of corona and i gave her back some of her stuff and we talked for hours and hours like old times then talked about our relationship and made out and decided to take it a little bit slower this time. 

We’d broken up before due to me falling into a depressive and substance abuse episode. But I sobered up and got better and we were friends for a few months, but I’d always have really bad panic attacks about jealousy. Being jealous and feeling really low self worth when she was hanging out with a guy friend. 

So right now we’re taking it slow and making sure that we actually have a healthy relationship this time and don’t get too obsessed with each other. 

And I saw one of her guy friends on her story and it took me right back to where I was last year. 

I’m gonna talk to her about it tomorrow, because my big like anxiety thing is that I don’t know if she’s been with anyone else or if she like thinks we’re like not saving ourselves for each other or something idk. I’ve always been madly in love with her and never wanted any other women. Even during the times we were apart I couldn’t bring myself to even kiss somebody else, it just felt wrong. 

And it’s fucking me up because of how everybody seems to just hook up with people without caring for others feelings and I want to trust her but I have no way of knowing. Like my friends talk about people doing stuff like that. And that if you aren’t in a relationship it’s okay to sleep with other people and stuff. And maybe I’m just old fashioned or something but I like the idea of only being with one other person. 

Idk. Tomorrow I guess we’ll talk and I’ll bring it up like an adult and tell her that Id like to know if she’s been with anybody else or if she sees us as like exclusive or whatever. Because I see it that way and I haven’t been with anybody else and I like to think she hasn’t either, but I’ve never directly asked her about it and I deserve to know, since it impacts my view of our relationship drastically.

72,"Hey guys. I (26F) lost my job and moved back in with my parents temporarily until I find a new job, which could be a little while til I find something good. Very shortly after I moved back in, my dad, who has bipolar, got into a manic phase and stopped taking his meds. Long story short, things got out of control and we had him involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital. He eventually stabilized enough to be functional and go back to work but is still in a mild mania. He and my mom have had marital problems over the years, partially related to his bipolar and partially just major personal differences. When my dad is slightly manic, he pushes all of my mom's buttons even more and she is always getting frustrated with him. This has led to a nearly constant tenseness in the house, sometimes with them arguing and fighting, sometimes just passive agressiveness. They will each make private comments to me about the other and I have made it clear multiple times that I don't want to be put in the middle of things. I can see both sides and feel like I know what they need to do but it's obviously not my place to be counseling my parents, nor do they want me to do that. They're just frustrated about each other but don't see how to fix the issues. I have told both of them multiple times that they need to seek counseling individually and together because they HAVE to work through things, but they always end up putting it off and not doing anything to really try and resolve their issues. I am a sensitive person who HATES being around tension and fighting, so I just completely shut down anytime that has gone on. I also am recovering from the trauma of my dad's major manic episodes and being in this continually difficult situation that I have no control over only seems to be making things worse. I'm getting more and more unhappy but can't afford to move out. I can get away to spend the night at a friend or relative's house when I need to, but I know that isn't a permanent solution. I did start seeing a counselor but being in so over my head i feel like a meeting once a week just isn't enough. Does anyone have advice on coping/survival skills to get me through until I can move out, or anything else I should be doing for myself or for my parents? I'd also like thoughts/your experience processing and healing from trauma and similar situations. Simple words of encouragement and support will be much appreciated as well. Thanks in advance, Reddit community :')

Tl;dr I'm in a really low point due to a distressing home life. Looking for thoughts on coping skills, encouragement, and other advice to get through this period!",21Jun2020,1
73," So I have noticed that sometimes I will go several days and be happy that whole time, and then suddenly something negative happens, or something happens with someone I love that triggers me feeling anxious and like I'll lose them and it can ruin my mood for several days. For example, sometimes I will feel like I am loved and cherished and then a friend can say one negative comment or can react badly to something I do, or I do something embarrassing and it will ruin my mood for days. 

And sometimes it takes serious work to dig myself out of the low points, like talking with myself, talking with my friends, talking with God, but other times (and more often here lately) it's like I'll sit and try to talk myself through it for hours and then I will have some random thought that appears almost like a ""realization"" and it's like a switch flips in my brain that very second. 

Sometimes the ""flip switch"" even gives my a physical feeling along with it. Like today for instance, I've been upset for two days over the fact I \*might\* have embarrassed myself while drinking, and suddenly I thought of something someone else did embarrassing and realized... I did not care. And nobody cared what I did. Suddenly I got tingles all over my body and I felt a weird sensation in my head and it's like the bad mood was just... gone. I had a hard time believing I had felt that way. Why was I so embarrassed over something so stupid I \*may not have even done\* when I could not give anything less what the other person did?

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I will go for weeks and feel so sad and like this world isn't worth being a part of, and randomly over the course of a few days and sometimes instantly I will get to feeling good again, but when I get into the good and okay feelings it really feels like I just woke up and all the negativity was a dream and almost like it didn't actually happen. Sometimes I just can't understand why I get as bad as I do... like there's a disconnect somewhere between the moods and almost like it's two different people because we cope with stuff in entirely different ways and have whole different outlooks and perspectives... if you made it this far thanks for reading.

There are times where I feel uncomfortable with my gender or my outward appearance. And people have told me my actions and tone change from time to time for absolute no reason.

I don't really know where my actual disposition  and where coping mechanism begins though.... i mean I have a pretty big hunch that my really low self esteem plays a big role in this, it imposes me to take some distance from others in order to maintain my facade, I know i dont have a chance so in order to not get rejected and get hurt I simply don't even develop interest in others.
But frankly I really struggle to grapple any kind of complex emotions, to a point were I started to question if I become emotionally dumb from  the depression and anxiety that I'mgoing trough...

Has little panic/anxiety attacks earlier in the year and, while scary, was at home and they only lasted 10 mins or so.

In Thursday  night after going for work drinks (where i definitely drank too much) i got home to find myself without my bag, coat, keys etc. Was very cold and raining- don't remember too much but after an hour or so i got in touch with a friend who lives in a different city and was basically hysterical saying i didn't know where i was or what was happening (which is really unlike me as genuinely a very calm and stable person).

Without going in to too much detail was in this constant state of panic for about 2 hrs and then another friend got me and took me to a hotel.

Since then i have been feeling really odd - been feeling absolutely exhausted, been feeling as if i am constantly shaking and when i went to the supermarket today i felt really like nervous or anxious being outside.

92,"I’m 20 M and my parents have always been very sheltering and prioritized education over everything but God. I was top in my class all through grade school motivated only by my parents nagging. This constant pressure to do better because deep down I wasn’t good enough gave me very severe social anxiety.

In high school I was peer pressured into applying for the IB (international baccalaureate) program by my parents and of course got in. IB is a highly intensive program that dives into each subject and forces the students not only to be well rounded, but above average in each category as well.

I got my drivers license sophomore year and that little bit of freedom went a long way. At that point I was smart enough to maintain average grades just enough to fool my parents into believing I was still motivated. It continued like this through the rest of high school. While my parents may have been suspicious of my steadily decreasing grades and bad attitude, my freedom grew and I continued to slack off. 

As soon as I was old enough, I moved out and I went to college with an undeclared major because I had no idea what I liked. I was pushed so hard that I was never able to pursue one specific thing I actually enjoyed, and because of that, I had not the slightest resemblance of a path for my future. My freshman year of college was mainly composed of completing gen eds and wasting time. 

By the time my sophomore year rolled around, I had declared a business major and quickly realized I hated what I was doing. I dropped all of my classes without telling my parents and by the second semester I had no motivation to do schooling anymore. I got up the nerve to tell them I wanted to take a ‘gap year’ and despite my parents being mildly, it was ultimately my decision. 

This entire time I was working a full time minimum wage job to pay for school, rent, car stuff, etc because my parents would not pay for anything once I moved out.

Once I started to mature enough (senior year in hs about) to have the insight to look towards my future I quickly fell into depression. Nothing I do is fun, I have no friends because of my crippling social anxiety, and I can’t go to my parents with anything besides news about going back to college. When the corona virus started spreading, I got laid off and money quickly started to run out along with any remaining hope for happiness. 

I have tried to meet girls and stuff but anything that might have a chance of becoming real fizzles out in a few weeks leaving me heartbroken. My lack of companionship my entire life (romantically or otherwise) has lead me to catch feelings for anyone who will give me a second glance. That, along with social anxiety and no real practice with commitment continues to chisel away at the dark stone that is left of my mental state. The only support I had ever previously received came from work, where people were forced to interact with me. My depression became obvious and shortly after we were all laid off. So with no work, no support from parents, and no friends, I’m left with the dark and impersonal responses from people over the internet just trying to do some good. I’m forced to grasp onto this because it’s all I have left to hold onto. The only thing that separates me from a purposeless life that will quickly dissolve even further into debt. 

Hold on I need to go respond to another girl who just wants to be friends. Little do they know that friends would be enough, but even this will fade.",21Jun2020,1

It sounds really pathetic but something as little as someone reminding me that I’d said I would do something which I forgot about makes me feel like I’m a failure and instantly takes me to rock bottom. It’s like a mix of extreme highs and lows and I feel like I’m going crazy. 

Can anyone here she’d some light on what may be going on cos I’m really scared, I felt in recent months like I might be making real progress but then everything flips in an instant and I’m in a deep depression again. 

Thanks to anyone who takes the time to read this, I’m trying so hard to stay but these dark thoughts are creeping in again and I don’t think I can cope with it much longer",21Jun2020,1

Now he wants me to choose a sport to play when quarantine is over,I can’t choose no, he already started my depression and now i have to choose because we are - last names- I’m so close to just gutting him like a fish,",21Jun2020,1

99,"I've always had a bad relationship with food. I struggle with cycles of binge eating, heavily restricting, binging and purging, and being extremely picky about food. I don't understand any of it and it's exhausting. 

I want to lose weight and have been slowly since I finally learned how to keep myself from bingeing, but now my eating habits are getting weird and I have no idea why. Since I've been under quarentine, it's gotten really weird. 

I'll seperate salad buy veggie in piles then eat with a fork, I'll get a sandwhich from a store or resturaunt but pick it apart and eat everything seperately. The other night my husband made spaghetti and I seperated the veggies and noodles then only ate the veggies once the sauce was completely wiped off with a napkin. 

I've also started mixing water with my food before eating it. It started off with me pouring some water on some bread because it was a little hard and I was hungry but we forgot to go grocery shopping. From there it just turmed into me pouring a little water on almost all of my meals and mixing it in before eating it. I don't know why. It makes the food taste bland but I just do it anyways. 

I haven't picked this up from anywhere and I don't feel nervous or anxious when I do it so I don't think it's some type of ocd thing. 

Each day I get more confused and frustrated but don't know what to do apart from see a therapist the second I go back to work. 

I'm worried now because yesterday out of weird impulse, I put a torn off strip of paper in my mouth and started chewing on it. I chewed on it for a while and intended on spitting it out, but didn't. I ended up swallowing it. 

For some fucking reason, today I wanted to tare of another strip off a piece of paper and chew on it again. 

I feel like I'm going crazy and I don't know why. I think that's what's hurting the most. I want to at least know why things are getting so fucking weird.",21Jun2020,1
100,"My brother has spent hundreds of dollars on audio files from a scammer named Robert Zink who purports that the ""Law of Attraction"" is the solution to every problem a person has. My brother wears headphones the entire day and during night, listening to these audio files that will help him manifest his dreams. He has said multiple times that he will manifest money, obviously when asked where the money is he doesn't respond. He also says that this garbage works because it has helped him deal with mental issues, which he won't talk about. It is extremely frustrating because obviously its the opposite and it has worsened whatever mental issues he has. He refuses to get help, and is extremely defensive whenever asked about how listening to this garbage has brought him tangible results. He consistently references famous people who also support this garbage like Conor McGregor. Who is known to be a supporter and believer of the ""Law of Attraction"" and visualization. As well as, other athletes who mention this and credit it for their success. With their huge platforms support for this garbage is really damaging to the public. Anyway, how do I help my brother? This has been going on for so long, at first we thought it was a phase and eventually he would realize that it brought no results. But, his delusion is consistent and we don't know what to do to help him.",21Jun2020,1
101,"Yeah, it was bad. My bro who was one of the most incredible people just fuckin up n died on thanksgiving. Fentanyl. The summer before he died, I was listening to Saba song and I had a panic attack thinking about my little dying. Some might call that premonition but honestly I was constantly afraid of him dying. I'm a social worker. I'm 26 yo but since we had a somewhat rough upbringing and Ive had some intense jobs I knew my little bro was high risk, even though I didnt know he was on drugs or to what extent... 

My mom was consistently loving and caring despite battling severe depression and abuse from my father and our cult. I understood why my mom couldnt get out of bed for days and why she told me she wanted to hang herself in our closet.. My dad and cult upbringing trained me to be helpful and pleasing above all else. I saw my moms weaknesses and I took over most of the duties. I made sure my brothers rationed the food, I interruoted the most violent confrontations and sometimes even managed to deescalate it. 

My brother and I were SO close. Some might think it was weird but to be honest we had been through too much together to give a fuck. We were poor a lot of the time and that meant putting our matresses in the apartment kitchen and bunkering down without internet. My mom, my brother and I found solstace in each other after my mom escaped my dad and the cult. We were all free to explore new things together and even the smallest freedoms made life worth living. On the hottest days, we would sit in the park and read a book out loud together until there wasnt enough light to read. My brother was the man that taught me how men were supposed to treat women. He was a fuckin knight and he treated EVERYONE with that respect. It was his biggest fault (no confrontation was missed if justice was at stake) but it also made him so pure. 

Last year, he had a psychotic episode and stole my dads car and drove it into the ground and got into a 22 mile car chase with ICE. He said his radio told him to... Remarkably, he escaped ICE and layed low until I came to pick him up. I spent a few days with him and persuaded him to go to a long term mental health program. My connections helped me get him into an amazing place, he loved it and got to be right on the oceanside. He made wonderful art and music while he was there.. During that time I didnt see him.. 

I moved away to Las Vegas to take car of my ex bf mom who got mad cow disease. It makes me mad that I spent that time away from him especially when I knew he was struggling.. 

My ex was undiagnosed schizophrenic for the firdt 4 years of our relationship.. He would fly into rages tell sometimes where he would scream racial slurs, sexist slurs, violent things etc. He would break my windows with his head.. Things wers hard..  

I got sick while I was with him. So sick I couldnt walk or stand.  My brother took 24 tabs of acid a few weeks before dying and told me that my bf was making me sick. I got defensive but we stayed cool. Ibtold my bro the dr put me on synthetic opiates for my sickness and he begged me to get off of them.. Told me to sip lean instead, ha. 

When he died I couldnt take any more opiates so I quit then cold turkey. The hospital wouldnt treat me without insurance they just offered me potassium lol. 

So, I stayed awake for 8 days. Wide awake. Running, sweating, vomiting, and meditating. By thd 8th day I felt AMAZING. Too amazing... It was my first manic episode with psychotic features. I started doing crazy math things haha and I thought I was going to somehow cure the abuse in my family like a goddamn savior. I randomly told everyone in my fam that my dad sexually abused me.. Which aside from him groping me and making me strip for belt spanking at questionable ages.. I cant tell exactly if he abused me to the extent that I think he did.. I have some flashbacks that are confusing and they correlate to a spot on my stomach that feels like knives when its touched. 

I was laying down on my back on the floor deep breathing when my mom came in and put her hands and head on me to comfort me. My response? I attacked her by grabbing her hair and arms so hard she said I was throwing her around like I was a 3pp on man... As I'm grabbing her arms hard, I start screaming about my dad raping me. Yeah. Idk what to even say about it. Then to make things worse inwas so delusional I didnt even recognize how violent I was. I thought i was justified because my mom didnt believe me? But my mom and I hadnt even talked about it... I also thought my mom was like possessed hahaha. Yeah it was bad. 

So MONTHS later, I'm clean from opiates and ive kicked out my ex and outed all my past abusers... i realize ive  been COMPLETELY insane and I make amends with family friends etc.. 

Now I'm just here doing life, trying so fucking hard to scrape up money for my car registration but crying in between pizza deliveries and working a dead end social work job. I cant afford medical insurance or therapy and I feel like no one in my family will trust me again until I get help. Shut- I dont trust me! I need help and its all anyone tells me... *get therapy*.. I found therapy and now its an intern who isnt even abke to give diagnosis",21Jun2020,1
102,"Hi. I'm a 31-year-old female who has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, anxiety, and mood disorder. I have also been suffering from insomnia due to anxiety. Recently, i was prescribed to take quetiapine at 12.5 mg every night to help with my mood and to help with my sleep. I was able to get better sleep lately but still wake up at least two times at night. There are also days when i feel like i am so tired during the day even if i get deep sleep.

My question is, how is your experience with this medication? This is the first time i ever took drugs for my mental health and i have been taking it for about four days. Has it helped you out?

My worry is that sometimes after I take it, i feel very slight muscle twitches on my neck area. Not enough to make me move, but i feel the muscles twitch. This will happen immediately after i take it at night as i fall asleep but they dont persevere during the day. I have read about tardive dyskinesia caused by this drug.

I'm 20 now and my anxiety has gotten really bad from being stuck at home for the last 3 months. I feel like I can't let myself be happy for more than an hour or 2, my brain is constantly looking for any problem, which 90% of the time is irrational or I have majorly exaggerated in my head. Just this week, I freaked out that my boyfriend is anti-feminist simply because he didn't like my retweet about awareness for sexual assault. I also flipped out when he said ""can't wait to propose in 4 years"" when usually he says 3/4, and I convinced myself he doesn't love me because of this? I also freaked out I has skin cancer because of a totally normal mole I was BORN with that my parents got checked before and has looked the same forever.! I Googled excessively about skin cancer for hours and hours I was so scared. I did the same when I thought I saw something in the corner of my eye and I thought ""yeah I'm schizophrenic"" and I obsessively Googled too. These specifics are just some of my obsessions the last 10 days, I've had 3 nights in this period where I slept less than 3 hours at night. 

My mom saw emails when she went to use my iPAd from an online counsellor I'm going to start talking this week. She panicked and then told me ""oh it's all in your head, everyone has anxiety, you're just bored and need a hobby"" and she mentioned how people pretend to have mental illnesses cos they read about them online and that I don't need therapy cos I'm not that bad?

108,"i’ll try to keep this as concise as i can! 

-i’m a 21 year old girl, 5’6ish, and i weigh ~85 lbs. on average, i eat one meal a day, probably about 600 calories/day. 

-no matter how much i want to, i just can’t make myself eat. i usually forget to eat for an entire day or sometimes two, but i don’t really experience hunger when i forget to eat. sometimes i’ll go get food, but as soon as a smell it or see it, i want to throw up. on rare occasion, i want to eat so much that i feel like a big food trash monster, and i’ll eat a half dozen donuts, or a whole mcnuggets meal or something (that’s a Lot of food for me). 

-i am happy with my body right now, but i’m really skinny (my mom told me i look emaciated lmao) and i’m definitely not trying to restrict my eating to stay skinny. if anything, i wish i could eat more so maybe i could have some curves 

-i was diagnosed with persistent depression disorder and generalized anxiety disorder about two years ago, and i know those things clearly affect my eating habits and health, but idk how related those are in my current situation. 

-my lack of eating has been happening for about 6 months; there haven’t really been any substantial changes in my life, though. i’m a full time college senior, i work in a neuroscience research lab, i’m in a happy long term relationship, everything has pretty much been fine for a while. so why am i like this?

110,"Lately my childhood trauma has been coming back up more often than usual.
I have a lot of childhood trauma. Both of my parents are narcissists and the abused and neglected me all my childhood. It's hard to admit sometimes and most times I automatically go numb when talking about these things.
I automatically go numb when talking about any of my experiences! So this has caused psychiatric hospitals and therapists to assume that I am okay.

I can be ""okay"" if I have enough distraction (Facebook and youtube all day everyday)

I've been a bad partner and I'm incredibly controlling and clingy.
To the point that I follow my partner around somedays and constantly ask them questions as if I were a toddler.

I feel like I'm going crazy right now as well. I quit my job earlier in the year and haven't been contributing no rent because I feel unable to go work (because my mind and mood changes so suddenly and so much that I cannot willingly keep a job for too long) i isolated myself from everyone and have been at home falling in and out of depression. I either sleep all day and dont get out of bed or i am being this clingy and annoying and suffocating person to my partner. 

I've been thinking of submitting myself to a psychiatric hospital because the feelings have been getting stronger and stronger and I've been literally losing my mind 
Some days I feel like I cannot grasp reality and it lasts all day if not 2 days straight. 
I am constantly binge eating and completely hating how I look in the mirror to the point that I want to starve to death.
I've also been thinking of starting to harm myself again.

I'm incredibly self aware of everything right now
Every little thing I say and every way my partner reacts to me and I've been having panic attacks over not having control over these behaviours and not knowing where to go to spare him from them.

I don’t like thinking about people I’ve had a falling out with because it feels weird and they would be uncomfortable knowing that. It’s not intentional. I just can’t keep thinking about them like this it’s unhealthy. Things happen for a reason and me thinking about it every single day is tiring. 

I’ve lost so many friends and ex’s and I’m not doing well. I miss those people so much and would do anything to have them back because life was actually enjoyable and I miss them. I care so much about them personally and well being. I never meant to hurt anymore emotionally. I’ve grown and I know rights from wrongs and I just wish to get another chance to fix things with anybody I’ve wronged. I’m not perfect at all and they know that. I just regret everything and I wish everything wasn’t real. I constantly think about what I should’ve did different or how I was in the wrong and how it could’ve saved me.

113,"Possible TW-Sexual assault and ED

I'm not really sure where to start except me(17m) and my girlfriend(16f) have been going out for around 6 months now we've known eachother for over a year and have in the whole time of knowing one another shared mutual romantic interest,, we never go together because of distance,, I really want to be taken seriously with these concerns and not like I'm idk self diagnosing or diagnosing without a doctor's that's not what I'm doing, I just see behavior that I myself have done in really depressive states that she is doing and I'm scared, we are both living in different towns so its hard for me to really do anything

For starters and the first I'm concerned with is she doesn't eat a lot she's 5,0 and 96 pounds she keeps on losing weight she normally only has one granola bar or just drinks Tea,, she knows there's a problem with eating but she says it used to be done to lose weight but now she can't stop,, her parents don't understand mental health at all, they just think she's being stubborn and not a actual problem, plus even if they did want to see a dietitian or something like that there isn't even a doctor of any kind in her small town, just nurses, plus her family isn't exactly well off so it would be extremely expensive, 

Another thing I'm worried about is her lack of concern for bad things that happen to her, I myself have struggled with admitting there's something wrong I have gone through a lot of therapy to work through it and realize I should do what's best for myself and my mental wellbeing, but she doesn't probably the worst that she is going through, is her childhood guy friend is being really creepy and has touched her saying it was just him playing around or that she moved in a way where he had to,, or grabbing her phone and looking in her camera roll for pictures of her,, it makes me extremely upset of course hearing this stuff but she says she doesn't want to make things awkward by telling his parents or hers, I've asked her to confront him herself but she's scared I'm scared too I guess, I have no idea what to do

I want her to realize she is worth so much not just to me but to everyone around her, but she just tells me its fine and it will all be fine she just needs to wait for it to go away and she'll forget about it,, I've cried because I have struggled with the same view on things before and its such a deep pit,, I wasn't able to get out until I was forcibly hospitalized while it was the right thing that had to happen it was extremely difficult to not be able to make the decision myself I don't want it to come to that with her, I want her to make the decision on who to go with with her problems because I can't be her only resource, I'm still a kid who still struggles every once and a while I'm going to stand by her side all the way through but I can't be the one to carry her, I'm scared

Idk if this even makes grammatical sense sometimes I'm just worried and at a loss of what to do, I'm sorry if this doesn't fit this sub please direct me to one can is more fit and I will move to that sub, thank you I'm sorry idk where else to go, I live in the USA",21Jun2020,1

120,"I'll try to make it simple.  
I've (24F) been in a relationship with my bf (31M) for 4 and a half years. We have had a lot of fights and arguments. Mostly out of misunderstanding and also personal issues. We have worked things out always. I've done mistakes, he has done mistakes and we try not to chain each other. I was accused often of not being honest, and kinda like I was made to tell him everything. To not keep secrets in our relationship. But I was young and didn't really think things through. I used to be in love with this guy, but nothing ever happened, I just had a feeling that he kinda liked me, we were close. Anyway after getting into my relationship, the guy contacted me and we hung out, I sometimes had doubts about him, but it was all in my head. It was mostly like I wanted him to love me and I would reject him. I was obsessed with him before my relationship, like big time obsession and I think I just needed closure, I just needed to get him out of my system. He was to me my soul mate, I was young and in high school. Anyway all these things happened in my head, and we hung out like friends a few times. And once I asked him if he ever loved me and he said he did, but he didn't know how to act. Anyway I was happy cos now I know I wasn't delusional thinking that he likes me. I didn't have any feelings for him, and I still don't. But this caused a lot of trouble in my relationship, which is normal. But my bf is very accepting and we handled it. After some time about this year, random things would come up in my mind, of guilt the stuff I've done, all the thoughts I've had, and the only way to get free of them was to tell my bf. So I did, I told him some stuff which I thought were irrelevant, which are in fact because those things can happen to almost anyone. I told him about the guy what kind of thoughts I've had and that I feel guilty like I've cheated on him. We fought, argued but my bf said he didn't care he understands me and wants me to be happy and that nothing what I've done has hurt him. He wants me to be free and happy. So after this, everything started. I ended up telling him every single thought I've had, about him, about others, about my daydreams (being in movies, a celebrity,etc) things that I've done in the past which have nothing to do with him, thoughts I've had about him, etc. All of these because I felt guilty. I felt guilty for almost everything. He also got mad at why I'm telling him nonsense, but I can't stop myself. Then I'd tell him something about the guy I loved and he would get irritated and say maybe you're not facing your truth, call him don't call me to tell me this, it seems that you love him,etc. And everything is now very scary to me. I'll watch a movie and if there is a romantic scene, or idk something along the lines ""You still love me"", my brain connects it with the guy, but I know it's just happening because right now I'm questioning everything I did, and I'm just so scared and afraid of thinking. I told him that sometimes he didn't look attractive or that sometimes I would have wanted him to have bigger shoulders. But it was my mind, like I feel guilty for thinking like that, I'm not perfect and I love him so much he is perfect to me, but sometimes, rarely and unconsciously I'd think stuff like that. And he said don't worry everyone thinks like that ok, don't feel guilty about anything. He supports me, I can't into full detail, but now I just can't stop telling him everything I've thought and think. Now I can't stop this feeling of guilt and fear. I'll watch a movie and compare him to other men, or think that he is not attractive, and I'll just feel shitty and horrible. I can't see why I can't focus on the times where I didn't have any thoughts like this, where I found him so attractive and was so in love. We love each other a lot. We've had our ups and downs. But idk, I just feel so horrible for thinking stupid things, which aren't even my thoughts, thoughts are just information from the data we have collected. I feel so horrible, and have been taking pills to calm down my anxiety, I've had panic attacks, and I doubt everything. I have dreams where I've seen the guy I used to love, and then woke up feeling like I still like him, and it's just so unbearable anymore. I don't even know what I feel anymore, my mind is a mess, my body is a mess, I keep throwing up. I know I haven't done anything wrong. He knows that as well and tells me that constantly. Now he also obviously is not cold, but idk how to put it. He doesn't want to be attached to me and I to him. He says let's leave it to time, everything will pass, we'll see how it goes. But I also have feelings of fear that I ruined the relationship and that I fucked everything up, and I just can't get rid of these feelings. I don't know what to do.  
My bf says you don't have to tell me anything, it's your life, do what you want, you can't hurt me and you didn't hurt me. But I still feel so shitty, I don't even know if some of the things I told him were real, or just a product by my mind in this shitty state. I'll feel guilty if I said something to my friend, and I'll feel guilty that i didn't tell my bf. It's ridiculous!   
I'm just so scared of what I'm going to think, I try to face it and think about it, I calm myself down, but it still gets me.  
I'm scared what I'm going to think, or remember or dream about, because then I'm gonna feel guilty and I'll have the need to tell my bf, because that's the only way I feel idk forgiven or making things right. I feel fair if I tell him. He says that I've kept a lot of stupid things inside with fear and they are just leaving their marks on me while I get them out. But this is ridiculous! I admit I was scared in my relationship, he was jealous in the beginning, a bit paranoid and all. We had a lot of trouble, then I became jealous. But now he is like a different person, and I think it's all from the fear in the beginning. I'd eat myself up if I found a guy attractive, I'd forcefully make myself not to like guys, even my bf tells me it's retarded what I did, and that I should be free.  
I just don't know what to do. I'm in a chaotic mess, I'm just so scared, and delusional, I accuse myself of the most stupid things, I feel sorry for the person I am, I doubt myself and feelings, I really don't know what I'm thinking. I feel so guilty for the person I am and all the things I did, I know that I didn't do jack shit, but this guilt is eating me alive. It's been a month or so of me feeling like this.   
I just really feel sorry for everything I did. I never meant to hurt him or have any hidden agenda. I did mistakes because that's how much I knew back then. This is my first relationship. I was and still am a weak person, and this has always happened to me, if somebody said anything to me, I'd doubt myself and think maybe they're right. But this is too far, I'm seriously thinking that I'm losing my mind.  
I've been reading on psychology, mysticism and everything related to this state. I might have PTSD from relationship and I have all the symptoms. I also want to see a psychiatrist, but this whole pandemic gets in the way.  
Please if anyone could I don't know help me in someway. I feel so bad and that I've ruined everything. Even though my bf and best friend say that I haven't, but I just can't stop this horrible feeling!  
I don't want to be scared anymore, I don't want to doubt myself, or judge my thoughts!  
I myself am a mess. I have no idea what I'm doing or thinking! I just can't help but judge and punish myself and I would often think that I deserve this, because of what I've done!  
Please if anyone could say something, I don't know what, just help me or say that I am not the only one feeling like this.",21Jun2020,1

122,"**Trigger Warning**: This post is about Anorexia, Bulimia, self-harming and suicidal thougts

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know where it would be the best to start so I'll try to summarize everything chronologically.

My (now) girlfriend is in a bad family situation. They're fighting a lot without the fights getting resolved. She started to feel worse and spend a year abroad partly to escape her family. In this time, she lived with relatives of the mother's family (her mother is Canadian). During this time she had something like a family and had a beautiful year. 

She came back last year in August. With the time she had to start her old live again (school, etc.) and then it became worse. In November she began eating less and losing weight (she doesn't look pathological skinny but compared to older pictures you can see a significant difference). With the time she start to harm herself with a knive at the wrist. Not deep and you would need to look closely to see it.

I know her since the kindergarden because our town isn't that big and we live only five minutes apart but we were never really interested in each other. Around New Year we started to write and do things together. Until February I had no clue that she has some problems. We both knew that we were more than just friend and in February, after watching a movie, I wanted to kiss her. That was when she told me she doesn't know if she could do that and told me a bit about her problems.

Over the time, she opened up more and more. However, she became worse and worse. She developed Bulimia (but not exactly how you would imagine it; she ate way less than others and tried to eat healthy). She tried to not scare me and didn't told me of it and pretended that she's feeling better (she's the kind of person who always tries please the others and forget themself). She planned her suicide in detail. She started to buy pills and wanted to take them the day after my last exam (I'm graduating this year). Luckily, her mother read her notepad where she wrote it down and had to went into a clinic for a few days. This really helped her (she even stayed longer than she had to and seemed way happier) but sadly not to long. Three weeks later she were so down that she didn't care about anything. Normally, she would have hid it from her sister but this time she didn't even care if her sister sees it. Later when we were alone she said the without really thinking about it at least six ways how she could kill herself would come into her mind. She also refused to call a hotline if her night gets worse (we're in Germany and the hotline is from the clinic, so it would have been helpful). As a reaction I talked with her parents and we brought her to the clinic for a second time. She were released eight days ago.

I'm pretty sure that she would not commit suicide for now because on Monday we had our first kiss and she is going to get a place in clinic stationary for therapy which is giving her hope.

A huge problem is her parent. They are about getting divorced but are fighting heavily. I'm about to be the mediator (not for the parents but the kids because they're really suffering). But I don't know how else I can help her at the moment. Yesterday she got really down out of nowhere. She cried loudly for over an hour which seems to be a good thing because she were unable to really cry for a long time. She used to hide in her room instead.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have any advices what I could do (except for just being there for her)?

It really can't continue how it is at the moment. I wrote that her parents are causing a lot of damage. To give you an example: After a fight one of her parents usually goes to her and complain about the other which turns her down. Two weeks ago I drover her to a hospital to get a wound stitched she did to her as a reaction of feeling bad after such a fight.

130,"1. **Start The Day With A Positive Affirmation.**

Start your day off with full of smiles and a positive attitude. This will set you off for the day. Always start strong!

2. **Focus on the good things, no matter how small they are.**

When you encounter with a challenge, whether if it’s big or small, focus on the benefits. For example, if you’re stuck in a traffic, think of the positive this can give you. You can now listen to your favourite music or podcast for longer. Always think positive in bad situations!

3. **Find some humour in bad situations.**

However bad the situation is, make it humorous. If you can, try and crack a joke about it or think about how the situation would make a funny story in the future. This can work wonders in the darkest situations. 

4. **Turn your failures into lessons.**

Everyone fails at something. Doesn’t matter if it’s sport related, work problems, family, friends or a situation in the past you had committed, turn it in a lesson and learn from it. You’re not perfect, I’m not perfect, nobody is perfect - we are all humans, and we all my mistakes. Don’t be too harsh on yourself. You made a mistake? Take it as a learning curb and move on. No matter the situation, how bad it is, lift your head up and look straight ahead. Don’t live you life with your head down and upset over a situation you cannot fix as it was in the past. Learn from it and move on with your life!

5. **Focus on the present.**

AKA Live In The Present. As corny as it sounds, live in the moment! Life comes at you fast, live the moments that you are currently in and enjoy it. 

6. **Find positive people to be around. This can be your FAMILY, FRIENDS, CO-WORKERS.**

Fill your life with positive people who have a positive mindset, people who bring joy to your life and brings a smile to your face. When you surround yourself with positive people, you get positive outcomes, you’d be able to tell positive stories. Eliminate the negativity out of your life. This will work when surrounding yourself with positive people, AKA family, friends....

7. **Transform your negative self-talk into a positive self-talk.**

An example of this is “I’m so bad at this”. Turn this into “when I practise more, I’ll be much better”. 

Positive energy and mindset will help you throughout the days. I’m not an expert, I’m here to help as many people as I can. Here are just a few tips to help you out, if needed. 

Have a wonderful day everyone! And as always, my DM’s are open at all times. :)",21Jun2020,1

136,"I wonder how common such thoughts are? They are some thoughts that I think to be pretty meaningless but stubbornly remains in part of the consciousness for some time. It had not happened to me for months, but today it happened again for some trivial thing and it was uncomfortable. Mostly it would be mild, the obsessive thoughts would just last for several minutes, but sometimes it lasts for several hours or days. It felt like some loophole or bug that gets kind of stuck at the front of the consciousness.

For example, I remember hearing someone saying 'It's the first time you do this. It's natural to be nervous. We all get nervous.' several years ago. I never thought it to be 'natural' to be nervous. So after hearing it, I wondered 'what??? everything is a 'first', every moment is new and the body becomes a new body, so they think one should be nervous at all time?' Then it became somewhat obsessive, talking to someone, I'd think, 'huh, talking to this person for the first time at this exact situation, so I should/would be nervous? NO!!! Don't think such useless thought.' It was similar when doing some other things. And the obsessive and intrusive episode lasted for several days.",21Jun2020,1

We got ready and headed downstairs and he asked me if I could feed the cats, change their litter trays and clean the kitchen up. I complained a bit, half jokey, half real, and then I continued to feed the cats, clean the kitchen floor, clean the worktops. Then he came downstairs and did the litter trays. I then said that I was going for a run. He stopped me and said “when you get back you have to help me with the rest of the cleaning” and he said it in a way that was saying that I never do anything and then he gave me this contradicting look when I said that I do clean. I felt like I was completely being spoken down to. At the moment he is jobless and cleans whilst I’m at work but the majority of the day will hang with friends, play games and search for jobs. When he was working and I was part time I used to clean everyday and I never made him feel like he wasn’t doing anything.

146,"This is something I’ve never talked about with anyone in my life. I’ve kept it hidden for years for a plethora of reasons. But, the other day it was especially bad while I was on a trip with my friends so I basically had nowhere to run or hide with my emotions. I had gotten extremely trashed with some friends and they said I had started sobbing for no reason and I wouldn’t reply why while blacked out.

Eventually I sobered up enough in the evening and one of my bestfriends was sitting on the back porch of the cabin with me. He was asking if everything was good before the dam just broke. I told him that I was gonna tell him something he might not believe, but that I had been struggling with depression for years. He just looked at me and listened while I told him he was the first person I had ever told and that I never like to speak about it because I’m suppose to be the “beacon of happiness” for essentially everyone. I wasn’t ready for what happened next .

He came over and hugged me while sobbing. He said that he was sorry that I have had to go through this and that I’ve had to go through this all alone. He begged me to talk to him whenever I was down because he didn’t want to wake up one day and realize I’m not there anymore. We stayed like that and talked for at least 30 minutes and throughout the night.

One of my other best friends (and future roommate) came out and I told him I needed to talk to him. So he sat down and we started talking about it. He’s not really the most emotional guy, but we’ve been there for each other. He asked a few questions and immediately went off. He said he was determined to make me wake up everyday knowing that I’m loved by everyone and that I can look myself in the mirror and say I’m happy. He said that he’d kick it with me, watch stupid movies with me, do fun trips, honestly anything to make me happy. I told him that the reason why we’re bestfriends is because he already did all that and more without knowing my situation and that’s what has made me happy and that’s why we’re always hanging out. That’s when we both broke down and immediately started sobbing.

I truly am grateful for my friends. I’m hoping this will help me. However, I won’t lie, I feel exposed. Here’s to hoping for change.",21Jun2020,1

153,"Depression is characterized by varying degrees of 

1. Hopelessness

2. Helplessness

3. Worthlessness

These are the cognitive symptoms which is not physically manifested but has to do with the thinking of a person

1. Hopelessness leads the person to stop believing in a future which is worth living for. 

2. Helplessness is the belief nobody or nothing will save him/her or can better the situation that person is in.

3. Worthlessness is filled with self doubt and loss of meaning in existence. 

All these three combined can make a person feel that life is nothing more than a torture and maybe he's not cut out for ""living"". 
The pain seems endless with no help and no hope.
But whether a person is thinking like that or not, to find that out, you have to be either their therapist or should have really talked to them extensively about their feelings. Nobody who is going through all this will ever pick up the phone and call you to tell you their story. Atleast we shouldn't expect them to. In majority of the cases calls up and says, ""Hey, I'm depressed"". So all that posts which say ""please talk, I'm here to listen"", in my opinion they are just a way to make ourselves feel better rather than really trying to help. IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. And truth be told, they aren't actually there when you need them. An actor committed suicide and everybody is concerned about mental health for a week, and people want you to call them when you're low instead of them checking up on us? That's how real concern is shown? That's not how it works. Please stop making everything a trend and then trying to fit in &amp; being a part of it. No need to be a savior of thousand lives by trying to put up a status saying, ""I'm here to listen"". Just look around you, in your family, in your friend cirlce, at work. Don't wait till another famous personality commits suicide for you to be woke again. 
If you really care about a person, approach them if you notice
1. Low mood
2. Lack of interest in activities
3. Lack of energy &amp;/or concentration
4. Decreased sleep/appetite
Listen to them.
Listen to them, create a safe space for them to open up to you, ask them how they're feeling and empathize with them. 
YOU, ME OR ANYONE can never truly understand what another person is feeling, so we should listen closely and empathize with them. And please don't say stuffs like, ""why is such a small problem bothering you"" or ""c'mon it's nothing, cheer up!"" 
As soon as you feel it's beyond your comprehension, you should help that person seek professional help.
Please be kind to each other. Only humans have the ability to use language to communicate, it's not a joke, so please use your words wisely. 
YOUR WORDS CAN MAKE/BREAK SOMEONE'S MOMENT/DAY OR EVEN LIFE. Sometimes I talk softly to someone who has done wrong to me, but being that person, I make sure that it's okay if I'm polite with my enemy but never okay if I'm rude to my friends. So let's consciously make an effort to play our parts and be the change our society needs.",21Jun2020,1
154,"I hope this is the correct r/

Human nature is to stick to known things in broad spectrum of meaning.
This would imply conservatistic traits would be dominant in population.
From experience I find more people to be impulsive and constantly wanting to change. Change anything, anyone, anywhere.
This urge 'to do something' most of the times leads to something, sometimes.

I can sit all day in the same position knowing the same stuff and I am well.
Life is constant and I know tomorrow.

Society labels me as a weirdo because my own mind can entertain myself, of course I need some stimuli now and then.

This is bad?

I find very few exciting or sad moments in life, its kinda flat. Im not depressed nor antisocial. 
Im very open and get on with almost all people.

I think of myself very low and can't change it but I understand that so its a cycle. I feel like dog, nah people tell Im good, I disperse that feeling.

I feel like psychopath wanting attention so I don't seek any.

Feel lonely sometime and return to my conservative self and entertain my brain with thoughts. 
Stupid most of the time. Stupid like me cause I laugh to myself sometimes.

156,"So to begin this off, I week or so ago I found a subreddit that involved mass killings ect. I went down the rabbit hole, as I usually do when I find something that is interesting, even though morbid.

For whatever reason I research the hell out of it, their motives, their words ect, not that I sympathize with them at all, infact I find it creepy that people sympathize with them, it really weirds me out.

Anyways It's been a week of researching fighting with conspiracy theorist assholes, watching confession and interrogation videos, as well as a semi stressful day yesterday.

Anyways, I do this sometimes like with those reddit posts ""What's the scariest unsolved mystery or ""Scariest unsolved tape ever"" posts, I will comb through them until i'm paranoid. This isn't very often and it lasts a week until I just stop looking into it.

Okay.. heres the hard part. I had an intrusive thought, and it was homicidal (even typing that makes my anxiety flare up, if it's even anxiety) Now, I do not want to hurt anyone, and it a combination of reading that they had those thoughts among other things that with that single intrusive thought, I FREAKED out, I felt light headed, my body was heavy and the only thing I wanted to do was get up and walk, I rushed out of bend and paced for a little thinking ""Holy shit what is happening"" My body was hot, and I was panicked, this happened at 3:30 and its 8:36 now and while the main issue went away, I still have a lingering anxiety.

Heres the other hard part, I keep getting that same intrusive thought (Not really right now) but when I was trying to go to sleep after the initial anxiety attack (Which im not sure it even was) when I close my eyes, it was like a fluttering of random pictures, the intrusive thought and a song I listened to earlier on repeat, and this happened from like 4:30 to 7. I couldn't sleep and still havens, I don't even want to try because i'm afraid as soon as i close my eyes, all that stuff will come back, as i'm typing and thinking of other shit, it's not even close to being like that right now, no intrusive thought, no song on repeat, no fluttering of random images.

When it was happening it felt like I was not in control, but I obviously was, I could think semi-rationally other than the absolute fear of what was happening.

The only thing I can even describe that was like this, was when I first got tinnitus and the thought entered my head that it would be permanent, and my body just went into full blown panic mode (It did end up being permanent)

So yes, i'm afraid, I didn't sleep yet, I don't know if I can even sleep yet, I've never really had this happen except for the tinnitus issue, which happened 5 years ago. Am I dangerous? Is this normal?

So what I felt during, body was heavy, felt like I was dropping, dry mouth, body extremely hot with some sweating, tried to watch videos but couldn't concentrate, when the first initial wave was over, still had that lingering anxiety which would ramp up if I tried to sleep, I was also yawning a lot not sure if from tiredness or what lol

Jesus christ guys, you guys deal with this everyday? I'm so sorry. I'm fucking SCARED.

So yeah Initially happened at 3:30 am, it's 8:43 am right now and I still have that weird feeling in my chest/stomach.

Also I should add I don't really normally get intrusive thoughts, if ever, and not sure if relevant I also did have around 436 to 530 mg of caffeine through soda drinking (Yes I am aware of the health issues lol)

I'm afraid that this wont just be a one off thing and I just awoke some fucking crazy anxiety disorder ..which Ironically.. Is giving me anxiety lol.

So yeah, not sure what happened, but i'm praying to whatever god exists that once i finally somehow sleep, it will be gucci.

There were also some anxiety inducing events that happened earlier in the week, such as a root canal which terrified me (But ended up being ez pz) and I need to get crowns in a few days, but i'm not really worried about that",21Jun2020,1

162,"Hello im a 21 year old male in need of some advice

so to start off i have struggles talking to people, looking people in the eye and sometimes it gets so bad that my friends have to do the talking for me,

this all started when i was 10 years old and i started having (IBS) which makes it very hard for me to go outside so i kinda never left my home except for school until i became 15 years old, when i became 15 i got my drivers license and i couldnt even enter stores alone anymore or even order food from mcdonalds.

this has became a little better nowadays but people still see me as super weird or they think i dont like them cause i can barely talk to them. this has ofcourse made it so ive lost all my friends except two.

so after losing almost all of my friends, barely being able to go outside cause of my IBS, ive been having alot of thought about killing myself and i have become very grey if you can call it that.

grey meaning that i barely have any emotions left, i can see people getting really hurt and stuff likes that where people usually react like: are you okay? or should we call an ambulance?. And ill just stand there or not even bother,

the worst part is the suicidal part, it has seriously limited my way of functioning combined with my IBS

like almost everynight i go out for night drives where i on purpose drive very fast on windy roads just for the chance that my car will lose traction and ill go out quick, im to much of a pussy to hang myself.

i got a job 5 months after graduating and was only able to work there for 3 days cause everyday i would just come home and cry myself to sleep cause of my suicidal thoughts, so i graduated 1 year ago and has worked 3 days of that time and i cant find anything that can make me happy.

like i wanna start working out but i cant find any will power for it, like i wake up att 3 pm then i just mindlessly sit and do nothing for 5 hours before i go to sleep again and repeat next day.

ive started doing digital art and that has helped a little with my suicidal thoughts but it will take years for me to be able to make a career of that.

&amp;#x200B;

any advice for me to get motivation or supressing these suicidal thought?

&amp;#x200B;

tl:dr: just me ranting cause i have noone to go too for help and i just wanna find someone which have some tips for me to become a functioning person again so i can make my parents proud.

165,"Hey everyone. As stated in the title, I'm simply too dumb to live. I can't keep up with my uni (I should be about to finish year 4 but I'm stuck in year 2), anything requiring mental focus is beyond tedious, I barely speak my mother tongue (let alone English and other languages). People think it's ok to call me up on it and say I'm ""simple"" as a euphemism for ""literally brain dead"". No, it's inappropriate. I've always thought I wasn't the brightest out there but not really that I'm the stupidest out of all the people who have ever inhabited the earth. I don't even feel like a person anymore. I feel inferior to the fly, stupid little fly.

It's a surprise nothing has killed me yet - and I wish it did. I don't deserve to be alive because of how stupid I am. The simplest of things overwhelm me. I shouldn't be allowed to contact actually thinking humans. It's so bad that I started having delusions that my brain is dead, just my cerebellum is active to provide me with the most primal survival. I can't even reach out to my psychologist as her office is shut down because of the pandemic.

I feel horrible. I think about killing myself to stop this misery and spare everyone having to deal with such an intellectual disgrace. 

I have a psychiatrist appointment soon. Should I tell her about it? Maybe it's one of my delusions (schizotypal here). 

Maybe, once my psychologist opens up, I should ask about intelligence tests. However, I'm terrified of them. I don't want to turn out to be intellectually disabled, which 99% I am.

166,"Where do I start? I am a compulsive liar, I have anger issues, and sometimes I think my thoughts are a bit suicidal....

Let's start with the lies, all my life I have lied. Since I was a child; they range from tiny to massive. For example my wife will ask if I have done something like if I filled up the salt shaker, and 9/10 times I will say I have regardless if I actually have or not. She will then go to use and realise that I haven't, she will then come to me and ask again to which I become aggressively adamant that I have, when when she holds it in front of me. The worst was when I had been telling her when we were up to date with the rent and out landlord called her asking why we had only been paying half for 3 months; to say the least she was embarrassed &amp; furious. Things like this have been going on all my life, to the point were I can see it on faces of my wife and family that they don't believe a word i say. I have tried so many times on my own to sort it out. Scouring the internet for help but never actively sought professional help; my wife has encouraged me to but I haven't.

Through it all my wife is still with me but our relationship is soo extremely strained by it.

To be VERY CLEAR with my anger, I have NEVER once been physical with anyone. The only person I have ever hit with my anger is myself. Whenever the lying starts an argument it will get to the point of us screaming at each other i walk away and start muttering to myself and the anger continues to build and build to were I am soo angry I wanna lash out, so I punch myself; usually the jaw or cheek bone were I instantly feel it the pain to calm myself down. I will end up hitting myself a few times before it works. Try to hide it by switching sides to minimise bruising. I let the anger build up so bad it just explodes.

The suicidal thoughts I think about is when ever I wait for public transport. It can either be a bus or train, when it approaches I watch it and imagine myself jumping in front of it. I wonder what it would feel like, would it be quick &amp; painless, would i feel the train push me forward first, would I survive the hit and then get dragged underneath... 

The only thing that always that stops me is the thought of the damage I would do to my family, the driver and passengers; I also personally think that suicide is a cowardly way out but I is my personal opinion on the matter. I do understand that those who do commit suicide are going through a lot but I that there is always another way, that and the damage suicide does to everyone around you.",21Jun2020,1
167,"Please don’t judge :/ maybe I am just lazy but I would love to know if there’s anyone out there who struggles like I do and how they deal with it. I genuinely have no motivation to get a job. It’s not dire, I’m in my early 20s in college and I’m really fortunate that my parents pay for my absolute necessities but I still pay for extra stuff (clothes, eating out, traveling, etc). I never ask them for anything. Anyway, I still want to make money and work because A. I have a dog and I want to obviously provide for him and B.

170,"There are essentially many types of diagnosed mental health “conditions” that many of us battle with on a daily basis. In my case, I am what my psychologist describes as a manic-depressive, obsessive compulsive man that suffers from severe panic attacks. My days are as normal as a “normal persons”. I am extremely successful with business, lead normal relationships (or so I think), and have 3 wonderful children. 

In my situation, I always feel I am living a life within a life, and never my own life. I feel like it’s borrowed time, almost like a borrowed body. I put on this mask to become daddy, to be this business extraordinaire but it’s never really who I am. And then that begs the question: who am I? A good friend of mine once asked who knew me, “who actually knew me”...and I didn’t have an answer so the reality is I don’t even know if I know myself. 

I don’t say that in terms of being down on myself. I say it in an uplifting manner. The life I am living within this shell of a life is the life I actually control, my life. I’ve spent so much time running away from my mental health problems instead of embracing them. Sure, it isn’t healthy to embrace psychotic behavior that is destructive. But the majority of the time, I just want to tell myself - or for gods sake just hear one time from my psychologist - it’s OK to be myself. It’s OK to blend in with my habits. It’s OK to feel down, or to feel up. I am who I am, I’m doing my best to lead a life and I am tired of being treated like a caged animal. I feel good, I look good, I’m successful and sure I have moments but I am OK! 

And so are you! What’s your story? Do you feel so abnormal from how others treat you, what the internet tells you, or how it feels good to recluse in your home to low rhythm music and feel deeply in your bones you’re not OK because that’s what the world tells you?

I feel like I’m fighting a constant up hill battle to feel content, to just not have this pit of sadness in my stomach, and though I’m happy regularly I always come back down within a few days. The descent seems inevitable and inescapable. 

I’ve told my mom how I’m feeling before and she’s always said that bad times are normal - but is it normal to be constantly going down? Like do bad times happen to everyone for seemingly no reason every few days?

And I know I don’t have it bad - I’m definitely not and have never been suicidal, but I guess I’m wondering if how I feel is totally normal and I should just deal with it for the rest of my life, or if there’s something I could do to stop it, because its getting fucking exhausting",21Jun2020,1

The user u/theepicking777 is going around this subreddit as well as others and using nasty remarks to put people down. He even says mental illness doesn't exist and is actually based on IQ, which is clearly false because many clever people have mental illness.

187,"A long time ago, I saw a girl who seemed to be walking away from highschool. They were very sexy. I felt harassed. I did not ask for them to be so sexy. It makes me impulsive and uncomfortable. So anyway, that wasn’t the worst part. I followed them and then later asked them for their instagram. And they didn’t give me it. This is disgusting and bating. You know those people in gta who use mods and freeze characters then have money drop in front of them, then they collect it and then release the frozen person and kill them? This is the same mindset of these sexy women. But women are much worse. Because this is not a game, it was complete reality. In fact by women being sexy they are setting up hundreds and thousands of men to be set up for prison. This is absolutely disgusting. How can I cope with women sexually harassing me?",21Jun2020,0

190,"Hello,

27F, I'm from a middle class family, mother having trouble with expressing emotions towards me, rarely physical, didnt like to hug her children, rarely even told us she loved us. She's the type who will try to convince you she sacraficed everything to raise you, so that you were successful thus you should be forever grateful. She's very focused on keeping up the appearance of a perfect family life. Noone really knows what has been happening to me.

Father - an agressive type. Worked his whole life, made some money in his own company. Once he gets angry he looses it. Bigger guy, he will grab you by your clothes and push you towards a wall. He has frequently beaten me with a leather belt, no pants. I still remember the sound of the closet hinge he was keeping them in. For the outside people - perfectly nice guy. Too nice. 

Have 2 brothers, 6 and 12 years apart. They both did martial arts as teens so they were perfectly capable of choking me while holding me down to the ground. I was always bruised on my neck, arms, legs. They enjoyed doing that to me. And i was so young, then it felt normal to me. Now we very rarely speak. We have no family relations. I dont care for them... 

Last year while still living with my parents, due to my brother's mental breakdown, during an argument we had above the staircase my father almost pushed me off the stairs. While my mother was yelling ""shut the front door, neighbors are going to hear you"". She didn't defend me, the only time it really mattered.

I was scared. Ran to my car, frantically drove off, scratching the car door while trying to leave as fast as I could.  Drove 20km away, parked in the field and slept for the whole day in my car, ocassionaly crying my eyes out.

Everything was curated to look so perfectly from the outside I felt like my boyfriend felt like I was overreacting. Like it wasn't really happening to me.

Then came the depression. I was both working a dream job and finishing my university. A lot of stress, a lot of pressure. I starved myself because I was afraid to sit with other people at the work dinner table. I hated listening to their perfect lives because mine was so awful. 

Then I tried cutting. It brought me some relief. Noone even blinked at home. Noone knew. 

I moved out very shortly after but was left with a huge mental scar. I think of suicide every single day. 

I'm not worthy of living. I hate myself and people around me who wouldn't protect or understand me. I went to therapy for some time. Done antidepressants. But I saw no progress... so I quit. 

I just don't know what to do. I hate it so much, what it did to me. Who I am because of it. I disconnected from everyone I ever knew. I pretend I'm ok because it's the only way i know how to behave. I don't speak to my father, even though my mother desperately wants me to.

I just don't know how to cope with this. I want to get back to hurting myself.... what should I do. 

Please help me. 

P.S. If you are still reading this - thank you it means a lot to me. Sorry for any grammar mistakes. English is my second language. Thank you",21Jun2020,2
191,"It all started about 6 months ago, around February. I had a particularly bad week, and slowly felt more and more.... weird. It felt like the world around me wasn't real, like I was playing a video game or watching a movie. It has gotten worse every week since then. I told my mom, and began going to a therapist. He didn't really help me at all. He would listen to me talk, sometimes explain elements of anxiety in general, but nothing more. He talked a lot about what we would do to help me, but never followed through.

Last session he told me he was going on a vacation, and that if I needed to talk more we could negotiate after. The way he said it it seemed he thought we were done.

But the problem is, it's all just gotten so much worse.  I feel like I'm walking around half asleep. I get surprised every time I talk because it feels like I am just a passive viewer in my life. I constantly feel like I'm about to faint. When I look at nature or anything well-lit it looks completely unreal, like it's a painting or a movie. Sounds are louder, and I am more jumpy/on edge. It's so bad I don't know how I get through the day.

I honestly don't know what to do. I need help, but my mom is pretty mad about how much money therapy cost. I'm norwegian, so there is an option of ""public therapy"" which is much cheaper but 1. My problems apparently aren't bad enough (like my mom said, you basically need to be on the brink of death) and 2. I would get a child/teen therapist, who mostly deal with more child/teen issues. 

I don't know what to do. I don't know how much longer I can go on like this. Please help.",21Jun2020,1

This line always comes out when I explain that I'm having trouble making progress. I'm diagnosed with Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar disorder, bpd and PTSD. I wish I could live a life without my mental illnesses holding me back but I'm not at that stage yet. It feels like even people who love and support you have very little empathy for us. My mother was always good at taking care of us but I've received quite a few traumas during my short life and it seems to just rack up.

198,"I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety but for the past four months this feels much worse.....

I constantly feel like all my friends hate me. I'm always afraid that they don't want me and that they want me to leave them, or that they will leave me. I often get very anxious when I am alone, but I don't know how to reach out to people when I need help. Sometimes it gets to the point where I can't stop thinking people hate me and I feel paranoid. 

I've lost so many friends over the years. I try my best to be a good friend, but when my mental health goes bad, they leave. When upset I feel the need to hurt myself. I have impulsively cut myself without even realizing what I’m doing, and  usually I hit myself in the head or on my legs over and over until my legs bruise so I can feel something . I also have thoughts about wanting people to beat me up because my hate for myself goes so deep that sometimes I feel like pain is the only way to release what I feel. I have had suicidal ideations for nearly two yearss

I’ve been dissociating - I feel disconnected and like I don’t exist. I know I’m depressed. I find it hard to get out of bed and motivate myself. I cry a lot. I hate myself as a person, my personality, how I look. I have anxiety a lot too and I have self harmed

But I also can’t control my thoughts. I feel like my mind is out of control. I see mental images of me slamming my head into windows or. breaking down and becoming insane even though I am not currently insane I don't think. I am afraid that I will one day go insane without knowing. I hit myself in the head when I’m upset and I don’t know why. I make so many mistakes.

Sometimes I think I see things moving but they aren’t. I feel paranoid a lot of the time and think of all the ways that people I know can hurt me if they wanted to. 

I can’t read people and I don’t know if they like me. But I’m very clingy and desperate for people to like me because I can’t handle being alone. The loneliness makes me suicidal. I try to be a good friend and I help everyone and am nice to everyone so they don't leave me and I never let anyone know about my struggles

I don’t feel like I’m coherent at all right now and I’m sorry but I am desperate because I don’t know why I’m like this",21Jun2020,1

I’ve always flipped flopped on almost every aspect of my life and i feel like i can’t focus on something for more then a month at a time.

208,"So long story short, had a weird day, was tired. Drove out to work to make sure I didn't have to relieve someone, I didn't. On way back for whatever reason I made a scenario in my head that car without headlights was following me, it wasn't real but it was supposed to be just a creative thought process/writing thing.

The following weeks I had been researching mass shooters, mass killings ect, I always go down rabbit holes of morbid stuff and generally freak myself out and then I stop, usually has me on edge for a few days, but nothing like this.

While laying down, had a single homicidal intrusive thought about someone in my house, and not even a milisecond later, I was in fight or flight. Pacing, panicking, dry mouth, limbs felt heavy, felt dizzy and light headed. How is this happening to me? am I going to become one of them? Comparing my traits to them ect.

I knew it was an anxiety or panic attack though, this same feeling happened when one of my worst fears appeared, I got tinnitus, this same exact feeling. Which.. had another symptom, whenever i'd close my eyes I would just play out random uncontrollable scenarios (this is what SCARES me the most) and they would make me super anxious, they aren't scary or anything, and only happen when I close my eyes. But now I just have a bit in my stomach that sometimes rises a little, then doesn't.

I can't pretend i'm not scared, and I can't pretend im not reposting this, but I can't sleep, not sure if that's normal.

I'm hoping I just wound myself up with all this stuff and it was a onetime thing. Is that likely that if I just avoid all the morbid shit, this won't ever happen again? It's never been a problem but once in my life, when I realized I had a permanent issue forever (tinnitus) The same panic.

210,"So I have reoccurring depression and generalized anxiety with elements of social anxiety. As a result of the depression I have racing thoughts, and as a result of the anxiety I tend to overthink things..This combination makes my head evaluate and think about every possible aspect of all things of my life and all possible outcomes and consequences of things.

This last episode of my depression, every time I've been interested in some girl/woman I've met a few times, and it seems like she might find me a bit attractive... I think about literally everything: 

Things like how I would go forward, what it would be like if I got rejected, if I would be down to marry even though I'm not a marriage kind-of-guy, if I would be willing to have kids, a scenario where I convince the person to adopt instead, getting to know her friends, etc.

I know it sounds insane, but this is all against my will. This combo of symptoms is a plague of the mind. I may be a little lonely, but then again who isn't? And my upbringing has made me into a person who has chronic existential crises whenever I'm not in a relationship. That being said, it's not like I'm super-needy or desperate either. A few girls I think were fairly attractive have shown interest in me this past year, but the feeling hasn't been mutual.

This isn't limited to dating, etc. But I believe it can be especially bad when it comes to dating. So please, does anyone have any idea of how to stop this? I'm going to therapy. But it doesn't really ""solve"" it.

222,"Hey, I'm not sure why I'm typing this, but I'm just super anxious and just wanted to went. 
I've struggled with depression and anxiety for over 4 years now and tomorrow is the first time ever I'm going to be talking about it with a professional. I mostly didn't seek help earlier because my parents weren't very supportive about it and I was in bad terms with them. I'm super awkward and shy and suck at socializing so I'm scared about how this is going to turn out and what type of questions she's going to ask me. The thought of opening up to someone who I dont know terrifies me.

224,"Hi all.

I have no friends, and never had any good relationship with another human. I always thought it was because the people around me, and because I have bad social skills. But now I realize that its because I have no intrinsic interest in interacting with people. I want to want to interact with people, and have good relationships, but I just can't. I feels so unnatural, people all seem to be in the uncanny valley for me, and I would rather just be alone. But that is probably part of the reason why I feel depressed.

There are times when I'm in a social environment, and instead of paying attention to the people around me, I will start counting ceiling panels or carpet patterns or something like that. Then I wonder why people don't like me.

So the question I'm trying to ask I guess is how can I develop curiosity and interest in other people, because I want to have good relationships and interactions with people instead of being so isolated.

so about two weeks ago I visited my dad after spending 7 monthes without seeing each other so we were talking about random things until I opened my laptop and played a shooting game after a few moments my dad started commenting about how it's a boys game and I shall be dressing some dolls on a girls games websites I told him games are games any gender can play any game if it's making them happy he said"" no this is a boys game, do you see boys dressing a barbie?no they can't do it just like you can't play a boys game"" I didn't answer him and I even leveled up 2 levels he then tried to be ""cool"" and started saying he is going to play better than me because he is a boy and he is used to games like this . I hate him.  I hate ho he says I should be more girly and if I show a bit more skin then I'm a slut I hate this way of thinking I hate how he says I'm fat although I'm 58.70 kilos ""129.4 ibs?"" and I was even down from 63 kilos "" 138.8 ibs?

I just hate my self honestly I tried for a good while  of time to be girly to be more appealing to  my father's family to my aunt to my mother but they said started saying I can't wear short clothes I can't put makeup on  and complained about my grades. I'm not even allowed to have friends from the other gender and they started telling my cousin she is a slut because she had friends from the other gender.

241,"First, I must tell you my credentials. I have been a dedicated psychologist, therapist, psychiatrist, doctor, and counselor for over 20 years. I have done it non profit

I have tens of thousands of hours dealing with all types of mental illnesses and people

Personally, when I see a troll, it is best to ignore them.

This goes along with the trolls on this subreddit, and also applies to attention seekers

When you see someone claiming bipolar, adhd, autism, schizoprenia, or depression, or anything else (comment if you need clarification) then ignore them.

Anyone claiming mental illness is seeking attention. All of them. Not a single one of them are actually serious. And if they claim suicide, just ignore. They will not harm theirself if you are worried about that. They are faking it.

Let the trolls know that you see past their act. They are under the delusion they are a good actor.

To stop self harm, ignore the person self harming. Once they stop gaining attention they will stop.

This works with dogs too. If they are barking, ignore them. It is literally in the books and all experts agree.

So when you see a human “barking” with their mental illness claims, ignore them. It will train them to be a better person.

An example of this going wrong is etika. Etika claimed mental illness and was led to suicide because people gave him attention for his trolling and self harm.",21Jun2020,1

245,"Considering the circumstances of the world, the fact that I can't see my psychiatrist, that I can't get meds, see my friends, etc, I feel as if I am doing pretty well for myself. 

In some ways, I am grateful for this time I've been stuck at home. It's the first time since my Bipolar II diagnosis at 17 (I'm 19 now) that I've really been able to stop, step back from the chaos of school and my brand new adulthood, and take stock of what my ""normal"" is. It is during this time that I've finally allowed myself to validate some of my concerns and actually work to resolve them instead of swallowing my feelings and chocking them all up to my Bipolar irrationality. My confidence is growing each day, and I am slowly making progress to become a more confident and self-assured person.

Of course, as is to be expected on any road to betterment, there are obstacles.

My mother is truly one of my best friends. I love her very much and she is a fantastic mother. She has very good intentions, I have no doubt of that. 

But, some of her behaviors have popped up as big roadblocks on my path to amelioration. She has a few very bad habits that I have talked to her about in the past. 

When, for instance, I express my frustrations with the behavior of a sibling, she responds with ""well, my brother/sister have said things more horrible than you have ever experienced in your lifetime and we worked through things"". She's expressly forbade me from talking directly to my siblings about their negative treatment of me. 

If I express any sort of discontent with *her* behavior, she says something like, ""I know I'm the worst mother in existence"", or ""You must really hate me if you think that"". 

 And, the most painful thing of all, any time I show any outward signs of irritation or sadness when speaking my mind, she interrupts me and asks, ""Did you take your pills today?"". 

I've done my best to kindly and with as much understanding as possible explain to her how these reactions to my struggles have made me feel-- belittled, ignored, and, as much as I don't like the term, a bit crazy. I've told her that these three particular habits are really hindering our ability to have a productive conversation and that I worry that I won't be able to have the relationship with her that I know she wants to have with me because she can't seem to separate me and my valid frustrations from the fact that I have Bipolar.

I am fully aware that I have my irrational moments when I am experiencing an episode but I'm not always in an episode, I've told her; I'm a person with emotions and frustrations and wants and needs just like everyone else. 

After many conversations of this nature, I would have thought that she would've at least made an attempt to be more open, but nothing seems to have changed. None of the issues I've indicated to my mother have been fixed, and because of it, I'm growing more and more bitter at my siblings. I know it isn't fair, but I often feel as if I get more backlash for expressing my exasperation than they get for the behaviors.

I feel invisible and it's really taking a miserable toll on my mental well-being and my relationship with my family. I don't want to harbor any more resentment. I don't want to wallow in self-pity. I just want to be heard. 

I want to sit down with my entire family and have a discussion about how I am feeling and possibly start to resolve some of problems, but I don't know how I would even begin to approach the discussion. 

I don't want to shame them or lecture them or anything like that, but I do want to show them how things can look from my point of view and explain why their behaviors can impede my ability to improve myself and our relationships. 

How in the world do I go about this?",21Jun2020,1
246,"Whenever I'm on a night out with friends or other people I've met, I wake up the day after, completely cringed out by the things I've said or done. Sometimes it just are small things but it bothers me so much that my whole body is cringing and I feel so extremely ashamed. I don't know how to properly explain what my body does in such a moment, but I either cringe or make weird faces, or scratch myself as a way of letting these feelings out, but I'm probably just making them worse. Usually when I tell people whats on my mind they dont understand why I'm so hard on myself, but I can't let it go. I've also been to therapy for this problem and it got a little bit better and I have been taking antidepressants, but it still didnt fully go away.

She didn't really ask me any questions and it felt like I had to carry the whole session. She didn't explain to me about the diagnosis she gave me which was affective mood disorder or didn't even tell me of my diagnosis specifically. Like was it depression? Bipolar? What exactly? Was she not able to say for sure? All she did was give me a prescription and told me that she was gonna give me the specific medication and how to use it.

I have roughly a 45 minute drive to work, I’m on midnights, and at my job, we don’t really do much. We do 30 minute checks, but other than that, I’m staring at a wall for eight hours, sometimes 16. Many people I work with say our job is the easiest job you never knew you could hate and anyone I’ve ever talked to has said they can’t pinpoint what exactly it is that they hate. I can’t either. I think it mainly has to do with the fact that there is ZERO positivity. Constant negativity from almost everyone.

With all that being said, almost every night on my way to work I will get intrusive thoughts. I’ll get them at work even when I’m trying to keep my mind busy. It’s not always when I’m on my way to work, it could just be when I have a long drive to somewhere also. Sometimes I’ll hop on my phone and watch tiktok or scroll through whatever social media. (yes, I know this is illegal, but I’m looking for any kind of distraction at this point.)

My question here is, have you ever experienced intrusive thoughts and if so, how do you handle them?

I also want to add that I do know my job is one main source for my anxiety and depression, but it’s also one of those jobs that once you are there, you are stuck... at least for a little while.

259," ***Because it’s a symptom. That’s all - it’s a symptom.***

&amp;#x200B;

Let me explain.

When you break your leg, it really f\*cking hurts right? It’s a symptom.

When you have a concussion, acute memory loss is a symptom.

When you’re depressed, you want to kill yourself, and as if that’s not enough, you feel as though everyone would be better off for it. And guess what - **it’s a symptom**.

&amp;#x200B;

I read a blog a while ago that described depression as a very clever illness. It takes you away from everything comforting, until you feel as though you have nothing left, no happiness, and then it hugs you. You almost feel comforted in the sadness; I for one know how comforting that can seem to feel, and how it can make recovery scary, foreign.

But it’s all an illusion - it’s not real.

People will not be happier without you. They are happy with you here, I can promise you that.

&amp;#x200B;

You have a choice.

Today you can choose to live, or choose to die.

260,"About 7 years I (28F) think my ex (34M) might have taken an unconsented photo. It was during an intimate moment and I saw his phone briefly in his hand but I don't know what he was doing with it. I can't help but assume the worst. I didn't think at the time the bad things he could have been doing. I was pretty innocent, trustworthy and hadn't been in many relationships. The relationship was brief but quite toxic. 

I've no proof that he took a photo, that a photo was sent to anyone or that a photo was shared/ uploaded somewhere but I just can't stop thinking that there could be a photo of me somewhere that I didn't consent to or even know about at the time. Would I be identifiable with the years that have passed and the lower photography quality? I've searched on  Google images for my name and location etc.but I know there are so many places it could be if it's true.  I'm just very anxious about someone I know possibly coming across this one potential photo of me or it somehow getting to my work. I can't stop thinking about it. It's taking over my life at the minute. I'm constantly googling how to search for a possible photo etc. It's awful. 

I just don't know what to do and it's making me really paranoid and down in myself. 

P.s. I never sent him or anyone nudes, sexy photos etc.",21Jun2020,1
261,"So for as long as I can remember I generally always feel down. I have thought of taking my own life, but I won’t. I have some pretty bad social anxiety, hate making eye contact, wont talk unless spoken to and I wish I could be more out going but I can’t. My low self esteem is constantly reminding me that I’m fat and that’s all anyone will see me as. I try to lose weight, I do good for about a week and then I binge eat and take laxatives. I’ll starve myself for a few days, and binge eat again. The only thing making me feel happy and relaxed right now, is weed.  I keep trying to convince myself nothing is wrong with me, but I need to realize that not everyone feels like this. I want to better myself, but after being called obsess in 3rd grade by a doctor I have so much anxiety when it comes to things like this. Calling and setting up an appointment for my health gives me so much anxiety. I know a lot of people have been telling me to try online care, especially now since it’s easy, but I have Tricare. I would have to call and make an appointment to then get a referral so I could go off of the military base and even thinking of doing that makes me anxious.

262,"I hate myself. Here's why.




During my younger years, my great grandmother moved in where I live. She is the kind of person who... had certain teaching methods. During the 7 years of living with my grandma, she would berate me and my sister with remarks. She would mainly aim them at me, calling me weak, fat, a baby whenever i cried(I cried often for reasons I'll explain later), and a wimp. Whenever I made a mistake, she would say the exact same thing and I can never forget it: Do it right the first time, and you never have to do it again.

These words messed me up in the head severely, but since I had to do the tasks she gave me and keep up with my schoolwork, I was never able to address my problems until they came back to screw me sideways.

Around April of last year, she moved out of the house after and argument with my grandma about the way she treated me and my sister. I was more than happy.

And then things went wrong. 

I started to say similar remarks that she gave me to myself. I began saying that I never deserved to live and I still don't. As my happiness plummeted, so did my grades. This was around before the quarantine started. I then started considering suicide. I kept thinking to myself ""Five benadryl, five antiseptamine, And five excedrin, that's all I'll need."" 

I eventually was seen crying during math class, and sent to the school psychologist. Happy ending right? WRONG.

I was told that I would be able to get a therapist and I would receive the help I need. That was when the quarantine started. I always will try to talk others out of death, but never myself.

All I needed was help. All I needed was to be loved.

I grew up without a mom or dad, I am autistic, making my reactions to things different, I have a little brother and little sister who I am only able to see only once a year, I now have a new little sister. She won't even get to know her 13 year old big brother. All because I never got help. 


And to the 777 guy who will say that I'm making all of this up for attention, I have a story for you:

Ok to start I’m not in immediate danger, I’ve had passive suicidal ideation for I don’t even know how long and although I have a plan, it’s not anything that I plan on putting into play until I get a few other things sorted out.

Anytime myself or anyone starts talking about suicide, people always come out and say things like “it’s not the answer” and “it’s a permanent solution to a temporary problem.” The thing is how does anyone know that? Anyone who has actually committed suicide can’t say whether it was the right choice, someone who attempted will often say they wish they hadn’t, but it got them help, but others continue to deal with this until they succeed. I get that the idea of someone taking their own life is hard to understand and causes pain for people around them, but why should someone who is in so much pain stick around just to make others not have to be in pain? When I was younger (probably like high school aged) I found the idea of medical assisted suicide for people with terminal illness very interesting. I feel like we do this with the elderly or those with severe terminal illness where we just help them to be comfortable until they die naturally and same thing with our pets, so why do we suddenly feel that someone else’s pain is more important than helping ourselves to be free of the pain we’re in.",21Jun2020,1
269,"Edit: FORGOT TO ADD TRIGGER WARNINGS (sexual assault, ab*se, dark thoughts) 

I just finished my sophomore year. My freshman year was the worst year of my life by far. I don’t wanna get too into it (if you’re curious I made a whole master post on my page in an attempt to get my feelings out) but long story short I was in an abusive relationship that really did a lot of damage to me and he did a little bit of irreversible damage to my body as well. I haven’t been in that relationship in over a year now and I’ve been seeing a guy for about 9 months who makes me feel a lot better. Sometimes certain things trigger a flashback for me from my first relationship and then a lot of other memories come flowing in that really hurt me and make me feel nauseous. This doesn’t happen often when I’m with my current s/o (but it does sometimes) but it happens frequently when I’m alone. How do I stop thinking about it? Do I need some form of closure to let everything go? Do I have PTSD from the past relationship? I’m just really confused and hurting a lot inside from all the emotional, psychological, and physical damage he caused to me. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. This quarantine has been a highlight for me because I haven’t had to see him everyday at school, and I’ve been doing a lot better since I haven’t been seeing his ugly face. But sometimes he’ll like something on tumblr (I can’t block him since he has me blocked and can unblock me whenever he pleases), or he’ll make a whole new Instagram account and attempt to follow me, and it sends me spiraling. I’m stuck. I’m miserable when these thoughts happen. I don’t know what to do. 
Sometimes I have fantasies about murdering him (and his girlfriend who I have really bad problems with as well) and I start mouthing words (I only know this because someone asked me why I mouth things) and I get so into it, and once I’m pulled out of my world I have this really weird feeling in my stomach. I wish he was gone and he would stop bothering me. I wish he would leave me alone for the rest of my life. What’s wrong with me? Why am I like this? Why did this happen? Am I dangerous? I’ve never hurt anyone (besides the time I fought a kid for making fun of my autistic brother) and I’ve sure as hell never killed anyone. I tried talking to my mom about this but she thinks I’m overreacting. I’ve told my cousin a little bit of what happened and she offered to take me to therapy, but I declined because I was too afraid of my parents finding out about it. I’m so scared. I just want everything to stop and I want to erase my freshman year from existence.

I cannot think about the last time I started feeling down again, but the dark atmosphere is back.

It seems to me that the only way I can think straight is when I start writing down my thought. Most probably, because I tend to escape every moment I feel alone. As if, I am running from an unknown shadow. Only that I know this shadow very well, I can see him as much as I do when I see myself in a mirror

This dark and hupe monster has always been my deepest fear. The feeling of being left out. The strange state when I am trying to escape the simple and intuitive conclusion in my head that I am unlovable, that l can't be loved, which nobody wants to be intimate with me. However, my lungs are too tired from running out. I am too exhausted to start another round of escaping from myself. 

My sexuality, the feeling of being horny all day every day. Seeing every one of the people around me having their needs satisfied. Yet me, an average successful young man compared to the people in my age, have not had sex in a year and half now,

It is weird to talk through this with a friend, I have this big fear that will not be taken seriously, but god knows how much it did destructed my state of mind. Not mentioning my weird habit of trying to impress others, hopefully someone will have a crush on me one day, so I would satisfy the emptiness that grows bigger every day

Now, it has been 3 months since I feel this way, but it disappears since I am having a good conversation with a girl. In addition, it comes again as soon as I realize that there is no sex involved in the relation (I live in a conservative country). So I feel caught between my sexual urges, and me feeling that I am a pervert because of it.",21Jun2020,1

284,"\*Disclaimer: I did already post this here, but I accidentally deleted the whole post instead of my comment on the post, so I am reposting\*

Considering the circumstances of the world, the fact that I can't see my psychiatrist, that I can't get meds, see my friends, etc, I feel as if I am doing pretty well for myself.

In some ways, I am grateful for this time I've been stuck at home. It's the first time since my Bipolar II diagnosis at 17 (I'm 19 now) that I've really been able to stop, step back from the chaos of school and my brand new adulthood, and take stock of what my ""normal' is. It is during this time that I've finally allowed myself to validate some of my concerns and actually work to resolve them instead of swallowing my feelings down and chocking them all up to my Bipolar irrationality. My confidence is growing each day, and I am slowly making progress to come a more confident and self-assured person

Of course, as is to be expected on any road to betterment, there are obstacles.

My mom is truly one of my best friends. I love her very much and she is a fantastic mother. She has very good intentions, I have no doubts about that.

But, some of her behaviors have popped up as big roadblocks on my path to amelioration. She has a few very bad habits that I have talked to her about in the past.

When, for instance, I express my frustrations with the behavior of a sibling, she responds with ""well, my brother/sister have said things more horrible than you have ever experienced in your lifetime and we worked through things"". However, ""working through things"" seems unlikely in this case because she's expressly forbade me from talking directly to my siblings about their negative treatment of me.

If I express any sort of discontent with *her* behavior, she says something like, ""I know I'm the worst mother in existence"", or ""You must really hate me if you think that"", or something to that effect.

And, the most painful of all, any time I show any outward sign of irritation or sadness when speaking my mind, she interrupts me and asks, ""Did you take your pills today?""

I've done my best to kindly and with as much understanding as possible explain to her how these reactions to my struggles have made me feel-- belittled, ignored, and, as much as I hate using this word in this way, a bit crazy. I've told her that these three particular habits are really hindering our ability to have a productive conversation and that I worry that I won't be able to have the relationship with her that I know she wants to have with me because she can't seem to separate me and my valid frustrations from the fact that I have Bipolar.

I am fully aware that I have my irrational moments when I am experiencing an episode (and I've told her as much) but I am not always in an episode! I am a person with emotions and frustrations and wants and needs just like everyone else. I also happen to have a mood disorder. It's a part of me, but it's not the *only* part of me.

Anyway, after many conversations of this nature, I though that she would at least make an attempt to be more open, but very little, if anything, seems to have changed. None of the issues I've indicated to my mom about the treatment of myself and of my stuff have been fixed and because of it, I'm growing increasingly bitter at my siblings. I know that it isn't fair, but I often feel as if I get more backlash for expressing my exasperation than they get for these behaviors.

I feel invisible and it's really taking a miserable toll on my mental well-being and my relationship with my family. I don't want to harbor any resentment. I don't want to wallow in self-pity. I just want to be heard. I want to solve things.

I've been thinking lately that it might be advantageous for me to sit down with my entire family and have a discussion about how I am feeling and possibly start to resolve some problems, but I don't know how I would even begin to approach the discussion.

I don't want to shame them or lecture them or anything like that, but I do want to show them how the things they can look from my point of view and explain why they are impeding my ability to improve myself and our relationships.

How in the world do I go about this?

287,"Here’s my story. About 2 months ago I got a groinal response from an Intrusive thought to my girlfriend cheating on me. It has been the worst 2 months constantly getting groinal response sometimes an erection in my sleep when constantly thinking about this constantly checking. I am certain that this is SO OCD. I’ve had times where I don’t get a groinal response at all and I was convinced that it was over but it came back. This Is super distressing to me because I can’t enjoy time with my girlfriend and it’s killed a lot of my appeal for sex with her. I’m at a point where it feels like these intrusive thoughts turn me on more than regular sex. I don’t know if it’s because I’m forcing myself to feel attracted to my girlfriend but i don’t get the same gratifying feeling like I once did. I feel like I’ve had erections related to jealousy in my childhood. I’m not completely convinced as to whether or not my body enjoys this because my brain definitely does not.

 I know that some people will say that this is something that I should accept and embrace as if it’s my fetish or something but it severely disgusts me and makes me feel like throwing and is definitely not something that I want to indulge in at all. 

This has been the worst 2 months of my life and it literally destroyed the happiness I had. I’ve never felt so shitty or seriously contemplated suicide this much.

I would like to know how to treat this if this is even treatable. Ideally I’d like to not get a groinal response at all from these thoughts and just feel shitty about the thought of my girlfriend with someone else.

**Would you like to make a difference in the mental health community by talking about something that’s passionate to you? Send me a DM to learn more!**

Hiya! My name’s CJ. I’m 21 years old. I’m a mental-health advocate and enthusiast from upstate New York. Also an aspiring writer and musician. The book is called “Skies of Grey: Mind’s Eyes”. My format is designed to be concise and easy to read and understand.

**But CJ**, *I hear you asking*, **How can I help?**  
It’s simple! I’m looking for people who are willing to have interviews about a disorder they may be experiencing. It's 10 questions long, informal, text-based, and anonymous. I am NOT accepting mental health interviews for (I’ve had multiple interviews on these subjects already and don’t need any more info on them):   
Anxiety, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Bipolar, Depression (Major/Minor), DID, Personality Disorder CLUSTER B/C (Not A), and PTSD. All entries are available here : [https://pastebin.com/WeEUdn0e](https://pastebin.com/WeEUdn0e)  
^(In light of recent events, there is now a timer on interviews. You start the interview, if time zones/other factors conflict, you have a week to finish it before I have to scrap it.) 

Anything else is on the table! I look forward to hearing from you! Please stay strong and remember to take care of yourself, it’s a scary world out there and you’re not alone.",21Jun2020,3
292,"So basically i started treating everyone like shit for no reason at the start of quarantine, including family, it started a few years ago but i just locked myself in my room, now i lock myself in my room and whenever i go out i treat them like shit (not replying or just replying with a nod) and when i push myself to speak with them i instantly regret it (for no reason) I've also pushed one group of friends away despite being friends for the longest time, i don't like the way i am and i want to stop but whenever i go out of my room i can't because i don't wanna deal with anyone and i don't want anyone to speak to me, do you have any idea what i should do and why i do that in the first place? I do know for a fact (i know youre not supposed to self diagnose but it's more than just ""feeling sad"" for a while) that i have depression (4/5 years now) but I'd say it's gotten worse during quarantine since there's pretty much nth to distract myself with, i really don't wanna stay like this because i might lost ties with my mom, but i just can't communicate with her, my mind is blank whenever she tries to talk with me about anything regarding the matter and when she confronts i don't even wanna talk, I've been thinking about Suicide for the longest time. I'm too scared to ask for a therapist and we probably don't have enough money for it, please tell me what i should, thank you.",21Jun2020,2
293,"In 2018 our circle of friends lost a very close friend due to mental health. 
But we don’t speak about it, we never have done

on the day that my friend died we all got together and drank for her but we haven’t spoken about it since. 
My inner circle of friends who I can speak to about anything. We don’t even speak about it &amp; when it is brought up the conversation ends quickly or proceeds into something else 

We are all 19/20 years old this is something we should all be able to talk about right?",21Jun2020,1

295,"Soooo my fiancé, who had always been doing fine (or so we thought) went through a panic attack. He is now dealing with the fact that he is anxious, where he always thought he was a relax kind of person. It’s hard for him, it’s a huge thing to process, and he’s still adjusting to this « new life as an anxious man ». 
I’ve been doing my best to be supportive, and to be there for him, but I’m sure I can do better, so, if you have any advice on how I can help him deal with all this, I’m listening !

Trolls are not welcome and won’t have any reaction from me. Just saying, so no one wastes any time.",21Jun2020,1
296,"Sorry if this the wrong subreddit to post to, but I've got a question.

Since the age of 14 or so, it feels like I've had two people in me. Separate entities with their own personalities, thoughts, and ideals.

The first one is Taylor. The most I can derive from him is that he's soft, vulnerable. Naive and always easily hurt.
The second one is Eric. He's tough, brash, violent, and animalistic in a way.

When Taylor is the main presence, I want nothing more than to get away from people and lie in a quiet place. I think the people around me hate me, and that Eric is my only company that genuinely enjoys my company.

When Eric is the one in charge, im quiet, angry. I see some tiny irrelevant thing and it makes me want to break the kneecaps of whoever caused it. He's tired of the little body I have and longs to be this powerful thing. He likes to just hold Taylor.

But there's also this strange malformed romance between the two. Like they fight but not really fight over who gets to run the body at certain points.

Around people, they kind of mesh and make me, and that's who people know.

Sometimes I can go days being one or the other, and sometimes days of both.

Why am I like this?
Has anyone ever heard of something like this?



No this isn't a joke post or some attention seeking bull, I genuinely want thoughts.",21Jun2020,2
297,"So I went through a rough breakup recently, after a very mentally and physically taxing relationship. And during the few years we dated I always felt so unwanted and unappreciated. When we broke up all of those feeling magnified and I tried to kill my self. It’s been better. I’ve been focusing on hobbies I started after the breakup; mostly gardening (although I’m trying to learn how to draw) to try and just fill the time I’d spend with my ex. There’s still a long road ahead, but I’m proud that I haven’t completely fallen apart yet. Depressions something I’ve struggled with since I was 8. It’s nice that this bout hasn’t taken me fully out of commission like I’ve been before. 

I’m not trying to make it seem easy, and it isn’t easy. I still wake up every morning and dread having to go through the day. I still have trouble sleeping and have constant anxiety. I go to therapy and try my best to force a routine on myself, but the finish line is still months away. I hope maybe some of you guys can relate with me. I’m only 19 so I understand that my emotional responses are a lot stronger and more impulsive compare to older, more mature folk so I try to remind myself of that. 

Intrusive thoughts are my biggest concern at the moment. Sometimes I’ll zone out for more time than I’d like to admit, because I’ll just flash back to a memory of me ex and it’s hard to snap out of it. It always leaves me sad and drained afterwards. There’s some suicidal thoughts, but the more work I put into my hobbies the less I think about them. It helps to have something I want to finish like growing my tomatoes or following that r/chloe subreddit to learn how to draw. 

I’m sending out positive vibes to all you guys.",21Jun2020,2

299,"I found a number of channels that are posting daily videos of what they eat in a day, in relation to their eating disorders. It appears that rather than holding themselves accountable, they are posting for approval from other sufferers (judging by the comments and certain titles that may ilicit views). If I just report to youtube, they will either ignore it or strike the channels down. I don't think this content should be on youtube, as it is an echo chamber that doesn't promote attempting to overcome the illness, only showing the 'enticing' parts of the illness, however I don't want youtube to strike them down without there being a system in place to help them. Does anyone know if there's anything I could do in this situation? I am not qualified to try to help them myself, but I also don't know to who, if there is anywhere, I can flag the channels to.

I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to ask.",21Jun2020,2
300,"Hello everyone, I hope you're all doing OK!

I'm suffering anxiety and very bad depression at the moment. I'm taking my antidepressants and trying in the ways I can. I have a CBT course on my phone,

The issue is having the motivation to work on myself when I feel so hopeless and worthless etc

I'm sure lots of us have this issue, but so far I'm really struggling  to find any sort of reason to try, despite wanting to get better and have a happier life.

Idk, what makes you get going?",21Jun2020,1
301,"My reasoning for this is that I simply don't know who i am.

I habitually go through phases, mindsets, and moods. 

Sometimes, when listening to certain types of music, I change who I am and where i want to be.

Am I a goth? Am I a beatnik? Am i no one? I can't tell anymore.

This is fucking me up as I am constantly changing my mind on everything. I'm supposed to go to University in a few months, however I keep changing my mind. From teaching English in Asia -&gt; A Police Detective -&gt; Office Drone. 

I don't know if it's immaturity or what but i really need help. I can't decide on anything and i don't want to do something I might regret... and I don't have a personality. 

I have many different interests, but that changes religiously. 

I don't really have a personality or one single version of myself.",21Jun2020,2

305,How extreme can anxiety be? I have always been an anxious person but I always thought a small bit of anxiety made me pay attention more so I didn’t mind as much. I started taking 5 HTP just to kind of help kick the edge off because I dont want to take meds unless I really need to. I’m not sure if it’s lockdown or moving to another country but my anxiety comes in waves. Sometimes I’m riding high and nothing seems to bother me. The next EVERY single possibly bad thing or embarrassing thing passes through my head and I feel so overwhelmed. I have never had an anxiety attack full out. The closest I have gotten was today. I was listening to a song playing video games with my husband and I got to thinking about not being young anymore which spiraled into before we blink we will be old which turned into what is death going to be like to what’s going to happen after we die. All within 3 minutes of a song to which point I got hot and heart started to race. It’s wild that these things can wreck my mind without anyone even knowing. I try explain when these things ever happen to my husband if he’s there and talk through them as best I can. I haven’t had anything like that happen in a long time but I just would love to know if this is normal and what people do to cope? I exercise and mentally stimulate my brain to help drain down. I talk my feelings through as best I can with my friends or husband. Sometimes I wonder if this anxiety is from a need of a lifestyle change completely. Different job or living situation. Something to help things equalize it seem normal.,21Jun2020,1
