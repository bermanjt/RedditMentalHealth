0,"I’ve been depressed for 8 years. 8. Long. Years. To be perfectly honest, I’m exhausted. I’ve tried everything from meditation, exercise, breathing exercises, medication, EVERYTHING. Nothing seems to help. I’m tired and stressed out all the damn time. I’ve contemplated suicide so many times, I can’t even count. This isn’t what scares me so much though..

A few months ago, after hearing about the post-trip healing effects of psychedelics, I decided to try acid. It started out quite pleasantly, and I began to understand why people do it. It was like seeing color for the first time. But this quickly changed once I sat in my living room and let my mind wander a bit too much. Panic set in. Hard. It was like a two hour long panic attack and I’ve never been so scared to lose control. See, I began seeing “alternate” versions of myself. They were so aggressive and violent, it even scared me. 

In one of these alternates, I was freaking out (like I was in real life) with one main difference: I was brutally attacking my wife. I lost touch on which was the real me, and for a while I honestly thought I had murdered her. Scariest night of my life.

Ever since then, I cannot get that scenario out of my head. It flashes like post traumatic stress depictions on TV. 

I can’t even drink anymore because after a couple of beers, I start to think I might lose control and do something horrible if I get too drunk. More panic ensues.

I’ve also had reoccurring nightmares that this happens and I wake up and frantically shake my wife to make sure she’s okay. 

I am so terrified I might do something crazy without even realizing it. Please. If anybody has any insight whatsoever, please help me.  Even writing this feels wrong. Like I’m somehow giving it power.",03Jan2020,2
1,"For context I'm 23F. So I went back to the hospital for the 3rd time last week. I was having suicidal ideation and thoughts of self harm. What basically got me in there was I thought the world was going to end because of climate change and I have nothing and no one. I've been isolating myself recently and haven't been going out with friends. I feel like I'm totally stuck. I have no boyfriend, and I feel like my friend group is pushing me out. I live with my parents and I just quit my nannying job. Its hard to have hope with all this. Does anyone feel like there is hope at all? I feel scared and alone.",03Jan2020,4
3," I have not been in a relationship for 10 years because my last breakup nearly did me in. I haven't been looking for anyone at all, but a couple months ago I met someone who is amazing, and we are so compatible and there is such intense chemistry. But it turns out that they only one month before ended a 9 year relationship, and they are still really attached to their ex and still sees them and talks about them, etc. So because of it I ended it, only a few weeks of knowing each other. I was triggered because of past relationships and got really scared and jealous and suspicious and so I didn't think it was healthy for me to stay in it. I didn't want to end it, I did it because it wouldn't work for me if they were still seeing each other, and I'm not certain they will ever truly be over. But the problem is, I feel like I'm in love, and I can't stop thinking of them. It's been two months since it was over and I feel like I'm going crazy in pain. I can't stop thinking about them! That's weird because I didn't know them for long at all and how could I fall in love that fast? I'm not a kid, I've had long term relationships before, but nothing has hit me this hard. Why should I feel so bad after a short 4 week affair and a breakup that has lasted 7 weeks already? Why did I get attached so fast and why can't I let go? WTF is wrong with me? Please help.",03Jan2020,2

Hi,

 I think i need someone to straighten me up. Since 12-14 years old (I am 17 now), i have been in constant fight with my thoughts and feelings. Something is always wrong in my head. I have tried meditation, not masturbating, not playing games, not watching tv or anything like that ( you know, whenever I was bored i didn't immediately turn on pc or something like that, instead I was drawing, reading..).

 I have a loved one, i talk with her about any topic possible, It is helping a lot (talking with her and other people about my frustrating problems), but I'm still, all the time, worried about something. I had even stages of working out, running every day. Lately I am learning so much and working so much on school that I barely have any time. I thought it would make me happy, and yeah, it makes me happy a little bit (high grades, bright and clear future), but I still have something on my mind, and I don't know what it is. 

Currently the passage of time is killing me, but I am sure that I will just talk with people, think about it a lot, and in the end I will just stop thinking about time (like really, now, every good moment i have, it passes so fast I can't even see it). In a few months my head will have another main problem that will kill 50% of my will to live, will to achieve great things, learn great skills.. I tried to relax and not give a fuck, it doesn't work either. Talking, working, running, meditating. I tried not to think all the time, remove the negative stuff from my head, but i just can't. I am eating good food, sleeping well, drinking plenty of water. 

What can I do? Should i worry about fixing my ""problem"", or it's just normal thing for humans? (I would love to have clear mind actually, It would help me to not get frustrated so easily, get much more work done in less time..)

If you gave me your precious time, and actually did read all of it, thank you, please give me a possible solution, opinion, or just say something in comment below. Thank you very much.

And also, sorry for my english, I think i have made a lot of grammar mistakes above, but I'm not using english daily, so I'm sorry for that.",03Jan2020,2

8,"Hi everyone,

I’ve just been feeling pretty sad today. Maybe it’s lonely being home for break with my parents, they moved somewhere kind of rural I have never lived before until this break. I’ve only been here a week and a half and I just have two more days until I go back to my apt, I hope I will feel a little better then. 

I flunked all three of my classes last quarter while I was doing an intensive outpatient therapy program. I was supposed to graduate this June, which would have been remarkable given how my depression and anxiety have affected me all these years of college. But with this comes some regret that I have made it into such a prestigious university and that I haven’t really taken advantage of the resources here or felt like I have tried my best. I’m watching my acquaintances get grad school acceptances to great schools. I know
that I’m not helping myself through self-comparison, but these thoughts come my way every now and then. In a way I feel like I’m trying my best now but that I am doing my worst.

Anyways I feel sad :( but I’m sure I’m not alone, and my empathy goes out for anyone in a similar boat.",03Jan2020,3
13,"This isn’t the shortest post, but I would like some help if some people are able to.

I’m slightly better mentally than I have been in the past, but I’m still not okay. I spent two years ignoring everything I felt and I’m still dealing with the subsequent breakdowns that occurred with finally listening to myself. I’ve struggled with S/H (though I’m a few weeks clean now); and a general feeling of detachment from my body and emotions.

I know that something is wrong with me mentally, I just don’t know what. I know I seem to think differently and I’m too empathetic, but it’s more than that. My brain and thoughts just seem... wrong, for lack of a better excuse. I know there’s something wrong.

I do really weird things. I’ll decide to sit on the bathroom floor and write in my diary but then I’ll realise what I’m doing is wrong. I needn’t be doing that, and I’m annoyed with myself. 

It’s really hard to explain, but I was just wondering if this is normal? The way I think and my emotions in response to situations seems stupid and wrong. I get far too angry over the smallest things (like the movie Elf. Stupid I know, but it infuriates me lmao), and I get too defensive.

Tl;dr- My thoughts and actions feel wrong and stupid and I don’t know if it’s normal",03Jan2020,1
14,"Hello, I am 30 years old and live in Texas, USA. I was diagnosed with Aspergers in Middle School, have dysgraphia have had depression since childhood, had a major depressive episode a couple years back where I was partially -hospitalized in an intensive therapy/ Psychiatric program for treatment (thankful I found such a thing otherwise I would likely have been fully hospitalized), and have had anxiety for about ten years. I have been and am currently on medication for my depression and anxiety. This past May I was able to finally gain my Bachelor of arts degree. Although I wish to do grad school to pursue a career in Academia.

I have always had difficulty finding employment, even part-time. I have worked part time at a movie theater, had a full-time job for 3-4 months a Frys electronics before the strain completely burned me out and I had to leave, managed to get a student position at my college (was super easy and I would have had to steal money to actually get fired, as I was depressed and lethargic in the job, and often late). I had to leave that job end of September as I had graduated, and even though I started applying to various positions in May, had a number of interviews, I only got a $9 per hour temp job ending end of the month at a college book store beginning of December ( my degree and job experience really took me far). I seem to have started feeling more depressed and feeling a great deal of anxiety from my job which is odd. It seems I have a pattern of quickly becoming stressed and feeling greatly depressed at the jobs i have had ( I really know know how I did the movie theater job as I'm not sure I could do it again). All this has made me start to consider if finding and keeping a job at my level of qualifications is a result of my mental health issues. I like to hope grad level work would open up doors to work I might be encouraged and motivated by having which lasts.

This is the first time I have really considered my issues my be enough of a disability to qualify for social security. My Asbpergers seems to be different enough that I actually am good at literature and like some social interaction ( had to learn almost as if by wrote to pick up social ques and learn ways to respond, especially in first meetings, still have trouble in some areas though and can get very anxious figuring out how to respond or start interacting in situations I am not familiar with it are not typical) but don't like math and am not tech savvy, so I don't seem to fit the standard image. I thought I did well in all my interviews but maybe I did not, which prevented me for being hired for certain positions, perhaps my aspbergers and anxiety effected me more than I thought.

Does it sound like I might qualify for some social security so I might be in a better situation to try and pursue a path I can actually end up with a decent job I can be satisfied in? And if so, what would be the best way to go through the application process with my situation?

Note: Yes I live with me parents (shocker), but considering my issues and a number of things I could be doing a lot worse I think. Plus, it really bothers me I have not progressed farther by age 30, life is a real beach.",03Jan2020,1
15,"For 2020 I have decided that I'm removing labels from my mental health treatment. 

So from now on I'm not ""a bit OCD""... Instead it may be that I experience / display some OCD behaviours like intrusive thoughts and disruptive checking. 

From now on ""I suffer with anxiety"" is not a thing for me. I sometimes ""have anxious thoughts but coping skills help them go away"" is a better mindset for helping me deal with this. 

Similarly, ""I am depressed"" is now a banned phrase for me... sometimes I do have dark thoughts and that's ok with me as long as I sort of wave them on out and don't get stuck in a thought spiral.

I was diagnosed with ADD as a child, which lead to many medications with side effects all worse than the other. I feel like at this point, it's worth my time to read into this as a possibility.

22,"So I’ve been contemplating for awhile now whether or not to actually post in this subreddit and any related, but my these panic attacks (?) have gone so far now that I just don’t feel like I can sit here and keep quiet for much longer. 

It started in 2016, I was watching a random video on YouTube when an overwhelming sense of dread over my own mortality, death and time came over me and it made me want to pull out my own hair. It would last for a couple of minutes max and I would only get it every now and then. In early 2019, I stopped getting them and I’m assuming it’s due to the fact that I moved from an isolated area and back to the city where my family was but those attacks being gone was short lived, as my mum passed away in April. My attacks weren’t too bad after she passed but in the last few months or so, they’ve escalated to the point where I have almost 3 or so a day. 

Last month (Dec 2019), I went to stay next to my old house where I lived with my mother because I was there for a house sitting job, but during this time my attacks escalated to collapsing on the ground, hyperventilating, almost screaming, crying and trying to pull at anything I could. This happened when I was awake and I somehow also woke up having a similar attack at 3am. 

Then this morning happened, again at 3am, a different type of panic attack that lasted almost an hour. While my best friend was sleeping next to me, I couldn’t bring myself to wake them knowing they have work this morning. I dug my nails into my arms like I usually do and did my best to fall asleep only to wake up this morning feeling like absolute trash and crying on my best friends shoulder. 

All of these panic attacks relate to being hyper-aware of my own mortality and the time I have left. It gets in the way of me being able to enjoy even the most simple things, like watching a TV series or a movie. I get triggered by so much, even words in the past tense can sometimes send me into a panic. 

I did see a psychologist long before, within the year it first started but it didn’t help much at all.

I know some people might say “at least you’re not suicidal” but I do have depression and I do know what it’s like to want to jump in front of a moving vehicle but please understand, the fear that I live with on the daily basis is now so incapacitating that I struggle to live a normal life. I can’t go a day without an attack anymore. 

So if anyone has any advice or can even tell me if what I’m feeling are panic attacks or something else, please, do help. I’m begging at this point because I can’t do anymore. I’m tired and I want to be able to enjoy my life.",03Jan2020,6
23,"I’m not depressed. I don’t feel like I am. Maybe I’m in denial, maybe I am sad. No. I am just in a weird headspace and I dislike this feeling. I don’t want to be around friends.... at least I don’t want to be around 98% of them. Even at work, I just don’t want to be there. Avoid talking to coworkers and just kinda, barely make it through the day. Not sleeping to well, food doesn’t really taste that good. Even writing this I don’t even want to finish any more. Lack of focus. Little to no motivation. Very, very tired.

I mean I sorta thought about laying across the train tracks today but I don’t want to die. My usual thing to do when sad is self harm and I don’t have any desire to cut myself. I’m not suicidal; I’m just exhausted. I have been severely depressed before but this feels different. I feel extremely exhausted and unmotivated.

Anyone who I reads this post please don't tell us to leave because this is what were doing and theres no point telling me otherwise. My mum lives out of town and is in even worse danger. 

I guess the point of this post is my frustration with her and the frustration of my own independence. We ended up down in an evacuation centre Monday night and I wasn't prepared at all. Tomorrow is what were preparing for now. My cars packed.  

My mum just is being so blazae about the whole thing, hence why I wasn't prepared Monday. Even now she thinks she'll be okay out there and assumes the fire won't hit her house. She even thinks were better of out her place. 

I feel let down.. I don't want to be around her. It's almost like she thinks the whole thing is a joke.. but I guess it could be her way of dealing with it. People are being told they should get out if they've got somewhere to go. I can't afford to leave now, as in I don't have money for fuel.

PART ONE:
“Baby, I’m HERE! ❤️”

When I look at you, I still see the freshly 20-year-old, outgoing, charismatic young man who carefully gained possession of what was left of my almost non-existent trust and fragile, teenage heart 13-years-ago. I still see the confident smile that belonged to a rambunctious boy who knew the world was full of possibility and opportunity, and he could conquer any obstacles that lay in his path. That smile... oh... that smile 😌 it melted so many hearts, and I’m so lucky to be the ONE woman who is still able to coax it out of hiding from time-to-time.

You are the man who saved my life more times than I can confess and the person who’s pure and beautiful soul I have been blessed to be able to create and build my life with. You are the devoted, adoring and incredibly nurturing father to our three magnificent children. You are my kindred soul... the universes answer to my life’s purpose... and... my darling... believe me when I say that I would be LOST without you...

I love you. Not in the truism sense of the word. Not because that’s what we, as humans, have been conditioned to tell someone with whom we show adoration toward... NO...I am chemically and cosmically connected to the fabric of your immortal energy. My spirit requires you... I NEED you in the same way I need air to breath and water to drink. You are my soul’s sustenance.

So that’s why... on the day when you tried to kill your self, 3-months-ago... I felt like a vital part of me died. For weeks, I have felt like I have been living with a stranger and I haven’t known how to look at you or even what to say. Not because I love you any less, but because I haven’t been able to understand how you could have gotten to that place where you felt so bombarded by your own mind you were forced to pushed every primal, human instinct to survive away and KNEW you needed to permanently escape. It breaks my heart to think about the agony you must have gone trough to get to that place where you felt like it was time to leave this earth, this life, our family and our love. I feel so guilty that I, your closest and most intimate friend in this world, never saw the signs and couldn’t be there to save you from yourself.

I’m so, incredibly lucky to still have you with me, and I’m trying my best to understand how that beautifully complicated mind of yours functions. I know you’re not ready to talk about it, but I would hope that you would forgive me for seeking advice from other’s who might also suffer from Paranoid Schizophrenia, so I can gain a better understanding of how you are wired and how I can be there for you now and everyday in our future...

I love you, baby and I am HERE FOR YOU... as long as we both shall live...

12/27/2019

We are growing accustomed to celebrating the small victories we have encountered over these last few, unexplainably difficult months. I like to think this kind of behavior has been therapeutic for your increasingly more fragile mind. It feels incredible to witness you smile on occasion and... my love... today is Friday and the kids are asleep.

It’s time to celebrate US... this rare connection we have. Our deep friendship and kindredness that has given you and I the strength to survive the ravishing fires of hell. Tonight... All we need is you and me in our purest and most honest forms, this old couch that’s certainly seen it’s share of better days, a couple of cheap beers and a music playlist that is rich with adolescent memories - those few years of our lives we had to struggle through alone. The years before I found you and we weren’t lucky enough to have loved one another...YET...

We require this moment where nothing is expected of us. Just a few hours when nothing outside of this toy and cheerio covered living room is of any concern to our collective psyche. We have earned this sliver of time to take all of our stress and anxiety acquired through the years and store it, for a few moments, away from our present minds - somewhere it can’t weigh on our cerebrum. And when our chests finally feel a bit lighter, It’s time to forget today, forget last week, forget last year and remember the tiny moments and coincidences that brought us to one another. It’s time to dive deep into each other’s lives and emerge from the depths as stronger and more learned version of ourselves. These minuscule clips of time seem to pass so quickly, but I know we are better for them.

Did you know that I love that you can still surprise me. I adore that you are still here to spend this moment with me, to share our truths and experiences tonight. I am fascinated by your life. Your story is an intoxicating book that I can’t put down. You are the most incredible human who has ever walked this earth and I’m genuinely grateful to be the one who gets to walk beside you, dance with you, and fall asleep in the comfort and security of your sturdy arms.

Words tend to flow from me freely when I’m in your presence because I know you’re the only person who has ever fully accepted and loved me as I am - in my rawest form - even my ugliest and most vulnerable versions. I love that you are habitually honest with me, even when the truth is both difficult speak and digest. I need you to remain this truthful with me, ALWAYS. I may not, in every scenario, know what to say or do with your truths, but I promise you that I can carry more emotional weight than you think me capable of, and your secrets are safest when harbored with me.

Laying next to you tonight, I was sorry to hear that your mind orchestrated delusions have become more negative and terrifying over the course of the past month. It’s hard to imagine the fear you experience when you wake up in the middle of the night to a faceless demon aggressively attempting to infiltrate our home and harm our children. I don’t know what it’s like to have an independent, entity narrate my life, boss me around, bully and break me down mentally and tell me that my time is almost over...

It broke my heart to hear you confess that you had planned to take your own life the day prior, because you thought it was the only way to make the unwanted haunting images, apparitions and disembodied voices leave you forever. It crushed me to learn that you had already begun your goodbyes to our children. Though, what confuses me most is why you believe that your strength and honesty are things you need to apologize for. I’m ecstatic that you love me enough to muster your strength in this moment with me today and I admire your courage to be honest about your waking nightmares. Its important for me to understand what you are going through so I can know how to help you navigate through this horror show spectacle.

I promised you, the day we fell in love, that you would never have to face this life alone. I have no intentions of breaking that promise now.

I’m still trying to process all of this. Its a bit overwhelming to digest this instant because It devastates me to know that you spend the majority of your days petrified in fear and polarized by anxiety. I wish there was something I could do to take that burden away from you. I’m not sure what those magic words are that will make all of your pain disappear...

That’s why I remained silent tonight and cried with you instead...

PART THREE
01/01/2020

Happy New Year, My Love!

I’m thankful to have had a 13th opportunity to kiss your gorgeous lips at the stroke of Midnight - Ringing in another New Year the way we always have. What would I do without you here beside me? Where and Who would I be without your influence on my emotional growth? I hazard to assume that I would DO nothing productive, BE nothing and go nowhere without you. You are my divine inspiration to exist...

Cliche as it may sound, I unquestionably slept as soundly as an infant, buried in your arms last night. Your scent, warmth and the weight of your body filled my dreams with pleasant, carefree imageries and I was excited to wake up beside you this morning.

Much to my dismay, the hopeful man I fell asleep with last night was not the same man I woke up next to today. The man I woke up with today was pale faced, trembling and petrified. He cried despairingly while gripping his skull and desperately pleaded with a hallucinatory force... Repeating his dissuasive mantra, “Please Stop.” “Stop.” “Please Go Away.”

I placed my hand on his back in an effort to calm him down. I rubbed him gently and repeatedly shushed and assured him that the voice he was hearing wasn’t real and everything would be alright. His anxiety consumed him entirely and caused him to spiral downward, in and out of reality, trying desperately to maintain his grip on his own physical existence. His personal desires and conscious thought became muffled beneath the howl of a sinister cacodemon that wasn’t actually there... 

I stayed beside the man I woke up with for the next two hours. Fearful myself, at times, hoping he would let my husband come back home to me soon. I sat, holding him tightly on my bathroom floor, as his fear caused him to violently purge every ounce of matter that existed within his gut. I began to shake uncontrollably as I held him firmly around the chest and calmly talked him down from repeated moments of hyperventilation and near panic induced shock...

He told me his angriest delusion doesn’t like me. He held me gently by the face and assured me that he would never hurt me, even though the voice in his head has been ordering him to, “SLIT HER FUCKING CUNT THROAT!” I told him I knew he would never hurt me... and then I ordered him to leave! 

I grabbed the bottle of antipsychotics that you have been neglecting to consume the past few weeks and forced him to digest one. I waited for several minutes that seemed more like centuries for you to come home to me. I watched his eyes transition from a tormented shade of dark grey to the beautiful, pale green eyes of the man I fell in live with. You collapsed downward, overwhelmed with joy and relief, as you found your way back into my shaken embrace, and tears poured from our eyes as you exclaimed, “he’s gone... I’m so happy he’s gone.” 

You are taking your meds regularly again, and we are sticking to our care plan. We had to learn a vital lesson in a terrifying fashion, but I can’t be more proud of your strength to persevere through all of this madness. 

You are the strongest person I have ever known, darling and I love you...

Let’s keep moving forward together.",03Jan2020,9
30,"So you know... I uh. Used to take antipsychotics. I've stopped off and on here and there. And I just recently quit again. But like. I noticed that whenever I'm off life kind of becomes miserable, I really don't want to take them but at the same time I don't think I have any other choice. But let me get to the point. I'm not asking if I should take them I'm just curious about what they do, to dopamine to be exact if anyone has an awnser. Whenever I take it I notice an increase in over all feeling of well-being and enjoyment. But isnt dopamine what makes you feel pleasure.

32,"This is kind of long.

I have been reading more about schizophrenia in the last few days and feel horrible about my mother and how I didn't know she could still be dealing with it even today.

When I was maybe 19-20, I can't remember exactly when but at least a little more than two decades ago, my mother had about a month in which she had a full blown schizophrenic episode. A strange period in which she thought awful, weird things about me. She was sure I was in a cult and kept only zoning in on me and thinking I was evil or bad in some way and I didn't understand and she didn't do it to anyone else in my family. She believed the tv was talking to her at times. She eventually unplugged the tv and turned it around to face the wall I remember and still believed it was talking to her. And there were so many other random things in which she was hearing things and putting things around the house in a strange particular way. The episode came all at once, a neighbor had a water tank that exploded and made a loud noise all over the street and it shook her to the point that it triggered things because immediately she started acting bizarre, scared, and weirdly paranoid and of me. When I think about it now I feel so bad and awful that I didn't realize sooner that she should be taken to a doctor. Or even more worried and scared for her since she was hearing things that weren't there. Instead I was on the defensive with how she was attacking me and I feel horrible now with realizing she was hearing and maybe seeing things and just so lost. And with it coming so fast or it seemed that way to me and that it happened while she was in her late 30's, it would be considered late on-set schizophrenia and so maybe she doesn't have too many or the worst symptoms of it.

And at that time I didn't have internet access, that didn't come until at least a couple years later but even if so, there maybe wouldn't have even been much to find on schizophrenia to know what was going on. I also can't believe that over all this time I didn't just look more into it at some point and feel guilty that I didn't.

Eventually my father couldn't take it anymore at one point in which she was being paranoid or scared about something and took her to see a doctor right then. She was there for at least a few days and then came home and things seemed to be okay. I still can't remember much of what I was doing at the time other than living at home, working, and going to college a year or two later so it's a bit fuzzy for me.

All these years have passed and I feel so stupid for not knowing more about schizophrenia. I've always thought of my mother's situation being this thing where she had an episode and was treated for it and no one ever really said anything about it but it was taken care of for the most part. I feel in a way that her generation still attaches a stigma to mental illnesses and people don't really talk about things and that had something to do with no one saying anything really. I was never really sure. I thought maybe she was put on medication to deal with it but I was never really sure the extent of it but she never had any episodes that I am aware of like that again. She is tired a lot of the time I think and I thought maybe that came from medications in dealing with it but I really don't know.

I read something recently about how a lot of people living with schizophrenia hear things daily. Some hearing things constantly or just randomly at times and maybe not every day but it can come and go possibly, and more so when they are stressed. This is what has me so freaked out. I am only now realizing that all this time, my mother could be hearing things every day or constantly and I had no idea. She could just be keeping it to herself and maybe she knows how to deal with it or maybe she is just lost. Maybe the medication keeps it to a minimum or down to a level that she realizes not to listen to whatever voices she may have.

I was starting to think in the last six months in which I spent more time with her than usual that maybe she is somewhere on the autism spectrum and that I didn't realize it sooner. Partly with how so into routine she likes for things to be and sometimes when she speaks, she won't finish the sentence. She will just randomly stop midway through a sentence and won't finish it. With reading more about schizophrenia now I realize that not finishing her sentences could be from ""thought blocking"" which some have. How she is makes more sense now for me with some of the symptoms of schizophrenia. Before, there were times also when I thought maybe she was a narcissist or had some narcissistic traits but it wasn't often, just very random at times and only when she is very stressed. With how stressed she can get also has me worried and wondering about how she could be hearing voices. I think she does suffer from negative or catastrophic thinking in which she always assumes the worst of things and creates so much stress for herself. And certain things like holidays stress her out. She also does deal with seasonal depression and probably just depression as well. And when she gets really stressed about things she seems very scatterbrained almost, it's very difficult for her to focus, and it's almost like she is going to fall apart. I'm wondering if when she is stressed is when she is especially hearing voices or seeing things. And this is a bit random but when I am at her house, she has a rabbit in her basement that she takes care of. I used to always talk to it and try to pet it but every single time, my mother who would be upstairs doing something and would always ask if I am talking to her. I always thought that was so strange because if I were talking to her, I would speak louder or just do it when I am at least on the same floor as her but maybe she thought that she was hearing things that weren't there. I always thought it was strange how she would ask me if I was talking to her every time that happened. Now I am just not even going to talk to the rabbit, there is no reason to anyways. But that is the only time she has ever brought up hearing something or wasn't sure if she did. I would think that if she is always hearing things, that she would bring it up more at times. Or maybe she is used to certain voices and knows not to bring it up with anyone else since she is so used to it anymore.

A big problem too is that I don't know if I can even ask about her schizophrenia. Or if she even really does have it. I am not %100 certain of who told me that she had schizophrenia at the time. Whether it was my father, or a sibling, or what. Maybe it could have been something else. And I don't think I could ask my father either. We don't really get along at all and barely speak to one another. I do talk to my mother regularly though but still not sure if I can bring these things up with her. And I have social anxiety, the other day she apologized for it as if it  was her fault and she has said kind of vaguely that she has anxiety too. I also have two siblings with social anxiety and one that is bipolar.

And with now knowing more about schizophrenia and how my mother is, I feel bad with how awful and mean I have been to her at times over the years. I used to carry this like bottled up anger or something from when she treated me like I was in a cult or on drugs, or just viewing me like I was bad in some way. I never brought it up but always just felt like she hated me or didn't like me and we have been estranged at times. There have been times when I moved very far away and had very little contact with her. I feel like the things she is dealing with is what caused us to be so distant at times as well as my own social anxiety, depression, and I think I have abandonment issues which makes me feel like family members as well as other people I've known don't like me so I avoid them and drop our friendships or getting along with them. I don't have any anger towards my mother anymore with how she thought I was evil or bad now that I can understand that it came at a time of her paranoia during her episode. And whenever she would talk before and stop midway through her sentences, I would always get on her case in a way and tell her to finish her sentence which was just rude of me to do no matter what. I really don't want to be causing or adding anymore stress to her and I am worried that things might be getting worse for her at times especially with her depression. I feel like I am still just very confused whether she is even dealing with schizophrenia in a really bad way still or if it's something that she has for the most part recovered from. Supposedly some recover in many ways at least within ten years of having it being treated. And a small portion don't always hear voices or only do during episodes maybe. I really just wish I knew if she is still dealing with that and hopefully I could help her when she's having those moments. And she does seem to be ""fully functioning"" with it, she runs her own business, takes care of herself, is always there for family members and dealing with things even though she can be easily stressed out at times.

Would it be okay if I were to bring up whether she does have schizophrenia or what things particularly that she is dealing with? Or do many or some people living with schizophrenia not hear voices daily or does it sound like maybe she doesn't with how she seems to be on top of things? I can't find much information with living with it for at least two decades. And as far as I know, she only had the one episode and I don't think my other siblings even really know that she has it. Two would have been too young at the time and no one has asked about it or anything which also seems really strange to me. In a way, I'm also wondering if my mother thinks it's weird that no one ever brings it up, or if she thinks we see it as something to be embarrassed by or maybe that she does. I kind of think that if I had it and no one ever brought it up ever that I would maybe think no one cares or maybe they would just rather ignore it or something. I have no clue and I've been thinking about all of this nonstop for days now and have been wondering if I should ask about it here on reddit or not but felt like I needed to at least get it out because it's stressing me out so much that I can barely focus on things and have been feeling so awful about all of this and scared that she has been hearing voices and things all this time.",03Jan2020,2
34,Now when my strings fall out of my pants and hoodies I don’t even bother putting them back in because then I have clothes I can wear in the mental hospital and I know it’s just a matter of time before I go back,03Jan2020,1
35,"So. As you're likely all aware due to my weirdly conceived new found fame there is a lot I've apparently done and I'm allegedly some form of atrocious psychopath that preys on people both mentally and physically. Now in this post I will not be tackling what I did not do; rather I will be making my own personal amends by coming clean about certain parts of my past and elaborating on and explaining certain situations with the truth and explanations for my actions rather then the Chinese whispers and rumours currently going around.

So I think for me the issue really starts over a decade ago, around march of 2008, I'd moved and as such was moving to a new school and I think many people really set me as a certain type here. So I'd moved from a school where I'd spent the first year and a half of my senior life bullied, for how I looked, my high grades, everything. Now my new school, Brumby Comp to be exact, my first lesson was history, and there was a test, a test thqt without prior education on I blitzed with 100% and topped the class. Now that's fine, except I was a kid that had been bullied for being a nerd and I'd walked in to a new situation where I wanted to not only fit in but be popular and on top of this just be accepted. So I was 12, insanely inexperienced, and lacked friends; I lied to fit in. About everything.

I think what made this worse was at the time I met my first girlfriend, though now looking back I'd have to say since I lied to her about every aspect of my life so she liked me (I didn't want to, I genuinely likes her, I'd just dug to deep), calling her that is likely unfair; but for the purposes of this I'll go with that. 

Now obviously this was found out, after 3 months to be exact and I lost my first relationship rightfully. I've never really forgave myself for this but it did serve as a valuable experience in my life; of course the bullying then again continued and eventually I just avoided school entirely. A place I once loved, a place of learning for me, became a backdrop of abuse and pain that deeply affected my self esteem and mental health for decades. Frankly, I don't blame a single one of these people for their actions, I deserved it this time.

Now besides the odd fight I was a model kid, I was a pain to my mother and siblings but I avoided trouble with the law and kept myself pretty clean. As such my next bad actions didn't come till Victoria, I was 16 now, and this girl was my first sexual experience. Hormones and lust took over and I became, well an arsehole. I think a lot has been said about me and her where I'm the evil one and she's the hero; somewhat true and mostly not also. The reality is we were both young, both cheated (me with former GFs with her, we were very on and off, her with other men that weren't myself). Recently we've actually both spoken and made amends here, admitted we were young and stupid and moved on. That's what adults do, the way this situation when I was a kid is being elaborates upon to make my abusive is ridiculous; even she says it never happened and she's the alleged victim.

Now the next one, Courtney? That's different. While we were together I was fine. I never harmed her and had no attempt to. Now she left me for a friend, a friend I'd made through the previous ex above. As any !an would I felt betrayed by my friend and yes, acted rashly and violently. That is my error, an error I am deeply apologetic for. I acted out of passion, it was elaborately stupid. I hold my hands up and admit that.

Rianna is a more specific case. As the situation arising here is one of much publication, rumours, outright lies and twisting of the truth.  There is simply to much to cover here so I will start with what I can admit...

I did emotionally manipulate her; albeit unintentionally.

I can look back now as a 24yo and realise my mistake. Then as a young man things were different.

What must be understood is that she'd come to me often with her own issues, friends she'd fallen out with, arguments she'd had with her parents, men making unsolicited moves on her she didn't know how to kindly reject. At this time I was inexperienced in this sorta stuff, now I'd handle things more sensitively, I'd realise these people were close to her... Back then I looked to protect her, by simply telling her to remove these people from her life...

I realise now years later that yes, that was stupid, and yes it was controlling. At the time I argued against that, claiming rightfully my aim was to protect her from people treating her badly... Only years and maturity has corrected my mentality, now I'm ready to apologise openly for such things.

Regarding the claims of abuse against her too, by the same individuals as above, this was claimed by friends of hers when we broke up. She herself immediately denied this in her own post. It's somewhere on Facebook, in her own words, I never laid a hand on her. Not my style, she confirmed it herself.

Now regarding the last claim I care to cover here which I am guilty of?..

Certain individuals have claimed through the now famous medium I took from them around 3 years ago.

And yes, there were two people I did. I am apologetic for this and if either of these individuals contact me now I will fully refund, with further amends, that is my error and I fully intend to fix it if asked.

Now before people judge, there's more to the story.

At the time I was homeless, without an address I couldn't claim, I couldn't eat. I was on the streets, and as such I unfortunately acted wrongly and I stole to survive.

Now many will tell me I'm a bad person for this, hell I agree, but until you are sleeping rough and starving you cannot judge me for it. Simply you cannot understand how easy it is to do wrong when your very next meal, very next might of sleep, is always a question mark above your head.

I've not had an easy decade, for myself it's been one of heartbreak, loss, attempted suicide, homelessness and more. I've been to jail abroad, I've lost my son, hurt people I care deeply about.

But when you sit there and judge me, or you claim like many others I'm pure evil don't pretend you are perfect.

Every single human alive has done wrong, we've all had our reasons too. Whether we've stolen to eat, hurt someone to protect ourselves or a loved one, we've all hurt. 

This world isn't black and white. 

I've done wrong, and a lot of it, but I'm prepared to admit that, apologise, make amends to those that want it and keep moving forward which makes me a better person then most of those judging myself that pretend they are perfect.

I know this will be used against me, spun to make me look bad once again, I don't care it's about my own personal journey to redemption and that's all.

But lastly I want people to know that for all I'm being hated for much I've done right has been forgotten.

• 3 years ago I fed and clothed 300 homeless individuals on Boxing Day, I ran, collected, and found volunteers for this myself and never claimed a plaudit. I only ever thanked those that helped.
• I have helped support victims of abuse and rape, many whom weren't even people I'd met before.
• I spent 5 years running a Tumblr blog where I helped people anonymously with issues. Talked people out of suicide, had over a million followers 2 years ago when I stopped as the workload became global and far beyond my abilities to answer everyone.
• I saved the life of a 13yo girl by jumping in a lake and performing CPR, again while I accepted the police commendation till today I never even mentioned it. The girl is 8 now, we still talk regularly.
• I've donated food, clothes, money. I've volunteered at food banks, I've helped animal shelters, and even coached football to down syndrome teens. I never cared to publicise this.

As humans we are all layered, we all make mistakes and yet only our mistakes are ever remembered and talked about. Yet for many of us the reasons we do the evil we do explains a lot goes ignored, just like the good we do as individuals.

So don't go and stop doing good of you're hated anyway, because that's what makes you a good person. Mistakes are mistakes, but when you help the many and expect nothing in return you are truly a great individual. And people may be accept that, hell people may hate you for the actions of your own stupidity, but that's because humans are fickle; we only ever remember what makes us view another as lesser. 

We're all complex, beautiful, intricate individuals who are both good and bad. 

The difference is some of us accept our evil, some choose to pretend they're perfect and judge others from a sense of truly unearned narcissistic superiority.",03Jan2020,1
36,"First off, apologies for the long post; I tried to keep it as brief as possible but include all of the relevant info. My father and I desperately want to help my mother with what appears to be a drastic decline in her mental health, but we have no idea where to turn.

# Some important background

* Lives in the US
* Has low self-esteem
* Has always been an anxious person (notably social anxiety, fear of germs, religious persecution)
* In spite of being one of the kindest-hearted people I know, she subscribes to lots of politically- and religiously-extreme media that spread fear, hate, and conspiracy theories
* Absolutely **refuses** any kind of mental or physical health care. Though we've been trying to get her to for years, she has not been to a doctor in over two decades except for a dentist
* Leaves the house for no more than 2-3 hours a week, and stays in the rest
* Is very sedentary (mostly spends her time in front of the computer) and does not exercise
* Has recently become disorganized in ways that are unusual for her (overstocking on unnecessary things, keeping a messy living, etc)
* Lives a relatively ""safe life"" (lives in a safe community, doesn't have a lot of money, and doesn't have enemies)

# Delusions of conspiracy against her

The traits above were always worrying to us, but not nearly as extreme as it has been lately. In the past year, she began showing signs of delusion and paranoia. She believes that there is an international conspiracy (with conspirators coordinating between the US and her home country) to purposely wreak havoc on her life and ravage her savings.

She believes these conspirators are:

* **Actively monitoring her phone calls and emails.** I'm traveling abroad, and she will not let me say via email or over the phone my current location or any possibly identifying information
* **Writing sophisticated software to infect her computer and online information with spyware.** Even in the face of indisputable evidence of the contrary, any time there are computer problems or trivial bureaucratic mistakes, she believes it's the conspirators behind it.

Recent unusual worrying beahviors:

* **Keeps windows, curtains, and doors closed.** She fears people are looking into the house. At one point, she claims the conspirators stopped in front of the house, stepped out of their car, and took photos of the house. Another time, she believed her foreign cousin, who asked for her address (in an appropriate context), was a spy.
* **Has greatly inconvenienced herself to try to evade the conspirators.** She has deleted all of her emails, changed her online identities, canceled her phone plan, and has reduced technological communication to almost nil. She's afraid to go outside and interact with others.
* **Believes we are fools for not seeing the ""obvious"" conspiracy.**
* **Afraid at all times**. Most of conversation with her recently has been focused on this perceived conspiracy. Her voice is  usually loud and shaky when discussing this. Sometimes she cries mid-conversation.

# What to do?

I'm sufficiently convinced that this is not normal aging behavior and could potentially be something serious, but we have no idea what to do from here. It's absolutely tearing me apart to watch this.

It's clear that getting her to a doctor, or having a doctor visit, is out of the question, and even if it were, she would refuse medication. Are there any foods I can introduce to her diet to improve her mood? What can I tell her to calm her down? How can I change her life so that she doesn't live her life afraid?

I'm very desperate for answers, and any constructive advice is extremely appreciated.

48,"Background: I'm diagnosed with depression, anxiety, ADD, and OCD. I also went through some trauma as a kid. When I was about 4 or 5, I was on a cruise ship with my parents, and I fell and busted my head. I had to get quite a few stitches. I was also abused once. Aside from this, I had a pretty normal happy childhood. It wasn't until late middle school-early high school that I began having more mental health issues. I've also struggled with drug abuse. I used to smoke weed almost daily, and I recently quit abusing xanax, so its possible I could just be having problems recovering from drug abuse.

Ever since I had a bad LSD trip, I have been unable to stop worrying about developing schizophrenia. The LSD trip started off normal, but at the peak, I smoked weed and ended up having intense anxiety and paranoia. I kept worrying that the people I did the LSD with and I we're going to be caught. My worry of developing it is such an irrational worry as well. Nobody in my family has it to my knowledge, so the likeliness of me developing it is quite low. 

I've never had delusions or hallucinations. I've had strange thoughts before, and there have been a few times where a thought like ""what if someone is reading my mind?"" Every time I've had a thought like this, I've been able to dismiss it as nonsense almost immediately. 

I also struggle with emotional numbness from my depression, and trouble concentrating from brain fog. These are symptoms of schizophrenia, but also symptoms of other things, yet for some reason I just assume this means I might develop schizophrenia. I also have some social anxiety. 

I'm really just scared of losing control and becoming unable to care for myself. 

I also fear abandonment, which may be a clue to what I might actually have.

What can I do to work on this and get better? I just wish I could go back to what I was before the LSD.",03Jan2020,1
49,"First off, I'm 17, she's 16. She turns 17 in Feb and I turn 18 in April, I'm a senior and she's a junior in HS. We both have mental problems (I'm diagnosed bpd and ptsd) but she has a very different problem than I ever experienced: the worst parents. They never married and have been having her between houses for her entire life, her dad in the suburbs where I am and her mom in the city (you don't need to know what city). 

Neither parent understands the implications of her problems, but I want to specifically talk about her dad right now. Her dad and her step-mom blame her for everything mental health oriented, from her overall depression and dissociative states to actual anxiety and panic attacks. When she confronts them about her suicidal thoughts, they claim that she's selfish and threaten institutionalization. I've been institutionalized before and I don't think she needs it. 

She hates her therapist and doesn't want to go to therapy. I've suggested many times going to a psychiatrist but she doesn't want to do that either. I really love her (ugh, I know, 17 year olds) and I'm really worried. I don't think she'll kill herself, but I'm still worried about her mental health in general.

What can I do? How can I help? What's the next step?

50,"I'm at a loss right now. For the past few months especially, but really for over a year or two now, I've been pretty bad overall. Apathy seems to be my main state, I get irritated by just about everything, and I feel pretty hopeless overall. 

 I'm having an issue lately that I don't know how to deal with, primarily because I can't tell what's causing what. I'm on setraline, buproprion, and Adderall. I have depression, anxiety, and ADHD, though I have a feeling the depression and anxiety are both CPTSD related. I'm not sure what all to put here so I'll put the basics. 

I get very, very irritated. I have a partner of almost four years, and they've gotten on my nerve more and more lately. I even talked to them about it so they'd maybe curb some of their behaviors, and they've begun to make changes. My two other roommates are good, but one of them is constantly on my nerves to the point of wanting to tell at her. I don't think I used to get this annoyed so quickly. Ive always been sensitive to sounds, scent, etc. 

I have an issue expressing how I'm feeling, always have. I try to be open about it, but it's difficult to be honest when all you have to say is that you're bad or apathetic or that you feel hopeless. Especially when your partner has anxiety, and of course has their own bad days. They require a lot of attention, both emotional and physical, and honestly I don't always have the energy. Is it selfish of me not to give more?  

I'm on the asexual spectrum, but my medication has made me have zero libido, specifically when it comes to physical things. But sometimes it feels like my romantic libido (is that a thing?) Is gone too. Maybe it's just hard to feel love when you're irritated and apathetic. I don't know. I feel so disconnected and I don't know what it's from. 

I guess I'm asking if anyone else has had that sort of experience? Anyone have experiences with the more emotional side effects of setraline (zoloft) or buproprion (Wellbutrin)? I also go to therapy 2-4x a month.",03Jan2020,8
51,"I have goals in life and I would love to get my life started. I am a 17 year old male that hasn't had a job yet, but I'm almost graduated. I cannot wait to graduate high school and start working and saving money, moving out, getting my license, getting an apartment, and having the life I have planned out. I know what I want to do as of these next few years transitioning from being a kid to an adult.

My issue is, I feel stuck. I have had an alcohol and drug abuse issues since I was 13 and I still do have them. This stems from boredom. All I do is lay down, watch YouTube, and eat junk food. I'm still pretty skinny surprisingly haha. Anyway, I have an issue with having absolutely no motivation which is weird and contradictory to what I said up there. Yes, I stand by this still. I just have no motivation. I don't want to do anything but lay down and relax. I don't like putting effort into anything because I'd rather be doing nothing. 

I hate doing nothing with my life, but I feel like I can't get anywhere. I'm stuck with no job which is probably most of the problem, I have too much free time on my hands. It drives me crazy sitting doing nothing. Makes me forget what life is really about. I have recently got to see family again for the holidays. Have been getting closer with a few friends again. This is what life is about. I'm just having a hard time myself. I'm not doing anything. 

TL;DR - I have no motivation and would rather be laying down watching youtube then anything. I have life goals, but am stuck. Also, everyday tasks require effort for me, and that effort that has to be put in is annoying/can be a challenge because I am a lazy ass.",03Jan2020,2

Sometimes I have good days where I'll have some energy to actually go out and go to Target or something. But 95% of the time, I just wanna stay in bed and watch Judge Judy.

These past 3 weeks or so have been really bad. I cry a lot (which isn't normal cause I've never been much of an emotional person). I've noticed a slight weight change (lost about 20 lbs in 1 month w/o even trying) and just an overall feeling of weakness and defeat.

I feel very lucky that I usually wake up and go to bed generally happy. I usually see the good in things and I'm known for being generally a smiley, happy, person.
The thing is, whenever someone is significantly upset with me, I get so sad. Like rocking and shaking and thinking that they'd be better off with me - sad. Sometimes it results in self-harm, but not often.

I end up convincing myself that I am a terrible person and I shouldn't even be here. I've never attempted suicide, and I can't see that ever happening, but I want to make sure this doesn't get any worse. I end up finding peace in thinking about what it would be like to just ""not exist"" anymore. But within an hour or so, I'm back to my normal, happy self, and I have almost forgotten what I was so distressed about earlier. Does anyone else experience this?

61,"So my friends and I have this friend we have known for a long time (they’ve known him longer than me). He lived in the U.S. a while ago and moved to Germany, once he moved back to the U.S. about two years ago his mental health seems to have heavily deteriorated. Prior to moving to Germany or even moving back to the US he seemed normal. We all spoke to him either through PlayStation chats or group chats as well as him visiting for holidays. We’re not quite sure what it is and whenever we attempt to address it with him he just ignores us and gets a tad bit aggressive. The best way to describe it is at random moments he snaps into this almost “new person” where he will just constantly pace around the area and find it difficult to stand/sit anywhere for too long. On top of that, he will spend a lot of the time laughing to himself and refuses to tell anyone what is “so funny”. We are all just super concerned about him because we’ve grown up with him and aren’t quite sure what may be the issue or what we can do. Also, it seems that he finds it hard to keep a job. He has had about 3/4 jobs since moving back, I think the longest he kept the job was max 2 months. Furthermore, from what we understand his family isn’t necessarily helping the situation at all at home, don’t have specific details but we’ve just heard it’s not the best at home.

On top of all that, my girlfriend of 6 years decided to leave me on Christmas night because she felt like she needed someone else and that my depression was too much of a stress on the relationship. This turned into her bringing someone into our home and getting sexual with them. Among other things, it has been a really traumatic separation with a lot of lies and disrespect.   


I just need to vent to an open forum. I feel like the woman I love and have built a family and life with ripped all of that from me. I feel powerless and defeated.

But it changed. I can’t pinpoint exactly when it started, but I’d say late summer. Whenever I get stressed, I get sick. To the point my stomach burns and I can’t eat anything without it not sitting well with me, badly, if you catch my drift. (Being lactose intolerant, I’m used to getting sick from foods, but this is worse, it’s like having a stomach bug, no food wants to settle with you) This didn’t really bother me, but lately I’ve noticed my heart rate and chest pains around the times when I’m stressed. The chest pains have only happened once or twice, but breathing/heart rate has been for over a month now. I can’t put my mind to rest at bed time, haven’t gone to bed at a healthy hour in forever. I’m a rower, and today an email was sent out about winter training, in which a new policy has been instated where you have to give absent notice 72 hours before the practice you’re gonna miss. Training is 5 days a week. I began worrying about all the other responsibilities I have, getting sick the day of or something coming up the day of, and the idea of feeling more stressed out from such a commitment, to the point I almost cried over it. One year ago I would’ve said “f it”, roll my eyes and make a sassy comment about the policy and suck it up. I felt my heart pounding and my chest hurting and head spinning. I am a foodie, but I had one taco tonight, I just couldn’t eat, I was almost sickened by it, I always have an appetite. I didn’t want to concern my mom because I never pass up Mexican. Instances like this keep happening. It’s like every inconvenience as of late, no matter the size sends me into a spiral like this to some degree. I feel...consumed? 

I’m only making this post because I don’t feel me, and I’ve never felt this way. I’ve never had an issue like this before, so I am sorry if I make you roll your eyes for maybe making something out of nothing. Is this something worth monitoring and bringing up to my mom?

I’m very confused, because I don’t have any disorders that do either of these two things and I’m not going to try and self diagnose them.

However, I’ve been having a lot of times where I don’t feel like I’m in my body. I know my body is mine, I know I am me, it’s not like anyone is “taking over” my body. It’s hard to control myself when things get like that, and I often feel empty and sluggish. I’ll have one of these about once a day or so, and they’ve been getting longer lately. The problem with this is that it gets hard to remember what happens during these times, and I think it’s actively worsening my education and social life.

I’m currently on 225mg of Effexor/Venlafaxine (an SNRI). I take this daily, in the form of a 150mg capsule and a 75mg capsule. I’ve been on this dosage for about a year now. I have BPD, if it’s relevant. 

I have lost (or run out of?) my 75mg capsules. I can’t find any in my house. I’ve searched and searched. I still have a few of my 150mg though, so I took one this morning.

I make so many mistakes that I get so frustrated with it. I feel like i’m in a sad cycle. And I spiral. The final one before it restarts is me getting upset with myself for being upset. 

My mom sent me to a psychiatrist who is no help at all. I’m in her room for 5-10 minutes. Every time I’m there she just asks me about college. Barely ever asks me about how I am. I can never tell if the medication works. I want a therapist and my mom told me she’d get me one for years. Same with the psychiatrist, and surprisingly she finally did it. It didn’t change anything.

I was 17 when I first went to my psychiatrist and they said they only accept 18 or older. But because my insurance sent me there, they took me in. Also, I don’t have insurance based in the state I live in, so my mom said it was hard to make the appointment. And I feel like a burden to ask for someone else. Even though she agreed that my psychiatrist isn’t helpful. Then she changes her mind and says she is and blames it it on

I can’t tell what’s wrong with me. I have ideas but I don’t want to seem like i’m reaching for a mental illness. And I know google is a terrible place because it just gets these ideas and bad thoughts into my head. Im not only hurting myself but those around me",03Jan2020,3

84,"Not entirely sure if this belongs here. I apologize in advance if it doesn’t. 

For the past year and a half I’ve been struggling with my mental health, but these past few months have been getting a bit worse. I haven’t gone to therapy/counseling at all because my mom can’t afford it right now nor believes that I need to see a therapist for my “issues”.  She believes nothing is wrong with me and that I’m “just a teenager going through teenage issues”. It’s beyond difficult to talk to her about my mental health. 

To get straight to the point, I really need to talk to someone about my mental health because it hasn’t gotten any better. I feel like I’m watching myself through a TV screen. Nothing feels real anymore. I look in the mirror and I feel like I don’t even know who that girl is anymore. Never in a million years would I thought I’d feel this way. I hate it. It’s fucking terrifying. I tend to forget things very easily, I can’t concentrate on one thing, my head feels like it’s constantly spinning, and I’ve never felt more alone. I just turned 17 a few weeks ago and I’m concerned that I shouldn’t be feeling this way at such a young age/something is really wrong with me. 

I feel like I have no sense of self. I struggle with finding who I really am. I’m afraid of the future because I have so many unrealistic goals and I am constantly changing what I want to pursue a career in. I feel like I don’t have one true identity if that makes sense? 

On another note, I struggle with concentrating on simple tasks. I tend to go off on tangents when I talk to my friends/family and I have trouble controlling it. I tend to forget things very easily and I feel fucking stupid afterwards. 

I don’t really know where to go with this to be honest because I feel disconnected from reality but any advice is greatly appreciated. I really hope I get some fucking help soon before I completely lose my shit. 

Also I’m really scared to talk to my boyfriend(M15) about this type of shit because I’m afraid it’ll scare him/make him not want to be with me anymore because he might not know how to react or want to deal with me :( I love him a lot. I have no idea how to bring it up to him and I’m nervous because I love him a lot but I’m afraid he won’t know what to do when I get like this :(

I apologize that there is absolutely no order to this whatsoever but I just really needed to let this out. Any advice is appreciated. 

TL;DR: I(F17) like I have no self of self. Often disconnected from reality. Difficulty focusing on simple tasks/concentrating. I feel like something is wrong with me and it’s terrifying. Any advice?

I really just wanna figure out if I’m just a lazy bitch or I actually have something wrong with me. I don’t feel sad or hopeless or anything like that but I experience things that a lot of people tell me are symptoms of depression. My room is an absolute disaster and you can hardly walk in it. I don’t know why I can’t just pick up after myself but it just gets like that. You can hardly walk in it. I lay in bed all the time, especially these last few months. I come home from school and lie down in my bed and I come downstairs for dinner and then somehow I’m back in my bed for the rest of the night. It’s like I physically cannot get up and there’s a magnet making me stay there. Today I woke up at 11 and didn’t get out of bed until almost 3 but only because my sister wanted to go to Panera for lunch. That’s the only thing I ate all day. I also have a huge problem getting up in the morning. I’ll lay there until literally five minutes before I have to leave before racing to put some clothes on and brushing my teeth for like 30 seconds. I’m usually not late to school but this year I have been late to class multiple times because of this. I rarely eat breakfast and I don’t have much for lunch either. I try to keep up with my hygiene but often I’ll go 3 or 4 days without showering on accident.  I am also a severe procrastinator and I won’t do anything unless it’s right before I have to get it done. Usually I’m able to get by like this but my grades have suffered this year from flat out just not doing big assignments which is unusual of me, but that’s probably just senioritis. I just don’t have the motivation to do anything anymore. The only reason I ask this question is because people have brought this up to me and I just don’t wanna look like an idiot in a psychiatrist’s office trying to figure out if I have depression when I’m just lazy. I’m not trying to get a diagnosis here or anything I’m just trying to see if I should take this seriously or I just need to get my shit together. I do have OCD and undiagnosed dermatillomania (but it’s extremely obvious, it’s just not very long term and I just go through a phase of intense picking for a few months. This year I started picking every single day at my scalp January - August, presumably from stress, and I lost a lot of hair because of it. I had two huge bald patches on the top of my head.) and I tried to kms when I was 11 just for a little context. (I don’t think I understood death back then, that when you’re gone you’re gone, and I thought I would be dead as soon as I passed out from choking myself. I don’t think I had depression back then either, just a really low self esteem and very insecure and confused.) obviously this isn’t very severe since I don’t feel sad or any significant negative emotions but to be honest I’m not sure what I feel. I kinda feel nothing. I’ve had a lot of shit happen this year and I’ve always felt I don’t feel emotions as strongly as other people. Sorry for such a long post.",03Jan2020,3

I've been feeling really low lately, the worst I've ever felt in my life. I'm supposed to start therapy on the 14th, hopefully, but I'm not sure if it will help at this point. I'm not sure what else to do besides check myself into a mental health hospital, and hope that they can help. But I don't know what all will happen..

The main thing is that I'm worried about my family and home life. I live with my mother and cousins and a couple other people. I've heard in some cases law enforcement can get involved and confiscate computers and cellphones and other things, and I just don't want to disrupt their lives even more than I would by just going to the hospital or by just getting therapy. They've got their own problems, they're just trying to live their own lives. I don't want to throw another wrench into it.

Is it true that they can do this? Confiscate computers and other things, notebooks, journals, etc.? Or is this just some lie that I heard? I know that they're allowed to do that type of stuff with some criminal cases, but this isn't a criminal case. I wouldn't think that they would be able to, or allowed to, if it was simply me checking myself into a mental health facility..

91,"Around November I started drinking again, because of depression and just isolation. I don't feel like being around anyone and the town I live in is small, where I feel stuck, with no support or really any good help. December is generally a rough month to begin with as I don't really like my family (well more or less don't feel like a belong) The drinking came on slow but as it rolls along its picking up momentum and I'm again doing this alone. Even when I am drinking I don't feel like being around anyone (essentially I hang around the cats)

I don't know overly what has happened to pull me back down this road after 8 months of sobriety but it could be the fact the people who said they'd be there for me just aren't. I also decided to just go home new years after playing dnd with some friends because they decide to not only distribute there share of the drugs around me but also use infront of me. So I just made an excuse and went home. To again drink and just go to sleep.

Then as I'm writing this (I've just woken up) and ive already begun drinking.

I know it's a few things bugging me. Like I mentioned feeling stuck in this town, I can't find a job here that accommodates my shoulder injury or isn't around people (I can't do customer interaction because of my anxiety) the times I do get out of this town, it's limited to pretty much my running around or doing shit for people who can't even return a small favour.

I feel a sense of abandonment yet again. I feel aban9by my family, friends, even my therapist I csnt overly afford due to being on disability. Like things have been going fairly well being sober but I know I'm slipping back down the path and I just don't know how far or quick this landslide is going to happen again. Last time I ended up using heroin and mdma to cope along with alcohol.

I don't know why but this has raised the bar to return way high for me. I have some fear of abandonment and the idea that ten sessions is the maximum makes me feel like they don't really want to solve my issues (which is nonsense because it is an insurance thing) and like going make would mean I'm overstaying my welcome and being a bother to people. Or like there is something wrong with me for not being 'fixed' in ten sessions. I wish I could just be with a therapist indefinitely but that appears to not be an option.

98,"Hey guys, so recently I've become worried about my mental state, and I haven't been able to find any solid answers elsewhere, so I've decided to come here. And I'm not here to get attacked for any choices I've made in my life, I know they were stupid, so can we please just overlook them and talk facts instead of have an intervention.

Here's some facts to start out...

Symptoms:
--headaches where my head feels like it's ""shrinking""
--Occasional panic attacks where I sometimes start to have difficulty reading. I can still read, it just gets sightly hard to look at the words and register them in my head. Then again I do read fast, when I slow down when this happens I usually don't have a problem.
--Random pains, feels like ball of needles, they don't happen in just one place.
--Sometimes extreme paranoia, but this is 99% of the time related to my health, for example, being paranoid that I might have a tumor.
--Very occasional loss of balance, but then again I've always been clumsy.



I am:
-male
-16

I know I have:
-autism(extremely high functioning, super-minimal symptoms, I suggest using Google to get a better explanation)
-ADHD(I don't know much about this except for that I have it. I take prescribed Adderall)

Other things:

•I live in a stressful household, everyone in the family has either ADHD or autism, my mom has depression issues and this leads to some unhealthy verbal interactions with my autistic father, which causes unrest in the rest of the family.

•Life is decently stressful due to multiple reasons(such as the aforementioned family), if you're making an equation in your head, set the stress level to high-very high.

•I've been saving up the past 3 months for a gaming setup, which means triple night shifts at work, so sleep deprivation I guess.

•Personality wise I'm kinda goofy, and I like to look for loopholes to get around difficult things when I can. I usually take bad things in stride and am not usually affected. (I think this may be due to the nature of my family life). This part is kinda vague but I felt like I should include it.

•I might have Hypochondria. My mom says it looks like a classic case, and from the symptoms I've seen online it kinda looks like that to me too. But I feel like I have something else. But you never know, could just be the Hypochondria...

Bad stuff (I know these were stupid of me to do, read the first paragraph again):

Drugs that I used to do(I've quit all of them)=

•alot of weed(plant and occasional THC cart, but I always made sure to check the cart for legitimacy and I haven't had any of the normal cart related problems. Never had any problems smoking.).

•acid, 4 times but appropriately spaced, last time I took 2 tabs and smoked pot, my friend who was also dropping had a bad trip, authorities became involved and I ended up being caught. I was very shaken from being caught but every time I was tripping, the trip was positive.

•shrooms (once, but it was a very positive trip and nothing bad happened)

•one time doing Molly, but that was a small dose, spaced out from other drugs, the trip was positive and I didn't have any bad problems, so I don't think it was a problem

I've never been addicted to any drug I've done. Of course there was the regular occasional teen vaping and drinking, but I never got addicted, and I rarely participated in those activities. Yes, once again I know it was dumb.


So if anyone has any idea about what I have/might have, just give it to me straight. Right now I'm pretty sure it could be a brain tumor or psychosis. Who knows, it could just be some stupid Hypochondria mixing with high stress and my autism/ADHD and causing some extreme paranoia/symptoms. I don't know.

Any theories or answers I'll gladly accept, and I'd be more than happy to answer any questions.

Thanks,
-idiot",03Jan2020,5

I’m starting to hear and see shit. 

I had this auditory hallucination where it sounded like 100’s of crickets were in my room chirping (spoiler alert: there wasn’t 100’s of crickets in my room) 

I get these voices in my head (not external only in my head) that sound like people being murdered and screaming. 

I’ve seen a few visual hallucinations in the past 2 days but not much. But what scared me the most was I closed my eyes and I saw my entire room and house completely redesigned, it was lowkey sick as fuck but that’s not really a concern.

Also I’ll get this thing where this old wrinkley ass bitch attacks me when I close my eyes (W as fuck)

101,"I’m 17, in high school and basically failing, even though I know I’m just as intelligent and bright as my peers. My only problem is, I can never bring myself to study or basically do anything besides lying in bed when I’m alone. I haven’t been for the past 5 years.

So, my problems actually started 5 yrs ago when I transferred to this grammar school. Before that, I was a straight A student despite never studying much. Paying attention at school was enough and then my mum would often study with me (or more like force me to). But, at the new school I struggled to make friends, was of the age when I thought no one understood me and constantly argued with my parents. After school (&amp; the hobbies and clubs I attended) I’d always go straight to bed. I didn’t see it as a problem at first because everything seemed ok, but looking back I think I became depressed. Note that at this point my grades were still amazing.

I finally overcame like a year later, made some amazing friends, became used to my school and my life started being ok again. I’ve since had some ups and downs, but have since become a confident, more or less happy person who can deal with her problems and has a strong support system in the form of family and friends.

In spite of this, I have problems with concentration - I can never pay attention in all my classes for the whole time - and I can never bring myself to study even though I really want to. Everything seems too challenging. Even basic hygiene now. For the sake of my social life, I can pretend just ok - shower every morning, do the most basic stuff for school, attend all social activities and be genuinely happy around my friends, but a soon as I come home, I go straight to bed and can never seem to do anything. My room’s messy and I only manage to clean it when I really have to.

I thought I had depression, but besides being sad about never doing anything, I think I’m happy most of the time. Then I thought about having undiscovered ADHD, but I think I’m way too little impulsive &amp; composed for that and don’t really fit the symptoms. But something’s certainly wrong with me and has been all the time. I know you’re no doctors, guys, but do you have any idea what can be wrong with me?

I seem to get buyers remorse over any little thing I buy, recently. The other day I spent 5 minutes pacing around a shop debating whether to buy a £15 lamp that I know I wanted. 

I recently treated myself to a new Kindle Oasis. I’m a big reader, although mainly paper books over e-books, and I’ve had my old Kindle 4th Generation for 8 years. 

I just feel so guilty about it. Ever since I bought it, all can think about is returning it. I feel so wasteful. 

The new Kindle is an upgrade, but not a necessary one. The old kindle works fine. It doesn’t have a backlight (like the Oasis does) but I have a case with an embedded light so that was never an issue. The old kindle was also a gift from my sister (albeit 8 years ago), and I feel even more guilty about that because I’ve arranged to give it to a friend instead of having it lie in a drawer for years never to be seen again. 

The cost of the new one isn’t an issue, and if the old one was broke I don’t think I’d be questioning my decision in the slightest. But I work hard and earn good money and feel like I should be able to treat myself without feeling this anxiety and guilt every time. 

Hopefully some of you will have some advice or tips. Or maybe you’ll all tell me I’m the worst and that I should return it after all 😂 Any input appreciated. Thanks all.",03Jan2020,2

109,"Hi everyone. I need to vent on something.

I have hardcore ""FOMO"" as I heard it, or, ""Fear of Missing Out"", that means I'm always afraid of missing stuff that could be happening while I'm not here.

I think nearly everyone can feel this way sometimes, frustration when you miss out on a great time. But I think in my case it can be unhealthy.

For example, everytime there's a night out with my friends, I'm one of the few that goes to bed at 5-6 AM. So everyone sees me as this ""party hard guy""... Well in 90% of those parties I've wanted to leave since midnight and go to my goddamn couch, and I go through the party with a hole in my stomach and I'm pissed when everyone orders an other drink. But I just can't leave because I don't want to miss out...

Recent example, a few days ago I was with my family for Christmas. I was SO HAPPY to see them because I see them like once or twice a year... But while I was with them I saw an Instagram story where my friends were having drinks. Just that. Not a specific party, not a special occasion, just having casual drinks like we do at least twice a week. And it was enough to, again, put a hole in my stomach and I couldn't enjoy my afternoon with my family and play with my nephew (which I love to do). Of course when they asked me why I was feeling so bad and looking so depressed I couldn't tell them, that would sound so ridiculous...

So I don't know what should I do to fix it...

- Has anything changed as of last year? You were funnier back then.
- Is everything alright? (Repeatedly from a friend of mine whenever she is drunk.)
- Certain people always asking if everythnig is alright whenever I meet them (this was not the case earlier)

111,"My name is Lucas and I'm 15 and from England. I haven't got the happiest family ever, and my dad used to do some borderline abusive stuff to me when I was very little which I was too young to remember but my mum brings it up sometimes to make my dad feel guilty. For example we were driving through a forest on holiday and I was crying in the car and my dad got so fed up that he put me outside and drove off with me lying on the floor looking at them abandon me. My mum said she could see me in the car mirrors and I looked terrified until my dad turned around to pick me back up. He also apparently used to drag me by my arm across the floor when he was angry leaving me with carpet burns. Once as a baby I was crying in bed in the night so he strapped me to my high chair and left me downstairs alone. I've also had lots of red handprints all over my body from slaps. I have no memories of this apart from the carpet burns. My mum has never forgiven my dad for doing things like that which is why she brings it up sometimes. Me and my dad have a pretty decent relationship nowadays. I know it's nothing compared to what some people experience growing up, but I wonder if it has still affected me in some way. I'm sorry this post is so long and I don't expect anyone to read any of it but I felt like I needed to write down everything that has been going wrong with me because it seems like too much going on at once. This way I will hopefully be able to handle it better by breaking down my issues.

My social anxiety is the issue I've had for the longest period of time. I hate large groups of people, I struggle talking to strangers, I can hardly talk to people on the phone, and I hate doing public speaking such as school presentations. I feel like this issue has massively affected my social life because I don't make as many new friends as other people and I'm too scared to join clubs with strangers. Even some of my family that live far away I react to them like strangers, same goes with my brother's gf. I'm scared of them basically.

General anxiety. I worry about getting a good job. I worry about what people think about me, like I feel I get on people's nerves or I sometimes feel like they think I'm being rude. I worry about my friends secretly hating me and talking about me behind my back. I worry about failing all the time, especially with school work because I'm useless at maths and chemistry and physics. It gives me dread to think about those subjects. I also worry about being lonely when I'm older, I feel like I won't find friends as an adult and I feel like I won't be able to find a partner.

Panic attacks. I started getting what I assume is panic attacks. Whenever something really stressful comes up my body is too weak to handle it. For example I had a class test for maths (which is my worst subject) and that morning I felt like my body was not getting any oxygen, like I was suffocating, even though I could still inhale fine. I also see stars in my eyesight, and hear my heartbeat in my ears, and I freeze up or my arms and legs will shiver when I'm really stressed out. 

My sexual problems. I have developed incest kinks thankfully not to my parents or brother but I have it to my cousins who are all much older then me by the way. I also get aroused by my own self. However in real life I've never had a gf or bf. I'm pretty sure I'm gay anyway but I'm too scared to come out yet. There was also a period of time at school where I kept getting groped by some people from my year group. They did it as a joke but they would grab my crotch and slap my bum but I never fought back and I never tried to stop them so I guess they saw it as acceptable and I don't blame them for thinking that. It wasn't just me they did that too though. The first sexual encounter I had was at 9/10 years old with someone who still lives only 2 minutes from my house. It basically involved me getting naked, lots of kissing, him putting his penis into my mouth and me doing that to him as well as some stuff with my anus. At the time I had no sexual drive and I would accept money from him in exchange for doing those things, so basically I was selling myself. I don't think I'll ever tell anyone that in real life. I remember my mum found some of the money (literally only a few £) in my trouser pockets and I refused to tell her where I got it from and cried, but that was the closest I got to saying about it. She probably thought I stole it from a friend or something. The person is also under 18 still so not an old man or anything, it's just they were much more sexually developed then me at the time.

Intrusive thoughts. I get thoughts about being raped by authority figures from my life. For example I've imagined several of my teachers raping me which has made me feel ashamed to look at them because of the horrible thoughts. I also get intrusive thoughts about hurting myself. Sometimes in my room I'll grab my pen knife and get tempted to stab myself. I have always resisted my urges until now, when I got so upset with everything so I cut my thigh through my trousers. I cut deeper then I meant to because I could see the layer of fat under the skin.

Attention issues. This affects me at school and it's really irritating. I'll be in lesson, I'll actively try to listen to the teacher and then i realise I've not actually been concentrating for the whole time they have been talking which leaves me unaware of the tasks I've been given. Then I have to ask the teacher again and sound like an idiot, or keep asking my friend what I'm meant to be doing. I also always get told off by people for fidgeting because I can't keep still when they talk to me. I shake my legs up and down all the time and my parents and gran hate it but I can't stop. Honestly this is a really annoying problem because I really want to focus properly but my brain phases out too easily. 

My mood problems have been around for a long time too. Most of the time I would say I have a low mood, I don't know if it's strong enough to be considered depression but I would define myself as feeling sad. I have weeks where I just feel like nobody in the world understands me and then I think of all the stressful things that I have to do in the week, like going to certain lessons or tests I have to do or whatever and I just get so sad about it because it feels like I always have too much going on at once. Then I'll get sudden urges to burst out crying for no obvious reason. I was watching TV with my family last night and I just teared up randomly and felt really upset and emotional. I've had to leave lessons at school before because I had to hold back tears and couldn't talk without crying. Then what's even more weird is I sometimes get bursts of joy where life seems great again. I'll start loving my friends who I normally feel don't really like me and who also get on my nerves a lot. Then I feel like I have a good sense of humour and my energy level is right up and my stress goes way down. I don't know how to make the happy feelings stay and I don't know why they appear so suddenly in the first place but they help to make my life worth living.

Health anxiety. Almost every night I worry about my health. I always have to check my throat and mouth in the mirror for marks and spots, I check my heart rate multiple times a day because it gets very high sometimes and I can feel palpitations in my chest and think I have a heart problem. I also can't stop checking all my moles because I get scared of skin cancers developing. I also get paranoid of lung cancer from smoking and bowel cancer because sometimes I get pains in my gut. I keep swearing to myself that I will cut out cigarettes and energy drinks but I can't stop. I'm honestly scared that I'm going to die. When I was younger I used to run into my parents room crying because I looked up whatever symptoms I had and convinced myself I had some horrible disease. I still do this actually but I try and keep it to myself rather then telling anyone about it. Like I'm pretty sure I had a thing called precordial catch syndrome where it hurt like hell to breath deeply in the left part of my chest but at first I convinced myself I had a clot in my lung and I thought I was going to die.

I am a Sixth Form, second-year student who is completing A-Levels in Sociology, Biology, Psychology as well as completing an Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) at Shrewsbury Sixth Form College. My working title for my EPQ is “what limitations are there for accessing mental health treatment in the UK?” I started this project as I never really heard/saw anyone else talk about this topic and I was very curious to see what actual limitations there could be. So far, I have found funding issues, age restrictions as well as demographic differences. Any data that is provided I will conduct a thematic analysis- I will look at common themes and patterns and mention them, I will also do a chart or a graph to show what types of treatments are most popular (I.e. 25% received CBT, 35% use medication) etc.

Although I have gathered numerical data and looked over different articles,  my research project would be much better with anecdotes from real life people who have accessed mental health treatment here in the UK; I could include how useful they found them, how long they had to wait for treatment, what kind of treatment they accessed etc. as a comparison to statistics. If you are transitioning from young people services to adult services, then your experiences would be especially useful too.

117,"Hello. I’ve been on abilify for nearly 2 year’s now, I think.  I’m currently getting a 200 mg shot every month &amp; and am determined to go even lower in the coming months. 

Shortly after turning 19 (I’m now 22) I went through psychosis, was then put on monthly shots of invega for a year. I’ve haven’t had a episode or anything remotely close to it since coming out of the hospital. 

I can actually recall I think all my delusions which I heard is uncommon &amp; I never really heard anything that wasn’t actually there like voices. 

So I was on 400 mg of ability. I’m now on half that &amp; have been told by my psychiatrist it’s equivalent to 10 mg a day.

118,"This is definitely less intense and severe than some of the other posts on here but I need to share.


My girlfriend and I were long distance the last 3 months while I saved up money to move out with her to her new city. In August, we were inseperable and madly in love with each other, even talking about getting engaged. We broke up New year's Eve at 9pm, then rang in the new year by crying into each other's shoulders and talked about what we wish we would've done better so that the distance didn't kill our connection. People drift apart and it's a tragic waste of love but that's how life goes sometimes.


We were halfway through a trip, her family came for Hanukkah, my family came for New year's, and it was just me and her on Wednesday when we broke up. Now I'm alone with my extended family, with all of them asking where she is and why we broke up, because we were so good together and they were just positive we'd give them grandchildren.


I'm avoiding all of them. I can't eat because 80% of the food I eat, I puke up within the hour. Sleeping isn't even worth trying, I'll pass out from exhaustion for 20-30 minutes twice a day or so and that's all I can really get. Those naps are ended by intense nightmares. I'm having hallucinations, hearing voices, seeing paintings move, etc. I think it's because of sleep deprivation but I don't know how I'm supposed to sleep. I'm also intensely paranoid. I convinced myself that the death of Qassim Soliemani was going to cause my home city to get nuked while I'm in the airplane flying towards it.


I don't know why I'm feeling this way, I've never taken a breakup this hard. I just wish I could go back to August and move right away, struggle with money for a little bit, and eventually find myself and be happy with the girl of my dreams. The worst part is that I know she feels the same way.",03Jan2020,4

121,"It's taken so long to finally get myself to this point in my rabbit hole where I have something that finally feels a little more concrete than what I used to think. I used to be depressed, but the depression lead me to become emotionless and then I started to have thoughts and images that just appeared out of nowhere of me causing harm to myself and others. At first they disturbed me, but after a long time I started to accept them and only once acted on it. The thoughts started going to my dreams and I would have dreams of murdering the people close to me, but not quickly or mercilessly. 

The first dream, I kicked my mom down the stairs to the basement then dragged into the laundry room and forced her to drink an entire bottle of bleach. She foamed at the mouth and kicked and tried to scream, but blood was filling her lungs, blood coming from the sides of her mouth. Like she was drooling, but with dark red blood. She twitched for a minute, but that soon stopped. The other dreams haven't been better. 

But during this whole time, I figured I had to be some sort of psycho or sociopath, maybe even had high functioning autism, but I just never the full symptons of anything, not even schizophrenia which my father was an extreme paranoid schizophrenia and although I fit a decent amount of symptoms, it wasn't enough to classify me as such. 

But here recently I figured, how about I just stop and look at the symptoms I have and so far every symptom lines up perfectly with only intrusive thoughts except the occasional episode of paranoia, but all my brothers have that, none of them have intrusive thoughts like I experience. 

So what if that's just it? Just intrusive thoughts l plus whatever I inherited from my father? Those two together basically explain everything and that makes me glad, but still not happy because I have no clue how to control or handle these thoughts. Everytime I'm near somebody, I just have the urge to hurt or kill them, the thoughts flashing in my mind like Mason and his brainwashing to kill Kennedy in CoD Black Ops.

Does anyone have any suggestions or tips or even a whole solution that I can steal? Yes I go to therapy, but she's useless. She's become a friend instead of actually helping me with this stuff, no others in town and the drive to the next nearest one just isn't worth the drive.",03Jan2020,1

Yesterday I admitted to my doctor I am on the edge and have been very close to committing suicide a few times (OD'ing on my meds), hoping he'd just prescribe stronger medication to fight off my suicidal thoughts, but instead because of that, and because I had lost 8 pounds in just two weeks (saw him two weeks ago) due to less eating (I just haven't had the will to eat much), and because I hadn't bathed in three days (not because I wanted to self harm via that, I just couldnt muster the will to get out of bed outside going to work) he recommended I go to a hospital's ER and tell them everything.  He brought in another doctor who concurred, and she even said ""do you want us to call the cops to escort you?"" when I initially said no.  So, shaking and wanting to throw up from fear, I just said I'd do it on my own and they let me go.  They're going to know that I didn't go eventually, and call the cops.  So what are my options?

Hi, first time poster in this subreddit, didn't even know it existed but I've been doing a lot of thinking lately and I need some advice. 

For some background, I have been an athlete basically all my life. I've found most of my success in running, which is am incredibly mental sport. Ever since my sophomore year of high school, I've dealt with some pretty poor performances that have really taken a toll on me. It's now my sophomore year of college and I still just can't seem to wrap my head around the mental aspect of the sport. Every time I can stay focused for a race, it goes incredibly well, but if there's even a second where i stop focusing, my head is flooded with thoughts of self doubt and ways to drop out. While I have never given in to dropping out, these thoughts have completely destroyed a ton of my races, only further reinforcing these thoughts.

I'm not sure if it was caused by my running, or this started before my running started to go downhill, but I ALWAYS have to be doing something. Any period of time where I sit around idly, I find my head filled with some super dark thoughts. During my most recent down time from running (I took 2 weeks of after the season) I have never been more antisocial and sad in my entire life for what seemed like absolutely no reason. I didn't want to leave my dorm room or do anything with my friends, and I really just laid around, cried a little, and did nothing for 2 weeks, which also crushed my grades.

153,"My anhedonia is ruining my life (term used by my psychiatrist). It makes me ‘not want’ anything. It makes it difficult to get anything done and keeps me from doing many things. I push myself really hard – getting all my schoolwork done and going to Meetups to force myself to socialize, but I get no benefit from it, no internal reward. Even at the Meetups, I feel like it is keeping me from properly socializing, as I get no internal reward for it. It all just feels like grinding, and after 2+ years of being treated by a psychiatrist I am growing concerned that I will never overcome it.

Does anyone have any advice? Any way to help me find a goal that I actually want to achieve, rather than just doing it for its own sake? I have tied diets (vegetarian 4 years, keto 4 months) and have tried exercise (completed Couchto5K running and TA’d a weight training class for a full year) with no positive results.

I feel like I’ve tried everything I could think of at this point, including getting professional help. What else is left for me to try?",03Jan2020,2
154,"Recently I've been going through a really rough breakup, I've been telling the people I felt comfortable with how low I'm feeling. That im having a hard time eating and sleeping, I don't even want to go to work anymore and I love my job. I literally have been feeling so low at times i feel as if I was better off dead and the only response I've had was either ""I'm sorry"" ""what did you expect"" or not response at all. The whole situation got me thinking that honestly not many people show any kind of compassion when someone else is feeling so crappy, yet when someone goes off and ends their life, people feel awful for never listening in the first place. Why are people like this? It makes this world feel so cold and lonely... Please be there for people when they need you if possible. It can literally change so much.",03Jan2020,1
157,"I feel so much dumber, more boring, less creative, less energized, more awkward, less happy, and more apathetic than I did a few months ago. I don’t know exactly what the cause of it is, or if all of those things are concurrent with one another or they are each the result of separate factors in my life, but everything just feels generally more dull to me. My writing, which used to be one of my strong suits, now feels lackluster in comparison to what it was merely a few months ago. My social skills have been faltering, despite me being someone who is typically very amiable (or at least, I’d like to think so) and outgoing, and to the point where I wonder if I’m even gonna be able to make new friends this coming semester at college, which I was really hoping to do, since I was having so much trouble doing so in the second half of last semester. I feel like I have so much more trouble articulating myself now than I’ve ever had in the past. My memory has gotten notably worse, at least since I’ve been home for winter break. My thoughts come to me much slower, and I feel like I can’t think of things to say as well as I usually can. I just feel so empty, unmotivated, like I’m nothing. I feel like all of the things I like about myself are rapidly fading away, and I have no clue how to keep them from slipping away. For some context, I’m 18 and a first year student in college. The main factors I suspect of causing this are:

* ADHD medication. I’m currently on 25mg of Strattera, and ever since I started it, I've noticed myself feeling markedly duller. However, by the same token, I tried to stop taking it for three weeks before this one that I’ve been home since winter break, because I suspected it of causing the things listed above, but noticed my memory getting a lot worse, so I’ve been taking it for a little less than the past week. I was on Ritalin for almost all of last year, which I stopped taking because it made my OCD much worse, and noticed myself feeling more restricted than usual, but it was never quite as bad as it is now.
* Antidepressants. Currently on 40mg of Prozac. Once I got home from break, I started trying to take 25mg of it instead, and sometimes I just wouldn’t take it at all, because again, I worried that it was causing the problems listed before, but that was probably a stupid idea, since I got a lot more depressed in the third week of being home. Eventually, I met with my psychiatrist, who got bumped down to 20mg after I expressed that I was starting to feel apathetic about things, but said that the ADHD medication should stay the same. However, my mom and I talked and we agreed that it was probably better for me to go to 30mg since I was starting to feel more depressed anyway.
* Drinking. I’ve only been drinking since college started, which has been since August, and I don’t drink very often, probably about once a week if not once every other week, but typically when I do drink, I have more than the average person is meant to have, simply because I’m a bit of a heavyweight. However, college is the first time where I’ve had easy access to copious amounts of alcohol at any given time. I’ve taken note of the fact that when I have gotten drunk in the past three months, I tend to be much more socially apt than I have been when I’m not. I know they don’t call it “social lubricant” for nothing, but I didn’t think that drinking would somehow make me *more* awkward when I’m sober. There are numerous sources online saying that binge drinking can make you dumber, stunt your memory, and make you more depressed, but I don’t know if that only applies to people who drink religiously or it can apply to anyone who binge drinks regardless of frequency.
* Seasonal depression. Even though I was on the medications listed above this past fall and a brief portion of the summer, I remember feeling much happier than I currently do and just having much more motivation to do things. It isn’t uncommon for me to feel worse during the winter months, but it’s usually not quite this bad or prominent, and from what I can recall it’s usually more tolerable than this, but it would make a good amount of sense for that to be the case.
* College. I’ve really been enjoying myself at college so far, but during the last two months of last semester, I noticed the things I mentioned at the beginning getting worse without much of a way to account for it. Although the above factors could all make sense, I definitely noticed that the amount of work I was doing and the sheer amount of socializing I forced myself to do every day was starting to take a toll on me.

Hey everybody,

I experienced a relapse in health anxiety at the start of November during college and just wanted to get some advice... (Am I just crazy??)

I will not go into full detail about everything, as it is quite long/complex. A bit about myself: I am a male 20yo, entrepreneurial-minded, ambitious/workaholic with big goals. I definitely have a compulsive/obessive personality, which actually allows me to work extremely hard, and get super immersed in whatever I am doing. However, I have had some issues with OCD and hypochondria since my early teens (irrational fear of hiv, germs, cancer, deadly diseases etc.). These were just ""phases"" as I call them, so I always managed to snap out of the anxiety.

Basically, 3 years ago, an incident happened  [https://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/9v3fow/bad\_hookah\_experience\_should\_i\_be\_worried/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/9v3fow/bad_hookah_experience_should_i_be_worried/) . After that, I continue to live perfectly well for 1,5 years, without noticing anything being wrong. I built a business during high school, got great grades etc. Then, in my final year of high school, I come across an article on fb about that same incident, where the author was saying things like ""you can get brain damage, concentration issues etc."". Like I said, I never noticed anything being wrong with me, but when I read those articles, I spiraled into crippling anxiety, because I now thought ""I have fucked up my life/health/future etc."". I was in the middle of my preparation for my final exams, and I consulted more than 5 GPs. All of them said that I was fine and that I had nothing to worry about. I even consulted a specialist, who also reassured me that I had nothing to worry about. I do not know how, but I managed to get through my final exams with excellent grades, under extreme anxiety. After graduating, instead of being happy like my peers, I fell into a deep deep depression, because I just thought that I had ruined my life. I did not apply to any colleges because I wanted to take a gap year to focus on my business.

I was severely depressed and anxious but nobody could understand why. Nothing seemed to be wrong with me health wise, but I just cannot deal with uncertainty when it comes to health, I always drive myself crazy with ""what if"" thoughts, so I was put on an SSRI (10mg Citalopram) by my GP, but she did not mention anything about getting therapy. I was feeling like shit, laying in bed all day (very unusual of me, as I was always super productive, passionately working 10-18 hours a day), so I decided to see a psychiatrist, but the only thing he did, was listening to me for 50 minutes and telling me ""just don't think about it, it will go away"". After that, months of severe depression followed, I just felt completely hopeless about my future, and I was so mad at myself for that incident (normally I do not engage in any drugs/alcohol/smoking etc.) . A lot of people had the same thing happen to them, but they do not overreact like I do.

Somehow (probably the meds were kicking in), I found back to myself and started working on my business again, started getting back on track with my goals etc. I started feeling less and less depressed, and used all of the pain and suffering as motivation to fight myself back after these horrible months. Around march, my prescription for the SSRI's ended, and because I was not seeing any psychiatrist, I just stopped taking them. I did not experience any withdrawal side-effects, and during the following months, I was doing very well mentally - feeling on top of the world again.

In September, I left home for the first time to study abroad at a highly ranked university. The first 2 months were going super well, I was very happy with the new environment I found myself in. I was running my business next to uni work, doing better than ever, waking up at 5 am, working up to 100+ hours a week (my compulsive/obsessive personality), but loving every second of it. I also managed to get very good grades, and started socializing a lot. The thoughts about my depressive/anxious episode did come up from time to time, and I remember being super proud of myself that I had digged myself out of that hole, thinking ""How the hell did you waste months dwelling on something so stupid"".

Then, in November, I was not in a very good place mentally, as I had to rewrite a whole assignment, which I had spent 2 weeks on - throwing me off guard a bit (I am very structured, always like to have everything planned). I don't know how, but all of that combined (probably a burnout) triggered my OCD and I started dwelling on that incident again. At first I thought I could snap out of it, but I just started obsessing with the same thoughts again, leading me back into that negative spiral, feeling super anxious again - even had a full-blown panic attack. I saw a GP (she thought I was crazy) who gave me a 2-week prescription for a benzo to reduce my anxiety. That did help a bit, but the following weeks were awful to control my anxiety and studying for finals at the same time. I really needed help, so I am now seeing a psychiatrist and doing CBT to finally treat the root of the problem.

I am currently back home for Christmas, and I must say that my anxiety is now much better than it was just 1-2 months ago. However, this relapse made me very confused about myself and my future. I thought that I had overcome the anxiety, but it just came back out of nowhere. The thing is, every time I get these obsessive, irrational thoughts, I start feeling hopeless about the future, because I think to myself ""You are not good enough anymore because of that incident, and there is something wrong with you now"". This makes me neglect my passion for business, consequently, making me depressed. I am kind of mad at myself because I have put my health at risk like that,

Now, I don't know whether I should go back on an SSRI to help me during this phase. I really do not want to mess up my grades/and even uni experience (I did not feel like socializing anymore, and became very pessimistic, not attending any lectures). The anxiety/OCD definitely is not as bad as it was 1-2 months ago, but I feel like the meds could prevent me from having another breakdown. Now would be the perfect time to take it, as I still have 2 weeks of break to get over the initial phase of side-effects. My GP prescribed me 10mg Citalopram along with the benzos, but I did not take it yet. My psychiatrist said, that I should not take the meds unless it is absolutely necessary (I live in a country where they do not like putting everybody on ADs). I am planning on seeing one of the specialists that put these articles out to get that final bit of reassurance about my specific case (I would have to drive 300km for that, sounds crazy, I know). I do fear that the SSRIs would make it hard to concentrate/study, but I actually responded pretty well to them when I first took them. I also always saw my OCD as my gift in business, so I'm kinda scared that the meds would make me ""less obsessed"" about my business.

This was longer than I initially thought, but if you made it through that wall of text: Thank you!",03Jan2020,1

163,"Hi !  I've been tip toeing around the idea of writing here for a long while, so here i go. Might be a long post (EDIT : it is. he last 3 bullet points are about my situation atm if you want to skip ! )

I'm a 23 yo, and I'm since quite a long time now facing a huge wave (or waves) of changes. I'm in this transitional state where the things I had to quit have been left behind, but i'm still not feeling able to take any decisions. My brain is like a slow hamster wheel, kind of under control in terms of speed, but going round and round in terms of problem solving. i'm going to try to recap the facts + feels.

First of all, I started studying very young, I was 17, freshly out of high school. I started studying arts and fashion design in Paris, in the best schools out there, as it was my secret dream since I was 12. And it was hard, as it's supposed to be. my mental health wasn't great but it was much better in a way than what it was before I turned 18, and I was trying to grow as a person and overcome the obstacles that come up when you want to study fashion and are insecure. And then, two years in, I started to actually study fashion design, and everything started to take a bad turn. The teachers, in this famous uni, that required a very long and tough contest to get in, were the worse. I won't go into details because it's still quite traumatic for me, but let's say their methods of pedagogy were non existant and they ended up not teaching anything and only criticising the intents. I resisted 2 years, and in the middle of the 2nd year I had a big burnout, and stared at the ceiling for 2 months, unable to feel anything. During this time, I was extremely peaceful and quiet ; just before I broke down, I realised I couldn't do it anymore, and that I actually didn't want to DO it anymore. I took me 4 years to realise it, and 1 more to accept to let go of this path.

That takes us to me, stubborn as a donkey, doing an exchange program the next year (last year) to still study fashion but in another school. Usually you do a semester abroad, then you go back to your school to do your last 3 semesters and be graduated. It didn't work that way ; I was extremely weak and depressed, spent most of my days crying and having to take 3 hours long naps in the middle of the day (the hormones + the body don't deal well with acute stress). The main problem to me was that if I left my studies right there and then, what would I do ? I was learning the language of the country, having absolutely no hopes or dreams or desires about anything, struggling to feel anything but fear and tremendous loss. I had moved to another country, where I had friends and I felt good in, but couldn't see myself settle there without a plan. And going back to Paris in this university was at that point completely impossible. As I was navigating that I stupidly didn't seek help and I was really really low.

I wrote my master's thesis, because I was really passionate about it, and I loved writing it. I had to go back to France in June to present it, and I had made the decision to ask for a gap year so that I could take time to think. The presentation of the thesis went good, but the rest of the contact with my uni was a disaster. Picture a fight between middle schoolers, and you'll have an idea of what it felt like. It's just heartbreaking to communicate and never be listened to or taken in consideration, even in a class of 10 students. I felt like I was going to crumble down again, so after a lot of debates with myself and friends I just quit the uni cold turkey. That means, I don't have any diploma from the 5 years I studied.

I stayed in Germany because I felt better there than in France. This year I took a job in retail (ain't fun but at least my head is above the water), I'm continuing to learn german and I'm doing a Yoga teacher training, something i've been wanting to do for 5 years, and it feels nice to learn things. But here's the sticky part. My mental health is still quite bad, I'm able to have longer periods where i'm not completely not ok, but when I'm not ok I think it's to the level where I should take medications. The problem is I still cannot really feel positive emotions, I can dissociate for quite long periods of time, and I can't seem able to take any decisions. Let me bullet point it out :

\- I have to decide what I'm going to study for next year or the year after, to have some sort of a professional project. Lately i've felt a pull towards osteopathy or somatic practices, and it feels really good to have something I can think about and not just nothing as it was until then. But when I look at the studies, I would have to go back to France for 5 years, and I have people I love there but so many things that are for me really traumatic : the language, the mentality, the fact that you need some money to just get by in Paris (where i'd study).

\- there comes the 2nd choice, the geography of things : I really like Berlin but I feel completely unable to settle down here and enjoy the present moment because I feel like the city doesn't carry a future for me in terms of studying (I would need to master the language, which I can do, but I don't want to realise half way there that I actually don't want to live in Germany) (living abroad is so loaded, even if i'm m aware it's such a privilege for me to have the choice). Paris hurt me a lot, the mindset of the city and the political climate are very tough, but some of my closest friends are there and ready to welcome me back there. I could study there but I'm not sure I could find peace and grounding. My bonds with my friends from France are changing and getting a little looser, and i don't feel safe to explore and build my life here and now in Berlin.

\- and in the end it's this whole identity crisis that comes up : if I can't seem to know where I want to be and what I want to do, how can I make choices ? If i'm always a foot out the door in terms of everything in Berlin or in Paris, how can I be alive ?  My mom just told me it's symptomatic for me to feel lost, and that i won't ever feel ok with any thing because it's me (that was nice). I try to take all of the things i've learned in the past 20 years, to remain present and to breathe and to give me time, bu i'm really scared to never find this feeling of home and belonging somewhere, in any language, in any studies. I really want to be able to make decisions and trust what they have for me, but I need to make them first and I am completely and utterly lost. It's like I've jumped and I am floating, waiting to see an appealing place to land but I can't see anything, it's all foggy, so I keep floating. I can't think of having feelings for someone, or something, because it might leave me or i might leave it.

Anywayyy this is my messy brain at the moment. I'm quite sad. It's getting slowly better, but I'm really not grounded. Does anyone have a similar experience ? How'd you get out of it ? What is home for you ?

thank you for reading this novel haha

164,"The book is called ""Dappled Psychiatric"" and it's about a somewhat self-absorbed psychiatrist who admits three patients to the hospital. Over the course of several days, you get to know the patients while learning that the psychiatrist may lose his job and his family. I just published it on Amazon.

Why did I write it?  In 2012, after a 33+ year successful career in health care administration and consulting, I was suddenly and unexpectedly fired from my position as Director of Behavioral Health Services. In addition to the trauma of being fired for the first time in my life, I grieved for the lost opportunity to contribute to circumstances I think were suboptimal for psychiatrists, staff, patients and organization. While I was empathetic for the psychiatrists who had made substantial sacrifices to achieve their professional status, I felt the greatest angst for the adolescent and young adult patients with situational dysfunctions who found themselves locked on a mixed unit with psychotic, severely depressed, demented or other seriously mentally ill adults and elderly. Part of my job was to meet each newly admitted patient and then visit them periodically. My job was to orient them to the unit and address concerns they might have. I'd come home at night and tell my wife that I had never cried so much in my life. Anyway, I've spent more than four years, substantial emotional capital and several thousand dollars (on writing courses, copyediting, cover design and interior layout) to birth this catharsis/novel.

I have the urge every few months once I make any profile on any social media or anything to just delete it and go back into hiding. I have a facebook but I never use it, I deleted my twitter and all my tumblrs ages ago, and life is generally better without too much social media anyway, but there are times when I feel like I want to turn to people on the internet, especially when it comes to mental health...because I get tired of bothering my friends and family...

I'm always watching what I say and I'm CONSTANTLY worried about saying the wrong thing and even when I know there may not have been a right or wrong thing to say in any given moment, I'm usually pretty sure I said something wrong anyway.

First off, I just want to get all of this off my chest. Thank you for reading! If there were no stigma or judgement, I would scream all of this to people who tried to invalidate me. Appearing to have my crap together on the outside does not mean I am not hurting inside.

I am tired of being told that my life is easy, nothing bad happened to me, everybody has bad things also, etc. When I seek support and validation, I am not looking to invalidate others' struggles or compare myself to start a misery competition. I completely understand that I am very fortunate to be at my current position; a lot could've gone wrong. I respect everybody's battles, and I wish for everyone to keep healing.

Here is my journey, thank you again for reading.

At 2, my sister was born. While I love my sister and never resented her, all family, friends, and acquaintances favored her over me (to be fair, I was an ugly kid, and she was really adorable). Nobody heard me.

At 3, I still struggled to speak properly. I had speech problems, and I had a hard time expressing myself verbally.

At 4, I was raped repeatedly over the course of a few weeks by the school janitor. After being sodomized by a mop, I get pushed down to urine and then get hosed off. When I return to the classroom, my teacher scolded me for using the bathroom for took long and playing with water. The school finally figured out what went on and did nothing. Nobody stood up for me. Nobody heard me. Since then, I had a stutter that I could not get rid of until my late teens.

At 5, I learned to skin pick my buttocks, so blood would continue to appear on my underwear.

From 5 to 8, I was constantly blamed and berated by my aunt for troubles her children caused and I was in no part of. Nobody stood up for me. Nobody heard me.

From 6 to 12, my parents took turns getting sick and checking in and out of hospitals. One time, my parents were away for almost a year for treatment abroad because they could not afford healthcare in the states. Nobody heard me.

At 7, I was the target of my 2nd grade teacher's constant bullying. I had the second highest grade in the class. Yet, that was not good enough for her. She singles me out and berates me for the entire school year in front of everyone for every little thing. No one heard me.

At 8, I moved to the states. A few kids in the classroom offered to ""help me transition"" in front of the teacher, and then proceed to emotionally and physically abuse and bully me behind the teacher. Nobody stood up for me. Nobody heard me. I did not know how to speak English.

From 8, my uncle, whose family sponsored us to emigrate, was terribly verbally abuse towards me for existing and causing ""problems"" in his family. He loved my sister, but hated me. Nobody stood up for me. Nobody heard me.

From 9, I learned to skin pick my genitals. It feels better than picking my buttocks, when I needed to feel better.

From 9 to 13, we were told to stay quiet in the house and not go outside while my mom works, or else our semi-racist neighbor might call child protective service. We were not well off. Sometimes, my mom showed up with food that she scavenge from restaurant garbage and were just thrown out.

From 9 to 15, I had two friends, who repeatedly stood me up for other plans. I offered kindness to others and sought friendship, only to receive manipulation and emotional abuse.

At 10, my mom had a house keeping job. My sister and I went to help wash strangers' toilets and underwear. I watch these strangers, who paid her minimum wage, berate my mom in front of me, and I could not do anything.

At 10, I ran the household, paid bills, made calls, and make sure everything is up-to-date. My parents tired their best, but both of them were rarely both home due to work and time at hospital and spoke very little English. Nobody heard me.

At 10, my PE teacher berated me in front of the entire locker room for ""attacking"" my classmate. My classmate just wanted me to feel his ""six-pack."" Nobody stood up for me. Nobody heard me.

From 10, I learned to skin pick my scalp. This feels good as well.

At 11, I constantly did not have enough food for lunch. I walked around and asked my classmates for their leftovers. I did not want to tell my parents that I was hungry. They tried their best.

At 12, we finally have healthcare. No more lining up for clinics or going to unlicensed doctors for treatment.

At 15, I discovered the guitar, and had been obsessed with getting better at this instrument every since. Music is my refuge from the turbulence inside my head and my loneliness.

At 16, I finally have my first group of real friends. I felt inadequate. While I loved them to death, I always felt like they were just letting this underprivileged kid tag along.

At 18, I got into the university of my choice on almost a full scholarship. I was told that I will not succeed.

From 19, I started to abuse alcohol. It was not hard for me to go through bottles of wine or 6-packs when I wanted to cope with negative feelings.

From 19, I learned that seeking validation reduces my fear of rejection. I work my ass off academically, socially, and in extra-curricular activities to maximize opportunities of being validated by others. Because of my thirst for validation, I go out of my way to please others. I don't want anybody to have anything negative to say about me anymore. My stutter went away, and I was finally confident about myself. My classmates said I was lucky to be even at school and I did not deserve to be successful academically. They said that my underprivileged background did not matter and was only used to seek pity.

From 21 to 27, I was constantly on the receiving end of then-girlfriend (now wife)'s anger, rage, and emotional abuse due to her (most likely misdiagnosed) depression. My fear of abandonment and thoughts of self-harm and suicide worsen. I love her. When we were not hurting, she made me a better person. I will not leave her, and we will heal together.

At 21, I graduated summa cum laude in electrical engineering and received an award from the school chancellor for community service. I had no school debt. People said I was ""lucky.""

At 21, I bought my first car, but my parents decided for me. It was not my choice.

At 22, I bought my first house, but not by choice. Grandma got kicked out of my aunt's house and needed a place to stay. My parents told me to buy a house for tax benefits and ""save money."" I did not want to buy a house.

At 24, I completed my Master's degree while working full-time. My friends said I would die trying to work and go to school. I did not have to pay a cent for this degree.

At 25, I started a new job at a tech company. I was called ""stupid"" by my colleagues behind my back because I was new to the industry.

At 26, I received my first patent. I was one of the group's best circuit designers.

At 29, I bought my second house with my then-girlfriend. We finally have a stable home. My wife's mental health crumbled shortly after.

At 29, my then-girlfriend (now wife) was diagnosed with schizophrenia. My home life has been turbulent since then, and I was constantly put on the edge. I was constantly on the receiving end of her psychotic episodes. The voices in her head makes her angry, sad, or lose all feelings. She always wants to run away, leave me, or hurt herself. She can be a different person by the hour. When I sought support, people said I was fishing for sympathy behind my back. I need to keep everything together, for her sake.

At 31, I married my wife. I love her, and we will heal together. I will never leave her alone.

At 31, my wife relapsed and quit her job without any warning. For a few months, my days were spent caring for her and being on receiving end of her worst psychotic rages.

At 31, I received my tenth patent. Nobody questions my abilities as an engineer.

At 32, my suicide ideation worsens due to relationship conflicts and stresses from care giving. Everyday, I wanted to walk in front of a train or truck or jump off a building.

At 32, I was diagnosed with BPD. I stop drinking. I am starting DBT. I hope to heal and make amends with the people I care about. I am finally understanding the importance of taking care of myself. After healing, I vow to dedicate my life to become a mental wellness advocate. I will do my best to make sure everyone is heard and supported.",03Jan2020,2

Whenever the slightest thing happens no matter how insignificant or small, I read into it massively and end up upsetting myself. Whenever something happens, there's always this little voice in my head that starts to tell me negative stuff. I basically have an argument with this irrational voice, trying to reassure myself and tell it it's wrong. But I rarely win these arguments. It causes me unnecessary pain to myself and others and I'm worried I'm going to push the people I love away. This stuff has already caused my friends to become annoyed with it but I talk to them and they understand, but I hate that this affects them. Is there something wrong with me?",03Jan2020,1
177,"So I was going home from work and I had to drop by the nearby supermarket. I stopped for a second in front of it. I saw a guy coming towards me. He had a very questionable behaviour. He looked like he was under the influence of something. I got of the bench and went closer to the store hoping he'd stop or keep walking past me. He didn't. I went into the store, he went in as well. I walked past the checkout and he was nearby me, staring at me. I literally darted to my home while he was in the store with security behind him. The security probably noticed that I was being scared shitless and he was walking really close to him. I'm at home safe and sound but holy fuck I'm even scared to get out of my block. It was around 9 pm. I got home and literally broke down while explaining to my bf what happened. CAN A WOMAN GO TO THE FUCKING STORE WITHOUT FEELING LIKE PREY?! FFS!",03Jan2020,2
178,"I don’t know if this is the right place to post, but im going to try anyway... i’ve been depressed since i was about 12 years old, it was always pretty manageable, meaning i didn’t feel many physical side effects of it, aside from feeling really really sad all the time.

however that changed a couple years ago, around 2017, i started a new job that really brought me down and i started having physical effects manifest from my depression the main symptoms being that i felt numb to my emotions and extremely tired all the time. 

flash forward to now, i’ll be 28 this year, i still suffer from depression. i still am extremely exhausted all the time but i think a lot of it is due to a variety of health problems that make day to day life more difficult as well as a new job that i started last year that takes all of my time and makes me feel like i have nothing outside of work (however my management is a billion times better than previously.)  but i am noticing that i am less numb to my emotions and that some parts of myself seem to be healing. 

one thing that i lost when i started feeling my depression more was my confidence... i’ve never been a really confident woman, i’ve never liked myself that much, but when i was a teenager, i still had an audacity that i seem to lack now as an adult. i thought a lot less about my actions, which, usually is a bad thing, but in my case would be great because i overthink EVERYTHING. 

so i’m wondering if anyone has any tips on how to work on this? do you have anything that you do to feel more confident? is therapy the only way? 

also a little background on me, im super shy and introverted, only have a handful of friends and a boyfriend whom i live with. i was homeschooled my entire life and although i don’t lack *most* social skills, i severely question most of my ability to talk to people. 


tl;dr i have depression, it killed my confidence, how do i fix this problem?",03Jan2020,2
180,"My best friend (23M) who's technically my (20F) ex, we have a bit of an odd relationship) has had many many mental health issues in the past. there was a period of several months last year were he was at what seemed like an all time low, and I tried my best to be there for him both physically and emotionally as much as possible. He was (and still is) going to a therapist, and seemed to gradually get better. I haven't known him that long (less than a year) but it just felt like he was feeling great. We even had conversations about how great its been now that he's not like that anymore. 

We're both at our families homes for winter break (both college students), an he just messaged me saying that after he finishes some of his work he's planning on suicide. He seems FIRM in this decision, saying that I can't convince him not to, that he just needs to finish his book, and he's started drafting a letter. Most of this seems to be stemming from his shitty relationship with his mother, who from what I understand doesn't take his mental health very seriously. He says he needs to hurt her the way she's been hurting him. He can't really cut her out of his life as she provides financially for him. 

I feel like I'm at my wits end, or that I'm in a nightmare I can't wake up from. I don't know when the next time I'm gonna get to see him is, and I really don't know what to do anymore except... call the cops? but he's not gonna try anything for another few weeks at least so idk about that. I think if I got him hospitalized he would hate me, but that's better than the alternative so... I guess I'm just stuck now. He said he'd talk to his therapist and then ""let him know he won't be needing his services anymore"" so I'm hoping he'll be able to do something I couldn't. 

The other thing I'm worried about, which is the last thing on my mind but still there, is that when he was like this before that was the lowest point in my own life.

184,"Hello all,

I am not sure if this belongs here or if it even is a mental health issue. For most of my life I would be described as being a major introvert who lacks confidence and everything. This caused me to be alone without friends for basically all my life. The last few years have been increasingly worse due to exams and stuff. During this difficult time, I heard a voice 2 years ago, a few months before my IGCSE exams, he told me to let him handle everything. Afterwards, I suddenly became more social, confident and my grades improved. My parents were happy with this change in my personality and I was as well. 

However, this is when things became bad. The voice in my head became more dominant compared to my own thoughts and I felt that it was more than a fragment of my imagination. Whenever I disagreed with him, I could feel my confidence fading and the old me coming back and I start to get headaches and anxiety. I decided to confront this voice and met him in mu dreams. It was another me but more charismatic. Unlike me, he did not stutter and he spoke clearly and confidently. I thought he was an imagination, but he insisted he was not and told me he was my “deeper subconscious mind”. I’m honestly freaked out, I don’t know how to confront this. Even writing this now, he knows that I am doing this and he says he doesn’t care about the keyboard warriors of the internet. I don’t know how to confront this, I don’t know if he is created to satisfy my loneliness. I don’t know if I am even in control of myself to be honest.",03Jan2020,1

Hi there! 

To keep it brief my parents packed my bags and dropped me off at my uncle and aunts house for being “untolerable”

But, wait, wait how did we get here??

My parents genuinely hate me, they voice it all the time. We fight a ton, which of course I factor into. But, my parents blame it all on me, saying how much I ruin their lives. 

I want their love, I want their respect and I want to be back at home. I sent a long list of how and why I want to improve in details and sent it to them, but of course I get a long paragraph how it’s unfair for me to ask when I’m coming home. 

My argument is that it’s my life too, and them being not transparent causes me stress and makes my quality of life bad when I’m trying to get better by going to therapy twice a week where they don’t really seem to want their own daughter.

I love them, but they are making me so stressed and upset.",03Jan2020,7

Not only that I want some good to come from it in his memory. So I guess my question is, how do I start down this road of turning my big adventure into a fundraiser that’s worthy of his memory?

I have thought my best friend who I live with was trying to take over me and he was possessed. I've thought people wouldn't stop looking at me and licking there lips in this really creepy, suggestive way - as if they were craving to take over or kill me. I've thought police were after me, and had no reason to be worried if they would talk to me. I've had a really horrible dark past 2 - 3 months.
To add a bit more information, I do have a past that includes a fair amount of psychedelic drug use - I understand I may have brought this on myself and I can live with that, and I have learnt my lesson albeit too late. The very first time I had an intense paranoia experience I was on a lot of a psychedelic research chemical called '2-CB' some of you might be aware of.

204,"i was pressured into sex.

months ago, near the beginning of the year, i was pressured into sex by my girlfriend. i had been with my girlfriend for over a year, and it had come with a lot of difficulties (as many relationships do) ranging from struggles with my sexuality (i am a bisexual male), my loyalty (i had never cheated, never flirted with anyone else or anything along those lines) which began to make it clear that the relationship was toxic. 

nearing the end of the relationship, she was over at my place, and we were just watching a film on the sofa, when she started to initiate. i wasn’t in the mood, i was stressed with school, tired, and hungry. i wasn’t in the mood for it. i pushed her away multiple times and stalled, before she got mad. she began to spout nonsense about how i was a “queer”, how i didn’t want her because i had lost interest, etc. when neither was the reason why, i just wasn’t in the mood. 

i caved in and just gave her what she wanted, i was too afraid of an argument, and i just wanted to avoid conflict. i gave head and we had sex, without protection. i felt horrible. 

this acted as the turning point in the relationship and it ended a few weeks later. i am now with someone else who i am very happy with, and i have been with for a few months now. it is a much more stable, happy, and mature relationship, and she is accepting of both my friends and my sexuality. she is aware of what happened between me and my ex. 

it would all be fine if i didn’t still struggle to this day. i have recurring nightmares of the event, normally getting a repeat of the event whilst i sleep more than 5 nights per week. i don’t know how to stop it. i dread speaking out about it to my family, my friends, or a doctor, due to the fact that 1 i am a man so it’ll be less likely that it’ll be taken seriously 2 i never said no, clearly. in addition most of my family is christian and would be angry that i did this at such a young age. my girlfriend knows about the nightmares and tries to help, but it doesn’t work.

207,"26F. Poly curious. Anxiety. Depression. ADD. 

Though I have dealt with anxiety all my life, I was recently diagnosed with depression and ADD, probably within the last year or so. They are still pretty new to me, and I am taking it day by day. 

My memory has been greatly and probably the most affected. Sometimes I can barely leave the house, or my bed. My appetite isn't nearly what is used to be. And I feel like I am stoned more often than I am not. Sometimes I cant even take my pills or do my night or morning routine. 

I have been steadily trying to dig deeper into myself. Pick my own brain.
 
Along with trying to heal some inner child trauma, I have been trying to heal traumas from my adult life, which include abusive relationships, my mental issues and my health issues. I think my inner trauma stems from my dad being a pos and having separation anxiety at a young age. 
For some reason I had a puke phobia growing up most of my life as well. Sometimes I feel like I hear things that aren't there. 

I think my inner child trauma stems from my mostly absent dad and the separation anxiety I dealt with when my mom got a new job. I also was shaded from my dads other life which included a child with another woman. 
In all my relationships my insecurities have shown. But I have also been cheated on, and abused. Mentally and physically. I dont think I have been with the right people and have now learned what I mostly desire in a partner. I need reassurance and I like attention. 

In one of my relationships, an explicit sexual video was taken of me without my consent and shared. That has scarred me for the past couple years. I am still trying to work through that. 
But that has opened up a door to explore my own sexuality. I have an onlyfans that is quite popular and have done cam work. Have also done escorting. 

I have also been poly curious. Doing a ton of reading on that and exploring it from all different ends. Trying to figure out if I can even succeed in a relationship. 

My therapist passed away in November. I am still really struggling with it. Her and I had such a special connection. I had major (what I think) are disassociating episodes and was more depressed. I had my meds up and we stopped the start of an ADD med. 

Sometimes I feel like if I spoke how I really feel, I would be put away. 

Side note, anyone know any good supplements?
If anyone is into astrology, I am a sagittarius sun, aries moon, and virgo rising. With my mercury and venus both in scorpio.

I know it's fucking stupid and crazy, but yet this thought scares me a lot.
Any advice?",03Jan2020,1
209,"I just feel like I need to get today off my chest. Christ, I can barely see my screen through my tears. Two major things happened today, and I just can’t ever remember feeling this awful.
1) This morning, at the job that I absolutely detest, that I struggle to get myself out of bed in the mornings for, I was attacked. I work in care and I know this happens, but today it was bad. I ended up stood in the bathroom, staring in the mirror and trying not to cry while blood poured out of my mouth. I’m a young woman, and I was attacked by a grown man. It isn’t the first time it’s happened, not even the first time in the last month, but today it was particularly bad. I got into the office, I sat down and just broke down in tears. I told my boss that I hate my job and that I struggle going to work every day. Now I feel week for crying in front of my boss
2) I finished work and went to visit my grandad who I’m very close to. He’s in hospital currently for the third time over the past few weeks. My nana, putting on a brave face, said he kept getting chest infections. Today when I was visiting him, a hospice nurse arrived and my nana broke down and told me that my grandad has lung cancer. This was just the final straw today. I managed to keep a brave face for my grandparents, but to know that my grandad is seriously ill, to see my nana so fragile and broken and afraid.. 
I got home and just cried, and I haven’t stopped crying since. I know nothing anyone can say will change things, but some positivity would be really appreciated right now ❤️
Thank you for taking the time to read this long post 😞",03Jan2020,13
210,"So, through high school I was seeing this girl. It was good for a time but things went bad. To cut a long story short, she used to mentally abuse me, physically hurt me, cheated on me, anything you can thinking to bring me down to a point where I felt like I was worthless to everyone. My father had left me, my mother had left with her husband, my auntie couldn't deal with me, and my grandmother ended up having to put up with me. This has affected me so much in recent years, keeping it locked up in the back of my mind trying to keep positive. Recently I've gotten a new girlfriend, (somehow) and she is the greatest person in the world, but my issues etc keep getting in the way, I feel like I'm going to lose her. We talked and she says she is here for me but she has her own problems with out me burdening her. 
What do I do? What is the point?",03Jan2020,1
211,Lately I've been having more excessive thoughts of worry and when I feel like I'm not worried anymore I feel like my head and parts of my body starts feeling physically strained making me scared to sleep. What should I do? I have an appointment scheduled so I recently have just been dreading rather or not that will actually get my mind straight. Any tips to help me sleep as well would be appreciated just seriously feel like something bad would happen if I didn't open up about it.,03Jan2020,1
212,4 years of this. I'm sick of losing job after job because of my mental health. I heard applying for disability is hard. But I can't do this anymore,03Jan2020,12
213,I have people telling me to stop faking being depressed and having issues when I’m not at all. They just don’t understand my issues because I don’t talk about them. It makes me feel even worse that people close to me think I’m lying and make fun of me to other people,03Jan2020,1
