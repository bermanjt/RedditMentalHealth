1,"Strongly associating places with bad memories and finding it hard to de-associate them, help?

Is this some sort of trauma or something?

My mental health has been better over the past 2 ish months than it has been since November. I‚Äôve been pretty happy, felt mostly light, carefree, etc., even with a pandemic and political chaos going on. 

I thought about the reason and I think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm away from my college campus. I love my college campus. It‚Äôs beautiful, I have a lot of friends there, I like my classes and my professors, I feel at home there. 

But that‚Äôs where my ex and his friends are. To give further backstory, I‚Äôm 21 (F). I grew up with social anxiety disorder and not having very good self esteem at all. When I came to this college at 20, I had never been in a relationship before. I met this guy and we hit it off and began dating. I don‚Äôt want to go into details because it would take me forever but basically I really liked him and fell for him and he was still hung up on his ex and used me as a rebound while stringing me along, making me feel bad for telling my best friend we had sex, doing the on again/off again thing repeatedly, and just making me feel like I had to walk on eggshells to not mess anything up to stay with him. 

In the end, he said he wanted a break to see if he wanted to be single or not but my best friend found him on tinder. I called him out about it and he ended things.

I was, of course, really hurt and sad for a while, A few months, as it was my first relationship and I was invested. I‚Äôm over it now. But when I think about going back to the campus and seeing him or his friends (who I know talked shit about me), it makes me feel weird. Bad. 

I strongly associate places with the things that have happened there, but usually only the bad things, and it is very hard for me to unassociate those places from those events. 

I want to love being on my campus and around the places where unfortunate things happened. I don‚Äôt want them to feel tainted by things that hurt me months ago. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs some type of trauma because it did hurt me but it feels silly to call it trauma over something that isn‚Äôt like abuse or something.

3,I F(18) am getting ready to go to uni in September (provided I get the get the grades) and the closer it gets the more daunting and upsetting I find this. Generally I‚Äôm hypersensitive and cry and break down easily due to my anxiety which I don‚Äôt think is abnormal. Maybe it‚Äôs because school just stopped with no proper goodbye to that part of my childhood...but I don‚Äôt feel like an adult yet; I don‚Äôt feel ready to move on and leave everything I know behind. I know I need to do it and it‚Äôs the best thing for me but I know I‚Äôm also going to be even more emotional than I am now.,27Jul2020,1
4,Where is the line between anxiety and being paranoid. I consistently have a fear of being followed and feel as though it is happening at times. I also worry people talking about me and I feel like I can‚Äôt trust that they most likely aren‚Äôt.

6,"I've been depressed for years now. Like most guys I've been told one way or another I need to be tough and ""suck it up"", but when I was in ninth grade I tried to reach out to my mom, telling her the reason my grades had been dropping and I was watching so much youtube was because I was lonely, sad and since I could only go outside to play with kids my age in very rare occasions (I can probably count the times I was allowed to play outside with my fingers) I had no one to talk to, so at least the guys on the other side of the screen made me feel like I was not entirely alone... Well I wasn't allowed to watch youtube for the rest of the day, I was told that I wasn't sad, that I was just lazy and I had to shape up. 

I was always the best at school, but not because I was somehow the smartest in the whole school, but because of the overwhelming pressure my mom put on me, she basically scarred me as a kid, sometimes I would flinch and get scared, waiting for her to yell at me and then she would do so, saying ""I don't hit you! Stop getting scared!"" And that didn't help much. My dad would shame me for not having a girlfriend (and so did many people), and the fact that I couldn't ask anyone about the doubts I had with my sexuality, because virtually everyone I know is homophobic, just made it all worse. Everytime I would show any sign of being depressed, of being sad, of self doubt, it would either be brushed away or just met with ""man up"", with my dad telling me similar things for years, and he sees me as an adult and a man already, even though I'm just 17.

I feel like my feeling don't matter, and that no one will be there for me, even though I have a best friend who is literally the best, and has actually been there for me since I was four and whom I love, I still have a hard time opening up to her in some things since my head just gets filled with thoughts like ""you're just bothering her"" ""She has her own problems, she doesn't need yours on top of that"" all whole I have no problem listening about other's problems and almost feel the need to put them before mine, since it feels like mine don't matter, which led to two very toxic romantic relationships (and the fact those two have been the only ones to ever like makes me feel worse, as if I can't be loved by someone non toxic.)

I don't expect much from this, I just needed to put all fo this out there, and omg writing this was so much harder than I thought. I wish a good day to anyone that reads this!",27Jul2020,1
7,"aka addressing my problems for temporary relief but don‚Äôt actually solve them. To trim down my own problems, like when I confront them and recognize them. I organize them in my mind, step back, and look at them. Doing this gives me comfort; a reprieve from a build up of stress. I feel like I have some sort of control, to be able to analyze my own issues at least semi objectively. But I‚Äôm only addressing them, not solving them. The ‚ÄúRAGING BULL‚Äù is still there. Shaved but not gone. The comfort is only temporary, by doing this unproductive ritual I give myself just enough relief to be able to live a little more comfortably for a while (wearing its fur to sleep) but eventually the bull will grow its fur back and I will be back to square one.

I relived the past and all the bad things that came with that. The panic attacks and the abuse. All of it. A 4 hour attack ensued.

Now I thought that was an outlier but ever since then every time I try to go to bed I wack up and panic. I have to do a breathing exercise and take a sleeping pill to go to bed.

16,"Today I made so many mistakes and I feel so incredibly guiltyAnd useless I don‚Äôt know how to apologise to my boyfriend without upsetting home more than I probably already have. 

First mistake I left my work alarm on even though I wasn‚Äôt working and woke us both up at 5am. He went back to sleep pretty quickly but I know he was tired when I last saw him because of this. 

Then my boyfriend offered to drive me home from an appointment as my car is being serviced. It took him a long while to convince me since I felt really guilty about making him late for work. I ended up getting lost because my google maps took me down the wrong road (I was walking to where my boyfriend was parked) and I started to panic that I‚Äôd make my boyfriend late. 

He called me to ask where I was and I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry my maps got me lost and I‚Äôm confused about where I am just go to work and I‚Äôll get myself home.‚Äù He was calm about explaining that it was fine and he‚Äôd wait as I was closer to him than I thought. 

Then when he dropped me home I realised I left my bag in his car. I told him that I‚Äôd pick it up once he finished work and he told me that he was going to take it into work with him so it didn‚Äôt get stolen. I told him I was sorry that I forgot it and he didn‚Äôt respond which I get because he‚Äôs at work. 

I just feel like I‚Äôve made too many mistakes today and it isn‚Äôt even lunch yet. I feel like my boyfriends probably pretty mad at me and I don‚Äôt blame him for that. I just wanna curl up in bed and cry honestly and that makes me feel even more useless and guilty because what the fuck do I have to cry about.

I‚Äôve built things with a company while having done immoral things in the past that they presumably are not fully aware of that stain my relation with them, cause issues that seemingly occur at random that they have not connected to my past actions. I did immoral things in the past and grew with a platform and developed a strong connection to it in many aspects and changed as a person.

I‚Äôve also lived in a Biblical illiteracy evangelical enviroment and world view for most of my live, being baptised at 12 or so and later in live having more of a revelation and in that aspect I guess loosing some meaning. 

I also experience same sex attraction which in my situation becomes a pretty major failure, with my families religion taken into context and how I would feel responsible to not ruin their lives through doing what they would perceive as something essentially giving me a sentence of eternal torture, in some ways there it would probably be preferable for them to have me dead perceived in heaven, rather than a future resulting in a perceived hell.

when i was in like 7th grade dealing with bad anxiety and incoming depression(f/i was like 12/13) if my brother(age 4) got mad at me he would describe in dark detail how he would i guess murder me. he would always threaten me and try to attack me but for some reason i thought he was serious.

so i would lock my door and keep something sharp next to my bed, i would tel my parents and they would be like ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs just how he is‚Äù, and if my brother was mad and i was in the same room as him, doesn‚Äôt matter if he spilled water and i had nothing to do with it i knew he was going to attack me so i would try to stay silent or go into a diff room quickly, he has anxiety but he doesn‚Äôt have anything else.

he also had some medical issues i remember once i was on the ground and he was choking me and i started to feel kinda tired and it got kinda hard to see, i knew if i kicked him off me my parents would yell at me (he has breathing issues and i would have to kick his stomach to get him off of me) but if i didn‚Äôt i was scared i would die. so i kicked him off and prepared myself to get kinda yelled at, we both got yelled at and when i told them it felt like i was going to die they kinda laughed and said we were just playing.

don‚Äôt get me wrong my parents are great people i think it‚Äôs just they didn‚Äôt think i was serious especially since i was so young.

now when ever i am around my brother i flinch and if he gets within a foot of me i either punch him because i‚Äôm afraid he will hit me first, or i go to another room and wait for him to go back to his room, i don‚Äôt stand up for myself around him cause i know it‚Äôs gonna end with me in bruises or blood so.

he hasn‚Äôt actually severally hurt me just bruises, cuts, he shot a nerf gun into my eye, elbowed my eye, both on purpose, i couldn‚Äôt see for about 5 minutes, but that‚Äôs really it

i‚Äôm scared because i haven‚Äôt came out to my mom because she‚Äôs biphobic, but then i wonder why im even sad about that she still cares about me right now why even care? when i came out to my dad he didn‚Äôt get it bc we both grew up in a heteronormative setting. he suggested to not tell her but i can‚Äôt just do that.

nothing feels real because i just finished bojack horseman and i even posted to the subreddit being like ‚Äúi thought all my problems would be gone when i finished, but they‚Äôre not. and i think im okay with that right now‚Äù but in reality im not. it was the only thing keeping me going for so long but now i just don‚Äôt know what to do. nothing feels real at all. the ending was realistic and i think that‚Äôs why im having a breakdown right now because i can‚Äôt handle the fact that recovery takes time.

i struggle with my body and never want to eat or constantly want to overeat. i was scrolling through tiktok and saw a video saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre beautiful, you deserve to eat, etc‚Äù and it hit way too hard and i think i broke a little. the fact that that made me sob concerned me. the fact that i can be feeling myself and then go straight to wanting to ~not exist~ scares me. not that i have suicidal thoughts, i literally just don‚Äôt want to be on the face of the earth. i told my mother and her fianc√© today that i gave up on losing weight because there was no point, and neither of them were concerned with the fact that i might start overeating or under-eating. they literally didn‚Äôt care ‚ù§Ô∏è

i know what‚Äôs happening but i have no idea what recovery means in a v strong sense. i understand what recovery is, of course, but i have been in this slump for almost a year and i just don‚Äôt know what to do. 

i have so many things I think about all at once when i break down, including what i said above ^ and it gets so overwhelming and i get so shaky and i just can‚Äôt even describe how horrifying it is.

and I have a therapist but i can never get into ANY of these subjects in any amount of detail. then when i go to my mother, who works w/ this therapist, she‚Äôs like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre their favourite client‚Äù ‚Äúyou wanna get rid of them?‚Äù

and my friends hate being vulnerable and get kinda weird when anything personal is brought up so none of us vent to each other because not only are we all super anxious, we all hate opening up.

so it feels like i have nobody to talk to. besides my dad. we both give each other advice but we both still get back into a slump and get super depressed and neither of us are really in a state to give advice but we still do.

but AGAIN i feel like im just picking out negative things because im a young girl in an upper middle class family who gets called pretty all the time and talented all the time even if on the inside nobody sees how much i literally hate myself even thought i SHOULDNT hate myself because i don‚Äôt have it bad.

imagine you have a bucket. you are half way up a mountain you have climbed. the way up was hard. you are tired, exhausted, and thirsty. you find a water source, but no matter how hard you want to you, cannot seem to bring yourself to fill the bucket. it is right there, right in front of you. yet you can't seem to do it.

going up the mountain was difficult. you cannot even take a sip of water. you cannot feel better. you are halfway up the mountain. you have worked hard, there is only so much left to reach the top. its so close. all you have to do is push. you are tired, but you have the strength to reach the top. you know that there is enough in you to do it. yet for some reason, you cannot stand up and finish the climb. like the bucket, you just can't do it.

One of my exes and I broke up for more than 2 years. We broke up on good terms and after that we both dated other people. We never contact one another after the breakup.

One of the reasons the internet states is that I didn't grieve over the breakup properly and didn't let it go. So I'm confused because it's nearly 3 years after we broke up.

To start off, I‚Äôm 19 F from England. I have suffered academically my whole life which has caused so many problems for me.  I have great difficulties with following instructions, listening to people, understanding things and I constantly daydream which I can‚Äôt help, I‚Äôve had these issues my whole life.  

It all started when I was 4 and started primary school (elementary school). I also struggled to make friends and was way behind the other kids in terms of my learning development. My Mum saw that something was wrong and tried to get me support but no one listened to her and I was ignored pretty much because I didn‚Äôt have behaviour issues and was a polite and well behaved kid, so The teaches thought nothing was wrong and just said that I needed to listen more. For years and years and even when I started secondary school, my mum was still trying to get me the support but it was just the same old ‚Äúoh she‚Äôs well behaved but needs to get involved more‚Äù or ‚Äúshe has great potential but needs to put more effort in‚Äù no one truly knows how much this frustrated me as I was putting in as much effort as I could but I just had no understanding of things.

My Mum used to think I was on the autistic spectrum but as I‚Äôve got older, this doesn‚Äôt appear to be the case as I only really have 1 or 2 autistic traits, I understand social cues and know what‚Äôs appropriate and I can tell what people are feeling although I do struggle a bit socially but this more due to social anxiety and my low confidence.

When I started College, things were staring to improve a bit as I was able to study a subject that I really enjoy and the only thing I‚Äôm good at which is sport. I did really well on my sport course and loved it but the downside was that I still had to study English and Maths along with it as I failed my GCSE‚Äôs in school. I had to retake my GCSE Maths and English exams last year and failed it again. Because of this, I wasn‚Äôt allowed to move onto the Level 3 sport course as you have to pass your maths and English to go onto it even if you got a good grade for your level 1 and 2 main course. This means that I will never be able to go to university and try and pursue my career that I wanted which was a sport physiotherapist. 

Please believe me when I say, I tried so hard with those Maths and English exams but again I was ignored and wasn‚Äôt given enough help beforehand, which left me always confused in class and I tried to get on with my self but I it‚Äôs just so difficult for me.

I‚Äôve now accepted that I will never have a nice job and will probably just be working at some shop forever or even living on benefits my whole life as I can‚Äôt do anything right.

I do blame my schools/education system for the lack of support but also I‚Äôm blaming myself for just being this way and having these issues and also having anxiety and low confidence which makes matters worse. I‚Äôm never going to be able to do things my friends and others my age are doing like going to Uni, learning to drive and some are even getting their own houses.

Despite all of this, I am generally a happy person and I‚Äôm not depressed or anything, I have a good family and good friends around me. But I‚Äôm worried that this is all gonna change as I get older and I‚Äôm just gonna end up being a loser with no career which means no friends or money. Is it too late for me to make improvements?",27Jul2020,1

40,"I have a friend who has disclosed her mental illness and suicidal thoughts multiple times. On multiple occasions she‚Äôs messaged me saying she was going to kill herself and saying goodbye and I‚Äôll do my best to send supportive words and beg her to be safe. I would never call the police for a wellness check anyways but I don‚Äôt know where she lives so I can‚Äôt call other mental health resources and I do not know her family or friends so I have no way of getting in contact with anyone to check on her. In the following days I will send messages asking her to confirm her safety and well-being which she looks at but never responds to (so my only way of knowing she‚Äôs still alive is her seeing my messages and being online) and then a couple days later she just pretends nothing ever happened. I am not a mental heath professional and have suggested to her that she find a professional to talk to but she insisted therapy doesn‚Äôt work for her and she just needs her friends and family to listen to her and talk her down.

I have dealt with mental health issues in the past and have myself attempted suicide multiple times. I‚Äôm actually doing fairly well right now (which is surprising considering the state of the world rn) and hearing others talk about suicide is pretty triggering to me. I‚Äôve tried to bring this up to her in the past but that just resulted in her telling me I‚Äôm selfish and a bad friend for putting my mental health before hers. 

About a week ago she messaged me with suicidal thoughts and I tried to be supportive while emphasizing that I am not the right person to talk to about this and she lost it. She said she was going to kill herself if I didn‚Äôt respond to her but I genuinely didn‚Äôt know how to respond. I‚Äôve tried checking in with her since then but she hasn‚Äôt responded to any of my messages. She‚Äôs active online so I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôs okay but I have no way of confirming that and she‚Äôs never ignored me for this long before.

50,"This was hard to word in the title.

For what it's worth I am formally diagnosed with and am being successfully treated for BPD and ADHD(including anxiety, depression and an eating disorder within those) and I consider myself bisexual. I generally don't like to talk about these things because 

1. It's no one's business 

2. I don't want them to define me, they're not part of my personality, imo.

I recognise I am privileged in that I am white/cisgender/working class, and I have access to treatment, can afford it, and I am lucky to have found professionals that take me seriously, and that is a kind of privilege.

I understand in extreme cases when it affects your day to day life, it would make sense to tell someone you're trans/identify differently to how you appear, or have something like OCD/ADHD (as an example not just those diagnoses) to help explain why you do something or behave in a certain way.

I guess what I don't understand is why someone whos sexuality isn't relevant/illness doesn't severely impact their day to day life, like you wouldn't know unless they told you, why do some people feel the need to identify themselves with a mental illness/sexuality, and use them like personality traits? I often see people on social media include all their diagnoses/sexuality in their bio, or I've had people tell me within the first few minutes of meeting me that they are x and have x y and z when I wouldn't have known otherwise or didn't need to know. It feels like a lot of people like to use their sexuality/diagnoses like a ""status symbol""? I don't think that's the right word but people seem to buddy up on social media like it's a little club just for people who are x/with x diagnoses and I see why it would help to be a part of a community of like minded people, hell I participate in some communities like that, but I don't understand why people use it like a quirky personality trait or style.

I don't tell anyone about my sexuality/diagnoses unless I'm very close to them and it's somehow relevant, and like I said I don't use them like an identity since it's personal and I want to overcome my mental illness, not embrace it.

So why are others so open about it? Is it a trendy thing/phase that some people go through or a way of destigmatising mental illness? I have these same feelings about using sexuality to define yourself like a personality trait. Why does it matter to the general public when (imo) it should only matter to who you choose to sleep with/have feelings for/ who is important in your life? Is it a way of destigmatising sexuality? I'm all for normalising mental illness and all kinds of sexuality/gender identities but I feel like this goes beyond that a bit.

I'm sorry if I have come off as phobic/discriminatory, I don't have a personal problem with anything described above, I just don't understand it fully. I'd really appreciate another viewpoint as I feel this is beyond just personal preference for some people.",27Jul2020,1

55,"23M here and I do have undiagnosed moderate anxiety and some other issues that I plan on getting treatment for but I wasn't sure how to put this specific trait into words so im describing it as best as I can here so I could hopefully bring it up to a professional in a coherent, and less wordy way.

Ive tried my best to search this up but with nothing relevant coming up I can't tell if this might be linked to anxiety, focus issues or maybe something more physically related but this became highlighted to me on the rare time I would get intoxicated (drinking or smoking), and with that I'd never stay in a steady state of influence. I could have a lot or a little and the buzz of whatever I'm having will constantly wax and wane on me cyclically, like a sin wave sortof, while for others they seem to be on a steady, constant slope where moment to moment their mannerisms and influence match the way they were just a few moments prior. It'll be like this even if im feeling completely calm but I will say being anxious definently makes it more pronounced.

For example I could be a few drinks in with friends and one moment feel a completely tame buzz then a couple minutes later seem quite intoxicated and have my mannerisms change and feel like im running on autopilot, then revert back to feeling stone cold sober before feeling under the influence again, and then repeat. The best way I can describe this is that it feels like both my level of influence and my awareness are coming in waves. And while you could just chalk it all up to being sensitive to intoxicants, I've paid mindful attention to this happening and realized it explains alot of my lifelong behavior sober as well, its it's just more highlighted under the influence. Especially in social interactions and also anything I might be focusing on but even when im by myself, I've become more aware that in one moment I'll feel completely present and in an aware state of mind and then spacey, unfocused and only able to think in abstract terms (making conversation hard to keep) for a few moments after that and cycle through this. And depending on when on this cycle someone interacts with me I could offer up either a normal, awkward and out of place or occasionally a very tuned in and creative personality and interaction.

I'm not interested in self diagnosing anything here, I'm just hoping that someone can break this down for me in a better way that I could maybe explain to soneone else and am also interested if anyone else has felt the way same way since no one I know has ever mentioned feeling similarily.

TL;DR While intoxicated noticing that mannerisms, mental focus and autopilot don't flow congruently but more cyclically. Normal, strong, weak, repeat. Highlighted that while sober (starting way before using any kind of intoxicant) I behave the same way and has been lifelong issue.",27Jul2020,1
56,"I am not saying this for attention, I judt want to get this off my chest.

For the past month I have been in an awful headspace, not a mood but like, an actual psychotic headspace. Im pretty sure this is due to a wierd spiritual experience involving cannabis that I had a month ago. Some call it ""enlightenment"". Ever since then I have been trapped in an extremely strange mentaphysical headspace that only people who have experienced this so called ""enlightenment"" seem to have had. I feel like I ak not experiencing base level reality and my head of absoluetly full of weird occultic and metaphysical ideas. Even when I have a thought, I think about the thought, and I think about thinking about the thought and so on. I feel as though I am being ""shown"" a ""higher level"" of reality and I absolutely hate it. Not o ky that, but my head feels different, like O can feel my thoughts, idk what this means, im probably just imaging that part, at least I hope so 

I am afraid that this is due to a legitimate spiritual phenomenon and not just some brain fuck up. I have been to the doctors and they couldnt diagnose me beyond unspecified psychosis. If I get any further into this headspace, or somehow realise I cannot go back to normal, or that this is a legitimate spiritual phenomenon based in truth, and not some kind of trickery I will end my own life.

I'm really starting to get pissed off. I deal with several depressive disorders and it's been really hard for me lately. I have a physical disability and my dad tells me he doesn't even see me as disabled because I'm higher functioning than other people. Wtf. So if he doesn't see me as physically disabled there's no way he sees me as mentally ill. He doesn't even understand my mom's severe GAD (she hasn't been diagnosed but that's what she's being treated for). And while you would think, oh. Your mom is mentally ill? Surely she understands! No. She's a raging narcissist (NOT CLINICALLY, SOCIALLY). I tend to deal with more depression than anxiety and she doesn't understand, and while I don't struggle with anxiety as my main issue I try to understand her problems but I'm getting at the end of my rope when she insults me for my mental health issues. My sister made a joke today about me being miserable all the time and when I attempted suicide back in 2016 she got mad and asked me why I had to go tell mom and dad about it. Like cuz I needed help??? Or else I might not be..alive?? Another sister of mine Idk. She has weird thoughts. She told me she had depression for seven years. I get that. I got diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder as well. Yet she's against me taking medication. Says I don't need therapy to fix my issues. Later my mom told me SHE WENT TO THERAPY SO WTF ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT. They all only seemed to care when I attempted. Now I'm just the depressed edgy teeen. And you know what? Fuck you. Idk how long I've been living with PMDD but I know I got diagnosed around 2 years ago. And the self harm and suicidal ideations are creeping back in. But they're not as bad as they used to be. They don't understand my feelings and never try. Being suicidal makes you an attention seeker, but once your dead you're suddenly the sweetest angel to have graced the earth. Is that what you want from me? To be dead? Then will you care? Will you actually love me?? The one thing I cling to is my dad and my one sister. My dad doesn't entirely understand, but as I am a behavioral health major we talk about it more and more so I'm trying to help him understand. And my sister actually said she misses me. That made me feel better. Even if she's a little weird and kinda dumb üòÇ

She would talk about people who would stay in bed for hours and how sorry she felt for them. But when I do it I'm being lazy, I'm not trying. Thard my whole family. My uncle suffers from bipolar he hasn't left his bed for probably a month now besides necessities. You feel sorry for him, for my aunt. In normal time I got up to go to school every day of my life. Even on the day I had a violent reaction to medication where I couldn't fucking move, I crawled my ass out of bed and tried to go. I do all my homework, I get A's, I try to be the best at what I do yet somehow. SOMEHOW I'm lazy?? I'm a bitch? (My mom calls me that A LOT), my scars are nothing compared to so and so? Fuck you.

Her husband suffered an injury at his job and can't walk, going to work was his only way of distancing himself from my auntie. When he was injured my auntie spend all of that time telling him how useless he was and verbally abusing him. Now that they are living with my other auntie my cousins do not feel safe and are afraid of being alone with her, they are mostly children and witnessing these events is not healthy for them. I am not living with them but my mom and I are having a hard time helping our family with what ways they can help her.

75,"Someone I care about a great deal is going through something I can only try to understand. They have developed symptoms of panic disorder, depersonalization, and anthropophobia (these aren‚Äôt diagnosed, just my own observation and attempt to relay the extent of things). It seems like it‚Äôs some kind of identity crisis brought on by extreme stress. They say they‚Äôre angry, scared, tired, afraid to be around people (even in a one on one setting), can‚Äôt relate to their former self of only a few months ago, and prefer to stay at home alone most of the time. 

They have detached from former relationships and speak about things as if they happened to someone else. Sometimes it seems they don‚Äôt even remember things at all. 

I am not in a position to communicate with them freely anymore and am held at a great distance, I suspect others are as well. I am allowed the most basic of surface level conversation in a very specific online setting only. 

I want to continue to be someone that they can trust and build upon that as much as possible without making things worse for them. They don‚Äôt want help from their friends and get angry when pushed in any certain direction. They are seeing a professional and wanting to help themselves, thankfully. They are able to pretend to be themselves enough to get by and I am unclear as to how many people are aware of what‚Äôs going on underneath the surface. 

Seeing someone I care about going through this, without being able to speak freely or help in any way, is causing me a tremendous amount of pain. We were once very close and now I am a stranger.  I miss them more than I thought was possible. I have moments of despair and extreme grief over the loss of having them in my life. They are an exceptional person and have experienced unimaginable hardships. I cry thinking about how they are unable to see how extremely amazing and loved they are. 

I continue to hold hope that they can come through this and live a fulfilled life that makes them happy. I don‚Äôt expect they will ever be who they were before exactly but hopefully a better, stronger, more honest version of themselves that can be an active participant in their own life. 

I could really use some advice on what to do. Should I continue to stay in contact or should I let them go? I feel like they can use as many people as possible in their life who are willing to accept them for who they are right now but I also know that I am out of my realm of understanding. Is it best to cut ties completely and let them fight through it alone? They don‚Äôt seem to care either way if I‚Äôm in their life, but then again they don‚Äôt seem capable of caring about much of anything right now. 

I don‚Äôt want to impede their healing or become an enabler to their current position. I want to do what‚Äôs best for them. 

Thank you for reading and sharing any personal experiences with similar situations and advice.",27Jul2020,1
76,"I‚Äôve always had issues with anxiety and depression, even had it under control for the years leading up to my pregnancy.

79,"Staying in the same boring, agoraphobic routine every day is my poor excuse for a mood stabilizing method. It sorta works, except that I have to accept the nothingness, and as soon as anything major changes, all the ""stability"" goes in the crapper. 

We're getting prepared for a huge move hundreds of miles away. It's a good move, with lots of promise for our family of five adults. Better economy, better healthcare, and a support system of several extended family members. Job opportunities, and cleaner air, too. Lots of positive reasons to try to push through the pain. 

However, everyone is struggling with the poor air quality, chronic pain, and our healthcare here is inadequate. The stress of seeing everyone feel so bad, but not being able to get them real help until after the move is scaring me, and oppressing me. 

First, I had hypomania of course, that sense one needs to be pumped up for the coming events, feeling like downtime is for the weak, I have been having some weird ideas, wildly euphoric at times, and irritable others. 

Now, with each family member struggling either physically, mentally, or both, I'm starting to feel completely unstable, scared, and I'm worried I might flip towards depression, or.....that other thing that happens. 

If I went to try to get help right now, it could jeopardize the move, I probably wouldn't get appropriate treatment here, and I think it might be worse to try to get used to a mood stabilizer or something, while packing and doing related stuff.  

So, I feel myself slipping, losing my grip, and I want to hide, and I really need to keep it together. I wish I could be able to help everyone around me, too. I wish I had the power to move us myself. 

Realistically, we'll feel better once we're on the road, but even a great move is difficult. It's tiring, there's all kinds of unexpected things, and you have to have all these new experiences when you arrive which are inevitably always stressful, even if much of it's positive. 

I'm starting to get some negative thoughts again in reaction to the stress because I just want this pressured feeling to end. Yet, I also want to see this work out for the two family members that are under 30, and be strong for them. 

Right now I've got zero idea of how to keep going.",27Jul2020,1
80,"Since I‚Äôm on suicide watch, my therapist and psychiatrist wanted me to go inpatient at a mental institution.

On the darker side of things, I think I‚Äôve become more numb than normal from my new medications. Everyday is horrible. Every night is torture. The only thing I can thing about is self harming. That‚Äôs literally it. I daydream about it, I actually dream about it, it‚Äôs in every corner of my mind. At this rate, I‚Äôll be inpatient by the end of the week. I just wish I could just end it.

82,"I am a 25yo (F) who has been masturbating since I was 6 yrs old. I can remember I started humping pillows at that age and would become horny when watching intimate movie scenes and would excuse myself (cause I was with my family) from the movie, to go masturbate. My main concern tho is that my brother who is 3 years older than me (so he was 9, 10 yrs old), and I would hump each other till we orgasmed.

I dissociate a lot. I use to call it ‚Äúfalling out of time‚Äù because I wasnt sure what to call it. But now I know what it really is. 

I only started to realize a few days ago im delusional. That the voices arent real, the thing in the closet isnt real and that the music isnt real. I think that the only way out is to kill myself. I feel like im too far gone. Am I too far gone? I dont want to go to a mental ward. Would meds help? Im scared.

I use to think all of it was real. The screaming, the whispers, the music, the dead people and pets walking around the house. All that crap. But now I think ive been crazy all along. 

And now I dont even know who I am. I dont feel like a person. I dont feel like I have a name.  Im not one person. And all the thoughts are clumped and it hurts because I cant think. I cant think for myself. Everyones in the background telling me what to do. 

The voices are different from our voices in our heads. The voices of the others are closer. In the Front of my head not the back where my voice is. 

And then at times im not even in controll. I dont Remember anything after i lose Sentients. And then other times im outside of my body. Im not here. Im watching. 

I think maybe if I kill myself ill get out. Maybe this is all fake and I will wake up if I kill myself. 

And then my fingers act like they arent mine. I dont want to rip them off. But it makes me feel like I need to. I use tape to fix finger issues, i need my fingers

The two of us broke up because of some stupid dispute and I got over it after a month. I was able to forgive him and myself for what happened. After I got over him, I chatted him which was a stupid thing to do. Our first conversation was just casual and I just asked him how his birthday was. He told me it wasn‚Äôt worth celebrating because I wasn‚Äôt there. That prompted me to chat him more, cause yes I do still have feelings for him. The next conversations was more about me asking how he was doing, and everytime he would tell me how he wants to die, that he feels so empty. He would constantly tell me that it‚Äôs better for him to die, that he doesn‚Äôt wanna live anymore. I did try to help him as best as I could, I would tell him how he shouldn‚Äôt do that, that he should think about the people around him. He would say that no one cares about him, and when I said I do, he told me that a single person doesn‚Äôt matter to him. That made my heart break, and then he was listing all this methods on how to kill himself. I tried my best to cheer him up, but my words didn‚Äôt really matter to him. Then he told me, ‚Äú I need to go. If you bring this topic up to my family. Everything will be over for us if ever I‚Äôm still alive‚Äù. That night I knew he plans to kill himself, and with those words it made me ponder about what to do. This was at 1 am when he messaged me that, I messaged him over and over again how he shouldn‚Äôt kill himself. And I cried to the point that it triggered me cutting myself again, Note that I was clean for 2 months. I waited till morning though because I didn‚Äôt know what to do. Then it was already 9 am, so rather than just doing nothing I texted his mom and just asked her, ‚ÄúHello, sorry for bothering you this early. But I want to know if your son is okay?‚Äù. Just that one message got me to open up my eyes. After a few hours without any reply from his mom, I tried calling him, and after not being able to reach him, I messaged his mom again, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried, is he there?‚Äù. Then my ex texted me, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre giving hints to my family. Please we have our own lives. Focus on your own!‚Äù. That made me angry, I was just trying to help because I didn‚Äôt want him to die, I guess I shouldn‚Äôt have tried to help him anyway. I texted him back saying that I just asked if he as okay, I didn‚Äôt say anything about it. He replied, ‚ÄúYou're not being serious about what I said last night. Everything will be over to us. And you giving a hint to them already. I'll stay alive for now but everything is over for us. We‚Äôre not even gonna be friends. Thanks for giving a hint to my family and you just ended our supposed to be good terms. Goodbye for good.‚Äù At this point I didn‚Äôt really care about him anymore, if just trying to stay by his side would hurt me to the point that I‚Äôll cut myself I‚Äôd rather not. I don‚Äôt really need him in my life, this is just him emotionally manipulating me to the point that it becomes toxic. I can‚Äôt do anything about it anymore,  I told him to just stay alive and that it was already over anyways. I want to help him but I‚Äôd rather help myself, so sorry for being selfish at this point.

88,"Hey,

First time on this subreddit and I hope anyone has advice.

I'm a very self concious individual, I think three times before I do something and I'm always scared on how people will perceive me or my actions.
I'm a stutterer which greatly contributes to the issue. And these thoughts have tormented me for years to the point where I've stopped going outside &amp; seeing friends. It has also stopped me from making friends as I am scared to talk to interact with other individuals cuz I'm scared they'll think I am retarded or something stupid.

I just want help on how to stop overthinking &amp; caring about what other people think of me, I'm sick of it but I cannot stop.

Everything I find is just people saying ""stop thinking about others opinion"" but that shit does not help, it is impossible to just stop thinking.

Also I have these flashbacks frequently which makes  me subconcious of my actions in the past, etc doing something awkward and seeing the look of others faces.

I do not want to have these thoughts anymore, I want to live my life and start loving life as this shit has put me in depression. Any advice would be extremely helpful especially if anyone has experienced my issues.

90,"Hey y‚Äôall,

I stumbled upon this subreddit and it seemed like a good place to post this question about something I‚Äôve noticed in myself in the last few months.

I‚Äôm going to provide a bit of backstory on myself, because I wonder if some of these things may have something to do with it.

I‚Äôve struggled with extremely low self-esteem my whole life, and although I‚Äôve never been officially diagnosed I believe I have struggled with depression as well.

I broke up with my girlfriend of about a year and a half at the end of May. In hindsight it was an unhealthy relationship for me that I should have ended much sooner. Despite being an overall great girl, she was controlling, would lash out at me for very minor things, and overall I just wasn‚Äôt happy but stayed in it for some reason. It was my first extensive relationship, as in the past I struggled to find any girl that was interested in me in any way. Prior to dating this girl, I dated two other girls for short times, the second of which was a girl that I truly thought was amazing and got along with great, but after just two short months she just told me she ‚Äúdrew away from liking me in that way.‚Äù That stung a lot and caused me to spiral into one of the lowest points emotionally of my entire life, and I still think there‚Äôs part of me that hasn‚Äôt recovered from that, especially because I still see her around quite a bit (she‚Äôs since moved on to another guy). I think it‚Äôs because I thought so highly of her but evidently she just didn‚Äôt really see me as all that special.

The breakup in May has left me as one of the few people in my friend circle that is single and actively looking for a partner. My sister who is two years younger than me is even dating my best friend (they‚Äôve been together for 3 years now, and don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm very happy for them).

Sorry if that was a bit hard to follow I‚Äôm kinda just putting all my thoughts out, now onto my point for posting this:

A few months ago I (21,m) was at college (like around January or February, so I was still with my most recent girlfriend) and noticed something that I would do that I didn‚Äôt think much of at the time but I‚Äôm now wondering about. I noticed that when I was sitting and not doing anything in particular aside from dorking around on my phone, I felt the need to pull my hoodie up over my face so basically only my eyes were visible, so I could still see what I was doing. It was sometimes accompanied by a chilled feeling despite that it wasn‚Äôt really cold and I‚Äôm also not someone who gets cold easily, but sometimes I just felt the need to do it. This went on for a while but I chalked it up to it being cold in the buildings I was in.

Fast forward a few months later, I‚Äôve broken up with my girlfriend and although I‚Äôm glad I did, I still don‚Äôt really feel super happy. Additionally, I‚Äôve noticed that even though it‚Äôs now summer and very warm outside, whenever I‚Äôm inside I feel the need to put on a hoodie, even though there‚Äôs no reason for me to. My family has noticed I do it and they always ask if I‚Äôm cold, to which I say no because I genuinely am not, I just feel like putting a hoodie on.

Has anyone else experienced anything similar to this?

Am I potentially suffering from depression, or low self-esteem, or just general loneliness?

Do I somehow find the hoodie comforting? Like even just as a sense of warmth? Or perhaps as something deeper like replacing the feeling of being hugged by someone?

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

Thanks y‚Äôall.",27Jul2020,1

95,"Hi there! Me (27F) have depressive episodes since I were 16. 2 years ago I had a psychotic episode because of which my then bf left me. The episode was drug induced, but doctors were confused if it was a sign of bipolar disorder. Long story short I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Since the episode I'm feeling really ashamed because I was kinda exposed online on fb. Everyone was really supportive nevertheless. However, my therapist introduced me to a group therapy program which led me to a downward spiral. He insisted on staying there even if I was expressing my constant dysphoria. 8 months later and after 4 efforts of committing suicide I ended up in the hospital where I am for the last 2 weeks. I feel a lot better. But I'm in constant anxiety of how do I communicate my history with a person I might date in the future? I'm an honest person, outspoken for mental health issues, but this year a guy I was kinda dating admitted he was scared of moving the relationship to the next level due to my issues (not to mention that after I told him I am in the hospital never contacted me again). Being ditched twice hurts a lot. I am in constant fear of ending up on my own. Anyway, when would you like to know that the person you are dating has that kind of history and would you consider it as dishonesty if that person hid it from you? 

P.S. I am a very functional person. I have a degree. The episode happened during my master's abroad, so I couldn't finish it. Ever since I am trying to overcome the shame and the depression through intensive therapy and medication.

97,"My father had little patience and wen he was angry, he said very offensive and hurtful things to me, because of my grades; and to my mother, because of a delusion he had about her having an affair with a gym coach.

I also learned very offensive language from my half brothers and the internet.

My mom once told me that when I was 2 years old, her and dad took me out to lunch. In the restaurant we were eating there was a baby who cried unceasingly, so I got tired and stood on my baby chair and shouted ‚ÄúShut the fuck up!‚Äù

I remember a day in 4th grade (ages 8-9 in my country), the class bully had pushed a friend of mine intro a tree. The kid hit his eye superficially on a small branch. I was furious so I immediately approached the bully and proceeded to yell somewhat offensive things for an 8 year old to say to a classmate. The bully just stood there and started crying. Was that situation addressed in a good way? 

When I was 10 y/o, a friend had come over to my house and we were drinking water at the kitchen. Then my friend hit the salt shaker off the table, so I got mad and this time, I yelled repulsive insults about him and his mother. He stood there and looked shook, but he didn‚Äôt cry. Fuck I even remember I told him I was going to kill his mother, obviously jokingly. One day father yelled at him like he did with me, an when my friend went home, my dad told me: ‚ÄúTell your friend I was joking hehe‚Äù. üòí

I had been dealing with it since my father passed away 4 years ago. 
Last year was a really rough for me, I was unable to go outside, going to the university even to clean myself, Everything was making scared I felt like it was no future for me. My notes were going down close to getting kick out of the university, lots of debts, No money incomes, sent tons of job applications and no answer, losing friends, weight,started with suicidal thoughs and close to getting suicidal tendencies, was hitting the bottom until I met my gf (current ex) a wonferful woman that helped me go through and push me over to see a specialist because I wanted to be better for me and for her. We are no longer together but thanks to her I am better now, I don't know what could happened if I didn't meet her, I will be forever thankful to her. 

Took me a year to seen my potential and what I was capable, Also to love myself again. Was a difficult journey I will not lie but trust me, it is really worthy.

about 3 or 4 weeks ago, my girlfriend and i separated because of her own psychological issues caused by trauma that happened when before we met. The problem was that we was in the process of buying a flat together and she was genuinely excited about it! Her reasoning for pulling out and separating is that she needs to heal from what happened to her alone before she can move on with her life. She never said she wouldnt get back with me or anything and said the reason she has waited almost the 2 years for this to happen is that i am the perfect boyfriend and she thought she could just move past it but she cant.

I've always been a daydreamer. But now my crazy made up stories have turned into peaceful thoughts of ending it. No more sadness, no more stress, no more regrets, no more mistakes, and no more overthinking. To be honest, these thoughts have actually brought me some peace and quiet in my head. I'm always overthinking and over analyzing everything, but when I think about how to do it i get a sense of relief.

There's people in my life that I absolutely know I would hurt. Especially my little girl. But right now the pros are outweighing the cons. Therapy is in 2 days, and I'm not excited about it. Already tried it. To be honest it helped a lot. The drugs helped a lot too. Made me feel again. Maybe I should give it another go before I do something stupid ( or smart if you ask me).

115,"When i was 6, my mom went in for a tooth surgery where a surgeon incorrectly inserted a needle into the roof of her mouth and pierced her trigeminal nerve. 

She developed trigeminal neuropathy which caused daily crying and screaming and smashing for years up until I was 13. A large portion of people who do contract this disease commit suicide, especially if it‚Äôs in the head. In fact, it is often called the ‚ÄúSuicide Disease‚Äù. 

During this time, when the pain spikes became really bad and endured for long periods of time, she would tell me, ‚Äúwhen I‚Äôm gone just don‚Äôt remember me like this. In between fits of drooling and screaming, she would hug me and tear out my hair in frustration. She would then leave, and I did not know if she was coming back. Neither did my father for that matter, but he didn‚Äôt try to stop her. 


She would come back a day or two later, and the cycle would continue. 


I remember this was very difficult for me at first, but after a few months i became apathetic. At this point, I did not care about her pain nor  especially anyone else‚Äôs. 

After about a year, I began torturing animals and abusing some of the more vulnerable kids at school. 

The animal abuse stopped but my antagonistic behavior worsened into high school, becoming mostly verbal. I went to the principles 3 times in the first week for tipping off one of the teachers.

A miracle nerve blocker cured the disease and our family is now relatively normal. I am 18 now and finishing my bachelors in math this year. 

I thought kids who had similar experiences in their childhoods developed PTSD or anxiety or something, but I am just completely apathetic. I don‚Äôt care about anyone or their feelings.  In fact, it annoys me when someone complains about pain. However, i do feel a tinge of pleasure when i see someone suffering in pain. 

An example of this would be watching a father on the news choke up over the death of his teenage son. My family was tearing up, while i felt a blast of euphoria. I was smiling uncontrollably and had to turn away in order to not freak my mother out. 

Feelings this strong are rare and are usually in smaller doses, but they do happen occasionally.

116,"TRIGGER WARNING, PORNOGRAPHY

When i was around the age of 11 i got my first phone.
I started to look around YouTube for stuff to jerk off to, for a while it was mostly drawn images or porn that slipped through the system. 
You could sort by time since the upload, back then a lot of porn did end up for 24 hours on the platform.

One day i stumbled upon child porn. 
I was 11 or 12 years old.
It was one video slideshow with weird links and russian text written on it. 
I can still recall the images and its absolutely horrifying. 
The worst thing about it is, that at the time, i thought is was interesting in a way. 
I dont know if i masturbated seeing these pictures.

Four years later, i had forgotten and suppressed what i had seen, it doomed on me.
The pictures started to reappear, what had i done, what am i.
Im I a pedophile? I could not think straight anymore.
Hours over hours analysing my thoughts, what i had thought or what my body reacted to.

A few weeks after the collapse of my mental health i started an internship in a elementary ... i quit one week into it. 
I just could not be around kids, the thoughts and images horrified me. I was 15 or 16 at the time.

I am 21 years old now. 
The last 3 years or so where relatively calm.
I avoided kids and the thought of me being attracted to them as much as possible.
Sadly around two months ago the images and thoughts came back. 
I am helpless, i can see the images and i am horrified.
I often have the impulse to puke and stress level can be very high at times.

My husband has MS and I have a certain degree of hypochondria that is just a result of general anxiety disorder. My husband is fine, his MS is not progressive and is well-managed, but between that and my paranoia/anxiety/common sense, we have shut down for months. We just started seeing friends again, those who have been careful and still distancing, but the adjustment is hard. 

Not only am I a little skittish about any interactions, so doing things that would have been normal previously have become more stressful, but we have been spending months together without leaving the house separately for any extended period of time. Now, I feel like I can‚Äôt be alone. It‚Äôs better if I have someone else to talk to on the phone or something, but just the premise of being alone or without him makes my heart beat faster.

Now it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt sit with myself and don‚Äôt know what to do and can‚Äôt stop my thoughts from racing. 

Simultaneously, social interactions are a production in my mind and a source of stress. Seeing friends and loved ones is something I feel very little emotional or mental energy for. It‚Äôs a dependency for being with my husband all the time and staying home that I know is damaging and the whole situation is taking a toll on both our mental health. 

I know a person can adapt to extreme circumstances.

If I am going down a highway or any road, its as if the cars around me matching my speed are actually stationary and the backdrop is scrolling past me like a greenscreen moving on a treadmill or something. Day or night. My perspective distorts and it feels like my environment is smaller than it actually is and I am a giant like some alice in wonderland type style effect. The problem is the disconnection I feel gets bad to where it almost impairs my driving to careless levels.

Rolling down my window helps most of the time so I can feel the inertia and resistance, but I was wondering if there are other remedies. I've been in several near death misses when driving due to other careless drivers almost ending my life, but if anything that should make me more alert and a better driver.",27Jul2020,1
130,"I realise that I am a particularly sensitive and na√Øve, and I know that my poor mental health doesn't help with that either, but social media is such a huge part of life now, and I have no idea how to cope with the negativity that comes with that.

I don't have twitter and I don't have Facebook, because it honestly just felt like a hate-pit, but I do have a very locked-down Instagram as I really enjoy seeing what my friends have been doing. I also use reddit, obviously.

I feel like I take negativity so personally, even if it's not aimed at me, it really hurts and is making me feel such little faith in humanity.

131,"about me im 16 and my dad and his mum had bipolar, dad‚Äôs one was pretty major, and i used to have apparently reasonless breakdowns where i self harm or think a lot about or attempt but not plan suicide, i also had  times of my life where i was again apparently for no reason really happy, and got the opposite of breakdowns

but last two shifts i got got me thinking, when i was depressed and started self harming again, my vape had broke and me and my friends were mad at me, and when i thought i got unreasonably happy, we had sorted it out with my friends

and now im feeling depressed again because me getting a new phone was delayed a week, none of these are reasons big enough to make me do what i do, so im confused if they‚Äôre just triggers or if im just sensitive if so why? or maybe all the sad things that had happened in my life (which there isnt really anything so extreme) go out the moment another sad thing happens?

I cant do mental calculations of even 2 digits fast and still have to rely on fingers, i cant remember routes that i traveled a few days ago, and in case of emotion i feel anxiety and fear twice more than others .

I also have a problem of premature ejaculation and I know the cause of it. When i started masturbating when i was around 10 i had to do it fast in order to not get caught. So continuously doing this has led to this problem and now i'm afraid of getting a girlfriend or even talking to a girl.

I have no motivation of doing things now. Every time i try i either drift away or if i force myself to learn something online i get tired half way in. Its like my body is trying to stop me from doing productive things.

The first thing I saw of my mother was when me and my autistic brother were having a casual conversation and she started screaming her head off at us, guilt tripping us about how much agony her headache is giving her, and telling us how all we ever do is argue.
OK, not unusual.
I found out that the 2 milk cartons (which was laid horizontally in the fridge for space), had leaked with the seals on. Without checking the cartons and before I Could clean it up, she sees it and freaks. Bellowing so hard at me and my 'Lazy, arrogant' brother, that she couldn't even stand.

147,"Hello all, I‚Äôll try to keep this short. About 3 years ago, when I was 19/20, I had my first major run in with anxiety, as well as separation anxiety, specifically, from my parents. Over the course of many months I was eventually put on Zoloft, which over time reduced the symptoms greatly and I was living a pretty normal life. Fast forward to April 2020. I‚Äôm 23, and still living at home (weird college/self employed thing). Again, I was fine until this point. One day, an anxiety attack hit harder then ive ever had one hit before and since then nothings been the same. I am able to be out and about myself, as long as one or both of my parents are at home. If they aren‚Äôt, I feel fearful until they return. Being at home by myself hasn‚Äôt happened recently. It scares me terribly, mostly because my thoughts turn somewhat dark (what if something happened to me, what if something happened to them, what if I hurt myself, etc.). Now understand, I‚Äôm not suicidal by any means, it‚Äôs just a thought that hits me and is hard to get rid of. In May, my doctor upped my Zoloft dosage from 100mg to 150mg, and added Lorazepam, which for a while helped a good amount. I was on 1mg daily (0.5 morning and night) and I am now down to just 0.25mg once a day, or half a pill. I truly don‚Äôt know what the answer is. I know it‚Äôs driving my dad absolutely nuts, as he feels like he can‚Äôt leave the house without me when I‚Äôm around.

148,"The principle of Thoughts-&gt;Feelings/Emotions-&gt;Behaviors-&gt;Thoughts is what enabled us to advance as human civilization. 

Throughout the history, we knew a number of people who did not succumb to their feelings/emotions (e.g. Julius Caesar not losing heart at being surrounded in Alesia,  John III Sobieski successfully defending Vienna, and Mehmed II persisting in taking Constantinople despite the opposing opinions of his advisors).

Personally, CBT helped me with my insomnia. Though I did not have it as worse as others, I really had moment when I was not able to sleep for two straight nights. By practicing the sleep restriction and stimulus control along with the cognitive reframing, I was able to conquer insomnia.

I am currently having problems with work productivity due to COVID 19 forcing me to work from home (I may have ADHD or some form of executive function disorder) and I now return again to CBT (and come across Dr. Russell Barkley) to help me with this issue. Right now, I am slowly getting back on track.

149,"I'm not really sure where to go with this as it's a difficult subject for me, but I guess I just need somewhere safe to talk about it and feel supported? I don't know, but here goes.

For as long as I can remember, I've been really non-confrontational and generally a passive person. It wasn't too bad, though did make me a bit of a target for school bullies as I never stood up for myself.  In the more resent years, though (I guess since I started uni I in 2009) I've noticed how badly it's affecting me.  I have depression and anxiety anyway which doesn't help, but the big issue that's causing a lot of trouble is how I react to other people's anger and negative emotions.

If someone is angry around me, not even directed at me, I go into panic.  It terrifies me.  I lock down, go quiet, struggle to breathe, and can't function at all.  I completely shut down and there's nothing I can do to stop it.  For instance, dad gets really frustrated with technology and whilst I was cooking yesterday he hit the counter in frustration.  It was all I could do not to break down there and then, holding it together and not crying took a lot of effort. I could only stay quiet and pretend nothing was wrong. I know he'd be absolutely devastated if he knew what had happened, he's such a kind and gentle man, but I can't say anything as 

Sorry, can't finish that sentence, you get the idea.

It makes trying to sort out issues with my partner difficult as well, if he'd ever got frustrated with a situation I'd lock down and never be able to fight my corner as I couldn't talk. There was the rational side of my mind saying ""It's ok, just talk, it's the only way to solve this"" but all I could hear was internal screaming and my thoughts would go completely blank.

And it happens with everyone. They get angry, I panic and lock up.

But what I don't get is why.  We have a very loving household, there was no abuse at all, I've never had an abusive relationship, my parents and I get on beautifully, and my partner is a wonderful supportive man.  I can't see any reasonable answer as to why it affects me so badly.  Mum worries she's at fault as she suffered from severe post-natal depression (screaming, throwing things, the whole lot), but that cleared up before I was 12 months old so I doubt that's the case.  Whether there's a memory somewhere that I've suppressed or my brain is just wired weirdly, I don't know, but I desperately want to stop feeling like this as it's exhausting and I think causing some negative emotional issues in me.  It doesn't help that I have untreated sleep apnoea (was just getting diagnosed when covid hit) so not sleeping well and my nightmares have been horrific. Some even reflecting these issues.

I'll probably have to talk about it with a professional at some point, but it's hard and this is, I guess, the first step of getting it out. Just want to know what people think and if anyone has gone through similar.  Thanks for sticking this out. X",27Jul2020,1

153,"Hello. This sucks and I hate venting here or seeking advice but I somehow feel talking about it could help a bit. Long quick backstory. We've been married almost 17 years, have 4 great kids and things have been reasonably good. Usual financial struggles but no real major issues. 
4 years ago she was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer, was awful at first but we got through it. I was with her for everything along the way. 
Through several surgeries and reconstruction things began to change. I thought it was constant influx of meds but wasn't certain. Arguments became more frequent but we still made things work. 
Last year she was having major depression issues that she said were her and I tried to be encouraging all the while worrying obviously. She took a handful of pills hoping to end things but got sick and vomited them up, this i learned after the fact when talking with her counselor. Also learned that she had thought to sit on some railroad tracks, and a few other methods she'd thought to look accidental. During one of her orthopedic appointments the doctors had deduced through code words she was a harm to herself and was admitted for observation as well as therapy. 
She eventually was well enough she was okayed to come home though later learning she was at a short stay facility and was to seek longer term help if more feelings arose

This brings us to recently. On the 10th she had the supposed last of her reconstruction surgeries and I'd urged her to stay as long as possible in recovery. Against my hopes she'd talked our daughter into discharging her unbeknownst to me.  My wife has a history of not exactly following drs order for recovery when sent home. 

Anyway something was not right. She was not herself in many ways. My kids would call me at work scared because mom was flailing her arms around and yelling incoherent words (person. Dog.out. adult. Bad.. better. Parent. Pilloe. Fall.) while occasionally crying. My 19yr old called me scared this person wasn't her mother and for me to rush home. Upon arriving home everything seemed to have passed and she was talking again casually. This same situation happened again 2 days later where it was my son watching over her. 

So around this time she informed me she needed her Cozart medication and I went upstairs to look. Unable to find it. I checked the car, tore the room apart, searched everywhere but couldn't find any medication by that name. I found many many pills in the collection she's amassed along the way. This made her more agitated and mad where she would out loud complain about me to no one as if I weren't in the room. I looked high and low yet it wasn't found and told her this. Then she accused me of intentionally trying to give her a heart attack because I wouldn't give her her Liprozan (not cozart as asked. Liprozan).
How in the hell was I to know it was a different name. By now I was agitated and stormed up and grabbed the actual medication I needed too the entire time without knowing. But by now things started to all go to hell. She yelled at me to leave her be so she could chill down which i did. The kids later came to get me to inform me mom was leaving. She is supposed to be on bedrest healing and being catered to mind you. She's packing bags and stuff, throwing them out the door and the kids obviously worried for her safety and healing asked me to get her. I did get in her attempted way to leave, took her by the outer arms and escorted her to the couch to sit and rest as instructed. What followed next was a 7 hour tirade of her storming around the house yelling and slamming things all in front of the kids (which she blames me for) about how she's the only one thinking clear and she's doing what's best for her. Yet couldn't tell anyone what she needed or what might be best. Police were called by never came to the house and everything continued minute by minute more irrational than the last. Talking on circles. Wouldn't allow anyone else to speak as she'd just yell over them. I did begin recording her at one point as she stated she wished someone recorded this so they could hear she was the only sane person in the house. I fwd'd those recordings to her therapist and he wanted to see her immediately. I also contacted her plast surgeon who thought she should be brought in but asked that she stop one med having not known about previous psychotic episodes. 

I asked my wife to do that pill by that brought more accusations that I was attempting to sabotage her healing. This was a couple days later by the way. I came home from work the next day and she was gone. Packed up and went to a friend's house for the night she said. The next day was her post op appointment which I'd initially planned to take her too, but she told me she'd let me know. She did everything she could to find another ride but at the last moment she asked me. 

Appointment did not go well. She had caused a lot of damage to herself that she blames me for but the doctor started asking why I had called and if she was ok. At that point she began crying and demanded me out of the room. I went to the lobby for 3 hours to learn she had again been admitted. Dr came and talked to me, thanking me for bringing her in as well as the heads up to her happenings. This was last Wednesday 

Now we'd talked a little here and there. Texting when she's up to it. Yesterday I thought I'd go visit and surprise her. That wasn't good. She was no longer in her usual room and front desk didn't know where she was. I asked nurses station and you could see worry on their faces like I was a monster. The male nurse stammered and said he'd go ask her nurse. I sat waiting and she was eventually walked out to me and we had to sit on a bench in plain view. I asked her why is everyone treating me like a demon and why couldn't I go to her room so she could rest. She followed that up with ""why did you manhandle and slam me on the couch""...ummm what? So that's it the hospital floor thinks I'm this spousal abuser ask the whole i never did such a thing. Our kids who were in the room told her the same as she was trying to say that on the night of big argument. Not to mention I walked her holding her outer arms.. I've lifted weights in the past but I cannot pick up a 190lb woman by the outer arms and walk her across a room like that. I tried to talk her away from that reassuring her that isn't what actually happened and that I've never laid a finger on her. More stuff came and it was clear she just wasn't having it with me. Security told us visiting hours were over, I mightve hugged a tree for all the reciprocation I got. Asked if I could give her a kiss. Said she couldn't and turned and walked away. 

I'm lost. The oldest daughter asked me to divorce her stating I deserve to be happy again and that I've given enough the last 4 years. Literally everyone on the planet has seen a terrible change in her these last few weeks. I don't know what to do....",27Jul2020,1
154,"Hi

I think I need some help. I‚Äôve been an anxious and neurotic person as a child but learned to suppress (can‚Äôt think of another word but maybe less severe than suppress) my anxieties to live a relatively normal life, although I can‚Äôt remember a time where I wasn‚Äôt anxious about something. Lately I‚Äôve been having weird spurts of episodes where my mind is always racing and I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself. I can‚Äôt even watch tv or a movie because I can‚Äôt concentrate. Yesterday, I had no appetite at all and didn‚Äôt eat anything all day. Couldn‚Äôt do anything productive I paced around a lot and tried to occupy myself but could only focus on small things or get hyperfixating on doing something that was physically stimulating (like bouncing a ball on the ground and catching it for an hour.) I was anxious and felt like my heart was racing. I usually have trouble falling asleep but it took me almost 3 hours before I decided to take melatonin but still kept waking up feeling uneasy and anxious in the early hours of the morning with my heart racing. I don‚Äôt know what this is?? I‚Äôve never been diagnosed with anything and I just wish I knew what it was so I knew what could help it. I just want some peace from myself because I have to deliberately tell myself every second of the day to try and put these thoughts/feelings aside but it‚Äôs almost impossible and definitely exhausting. Lately I‚Äôve also been isolating myself as much as I can. I feel like the best way for me to deal with these things is to be completely alone. I lie to my family and tell them I‚Äôm getting dinner with a friend or going to a friends house but in reality I just eat dinner in my car alone or drive aimlessly for hours because I‚Äôm finding it soothing. If I could I‚Äôd drive my car as a car as possible and end up completely random but thankfully cannot do that since my family lives with me and would never let me get far. I just feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind. Has anyone experienced this? Like I said I‚Äôve been anxious my whole life but recently as I grow into adulthood I feel like my anxieties are manifesting to the behavior of a crazy person and I just want to be normal :(. I know that‚Äôs insensitive to say but I really just feel like a maniac in my own mind. Any advice would be solid, thank you.

160,"Hey everyone, just starting this by saying (a) this isn't technically off **my** chest, because it's her mental health, but I just need a word of advice because I don't know what to do (b) I don't want to exactly say how old I am but she is the same age and we're both teenagers (c) this is all over text (d) we're both female. I'll try to keep it as brief as I possibly can but it's a long story. I'm also new to reddit so if I'm doing something wrong, tell me please!

So I've had a best friend of a couple of years and I've always kind of known that something was a bit off about her, but we loved her all the same and happily invited her into our friend group. She was quiet, liked art and music and used to be bullied in school, like a lot of us in that circle. She opened up to us and we all had fun, jokingly saying we loved each other and finding out about our similar taste in music, books, etc. She confessed to me she had a crush on me and I politely told her I wasn't interested (in anybody; I feel I am simply too young), and we stayed close friends. It's fine.

Then COVID happens. She has to stay home with her mum and her stepdad and 3 older siblings. I noticed she had a bit of a weird sleeping schedule in messages, and I admit that I didn't reply to her as quick as I could have done (I'm a bit of a workaholic so I was just studying a lot). My friends refer to me as 'mum' and 'Doctor (my surname)' because they see me as the 'advice person' in the group, so she starts telling me about how she's having migraines, a bad diet and a bad sleeping schedule. I offered her emotional support, sent her some recipes, reminded her to drink water and told her to speak to a doctor. Sometimes she got sad in the night and I would text back in the morning, being supportive, saying I loved her and telling her to go to the website, [www.kooth.com](https://www.kooth.com/). She says kooth is working and she's happier. It's still fine.

Now she's telling me she's been rejected by another of our friends, she feels low all the time, she thinks she has insomnia, she doesn't want to get out of bed, her head spins, she thinks she can't do anything right, and she's sorry. I ask her what she's sorry for. She doesn't even know. I have told her to tell her mum; I am happy to help but I honestly think I can't do it any more. I'm too young, I'm not a professional and I'm worried because she's my best friend. She says she can't tell her mum because her mum will say she's attention seeking like before with her eyesight, dyslexia, ADHD and bullying.

I'm in a weird predicament right now. I feel as if something is amiss but i can't put my finger on it. I broke off my relationship and everything is awful. We went to a friend's birthday a couple of days ago (in my country there haven't been any covid cases for some time now). All started out well, we were having a good time. Then i got tipsy and started having some weird thoughts and feelings. I began thinking that my girlfriend was flirting with a friend. It brought back a memory when we started dating she was chilling with her best friend and her ex was there as well. I don't know why but it irked me real bad and something like flipped inside me. The thoughts got really intrusive i got real paranoid and i felt as everything she did had an ulterior motive. some time went by and everybody went out to party. before entering a bar i confided to a close friend that i want to break up with my girlfriend and then i told her that as well and called her names. It was awful, i can't even understand how could i be so abusive. I wanted to leave so i told her that i'll take a taxi to her place to take my stuff, sleep and go to my home. ( i live in a different city and was staying at her place) She wanted to come with me so we went back to her place. we fought and everything was like a fever dream. Then i went to sleep. I woke up early and left. I wandered the streets and i felt really weird. I hated myself. I didn't want to be so hurtful to her. I was confused as to why i acted like that. The story goes on but i'm not able to write more right now. I feel sorrowful and regretful.

i remember going to my mom crying and shaking and she immediately called their mother and told her what was going on, and said my cousins were all huddled up crying because i was saying such horrible and disgusting things to them.

keep in mind, i never sent one more text after i said ‚Äúwe can both be ____‚Äù so they were obviously lying.

my grandma was in the middle of this, my family (me my dad mom and brother) weren‚Äôt speaking to their family, and the rest of the aunts and uncles were kinda just standing by the side.

it made me feel so ashamed of myself and i knew i was a burden.

185,"Last night, my wife told me that earlier in the day, she had a thought about what would be the easiest way to commit suicide. I was quite concerned and ended up calling the US national suicide hotline. While the counselor provided links for counseling, it seemed like there was little they could do as there was no imminent threat.

My lingering concern is it's tough for me to distinguish between a suicide idea vs. suicidal desire. I'm unsure if my wife really has a desire to commit suicide. I am concerned that, when we talked, she made statements like ""you \[as in me\] do everything for us and I do nothing"" (which is far from true). She also expressed how she should be happy with our house, our kids, and the fact she can stay home to care for them. My wife cares for our toddler and infant while I'm working so I can imagine the stress getting to her. And, due to the pandemic, we've gone out minimally so being cooped up isn't making things easier. 

I think my question is two-fold:

1. Can someone have an idea about suicide without that translating to suicidal desire?
2. Given the description above, I am wondering if my wife does need some counseling or therapy. For some reason, this feels like depression symptoms.

204,"To start off I'm not lazy. I'm getting to the point where I'm just tired of being busy. I get up get ready for work come home, crash. On my days off I take care of all the responsibilities, when I do have time someone creates more. ""You need to do this, you need to do that"" The responsibilities they had but no longer do. It forces me to not look at life, not enjoy it. 
I want to be alone in my own world. Not being a corporate slave and doing others responsibilities when I'm beyond drained. I remember telling my mom that life isnt about working and dying and she told me it was. I hate the fast lifestyle, I hate the idea of needing to stay busy. It's so draining and it kills a person's spirit. 
I've always considered running away from it all. Just living a simple life in a rural area where it's slow. Working without the feeling of stress, not working because I have to and it's the norm. Doing it because I enjoy it. The city kills me. I wasnt born to be stressed, depressed, and wanting a way out at 20. But people dont care. As long as they're getting money, they don't care. 
I dont want to die knowing that I spent my life working myself to that point. I want to live... I want to  enjoy each day... savor each moment. 

Tl;dr Busy lifestyle ruins people's souls and stop creating more responsibilities just to be ""busy""",27Jul2020,1
205,"So my anxoety was through the roof while searchkng for a job for 7 years because my town was reluctnant to hire me and my parents whome I live with have this ideal that if you can't get a job then it's clearly your fault and they would not help me.

Now that I finally have a job, and been working for months now, I had felt great, like I could have a life, but now it's getting worse again because my parents think I shouldn't be having a life until I'm stable. And to them stable is having a 40 hour week job, making more than ~$400 a week job, owning a car, and moving out to live on your own.

They want me to put 200% sole focus on doing that at the sacrifice of a personal lice and relaxation. To even quote them ""You can rest when the job is done, and until you're living on your own, you job isn't done""

They mean no socializing(not even online), no spending money at all(even though they want me to be independent), and constantly bugging my boss for more hours or work a second or even a 3rd job. Complete and udder commitment. And when I tell them that everyone needs time to relax and destress, they tell me ""You're delusional, you need a proper adulthood first and you're not doing that"" and I have been seeing myself having a spending issue lately and I think it might be because of the stress and anxiety, because even if I purchase a $1 drink somewhere, I feel like I'll get yelled at for my money. And I was also forced into letting my mother watch my bank account or get thrown out of the house. 

I can't move in with anyone, I can't afford to find an apartment because even if I could afford one, I'd have have to find a new job which I have no transportation for. I feel stuck with no way out...except dropping my life and friends and doing as my parents say....and when I've talked to others about this, I get yelled at by strangers on how I'm in the wrong.....I don't know what to do anymore.....I feel like either becoming a slave to their whims or quitting my job, selling everything I own, throw all that money at my parents and throw my life away to disappear....",27Jul2020,1

Basically, I was going through a VERY bad depressive episode. We were living 2.5 hours away from my hometown so I didn‚Äôt have them close by as a support system. I wasn‚Äôt happy in the small town we were living in and I basically convinced myself we were incompatible. I just really needed to work on myself and be closer to my family so I left.

Having all this time to reflect, I feel nothing but guilt and disgust with myself for treating him like shit. I‚Äôd nit pick things he did, make rude comments, answer him with a snooty tone. I remember him telling me on several occasions that I wasn‚Äôt in love with him. I was too fucking stupid and depressed to listen to him. I took him for granted. 

In the end, it was me I was unhappy with myself, not him. He was a damn good partner and I‚Äôm drowning in guilt and shame for how I treated him. I miss him with every ounce of my being and he will forever be the one that got away, but I know we will never ever be together again. There‚Äôs been way too much hurt on my end for him to even consider it. Plus he‚Äôs been in a new relationship and seems happy.

How am I supposed to forgive myself? Why did I allow myself to self-sabotage the entire relationship? Why didn‚Äôt I listen to him when he tried to tell me he was trying? I‚Äôm sick to my stomach day in and day out with myself and idk how to make it stop.",27Jul2020,1

I used to have short but intense panic attacks around once a month, but in the past few days I've been nerve wrecked and overwhelmed with never ending existential thoughts. 

I feel incredibly tired all day, and I'm either on the verge of crying, having a panic attack or passing out. 

I've started to look at life from a very different perspective, and it doesn't help when I see people online also being scared of the world and death. It makes me think there's no mindset I can adapt that would make me feel any better, and as of now, it's be coming very difficult to function.

231,"A lot of my childhood is filled with black holes, I‚Äôm not able to remember a large chunk of it. My earliest memory is when I was 4, I kept having the same dream every night, I still have the dream. It was also a much older man who would hold down the woman and have sex with her. As a 4 year old, I understood the concept of sex, I even thought that it was okay for people to touch me inappropriately.

When I was 5 we moved next store to a 15 year old boy. He would carry me and pull up my dress and would never put me down, always feeling up my legs... my parents noticed and they told me to not let him pick me up anymore... but he didn‚Äôt listen, so it continued, but I didn‚Äôt know it was wrong. 

When I was 6, my family and I went to a neighborhood party. I was playing outside and went down the playground slide, causing me to get a splinter. I ran and told my dad and he brought me in the bathroom to get it out. He convinced me that the splinter was in my vagina, making me sit on the toilet seat and allow him to touch me... 

When I was 11, my parents had already split up... my dad had shown me naked pictures of himself, claiming it was an accident even though he would pull down my pants just to rub my back.
I blacked out a lot during that time, although a hypnotist told me I was probably drugged by the way he would force me to drink a sip of water before bed. During that time, I would wake up confused but felt violated but not knowing what was real and what was fake. I remember being terrified for when my dads friends came over, even opening a window so I could hear.... I ended up calling my mom to come get me because I was scared... she couldn‚Äôt get me (she was in a different state). The most recent thing I remember from that time is waking up in  just my underwear and a big T-shirt in my dads bed while a man was using the bathroom, then I blacked out again.

She has always delt with mental illness and was diagnosed with major depression about 3 years ago, she is on antidepressants for that original diagnosis. However back in October she smoked weed and had a very bad exspierence, every since then she has not felt like herself and has all sort of different symptoms like, not being able to wake up, frequent panic attacks, feeling disconnected from the world and many others. Also since then we stopped smoking. I've looked into it and I belive she is showing not only signs of depression but also dissociative disorder. I recently talked her into calling her doctor and she made an appointment to talk about her medication because it is not working like before, however that appointment isant until late August. I also am currently talking to her mom and finding a therapist for her and I to talk to together. She dosen't want to talk to a therapist because its obviously a very difficult topic to talk about infront of a stranger. However I recently was able to talk her into possibly seeing someone together. I'm still working with her mom to find one that would be covered under insurance.

I want to get her help soon because she is not doing well, I guess what I am asking is for is advice as I go through getting her a therapist, what to say and what not to say, what do I do if she refuses to talk to someone? I also want for people to share there own story.

234,"I started seeing a psychiatric nurse practitioner (along with a therapist) about 9 months ago because I felt like I had ridiculous mood swings &amp; crippling anxiety. To start off, the PNP gave me simple meds like hydroxyzine for the anxiety which did absolutely nothing so took me off it relatively soon. Then he gave me an antidepressant. 

Months go by and my moods continue to be all over the place. My PNP decides I fit the criteria for Bipolar 2 and prescribes me a mood stabilizer along with the anti depressant and a anti psychotic. I just got worse. He told me the antidepressant induced hypomania and eventually mania and the mood stabilizer made me suicidal. I was a hot mess. 

Finally, he decided to take me off the mood stabilizer and just have me take the antipsychotic and the antidepressant. Again, did nothing to help my mental health!! He only tried 1 mood stabilizer that made me worse and when I asked him why we can‚Äôt try a different one he couldn‚Äôt give me a direct answer. 

Now he decides to take me off the antidepressant because at this point I‚Äôm manic and out of control. And gives me a NDRI to take with the antipsychotic. I went off the NDRI because the side effects were uncomfortable (I was only on it for 3 days) so the efficacy of it obviously wouldn‚Äôt show yet. My next appt he tells me to just take the antipsychotic and can‚Äôt give me anything else because ‚Äúeverything‚Äù has made me worse. (In reality, ‚Äúeverything he tried‚Äù was 1 mood stabilizer &amp; 1 NDRI). 

I tell him I‚Äôm hyper, anxious, depressed etc and he tells me my depression is ‚Äúnot that bad, just a minor inconvenience‚Äù. He increases the antipsychotic by 50mg and sends me on my way and says to come back in 1 month. Meanwhile I‚Äôm off my rocker and depressed as can be. And he refuses to say bipolar instead he calls it a mood disorder and now doesn‚Äôt even refer to it as that. 

Sorry this is so long, but I needed to get this off my chest and to vent. What are you guys‚Äôs thoughts on this? Should I drop the PNP &amp; go find a Psychiatrist or do you think it‚Äôs just me and maybe I‚Äôm not bipolar it‚Äôs just psychosomatic?? I understand meds are tricky but this is just ridiculous.

The idea of the app is to improve your mental health through conversation.  
You do this by having anonymous conversations with other users in the app.

I've got a decent amount of work done since my last post so I made a video on what it looks like so far. You can watch it here:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXS3HOB\_Ja8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXS3HOB_Ja8) 

I've also decided to call the app Chai - it's another avatar reference. I think the experience is similar to having a cup of tea with a friend and they're listening to whatever you have to talk about. Kind of like how Iroh has tea with people and gives them advice.

If you are interested in future updates you can follow me on twitter @ chaitheapp

I'm hoping to have the app released by mid September. In terms of what's next - I need to get notifications working, a reporting system working, and finalize asthethics and stuff.

Again, please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions on how to make the experience better. You can also email me at chaitheapp@gmail.com",27Jul2020,1
238,"Reposting this from another sub:

I'm 25f and I'm sharing something about my 23m friend with his permission. So he was sexually abused during his childhood. A lot. He doesn't like to get into it but every now and then it comes up. He was taking a girl home (we're roommates), and they were about to hook up; later he told me that she was being kind of aggressive. Not like forceful or anything, she was just trying to be strong and decisive because that turns a lot of guys on. He agrees that she didn't do anything wrong. 

Anyway, all I knew at the time was that it didn't work out. I went to his room shortly after she left, and he was sitting on the floor hugging himself and shaking. I put my hand on his shoulder -fast forward a few minutes and he's crying in my lap while I rubbed his head and told him everything was going to be okay. When things had settled a bit, he told me that no one had ever held him while he cried before-or not since he could remember anyway. In fact since he was an adult, no one had seen him cry.

People have been getting so much better about mental health, which is amazing. That being said, I feel like the mental health of men, especially men that have childhood trauma, is still overlooked so frequently. Please please please give love and support to any of your friends or family that have been hurt, and let them know that it's okay not to always be strong.",27Jul2020,1
239,"So this is really starting to get to me and affect my work -- and even my life. It happened once a few weeks ago, and I brushed it off as an embarrassing moment and moved on. But it happened again this morning and it has me questioning everything.

Basically, I can't speak or think clearly when asked to talk on a conference/work call with important people, or give any kind of report to multiple people. I start talking, and a few seconds in, my heart is beating faster, my breathing is labored, and I can't make it through a coherent thought. What's even more ridiculous is that I'm fine when talking to someone in a conversation, even multiple people. But when put on the spot while everyone is listening, I think I basically have a panic attack.

I've never been a worried or anxious person. However, I do have alot of generalized stress in my life, that when combined with the madness of this pandemic and working from home with kids and a wife with her own mental health issues, is really doing a number on me. Colleagues and coworkers have reached out to me after this second incident, asking if I am OK. My boss, who is great, as recommending that i talk to someone and see if there is any help I can get for this issue.

Has this happened to anyone else? I'm now worried even more that the next time I try to present or speak, it will happen again. I'm 35 years old and have been speaking in meetings and even at conferences my entire adult life.

How can I vent insecurity in a more healthy way or potentially get rid of it?

I've started writing a journal were i'd put my insecure thoughts;

""I'm not good enough, he's gunna find somebody better and leave me""

But I'm changing the words too;

""You are not good enough. He will leave you if he wants to""

I figured this might help remove my personal opinion on these unwanted thoughts.

Any advice? (UK)",27Jul2020,1
242,"I was talking to my stepdad to this the other night, it helped me a bit and helped get it off my chest, but I wanted to ask if anybody else has or is going through this. 

I have so many opinions on things and they seem to go against each other, and it sucks because I don't fit exactly into anything, even though I don't really want to. I constantly think I'm going to fail; cooking, art, writing, etc. I always question whether or not I'm really pansexual.

243,"I found my ex gf's personal (anonymous) blog, even though she clearly asked me not to search for it. I think the real reason I wanted to find it is because I'm afraid she could hurt herself. Her mental health is not great. I've read in her blog a text she wrote about me a few months ago, and it said how much she loves me, and she thinks I'm the best thing in her life. Someone commented on her text that she should learn to love herself as much as she loves me, which means she should break up with me and face her own problems. And that's exactly what she did. We're not together anymore, but we're still good friends. I know she still loves me and I love her too, but she wants to focus on her own life. And it's fine, but I have this stupid selfish horrid thought that maybe she doesn't know what's best to her, maybe she will be happier with me. I don't know. I love her so much and I want her to be happy, with me or without me. And I can't exaggerate how afraid I am that she will hurt herself. She has already done things like this before and she tried to kill herself. I really don't know what to do, please help. Thanks.

edit: she told me a few times that she's afraid to hurt me, and that's why she stays distant. But I really don't know what's the real reason. I wish I could just talk to her about it, but I don't want her to know I've read her blog, it'd hurt her so much.",27Jul2020,1

Even when I am completely sure I have done it, my brain keeps pestering me until I check it.
I don't know if I was able to make myself clear. English is not my first language.
And also. I've read in some places that having intrusive thoughts in common in people with OCD. And I have intrusive thoughts since I can remember, like for 7 years or more.

249,"When my sister was ~18 (10 years ago). My sister used to self harm (more than two incidents per week) and looking at her scars was one of the most painful things for me. None of us were aware of the therapy stuff back then, and our only help was her doctor who generally treated her more severe scars. He made a schedule for my sister- he asked her to stop right away, but allowed her cheat days- once a month when she is extremely helpless, she can go for it and he will take care of it. That year, my sister self-harmed herself 8 times. Next year, it was just 4.. 4 years later we got to know about therapies for people like her who need a professional help along with support systems.

I always had a pretty good sleeping habits, but it got worse a few years ago. I started having a light sleep, would wake up to go to the bathroom more than 4 times in the night (this is a bad habit) and would wake up 10am. I would sleep in the afternoon, sometimes more than 3 hours. And I would always feel sleepy.
Then it worsened. It would take me a long while to finally get asleep at night, but in the afternoon I would sleep the same amount. (I would go to the bad at night at 11pm and only actually sleep two or three hours later.). And I would always wake up very tired.
And it kept worsening. I started sleeping only one hour in the afternoon, sometimes I just layed in the bed and stared at the ceiling. And at night I only manage to sleep at 4am. 
One day I just simply didn't manage to sleep and the next day I only got 2 hours of sleep. So I gave up and asked my psychiatrist sleeping meds.
I know some people have it way worse. Like my friend sleeps at 2am or 3am and wakes up at 8am completely rested (he wasn't diagnosed with insomnia or anything)
But for me it doesn't matter how long I sleep, I always wake up very tired. And it all got me upset because a few years back I had heavy sleep and was always sleeping. But now, I just stay awake. At least now with the medication it is better.

Hey! My name is Abby and trying to conduct a study on how teens and young adults are handling the pandemic, because personally, it hasn't been well for me. I came here because I've seen quite a few teens in this facing severe mental health problems due to the pandemic.

This forum's purpose is to gather statistics regarding mental health from teens to young adults ( ages 13-24) in hopes to find suitable options to aid those going through a rough time. Mental health during this pandemic has not been nearly talked about enough, its over crowed with meaningless politics leaving us without any support. My goal is to help create that support.

If you have any time, please take this forum so that I can help others facing the same problems. This is completely anonymous, no info will be taken outside what you answer in the questions (so no emails or anything)

264,"I've been getting treated for depression for the past couple months now and I found the right medication fast, I genuinely feel a lot better and I'm not caught up in my head as much as I used to be.

I went through some of my old stuff and I found a book I would use to vent. It's a book of poems that I ripped pages out of, because it gave me something physical to do. I had also gone through and underlined any words that matched how I felt and then written in song lyrics of pretty aggressive and sad songs. Flipping through it made me remember how I had felt when I created it.

Seeing how I used to feel every day made me grateful for ""giving in"" and asking for help. I was always taught to be independent and rely on myself, and I thought battling mental illness with the help of drugs was a way of giving up that independence. I have also always been creative, but that came to a total stop when I was in the final slump that pushed me to get help. I wasn't myself. I couldn't find the willpower to text my friends or do school projects or even shower, let alone create art. I realized I needed to ask for help when my professor read out the symptoms of major depressive disorder to the class and I cried while sitting behind my computer in my dark apartment, because every single one applied to me. 
 
Now that I have the mental energy to look back at my more agressive work, I feel inspired to add to it with more positive and hopeful work. I'm looking forward to this new chapter in my life especially now that I feel strong enough to look back at my past and not let it get me down.

Little chips and cracks are appearing. This means more depression and more anxiety spill out, but this time, they can‚Äôt be repaired until the level drops again. 

It‚Äôs like a leaky faucet above my cup is constantly dripping water into my cup. Meaning that even after a spill, the water level rises again.

The problem is, what makes me talk to him is mainly just because i don't want to hurt him,, not because i want to talk to him,, i feel like talking to people is a task i need to do rather than something i do to enjoy my time,, no matter who's this person,,,,
I can't seem to get attached to ANYONE no matter how perfect they are, I can't make myself stick with them or even miss them when they're not around

If I ever work long enough at a company again to qualify to apply for short and long term disability insurance, is a trip to urgent care going to look less 'severe' than an ER trip? My dream is to be cured of anxiety/depression or at least make it manageable, but in the event I apply for STD and LTD (never done before, I'm stubborn I guess) I want to maximize my chances of success.

No one cares but my backstory:


- I've been dealing this crippling depression/anxiety since at least 2015. Before that had lots of success in tech, went to good schools etc.
- 8 tech jobs in 3 years, lasting only a few months before it's so bad I can't get out of bed and either quit or get fired. And my job hopping (not by choice) is so bad I am unemployable or I have to lie on my CV which is awful. I've also tried different roles of varying degrees of power so it isn't limited to a specific job that is driving me up the wall, it's in general
- I should have taken medical leave in 2015 when I was eligible (was with that company for many years)
- Most days I can't get out of bed, and the thought of interacting with people drives me to such panic attacks I feel like my heart is going to explode out of my chest. Chest pain from hyperventilating. Just crappiness all around.
- I'm at a tech company now again

275,"This year I'm keeping some flowers from the garden in a vase indoors, and cutting new ones when old ones fade. I've grown flowers for many years, and almost never did this before.

Somehow when I thought about doing it before, the destructive aspects of cutting flowers in the garden were felt so strongly, and the positive aspects of having flowers in a vase indoors were felt so weakly, that doing it was out of the question. This was totally ridiculous. It's not like I'll run out of flowers or even noticeably make things worse outside by cutting a few.

What causes this ridiculous amplification of negative perspectives and weakening of positive perspectives? I don't think I can simply say I was depressed then and I'm less depressed now. It certainly seems like my life was better while my father was alive and healthy, and my mother wasn't in some sort of long term mental health crisis.

There are all sorts of other things I've avoided because reasons against doing them seemed to outweigh reasons for doing them. I'm sure many times it was irrational. But that's usually a more complex story and more open to debate. This with flowers is just the clearest example of this kind of negative bias.

I have never taken medication for mental health problems. I do NOT live in an abusive household. I have never been suicidal, and not in the present. I have a loving family and friends. I also do not post much on reddit, so apologies for inconsistencies.

I can be incredibly stubborn. I am a incredibly empathetic person. People call me an empath (if you believe in that stuff or not). I have a very gentle personality, but I can be very stubborn during an argument. I find it very difficult not to be. It only really comes out when I have a dispute with my immediate family members, but not friends or other people I meet. I find it both incredibly destructive to family, and now myself too. After an argument I get very depressed and often think I am worthless, even if I apologise afterwards. I am constantly stuck in a cycle where I cannot break out of it, and it kills me internally everytime. I think that I am the Black sheep of family, and that they don't like me or that they think I am a freak. Its the last thing I want to be known for (I live with 3 others in my family for reference). 

I can never see when I need to stop. Its a reaccuring theme that I will do it the next time, but I don't. I find it so difficult.

I remember watching Sailor Moon every day. I don't remember watching it but I remember the entire story and the crackers I ate(one image only).

I couldn't remember things even when I was 17, 22 etc. I know this because I've tried to, since my family kept mentioning things that rang zero bells to me.

Apparently my family has way better memory. Huh, i think i drew the short stick.",27Jul2020,1
286,"Had a stroke in 2016. In the first year I recovered to the point of being able to walk around the house. I got back all function and the only thing that I'm left with is massive lingering fatigue, muscle weakness all around and some sleeping issues once or twice a week. 

I have a hard time enjoying my life. I'm looking for ways I can trick my mind or some light brainwashing techniques to help me change my perception of my life. 

Things I want to be able to accept are:

\- lack of a life partner to love

\- can't do things I enjoyed doing (weight lifting)

\- uncertain future

This is strictly a scientific question.

289,"I keep having a band pop up on my spotify who I really got into at the beginning of the year when I was in a very bad place. I really enjoyed their music but now every time I hear one of their songs I think why did I enjoy this folk music? It's very melancholic.

Then it made me think about how I really think I've come far.

I attempted suicide 3 times between december-may but now I have no interest in that.

One difference that I hadn't noticed before was my self harm urges. They've almost completely gone. Comparing that to february/ march time is shocking. I remember almost everyday thinking about cutting, hitting my head against anything including the sharp metal corner of my bed frame, walking into traffic all kinds of things.

The wound I had to get glued shut at the hospital in march is healing well. Still pretty visible but slowly less and less so.

And today I'm able to think about my future, the next few days, weeks, months.

I still somewhat blame the mental services for what happened. I mean one overdose, one climbing of a bridge, one visiting the hospital at 2am because I didn't feel safe by myself, one getting a sh cut glued, many calls to the mental health crisis number, many people chasing up my referral and never hearing back from them (I waited 3 months and technically still haven't heard from them although I moved back to my parents in a different town and got support here instead in the end). It does feel like they failed me.

I'm just glad I could come home in time to get help.",27Jul2020,1
