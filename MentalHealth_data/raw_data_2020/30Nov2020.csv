0,"With the frustration of my mental health declining, I have found myself talking to my parents about my own insecurities and my problems. And I have found myself having outbursts at myself and yelling at myself when a small inconvenience comes up. 
This has led my parents to argue about how to approach it I guess and how to face dealing with my outbursts. They argue and yell and I have recently overheard them talking about getting a marriage counselor. 
I am considering therapy heavily but I believe I am making progress. I understand this post is hard to follow and I don’t expect anyone to respond to this, I’m kind of just writing this to calm myself down or something I don’t know",30Nov2020,1
1,"*bit of background* I currently see a psychiatrist and she has ""diagnosed"" me with over reactive anxiety. Well, I've only seen her once to get some tweeks on my medication. I have went from zoloft 100mg to Prozac 20mg. I do have suicidal ideations. I have no plan or intent. I don't want to kill myself and I don't plan to, I just have these thoughts of just ""what if I turn the wheel of my car this way, what will happen?"" Just things like that. 

Thanksgiving was a hard day for me. Nothing was going right, everything was just falling apart. I snapped at my husband and told him I wished I never woke up that morning. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow for more med changes because I'm at my wits end. I'm a Rollercoaster of moods. One point I'm up really high and happy and the next moment I'm low and extremely depressed. 

I'm to the point where all I want to do is sleep, I hate showering, I just don't know what to do. If any of you ever fell this way please give me some coping tips or advice on ways to control the outbursts because I feel like I have no control over anything in my life.",30Nov2020,1

3,"hi guys

i dont really know where to post this and english its not my mother language but im 18 and im kinda confuse because i guess the things i feel and how deal with my feelings especially in my relationship isnt normal (its the first person i really like and who i imagine a life with and try my best to not screw everything up but its extremely hard sometimes and i think in a billion things and just cant) and my boyfriend says that i should look for ""help"" because he thinks the same and he wants to me to trust him and to see me happy, enjoying our time together.

but heres my question: everytime i say some stuff like that to my therapist she turn to me and say that its normal because of my age or its just pms and fear is normal too (and really is but i think it got in a point that has consumed me). she says that my parents carried that worry and fear too because their relationship were troubled and it passed to me by genetics but she never tell me what to do and i dont understand.

she help me into a lotta things but the most serious she seems to doesnt take that serious. she is the only therapist that i really opened myself and she helped me a lot (like stop automutilating) but in this case really seems its all my fault and im wrong to feel like that or that im not getting better because i dont want to really trust or get better and think good things.

what should i say to her? i dont have courage to question her, i get insecure because she is a professional and she know what shes doing but uuuuugfhdsgfhhgdhjfkasf i dont know its so confusing",30Nov2020,1
4,"IMPORTANT: im not thinking of sucide, i just want advice. i don’t want anyone to worry about that cause that’s not what i’m going to do.

anyways:

 i’m so tired. so tired. i don’t think i’ll be able to take it for much longer. i try to be nice and listen to everyone, but nobody cares to listen to me. as soon as they feel better about their problems they leave the call. 
  i feel fine during the day, but as soon as i get into my room all of the happiness just vanishes. 
  i tried telling my therapist, but i’m too scared. i’ve put up this “everything is fine, i’m happy” persona to her and now i’m scared to tell her that i don’t feel that way. 
  can someone give me any advice? please. im desperate.",30Nov2020,1
5,"Few years ago I read somewhere that once you get depression it doesn't ever truly leave you, and for me this has been the case. There will times when I will get better but only for sometime. 

I have been facing some issues at home as well as a strain in my relationship. I feel heartbroken, disheartened, all because I am constantly being misunderstood. I don't know what to do any more. 

Through out the day the feeling of wanted to give up comes to me in waves. During my 25 years of life I have always, always tried to do the right thing. Be there for everyone in my life, I have put other people's happiness and expectations above mine and despite it all I don't have even one person in my life who would do the same for me. Not one. And I know life isn't fair, that is what I have been told and I know life isn't fair. But I grew up believing that good things will happen to good people, it may take time but it will happen. But now I'm tired, I'm tired of waiting. My heart has been torn by the closest people in my life in the past and I just can't bear it anymore. 

Earlier today someone extremely close to me, someone I deeply love said one thing which tore my last strand of hope. Yesterday we got into an argument about feelings and expectations within the relationship, and he brought up my abusive marriage. I have told him in detail about my troubled childhood and abusive relationship, and yet to make his point he very easily said that 'you getting into an abusive marriage was the result of your impulsive behaviour', despite the fact that he knew under what circumstances the marriage happened. Him saying that broke my heart, he knows that I did not act on impulse yet in that moment he made me feel like I was responsible for choosing to be in an abusive marriage. I do not have words to express how shocked I was, when even after telling every detail someone can misunderstand you in this manner what hope is there for anyone else to show you compassion. 

I know one should never expect anything from anyone, but am I so fucked up that the closest person to me won't even believe my words. Sometimes I feel the world wants me to become as heartless and selfish as it self, I have fought so hard to keep my emotions intact  to never lose compassion no matter what, but maybe I am just not deserving for it to be reciprocated back.",30Nov2020,1
6,"Ok so I’ve been struggling with what I think is depression (I haven’t been diagnosed so I don’t want to say that I have it) and suicidal thoughts for 4 years and then self harm for the past 5 months. I’m 17 and live a good life, no one, except reddit, knows about my struggles.

As a child and today, I’ve always been super independent, never asked for help even if I need it, did everything all by myself, procrastinate a lot, disliked physical affection and so I guess my parents didn’t give me much of it since I didn’t want it. I had lots of friends, more than I have now. My parents got divorced when I was three, I remember crying every time I had to leave one of my parents (every other week, the divorce was mutual and no fighting or anger occurred) but I think I was just doing the same thing as my older sister cuz I didn’t know how to act. My personality type is INTJ (don’t know if that helps but yeah)

Does anyone know if the reason I’m struggling today could be because of how I was as a kid? Or does anyone else have a similar experience? 

Thank you in advance, sorry if this question is stupid.",30Nov2020,1
7,I ghosted my highschool therapist after feeling invalidated by her which I guess kind of goes to show my communication skills aren’t the greatest. I’ve recently been seeing a new therapist and while I tell her some things I feel like I can’t express myself fully she tells me oh you can spill to me whatever you want to and I just don’t want to. She constantly asks me how things make me feel and I constantly feel like that question just leads me to more brick walls. I can’t tell if I should continue to look around for a new therapist or just maybe tell her that asking me how I feel makes me uncomfortable. Idk I struggle with this a lot in my daily life and I have a lot of darker emotions that bubble up snd go away that I can’t pin point why or where they come from and I struggle to express them. I sometimes journal but the most I’ve ever said in my journal is just talking about how I’ve spent the past 9 years wanting to die and now my eyes have been opened and I don’t want to die but I don’t know what to do. I guess I’m kind of rambling here but should I keep trying or keep looking until I find someone I can feel comfortable with,30Nov2020,1

9,I am a freshman in highschool. I’m so lucky to have started highschool in the middle of a global pandemic. Now we have a system of “hybrid learning” where last names A-L go monday and tuesday. M-Z go thursday and friday. We have recently switched to all virtual and are now going all 4 days on zoom calls and googlemeets. The amount of work we do is insane. I feel like I’m not learning anything and I’m just rushing to get everything done. We have something around like 26 assignments per week. Out of 8 class periods. I do homework every single day of the week and when I finally finish on Sunday It just starts all over again. I end up crying everyday while doing homework. I have no motivation or energy to do any of this. I’m so overwhelmed. And there’s nothing I can do about it. As i’m writing this I have a 300 word essay to do and 2 art projects to finish haha.,30Nov2020,1
10,"I need to know who’s right and who’s wrong:

Literally I’m riddled with anger and confusion. I’m 14 years old and adopted from South Korea. I’m not really sure how to go about saying this. 

My mom used to be very harsh and strict when I was playing the violin. She would yell at me and tell me I wasn’t trying me. She would get mad at me if I didn’t memorize my music. Sometimes she would tell me my playing was bad, or ask me to play for her before a competition and yell and say my playing sounded awful. She would bang on a desk and say “it sounds like this!!” Leaving me in tears. I’m not saying I was perfect either and I’m still not perfect. When I was younger I would have the silly spoiled moments and dumb temper tantrums over silly things. I would say the occasional “I hate you,” or “I’m so mad I’m gonna kill you” because I didn’t get something simple I wanted, but that was all before I was like six, so I never meant any of it, and they never took it seriously. 

Now, my mom doesn’t watch me practice anymore, but when she does and if she critiques me, I find myself freaking out at her, and saying she’s being rude when she definitely wasn’t. I don’t know why this happens. I’m very sloppy too. I don’t clean up after myself and they’re constantly telling me to clean up things and I forget. Some of the time, I get mad at them in response. I have no idea why. I’ll say something like “it’s not fucking disgusting, like you said, it’s just a bit messy.”

My mom doesn’t have proud moments either. Like one time I messed something up in coding class, and she screamed at me, calling me a “stupid fucking worm.” 

Confused. 

We’ve all had our wrong moments. I’ve had arguments with them on the phone with friends (meaning I was arguing with my parents in person while my friends were secretly on the phone) and they’re all telling me that my parents are the toxic ones, and that I’m absolutely right. I don’t feel like I’m the right one though. Like sometimes my mom will apologize for something, and then do it again immediately. 

I need to know who’s really toxic from this information. I’m scared: 

I was suicidal last year. I came close to killing myself several times. I never attempted tho. My parents were obviously upset, but my mom sometimes tells me  “you better not have breakdowns in school this year, because you’re in high school and applying to boarding school,” and the “man up” comments which always destroy me. I also remember (I came out to them as gay two years ago and they were accepting 100%) telling my mom I was questioning whether I was trans or not, (I’m 100% not) but she said YOURE NOT TRANS. YOURE NOT. IM PROTECTING YOU. 

Another time, I asked my mom if I could stay up later and she told me to go to bed, and I refused because I was busy writing a script with my friend which we don’t have the opportunity to do very often (keep in mind these friends are friends I see once a year for a day at most, and I do talk to them a. Lot, but it’s super hard to just hang up) , so then we got into a really bad argument and suicide came up, and I started breaking down and she imitated my crying. And saying “WHY DONT YOU HAVE A SPINE, huh? YOHRE SO SENSITIVE) 


I don’t know how to feel about this. These are all some examples of times that both me and my parents were wrong.",30Nov2020,1
11,"Hey. Since I started my senior year of high school virtually back in mid-September, I feel like I’m headed in a downward spiral. At the beginning, I was keeping up, getting things in on time, and was even able to attend track practice (mask was off only when we were running), and my grades were doing just fine. I was feeling pretty good for a while, but then stuff started to “slip through the cracks.” I was turning in assignments late, not sticking to my schedule, and I wasn’t doing as much as I needed to in the day. I wasn’t happy with how that was going, which only made things worse. I felt even less motivated to do my work on time, pay attention in class, and generally do anything. Around the end of October, my family got the news that a family member had passed away. Shit really hit the fan. Right now I’m sitting on about ten missing assignments, one of which is over 3 weeks late at this point. My school got shut down because of a few COVID-19 cases, and as a result, the recently started cross country season had to stop. 

Since then I just haven’t been able to do much. I wake up each day, tell myself what to do, but when I have to do it, I choose to just not to. I knowingly make the choice fully aware that I should be doing my work, or going for a run. But I can’t find any energy to do what I really want anymore. Each day the dread of school keeps growing in my head because I just can’t will myself to do the work at this point. I can’t bring myself to do much that I really love to do. Yesterday I was supposed to work on my missing work and run. I only ended up getting out to run, and just getting out to run took the mental strength I had for today. I wanted to do the same today, but much of the same result. I’m now sitting in bed, typing this out, not having done a luck of my schoolwork, not having run, or done anything productive. I hate it. But I can’t bring myself to do anything at this point. This is easily the worst I have ever felt mentally in my life. And I feel like I can’t do anything to get out of it. 

That’s pretty much my rant. Hopefully shit gets a little better soon.",30Nov2020,1
12,"I am 21 years old and just graduated. However, because of COVID, everything went to shit; my graduation got cancelled, I lost my job, I became suicidal again.

Like, since August, I've have so many job rejections, ranging from retail to the job I studied 3 years for. It is so soul crushing.

14,"Angels have been talking to me, which is a pleasant surprise from the demons I usually hear. They’ve been quite a help, they understand me more than people seem too. I know that they probably are hallucinations, most likely at least. I don’t want to believe my new found friends are hallucinations, they are the only thing getting me through my depression right now. I’ve stopped taking my medication for the past two days so that they don’t go away, if they fade away then I will continue the poison I suppose. The angels and I aren’t hurting anyone, so it’s safe to keep them around. I’m not a very religious person, actually I am agnostic, so all of your portrayals of angels is probably very different than mine. You may be asking why label them as angels if I am agnostic, and you have a valuable question, the answer is simply because they claim to be other worldly and are very nice; the exact opposite of the demons I often hear who claim to be demons, that they are after my soul, and try to get me to kill or hurt myself. They might be a part of my schizophrenia, or schizophrenia could just be some made up excuse to keep us from interacting with our worlds, who knows and who is to really say. Whenever it was negative only I was set on it being schizophrenia, but I feel like I am starting to see it more and more as I type this out even, everyone precivesm the world differently than others and our experiences of “this world” is only semi shared.",30Nov2020,1

my issues:

\- No motivation. Struggle to even get out of bed in the morning.

\- Plenty of things that I want/need to do but just can't be assed.

\- feeling down for absolutely no reason.

\- Intrusive thoughts 

\- General negativity and pessimism for no real reason. I can't think about ANYTHING in a positive way anymore, I only see negatives.

\- Worrying: I worry about upsetting or burdening people with my issues. I worry that nobody cares. I worry that I'm going to make the people that I care about worry over me. I worry that my mental state isn't getting better; which quite frankly, it isnt.

I've been feeling like shit after two weeks of exams, toxic single mother alway telling me I'm not enough...

Anyways, today I went Richmond park for a trip, it was very nice there haha. Okie so on my way home I decided to get a co op meal deal and go to this little secluded park in the place I live.

I'm there for about ten minutes until I see two of my friends come with my ex friend, she used to be my friend until I said stuff about feminism that she didn't like too much, the other two didn't mind, were still very very good friends.

I walk over to them, my ex friend asks why I'm here and told me to go back and listen to my music and eat my food, at that point I told them I'm sorry but I had to go.

I left the park, on my bike of course, and on my way home for real now I sent my really good friend a few voicenotes on insta, she listens to them. I told her how sorry I wasn't I wasn't in the mood to be around my ex friend, the vibes aren't nice.

I can't stop thinking about this, I talked to her all day about it, she tells me not to worry about it but I genuinely feel shit about it.

You can find out more about my ex friend if you look at my other posts on the subreddit r/mentalhealthuk  btw.

Anyways, twenty mins ago I was talking to my really good friend over insta, she falls asleep while we text.

My ex friend took her phone to message me from my friends account and tell me that she fell asleep, I think she might be looked at my messages, I told her to tell my friend that I'm sorry, she just says okie.

She said:
""She's too tired to deal with this again right now
She's falling asleep
She was starting to answer but isn't in the right mindset to do so""

20,"Hello. I'll try to keep this short. I'm 22 and he's about 10 years older than me, I play bass, he plays drums, we jam together and hang out. Now, we've been playing for about a year and a half now, and everything was normal. We drink a beer and play, then hang out after, drink a coffee or something and I go home. Because of the pandemic, we play less often, but I also got a job recently so we play even less. He lost his job around a year ago, he lives with his brother who pays for food and the bills. He watches conspiracy  theory videos on youtube all day every day. The last couple times I went over, he started talking about some conspiracy theories (5G, Corona, vaccines, politics, etc) and I don't believe in them so I told him I don't want to talk about them, I'm not interested. He stopped and we talked about something else. The last time I was there, a few days ago, at first everything was normal, but after we played and sat down he just snapped, started screaming at me, telling me the whole world is a lie, that everything is a lie, stuff about the bible, life and death, that I need to inform myself... every time I tried to say something he started yelling ""inform yourself, inform yourself!"". He said he saw God and we're all going to die. At some point he stopped, I guess he saw I was kinda shocked. We said our goodbyes and I went home. Today, he came over to my place (death in family, to pay respects) and he was normal, talking with me and my dad, and again, at one point he started talking about god, and that everything is a lie, that we don't need to eat because everything is an illusion... my dad gave him counter arguments and every time he started screaming ""inform yourself, inform yourself, open your eyes"". It was getting worse, he started crying and praying that god opens our eyes, that we think he's crazy but he's not, he mentioned starvation and death... we were trying to calm him down but again he started screaming... at some point after probably an hour of arguing he stopped talking and went home. We were literally watching him go crazy infront of us and didn't know what to do, he wouldn't let us change the subject, after he left my dad told me he needs help and that I shouldn't hang out with him anymore. I don't know what happened, he's never been like this, he told us he saw god, 5 years ago he was trying to meditate and when he opened his eyes he saw god, I'm guessing he passed out or he was high on something, he claimed he was sober. Also he told me that he's tried a lot of drugs in the past, and still does some of them. My dad said we need to tell his dad what happened tonight and last time I was with him. What should we do?

22,"I know of course for any parent to find out that their child is harming themselves it would make them sad and disappointed. I just can’t handle the thought of my mom knowing about it and I don’t know what she’s really thinking. I cut my thigh really bad and I’m so afraid I’ve ruined my leg and that the scars are going to be awful. The cuts were worse than I had ever done before and I felt like I had gone insane. 

The shame and guilt I felt immediately after doing it broke me down enough that I had to wake my mom up at 3am to tell her and show her the cuts. At first she said they didn’t look that bad and she helped me calm down, but I still think about the cuts all day and how they’re going to heal. My mom has been asking to see them every once in a while for the last couple days to see how they’re healing. When I showed her today, right as she looked at them she put her hand on her forehead like she didn’t know what to do or say. But at this point she had already seen the same cuts multiple times. 

When she did this my stomach dropped and I just feel horrible right now. She keeps telling me “please don’t do that’ll yourself” but hearing her say that to me makes me feel even more guilty, it makes me hate myself for having done it in the first place and the first thing my mind goes to is that I should harm myself again because I’d deserve it. But obviously that’s not the solution I want. 

I don’t know what to do with this guilt right now, not only do I feel so ashamed, I’m so scared for how these big cuts on my thigh are going to heal. None of my other friends even know that I’ve done this stuff because I hide it by wearing long sleeves and pants, but I’m afraid these scars are gonna last forever and it’s gonna be an embarrassment. I wish I could go back in time so bad to undo it. Or to go back before I even started cutting to just never start doing it. I always tell myself I won’t do it again, then I find myself doing it and it does nothing for me but give me unbearable guilt. 

My mom also told me she’s emailed a few physiologists/counselors that she’d set me up an appointment with, but I don’t even feel comfortable talking to my mom about this kind of stuff. I’ve talked to counselors before but it just makes me uncomfortable, I wish I could just forget everything and be fine. The only problem is that I WANT to talk to someone, I really want to fix this and feel better, I’m just not comfortable talking to anyone. 

I’m not sure if you guys have any advice or if anyone else has had the same sort of experience to share as it does help to hear that other people can relate to me. Or maybe if there’s someone I could talk to on here, since my burner account is anonymous, it’d be easier for me to talk about this type of stuff. 

TL;DR: I’ve cut my legs really bad and I’m afraid it’s going to scar really bad. Not only that, I feel unbearable guilt about how it’s made my mom feel that I do this. I feel uncomfortable talking about this to anyone but I still really want to talk to someone about it. If you have advice or similar experiences to share I’d really appreciate it.",30Nov2020,1

25,"In the first place,I want to tell you that It's very possible to suffer from depression.My former therapist said that I have depressive tendencies.

After a lot of documentation I realised that it's possible to suffer from high-functioning depression.In short,I feel very empty inside and I'm not taking pleasure in any activity.

My problem may sound strange and it's hard to explain,but I'l give it a try.

I have those moments in which I live in different scenarios for a few moments.
For example seeing an old man would trigger a scenario in my head were I would be lonely all my life and I will live in misery.

Even in the good times,encountering a trigger would make me to live a moment from my childhood for example which wasn't necessarily bad or traumatic,but I will associate it with loneliness,monotony and sadness.It hurts,it hurts a lot because mentally it feels very real.Those ""triggered"" memories brings me a cascade of bad emotion and thoughts.

Another example is linked to the road to home.Seeing some old buildings immediately would make me to remember how lonely I felt while walking in that place and how no one is at home.Or if I walk beside those buildings and an abandoned apartement will appear,I will immediately imagine myself as an old guy sitting in the apartment being lonely and unhappy.

Hell,even practicing my hobbies became somewhat awfull. As a electronics enthusiast,everytime when I work,I feel as a boring human being who would end up alone with his stupid circuits,devices and ideas.Imagining a weird scientist who died alone in his old lab.

I have an awesome Gf,I love her very much,we are living together(but the emptiness and loneliness still persists).I don't consider my childhood very bad,even if it had it's unpleasant moments.

The thought of her leaving me plagues me to the bone because I remember how alone I was before being with her and how bad everything it felt.

I don't know if this is a real condition or if is linked to my probable depression or it's normal.

TL:DR:I live in some kind of weird,easy to trigger scenarios were I imagine myself miserable and it brings me a cascade of bad thoughts and feels.",30Nov2020,1
26,"I’m 19 and I feel like I’m at a dead end. I know everyone says I’m young and that there’s a lot to life, but is there? 
uni is just not working out for me, I have no money, no job and no motivation. My social anxiety stops me from doing anything, and I can’t get a job because I have barely any experience and no social skills. The worst part is when people think you’re being lazy when your thoughts are the very thing that drags you down every single day. The smallest things have become so difficult, like getting out of bed, putting on a smile and just having motivation.
I keep wanting to disappear, but how. Every day is the same. I wake up, my heart heavy, dragging myself to do almost nothing all day, still tired and then doing the same thing the next day. I feel like I only have myself, even when I’m surrounded by amazing people. They just won’t get it, whatever they do they’ll succeed. But me, I’m incompetent just like people say. I can’t seem to think about anything I’ve done that’s worth calling an achievement. I have no hobbies, no past and my future still blurry.

27,"I love my Mom but she refuses to help me with my mental health.

Here's some background Information; Ever since pre-school, I've had trouble making friends because Im extremely shy and when I did make friends I was a pushover I never felt like I could say no or do what I wanted if they wanted to do something else. Ive never been a good student, I just never paid attention, I remember one teacher would bang on my desk if she saw I wasn't focusing. I always felt like I was never smart, aside from reading I took a long time to understand a thing (I still barely know any times tables). Luckily in middle school, things changed my grades were decent and my parents were proud. But as happy as I was with my good grades I didn't have any friends, literally zero. I felt like I couldn't talk to people and I didn't, during 'group' work I worked alone unless someone was forced to work with me, and I ate lunch alone or went to the library. It was hard being alone so much I felt like I had no one but I didn't want to be a burden to my parents so when they found out I had no friends I said I liked it that way. Fast forward to high school and I'm still in the same place, I have no friends. Only now I've added on more problems I can't sleep at night I eighter feel like I'm a failure and I could have done more, or get this sudden burst of energy/excitement to pace or hop while listening to music (although this happens in the day too) and my mom hates this. It feels so hard to concentrate during class I've been on the brink of failing two. Now I feel like I have nothing before If I didn't have friends I at least had academics, now I have neither. I've tried telling my mom maybe therapy or counseling will help but she only says things like ""you need to fix yourself"", ""No, you're lazy"", ""You act like a crazy person"" but the most hurtful thing she said when I was pacing/hoping was ""You belong at John George"". I feel like it's not worth telling her things at this point. I've started to feel like maybe I am lazy and I'm causing myself problems. Am I making a big deal out of all this? Should I try to bring it up with my mom?",30Nov2020,1

29,"I literally just got out of a friendship with a man who I have been friends with online because of me being emotionally vulnerable. I said something to him that was very shitty, to be fair, but what I said to him was coming from a place of extreme despair. I essentially shamed him for having a father in his life while I do not. My father has been dead for 4 years now, from cancer. I'm a bi man in his 20s.

Why do we must always walk on eggshells when it comes to being vulnerable among her friends and family? Why is it such a burden for men to always talk about their emotions with other men? I'm sick of the shame. I'm sick of people yelling at me because I ""vent"" too much. It's called being a friend. People are allowed to dump all their emotions on me and I just sit there and take it. But when I want to have a conversation after a week of no conversation? I'm the worst person in the world. I'm needy. I'm emotionally unstable. I'm whiny. I'm weak.

I'm sick of this. Friendship has it's pros and cons. You can't have both without the other. People make it seem like talking about emotions and listening is a such a difficult concept. People only want you when you're strong but when you're weak? You're just trash.

8 years of friendship. Thrown away over nothing. No, I should not have said those hurtful things to my friend. Yes, I have apologized. Yes, I have given context. I had to build a Christmas tree with my mother alone without my father. Again. Another Thanksgiving without my father. Another December birthday without my father. Another Christmas and New Years without my father. I was in deep emotional pain. No, it does not justifying shitting on my friend for having a father and ridiculing him but what the fuck? Am I not allowed to fail? This was not a common occurance, even though he felt like it was.

I'm done with fake people. I'm done with being emotionally vulnerable with people that only want me when I'm strong. Nobody is gonna get anywhere if we keep up this myth that discussing emotions is something that should only be done in the therapist's office. I have been going to therapy for months now after hitting rock bottom and surviving a suicide attempt. I have made progress. I am more emotionally stable because of therapy. I can honestly say therapy saved my life.

But I guess it's not good enough. My friend ditched me for anime. God forbid I send my friend a message when he's watching a damn cartoon. As if my life is worth less than a cartoon. Wow. I'm just tired of the fakeness. So many times he would tell me it's okay to vent and it's okay to talk about emotions. This man would parrot bullshit about how toxic masculinity is shit and we all gotta talk more but he was fake as fuck.

I'm done. This is a whiny vent post. I don't care. I'm sick of it. Stop brushing off your friends. Listen to your friends that are in pain. Men that are struggling with emotions are not burdens. So many men deal with their emotions with drinking, drugs, or just outright anger. Men aren't given any positive outlets to deal with their emotions.

Therapy? Stigma. Being vulnerable? Get called a pussy. Actually have a shitty day and say a shitty thing? Instant loss of friendship. The burden is always ALWAYS on the victim. I'm tired.

Shit isn't gonna change because people don't want to stop viewing men as strong, stoic rocks. My friend's mistake was he was listening to me vent by his own choice but he wasn't asking me listen to his own venting. He just buried his fucking emotions and then got angry when someone else DARES to have emotions too. I'm fucking done.

Fuck toxic masculinity. Fuck the concept of emotional labour. I'm fucking sick of it. I'm tired of people abandoning me just because I talk about how I feel too many times...even though I don't. Everyone else can vent and share feelings but me. Anyone else but men.

34," I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this on?

(Context I'm a late 20s 5ft woman)

Long story short, I was walking home in the early evening and crossed the street in an underpass, there was a guy wearing a hoodie and those kind of fabric facemasks that basically conceal your whole face at the other end of the underpass and when I got to him he stood in front of me and I kind of tried to side-step him but when I had my back to him he shouted ""give me your bag and that"" and I screamed and ran and he ran after me but  never touched me then just stopped and turned around when I had gotten out of the tunnel. It happened quite close to a police station so I was planning to walk to it and see if it was open, but I saw some police crossing the road as soon as I was out and flagged them down and told them what happened. They went down to talk to him and then came back to say they think he was obviously struggling with his mental health or had taken something judging on his responses to them but I could still press charges if I wanted to.

They have asked me if I want to to give a statement/file a complaint but I'm not really sure what to do because if it's someone with mental health problems I don't want to give them a criminal record or anything (he was quite young -deffo 20s). I've struggled with my mental health in the past and I wouldn't want to make anyone's life worse or ruin future prospects because of it because I get it isn't ""you"", but I was also absolutely terrified and I feel like I should report it?

Because of that past experience, I'm very wary of telling therapists/doctors anything. I've stopped going to check ups/physicals at the doctor because I hate it how doctors seem to never take my word and instead (incorrectly) psychoanalyze me. Should I try going to another therapist, or should i just throw in the towel and assume that it's maybe not for me?

39," So around a year or so I started dating this girl. And it was my first relationship and I thought it was be really fun. We would go out on dates, I would get her gifts. The normal fun stuff.
But soon not long after, she started to show some problems with her personal life. And eventually I got to learn that she was being abused by her family and bullied by her school peers. We go to different schools, so I didnt know at the time.
 And as her boyfriend, what else can you do for your SO than to make them the best they can ever be? Or make their lives so much better?
 Soon after I discover that, some people started texting me saying they were gonna tell her parents she was in a relationship, also shes not supposed to be in a relationship.
 But some how, I get them to stop messing with her, and this happened another 2 times. But after that, I though that was the end too. 
But soon she starts telling me that my previous crush that I asked out, says that she was bulling my gf. So being a stupid little 14 year old. I asked my previous crush about it and she said she didn’t do it. But we got in an argument anyway. And I dont think shes bulling her, but I believed it back then, and now Im still struggling for her to forgive me. I really wish she could.
And later stuff like this would happen all the time, whether with my crush, her family, other shit. And her bullies, that are her friends now apparently, kept pressuring me to solve all of her problems. So I did. And I couldnt anything of course since it was a long distance relationship. And the fact that I couldnt do anything, but was expected to do sum. I was stressed and burned out constantly. But then I realized some times ago, WOW. This isnt good for my health huh? So I tried to fix it by talking to family more, becoming more interested in my hobbies, making new friends, a good start. But everytime I tried to do that, either my gf or her friends still kept yelling at me to make my gf feel better. So anything I did to make myself more mentally healthy, was thrown out the window. And now, the friends I mentioned  are all gone except for one, and hes an asshole anyway. Her parents still abuse her, and Im only left to watch. Powerless to fo nothing hut watch, and cry. Eventually I did tel her enough was enough, and that I would break up with her to make myself happier and also her problems were her responicblity and not mine. But of course she didnt take it well, but I still live the same life. Her one friend always yells at me to make her life better, shes always presenting her problems to me, and all I can do is watch. I have tried yo help her out a little by giving her tips of what I think is good for mental health. But she listens, but at the end of the day, doesnt do it. And we almost have an argument every night cause of it.

42,"I'm not depressed (I think). The best way I can describe how I feel a lot of the time is more or less content but uneasy. I don't mean paranoia or fear of the unknown. It's such a baseline feeling. If my mind is heavily occupied with work or a task, I don't notice it but once my mind has a chance to think, it's immediately there. A couple examples...I always feel like I'm not reaching peak happiness because I know I'm just going to come down from that eventually. I can't get too excited about X because I have to do X afterwards (even if X ends up being a good thing). If I have a good day at work, I feel slightly down because I know the rest of the week probably won't be like that (even though the week ends up being the same or better). I feel like time moves incredibly fast. I feel like something minorly bad is about to happen (like something that would just ruin my day but not my whole week like a speeding ticket or a complicated work assignment.)

Basically I never feel completely at peace. 

I am two years out from an incredibly stressful time of my life that made my every waking moment in a state of mild to extreme chaos, so I must have residual feelings from that. I know I'm self sabotaging but not in a way that has any physical manifestations - my life is great and I don't want to change much of it. I just don't know how to stop. I've started accepting this as part of adult life like I'm supposed to feel baseline stress or unease.

43,"Hi all, I'm a 21yo male and I've been dealing with what I feel like is depression ever since I was 10 years old. I specified that I feel this way because I am undiagnosed with depression. I would go see a doctor and find out but I don't have my own car, I live at home with a family that doesn't take mental health seriously, and I don't have health insurance.

The issue I'm hoping to resolve is this pattern of what I can best describe as a depressive spiral. I want to stop short of saying I have ptsd because I'm not a war veteran, but the symptoms are sorta similar. Something will happen that makes me really upset, and then my mind will just get flooded with flashbacks from the bullying I had to live with from 4th grade all the way through High School. For whatever reason my mood plummets and my body then loses energy and I just get really tired and really stressed to the point of where I can only lay down in bed. If I go to sleep then I sleep either freakishly long (10 to 11 hours) or in really short bursts (3 to 5 hours).

Yesterday I had one of these negative experiences. This girl I work with (who's usually very friendly towards me) just started blatantly avoiding me (like literally trying to hide so I wouldn't see or approach her). I tried to ignore it but all those negative intrusive thoughts started flooding my head. I hardly ever talk to her so I don't know what I maybe said to make her hate me? Either way, my mind took me back to that day in 5th grade when I sat down for lunch and all the kids at the table got up and walked to another table. I sat there alone crying and cried pretty much all day after school when that happened. I had some other flashbacks as well but I'm getting upset just thinking about it so I don't wanna share it (hell I could write a book about all the shit I've been through).

I'm trying not to ramble or make this post long but I'm tired of living this way and I want to stop these feelings and thoughts but I just don't know how and positive affirmations do nothing for me 

I understand that I can't make everyone like me BUT almost every rejection (romantically and platonic) wears me down more than the last, and as a guy whose been single for a year after my 2nd and last gf cheated on me (just like my first gf!) I'm having a hard time dealing with this. It affects everything from my friendships on down to my career. When my friends try to talk to me, or when I see a happy couple, instead of being happy I get all of these intrusive thoughts accompanied with flashbacks:

""Your friend doesn't care about you, he's just using you.""

 ""You'll never have a relationship, your too ugly.""

I tried a lot of therapists, it never worked. None of them seemed to know how to get me to find the issue.

I feel that I havent been able to enjoy my life for the last 20 years. Anxiety, fear of abandonment, doubt etc. It all comes down to that feeling of emptiness and loneliness in me. The fear of being alone in the world.

51,"Hi

35yo Male here.. 

 I'm feeling down and/or angst and/or sadness (lets call this my “down” state)  most days. Today is my best feeling day in around a week, yet I am barley feeling “OK”. 

What seems to be the smallest stressor (which when considered pragmatically should not even be a stressor) seems to trigger my mood from a what is a constant ""meh"" to the “down” state and often lasts for days at a time. Severity comes in waves throughout the day.

I don’t feel like there is a reason to feel this way. I have a really good job and a stable home life with 2 great (albeit challenging/full on) kids and a great wife. Health is otherwise OK. 

Communication with my wife could be better, as I haven’t been able to talk to her about how I feel emotionally. I really struggle to open up to ANYONE. We otherwise treat each other with love and respect. She knows I’m struggling to point, but I don’t think she understand just how badly. 

While the “pressure” of my job seems to trigger my “down” state more than anything, in reality it is a very easy-going job, with completely reasonable expectations and more than enough time to complete the work I’m given. Which leads to one of my biggest problems – focus. I really struggle to stay interested and focused on a specific task or project, unless I find it particularly interesting or technically challenging. This has led me to having issues getting through my work load, triggering my “down” state frequently. “Focus” has been a problem for a few years, but especially worse since COVID has me working from home most days. 

It’s not just work. Other things seem to trigger me and get me really down. Earlier this year we did some renovations and the small little elements of stress surrounding that caused the same problems. As do some social situation or times where I’m worried about being judged.

The thought of even talking to a doctor about any of this has me jittery.

Some days I feel a bit better than “OK” and convince myself everything is fine and to just keep pushing through it alone. Then it all cycles through again. 

I can’t remember a time in the last few years feeling really happy or joyed about anything, apart from a handful of moments lasting a no more than few minutes, usually seeing one of my kids especially happy or hitting a milestone. Things/hobbies that once interest me don’t really excite me anymore. Although that could just be the reality of not having time for those things with a young family. 

Sorry this was a bit of a ramble. 

Is this just what mid 30’s life is like with a young family or is there something wrong with me? How does one get the courage to seek help?",30Nov2020,1
52,"I don’t know where else to look. I have multiple chronic illnesses. Some of them physical but also some treatment resistant mental health related illnesses. 

I’m on various medications at the moment just to get through the day. I don’t take anything for my pain related conditions but I some of my mental health medications could technically help the physical pain as well (i personally dont find much and/or consistent pain relief from them). one medication is newly being used in mental health and has a strong reputation as a street drug. this medication saved my life and is the only reason inam alive today (i am prescribed all of these medications, take them only as prescribed (sometimes take half a dose or forget a dose depending), and i am monitored by general doctor, a psychiatrist, and a therapist. 

I am dependent on these medications in the sense that i will likely commit suicide without them, i can’t eat without them, I can’t sleep with out them. i dont crave them. i dont feel
a high for 98% of them and i absolutely hate the feelings when I do get high. 

My family doesn’t understand chronic illness, especially not mental illness. I had to stop telling them I was taking medication because they always assumed I was ‘on drugs.’

But most of all I hate that I need all of this just to survive the day. If I were to see someone else taking the amount of meds I do, I would assume they had a problem. I’m embarrassed that if I would never pass a drug test if needed. I’m embarrassed that I need all of this.",30Nov2020,1

54,"I've read a few posts on Twitter every now and then talking about how unfortunate hypersexuality is and how damaging it could be with someone's life and whatnot. So it got me thinking and reflecting on myself. Could hypersexual tendencies, inspirations, actions and fantasies stem from emotional trauma from say a relationship breakup? And is there a possibility that I could suffer with some form of it?

Disclosure: I myself have not been sexually abused so trauma in that context doesn't apply to me. 

Background: My self reflection is that I a 24 year old single male, has suffered through a pretty traumatic emotional break up from a long distance relationship when my ex cheated on me multiple times and ghosted me 6 years ago. As you can imagine that traumatized me and I'm pretty messed up now suffering with severe trust issues, lack of self esteem, unhealthy coping mechanisms and a bit depression. 

I've read some peoples input on how hypersexuality can be a trauma response in that it's a result of being conditioned to believe that sex=love/affection or a desperate desire for control over ones sexual experience with ones body, or those who've experienced sexual abuse. So my input is I see the ""meme"" of ""I don't want to be horny, I just want to be happy"" really relevant to me. I admit, I love to stay on twitter and various other nsfw art websites and just enjoy the content, just digital/traditional art in general and fandoms I kind of spend a majority of my time outside of YouTube and video games every now and then. It kind of hit me where some articles mentions an addiction to masturbation or fantasies and that I do tend to go and rub one off at times when I'm bored, depressed/sad or just wanting some serotonin more than once which is a lot actually... So in essence can and is hypersexuality be a response to trauma?",30Nov2020,1
55,"Hi everyone! I’ve been feeling very pensive lately and it might just be the changing weather and my SAD, but does anyone else feel melancholic/empty/nostalgic when looking at flames (candle, fires, etc) or grey/overcast days over a frozen and barren winterscape of dead trees and fresh snow?

56,"to give some context, i’m a 16 year old girl coming from an incredibly privileged family. i guess my one distinguishing trait is that i’m smart, the result of which being that i understand myself on a deeper level than most people are capable of understanding themselves. i tell this to myself to justify my desire to off myself and have fully convinced myself (whether i’m right or wrong in doing so) that my suicidal feelings aren’t a result of mental illness, but rather logic and profound self awareness. 

in school, i’m mostly taking college classes because of the fact that people assume that my intelligence is an indicator that i have the executive functioning skills needed to handle said classes (i definitely don’t). my grades are shit and with every single breath i take i’m disappointing the people i care about, and even they’re willing to admit it. i’m completely emotionally detached from the world and don’t know if i’ll ever be able to love someone, that is, if they’re not already repelled by how incredibly fucking incompetent i am. 

about once a week i’ll slice myself like a goddamn pizza until the razor goes dull in an overwhelming bout of shame, frustration, and hopelessness. it’s super fucking asinine because i end up hating myself even more as a result, but it makes me feel in control and honestly there’s an appeal to losing myself in total poetic melancholy every so often. i’m still convinced, however, that this is because i’m the one person in the world who can fully understand how much agony i deserve to undergo. 

i’m the most self-absorbed person you’ll ever meet and on top of that i’m a liar, loser, creep, and fraud. i have zero capacity to achieve anything i want to achieve and in every possible sense, i’m a hollow vessel of a human being. i live an incredibly privileged life, yet i still somehow lack either the perspective or the character to be content. because of who i am, i know this’ll only get worse as more and more doors of opportunity close because of my inability to pull my shit together, so i’m seriously considering just biting the bullet and taking a few too many pills to avoid further disappointing myself and the wonderful people in my life who believed in me just a little too much. 

this isn’t a baseless desire to disappear from the earth, it’s a rational decision i need help making for the sake of my own dignity and the love of my parents and friends. i can’t possibly put into words how unbelievably shitty and incompetent of a person i am, so trust me when i tell you i can’t express it well enough to provide a good overview of my situation. i know i don’t have the discipline to do it anytime soon but i just love my parents and brother so much and can’t stand to disappoint and burden them anymore when i know that the very essence of my being is burdensome.

57,"I've been considering counselling to improve my confidence and manage mild - moderate social anxiety but not sure if its appropriate. It doesn't seem bad enough to be medically diagnosable, so am worried that counsellors might think its worse than it actually is? I'm scared that the counsellor might misinterpret something I say and decide I'm crazy or something. In other health services, diagnoses are based on an objectively verifiable test or scan, eg, the x-ray shows a broken bone, end of story. However, diagnosing mental health seems purely subjective, based on what you tell the counsellor and what the counsellor thinks of it.

It would be really helpful to hear people's experiences with counselling and related services.

I also lie a lot. I crave sympathy. I’ve told people i have schizophrenia. I go to the hospital a lot for not serious problems I have a surgery coming up that i don’t really need. and all that is pretty much for sympathy. 

i do lash out at people sometimes for no reason and i do get angry but i’m not a very compulsive person, i’m pretty good at thinking before doing something. i do have pretty intrusive thoughts but never really act out on them. 

paranoia- i feel like everyone i know of trying to drug me (no reason why) so i will not eat around other people and will not leave my drink around anyone (even my parents)

65,"I often feel sad and worthless but I have never had suicidal thoughts. I don't have trouble sleeping or eating. I am a generally humble/modest person that can be quite pessimistic at times and hard on myself... so I'm not sure if I am depressed or this is my personality or if it's because of all these events?

Since this pandemic started, I've just been hit with so much bad news. I was in my last year of pharmacy school, went through a breakup and was unable to complete my last rotation to which I was really looking forward to. This made me like I was at a disadvantage compared to my classmates that got to complete all their rotations. I ended up being able to graduated but without any convocation, grad formal or any celebration. Tbh, not a lot of people even know I graduated. I also felt like the school scammed me of tuition money, etc.

My licensing exam was schedule for May 2020 and if I passed I would have been a pharmacist in June/July 2020. This was delayed due to the pandemic which was inevitable and was reschedule to August for Part 1 and November for Part 2.

For the August exam, my site decided to not host the exam about a week before the exam and I ended having to write 4 hours away. Two days before the November exam, I found out it got cancelled for certain sites and that it will be either moved to February or May 2021. I am extremely upset and I believe this shouldn't have happened and all the stakeholders should have had contingency plans in place as this is no surprised and they had over 6 months to plan!

Right now I am working as a pharmacy assistant at a place I've worked at for the past 3+ years for half the wage of a pharmacist or just a bit about minimum wage. I feel I have an identity crisis and don't feel confident because of everything and I just feel sad and irritated at work. I feel no one really cares, including my friends since many of them got to write the November exam.

I am also disappointed in myself for focusing so much on my school and career as sometimes I feel I wasted my youth. I think I am young and beautiful with potential, but I chose to just study and sacrificed relationships and traveling because of it.

Now I am just confused with life and feel like I wasted a year. I get sad sometimes and I feel it is ruining my relationships at home and work. I also cry or feel like it almost on a daily basis. Sorry for the rant, but I just wanted to let it all out.

How should I approach life??",30Nov2020,1
66,"I'm not sure if this is the place or even website to start these daily updates (if anyone has any other websites where I could post these to some sort of audience, please let me know!). I've been inspired by Alivia D'Andrea's Glow up Diaries (here's the link if you want to check it out, she's so inspiring: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeaEjnOjZPw&amp;list=PLfn36H7xflCtSCETOvovYLDARI-QmHrpt&amp;index=2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeaEjnOjZPw&amp;list=PLfn36H7xflCtSCETOvovYLDARI-QmHrpt&amp;index=2))

Anyways, let's get into it. I want so desperately to feel on top of everything in my life, to not procrastinate, and be productive instead of wasting away my days on YouTube and daydreaming. I've made attempts to remodel myself before, but none of them had lasted longer than a week, tops. I'm honestly trying to figure out how to make good habits stick.

So, about me! I'm a sophomore at a prestigious high school, taking four honors and an AP course. I do well, get mostly As and B+s. But I'm a chronic procrastinator. It's been bad this year, as my classes are really ramping up in difficulty. I can't remember the last school night when I went to bed before midnight, and on average, I get 4 hours of sleep consistently during the week. It's not good. At all. Fortunately, I function well with little sleep, so I get by. But waking up in the morning is a beast, and although it doesn't bother me too much, 4 hours of sleep consistently is anything but healthy. I do have homework, obviously, but not enough that should ever keep me up that late. Procrastination is running my life. I become more and more addicted to YouTube and physically can't seem to stop at this point. I'm hoping that sharing this on here will hold me to some level of accountability and I can be more productive.

So, that's my first and most important goal: productivity (and sleep, a sort of effect of my productivity).

Next comes exercise. Now, let's get this straight: I'm no athlete. I did do training for my cross-country season over the summer, and while I hate cross-country itself (the stress from competition and meets causes massive anxiety for me), going on runs around my neighborhood and listening to music is quite enjoyable, if I have the motivation to get out and do it! Over the past couple months, I've stopped running completely, and starting tomorrow (hopefully!), I want to get back on the wagon. I think it will help my mental health and overall happiness.

My second main goal is exercise.

Now, I don't want to write a paragraph for each of my goals (since I'm actually procrastinating homework right now...) so I'm going to list my other goals that I can think of off the top of my head. Better hygiene (some nights I miss showering) and skincare, decreased anxiety (kind of a result of better productivity and exercise), and more time for reading and music (again, kind of a result of productivity) are the smaller goals I can think of at the moment, but I'm sure that there are more.

This, coming up is Week 1, tomorrow is Day 1. Before I sign off, I should outline what's coming up in my life. 

I have two weeks to study for finals, and since I've been on Thanksgiving break, no studying has taken place so far... productivity will be key in these next couple weeks so I can do as well as possible. I'm dreading these next couple weeks because I just know procrastination will make my life an anxiety and guilt-ridden hell. Hopefully these updates will motivate me to change my ways.

The other big thing that's even sooner is my driving test on Thursday, Now, I'm not going to get into my issues with driving, that's not super relevant, but I have always had an intense phobia of driving and even riding in cars, so learning to drive has been quite a struggle. Staying true to myself, I have procrastinated it quite a bit, so over this holiday break, MANY hours of practice have had to take place. I'm in a better position now, and honestly believe I can pass the test, but I just know my nerves are going to overwhelm me the day of the test. I'm paranoid that my anxiety will lead me to mess up and fail the test. But hey, I can't borrow worries, so we'll have to see how Thursday goes! 

Now, I'm not going to write oodles like I did today, I'm planning on writing a little bit for set categories each day, They're not set in stone now, but I'm thinking of having them as: news, sleep, exercise, productivity, mental headspace, fun, miscellaneous, and goals. Maybe I'll add in a song I'm into that day, since I'm a huge music nerd :)

Anyways, that's it for me for tonight. I'd love it if you would follow me along on my (hopefully successful) transformation. I'd love to hear feedback and maybe tips and advice on how to better myself more easily! I want nothing more than to become the person I wish I could be, but ultimately, procrastination and a lack of motivation is holding me back. I suppose that I should practice positive self-talk and say that I CAN DO THIS! See you guys tomorrow!

68,"I’m a 20 year old female, currently stuck in a rut and feeling really demotivated. I’ve had recurring clinical depression for six years, and am on antidepressant medication. I don’t really know where else to post this, but my life is an absolute mess at the moment. I want to get back in control of it but the last time I had control over my life was when I was severely underweight and suffering from an ED. 

I would wake up early in the morning, work out, never missed a day of school, was constantly getting A* grades, heavily restricted my food intake, aside from being utterly miserable from the ED and negative body image I was really productive, slept 6-7 hours a night and was doing pretty well. This hard work got me into a really good university which I’m currently studying at. 

As of now, my course is all online, so I barely leave the house. I am essentially sedentary, leave the house about 3 times a week to go to the shop to get snacks. I sleep around 18 hours a day, usually waking up at 3-4pm. I barely do any uni work, often don’t even attend my online classes. I eat almost exclusively junk food, don’t drink enough water, eat lots of sweets and chocolate and have takeaway food multiple times a week. 

I am currently a healthy weight for the first time in about 5 years (actually at the heaviest I’ve ever been which is hard to come to terms with - but my bmi is 19.8 so I can rationalise that I am HEALTHY, not fat etc). Still have a lot of body image issues.

I really want to make some lifestyle changes as I think this may improve how I feel, but I just feel so out of control of everything right now and also scared of getting BACK in control as this was what characterised my life when I was suffering from my ED. 

If you’d have told me 3 years ago that this would be what I’m like now, I’d be mortified. I’m the total opposite of how I used to be.

I want to try and do some form of light exercise. I really need to make changes to my diet (I have had breakouts and spots for the first time in my life, and through eating too much sugary food I’m getting cavities). I find myself hating healthy foods, hating vegetables, wanting only to eat greasy and fatty foods, and feel out of control of my eating habits. I eat what I want when I want now. With regard to sweets, if I don’t eat sweets/chocolate at least once I day I get serious cravings and often find myself eating multiple packs and bars a day. 

I think improving my diet will be better for my health overall and hopefully making these changes will make me feel a bit better in myself as this is what has helped when I’ve been down like this in the past. Although I’m not actually gaining any weight right now (though I have gained some since March), it can’t be good that I’m eating far more than the amount of calories I’m expending (and having most of those calories come from carbs, fatty and sugary foods).

I’m just seriously concerned about restricting certain food types etc again as the last time I tried to diet post recovery, I slipped back into calorie counting and ED behaviours very quickly so had to abandon the idea. 

Does anyone have any advice they can offer, or experience with dieting/healthy lifestyle changes after recovering from a restrictive ED? Thank you :’)",30Nov2020,1
69,"So like, I need to talk about this to ppl I don't know, because my family is of no help for this. I might sound like a cynical nihilist. That is because I am a cynical nihilist and can't handle all this other than with irony.
I lost my training as a nurse in February this year after my mental health worsened again, which I was about to work on but my superiors are c***s (sorry to say but I am angry af at them) so I moved back to my dad's house, who has the habit of not leaving me alone when I need it. I lived alone for two years and before that, I lived with my mom who always let me do what I want (not that this is perfectly fine, but I learned to be an adult), so I really don't need to be asked if I ate something, if I was outside, when I got up etc. In March, my best friend and only person I was emotionally really close to broke the contact after we drank and made out one night, possibly because her parents told her to, possibly because she's ashamed of what happened, idk and at this point idc anymore. After a big fight with my father, I moved in with my brother unofficially, which came out to be quite a nice time actually. It was the time of the lockdown here in Germany, and he was also left alone by his gf the day I lost my job, so both of us were heartbroken and neither of us had a job to go to (my bro sells furniture, so during the lockdown his company had to close their shops and pay most employees 60% wages for 0% work). From March to June, we were drunk the most time and grieving about our losses. In July, my bro had to move to another city, where I could not live with him, so I moved back to my dad. Meanwhile, I became addicted to drugs again, which hasn't changed until now and I guess won't change any soon. I live as a parasite, I can hardly imagine to work or go to school again, but ofc nobody lets me just keep living like that, since they pay my food and everything I use. I hate to be in this situation, but I also don't think I could work as cashier again without insulting the fist rude customer to the core and lose the job right away again. It looks like I'll go to school again to be able to study at a university (skipped in early grade 11 bc of my mental state back in 2018) assuming they even let me, but I have no idea if I can get my graduation while being completely dead inside. So it feels like I live in some kind of limbo (do you ppl call it limbo? I'm neither Christian nor speak English as first language lol) because I'm not stable enough to live and not desperate enough to die. I guess I just hope to find a pot of gold on the street, so I don't have to live of my father's and my grandmother's money and can still stay away from the normal people. I become really sad and panic when I think about giving life another try, because I know, how deep I might fall if I fail once more. My father and my grandmother kinda push me to start working again, which I completely understand but can't imagine, or start therapy again, which I can't while being on drugs, which they obviously don't know about. The pressure they put on me with all that is so hard for me to take, that I sometimes wish I was just ""brave"" enough to end my life (I certainly do not want to advocate or romanticize suicide, please do not misunderstand) since there is no way for me to escape. For months, I have been pushing away all my pain and the dark thoughts in my mind, being constantly high and pursuing my hobbies. If this all comes down on me, I don't know how to handle it. I don't even have the ambition to start over, what happened disappointed me so much, that my inner me doesn't believe I'll ever make it. I fought really hard when I was on my (until then) all time low in 2017/2018, and when it all seemed to end well in 2019, I thought the bad times were over and I had a bright and happy future. After starting nursing school, it was the best feeling I have ever felt, because I could do what I had dreamed of, I worked my first practical block on a therapy unit and it was all I ever wanted, I had the nicest people as patients and I always seemed to know the right thing to say and do, I was so proud when one of my patients told me in tears that I was the only one who managed to help her with just the words she needed to hear when she was near giving up. I felt like all the pain I experienced had now found a sense, like it was all good for something. I just can't take how unfair this all seems. I don't believe in destiny, so there is no superior power that could have decided unfairly. But I can't get rid of this feeling that this is just unfair. And I just don't have the power for a third chance. It seems like this is what I am meant to live like. Like a loser, alone. It's the same with relationships, there was no relationship I ever had, that was so close and loving, so honest and so important to me like the relationship with the friend I mentioned in the beginning. And now that even she left me, I am unable and absolutely unwilling to ever give my heart to anyone. I don't feel like there will ever be a human being that will not, sooner or later, take it and break it into little pieces. What this loss made out of me is a cold and bitter cynic, I have never been the person that explicitly wants to be alone before. I could not even take being alone very well. Now even two days with my brother is more than I can take without feeling uncomfortable at some point. This year made a completely different person out of me, and I sometimes don't know if this person can safely be thrown into society again.
I'll close now bc it's late and I need sleep, although I could maybe still write for another three hours. Sorry if this is not what belongs here. Just couldn't keep it all to myself anymore.",30Nov2020,1
70,"Hey guys.

A couple weeks ago I got the news that my grandma had covid. One week later I heard through my sister that the doctor said that she had a 10% survival rate.

And then I had the emotional breakdown of this year, I lived at my sisters for a while because my whole household had covid at that point and I just didn't get it. So I wasn't home. I cried my eyes out for 3 hours. Fast forward to last week and my sister jokingly said that I was apathetic. I then noticed that I didn't feel emotions, I only feel those big bursts like the news of my grannie. But before that was January and surprisingly that was sadness aswell. I just live in neutral, neutrals good and stable. But the thing is: it isn't good. I have a relationship that I have to fake for and I know it's morally best if I cut it off. But I just do what's the least trouble to go through and apart from that I really don't give a fuck.

If I think if I love my dad, I just feel the shame that I don't love him as much as I'd like to. The only exception in the entire world is my mom. Apart from that I just don't have a lot of warm feelings for people and it sucks. It seems that I got stuck in the temporary emotional detachment and I don't know how to get out.

I had that realization last week and I dug deep with the help of 3mmc and friends. 3mmc has let me felt emotions on a normal level and memories came back, mostly fucked up ones like as to why I listen hardcore/style. And it was to cover the screaming in the house. However it was a good night. I did get a serious panic attack the next day. I just want to feel normal again. Are there people who relate and know possible remedies?",30Nov2020,1
71,"Hi guys I’m new to Reddit.
 I have absolutely no one I can talk to. Some nights the suicide hotline was my only friend.
Guys I am so exhausted. It’s like I keep fighting and for what? No one treats me right. I’m not saying I deserve the world but I’m not even 25 and I’ve experienced so much trauma and I can’t take it. My 16th year was so hard for me and it hasn’t left me yet. I had to experience a pregnancy loss all on my own. It still hurts so bad! My peers thought it was funny and that’s what pisses me off till this day I am full of anger but it’s valid. I’ve been violated and it’s hard to see myself as someone that can be something some day. All I want is peace I try my best not to hurt anyone but I’m always being abused. I just want all of this pain to go away.",30Nov2020,1
72,"Whenever I start crying he just gets angry and yells at me and he doesn’t believe in mental illness at all, he believes you should just get over it and there’s people having it worse and people in this country have it too good. Its been like this for years and my mum passed away 8 years ago and I know she would understand. But it makes me realise why I tried to commit suicide 4 different times. Not only was my life hard but I couldn’t even talk to my own dad about it because he doesn’t believe in it at all. I’m 22 by the way.",30Nov2020,1

Though I’ve had a few flings since then, but I’ve always been followed around by this feeling of regret for leaving her. I’ve only recently come to the conclusion that I think it’s all because I fear not finding anyone as good/compatible as she was. Combine that with the lack of dating and loneliness because of COVID, and it’s been a rough few months. Any advice on getting through it?",30Nov2020,1
74,"One of my earliest memories was eating out of a blue airplane plate in my high chair. The next is getting my head bashed into a faucet by my mom's BF when I refused to keep taking showers with him around 4 y/o I think. That abuse continued until about 6 when he split. At 8 my mom nabbed another winner who beat the shit out of both of us. Lots of meth use and opioids between the two of them. From 8 y/o to around 15 I was forced to shop lift and return to stores for money to support thyer habit. All through the years emotional and severe physical abuse was a daily staple. First thoughts of suicide manifested at age 9 and continued throughout the years. At 17 ran away. Homeless for a while then joined the service. Married, started family, deployed, had child, deployed, had child, deployed. Never home , wife left. So much emotional scarring, wounds never had a chance to heal. Married again, wiser more mature gonna make it work this time. Literally the day after I open up about the trauma and Baggae I've carried for so long wife leaves me. Bad timing, I dont know. Due to the nature of my position I am the problem solver, crisis manager, putting all before myself. There is so much I could go into with the struggle but I'm numb, just keep pushing forward with life, with no outlet. Like everything is okay. I'm concerned once I settle down this is all going to catch up with me. I know it's all there locked away in whatever defense mechanism I've built through the hardship because I was never able to proccess it. How do I let this out slowly?",30Nov2020,1
75,"Hello Reddit friends! My mom is really really cool, though, overreacts when it comes to my mental health, BUT IT’S COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDABLE! I get it, so don’t say she’s bad or anything, okay?

First of all, I’m the happiest I’ve ever been ever!!! I’m extremely enthusiastic, and absolutely love life! There is... one, tiny, little problem... things will happen! Minor things, like a bad day at school, or just a bit of an off day, it happens!

But, I feel like I can’t talk about it... The last time I mentioned that I was a tad bit grumpy, my mom sat me down and spoke about going to the hospital. Again. For... the forth time. I don’t need that! The last hospital, I WAS FORCED INTO A RELATIONSHIP WITH A PERVERTED DEVIL WORSHIPPER!!! I’M A CHRISTIAN WHO ISN’T ATTRACTED TO ANYONE!!! And then-
ANOTHER PERVERTED GIRL CAME ALONG! I WAS IN A POLYAMOROUS RELATIONSHIP WITH TWO PERVERTED GIRLS!!! We didn’t do anything, but GOSH! They were vulgar!

For some reason that kinda traumatized me, and made me think about the possibilities... so, I decided to avoid the hospital best I can!

Basically, I want to talk about the negative things sometimes, but I don’t think I can because my mom will send me back to the hospital, what do you think I should do? Also, I have to keep a whole lot of things bottled up, my other support person, my sister, straight up said it annoyed her, I thought that was a bit rude, so I don’t talk to her too much anymore...",30Nov2020,1

77,"A while back I was diagnosed with PTSD, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, and panic disorder. 

They all feed off of each other leaving me in a near constant low and the manic episodes are nothing but anger, frustration, irritability and wanting to be away from everybody. 

I’m left constantly feeling useless, like I don’t matter, like nobody cares or wants me around. 

Nothing has helped so far. Any medications I’ve been on either do nothing, make my symptoms worse or just leave me too exhausted to function. 

Talking about everything to my mental health providers does nothing but make me feel even worse because I can tell they are just going down a list of things to go over and if I start taking things they don’t have in their list then they take the conversation back the other direction. 

I’m tired of it. It’s old. Nothing is changing. If it is then It’s getting worse. 

The only things that have helped slightly have been marijuana but not enough to make it worth it, especially since it’s still illegal in my state, nicotine helps some but I have to keep up a constant stream of it. 

Is there anything anybody ride knitted of that can help? The coping strategies I’ve tried haven’t helped and I don’t usually have the motivation to keep them up.",30Nov2020,1

It's been getting worse and worse and I don't sleep well and am not productive or very social anymore because of this. It's like my brain has an obsession with justifying the way that I feel. (example: I'm feeling depressed and then I obsess over scenarios that would ""justify"" me being depressed like the loss of a loved one) These scenarios play over and over in my head for weeks. I'm so lost on how to deal with this and cannot pinpoint why or how this is happening.",30Nov2020,1
79,"I'm a 20 yr old male, my family is filled with depression and ADHD, bipolar and other mental illnesses. 
I was misdiagnosed at 13 and given Alprazolam, 2 years later I was given Alprazolam and Clonazepam, by this time I was active in the drug community and actively trying new RCs and other drugs. I don't remember much of my 15-17 yrs, I was mainly fully barred out on 2mg Clonazepam 2x daily with 2mg xanax up to 3x daily. I stayed with good grades and graduated early (using Adderall, benzos, and weed) I started using benzos and pot at 13, loved the escape and high I got and stayed with it for years since they kept upping my dosage. I was given Adderall purely for (studying and staying awake during slow periods) I've only ever been formally diagnosed with PTSD, GAD, PDD. I suspect a bipolar disorder, but I honestly have a very difficult time in telling what my feelings are. I believe I found a term online called alexathemia, and it shows many of my signs, yet isn't a mental disorder. In all honesty, I felt fine before drugs I mean a bit on edge but what 13 yr old isn't. Now I am physically dependent, tapering for 2 years. I went 1 week without my script of benzos and was having hallucinations (like tv static) couldn't see colors, couldn't taste, and started coughing up blood. I very nearly died from choking. I learned after getting a camera stuck into my throat and stomach to check for cuts or anything at all causing blood pooling. Dr said something along the lines of brain bleed from stress and a seizure. Ever since then Ive made it a point to never miss a single day. I'm also on 300mg gabapentin daily to prevent another seizure, I'm now down to 2mg xanax daily with no Clonazepam. I've never felt worse. I've never fully tried SSRIs as I learned how to play drs very quickly and just tell them that I get adverse symptoms from every one they gave me. I'm more worried about the withdrawl symptoms, I have never felt so low. I've given it about 4 months now since I've had Clonazepam, I still cannot get over it and my Dr is hesitant on giving it back in any capacity. Therapy seems pointless, Ive lost a lot of my mental capacity and have trouble with basic math now, I graduated with a 3.7 gpa. I now feel as if I could never do such mental feats. I'm a manager in retail, it's the worst as you can probably deduce, always short-staffed, always overworked. I feel if I get off drugs I won't be able to handle a job. I haven't woken up sober or stayed sober in any capacity all of my teenage years and now I'm entering adulthood and feel as if I've done nothing. Self harm has ruined my confidence, under eating and sleeping makes my life difficult as I weigh 120 at 5'9 at 20 years old. So my peers are of a very different stature. The gabapentin helps me taste food again, but in general eating feels very forced and makes me feel very sick. Any info, resources, or any words of kindness are much appreciated.

Now I am on a new path. But I feel as if I am slipping away, slowly, slowly slipping away. I don't know what life is supposed to be, but the older I get the more I don't want to know. Does anyone know their path? At all? I feel so lost so so lost. The seasons and world will continue to turn, but what if I get left behind. Does anyone care? Does anyone carry actual empathy for others? Are there actual people who enjoy your presence alone, or they only tolerate you because you have something they need? That question has come up in my head far too many times to ignore. It seems I have slowly become a vessel for everyone to feel good about themselves. A vessel for people just to vent, so much so that they only ask me a question so they can answer it; so much so that when I do answer a question I can never finish responding because their insight is far too important.

But when my family or friends say anything nice about me I completely break down in tears. Sometimes even those “you’re doing great, now go drink some water” posts get me. I’m not a person who cries easily, up until this started I would go for months without crying. You could literally beat me up and I could keep a poker face. It’s just people being nice to me. Like, yesterday my friend said she thought I had pretty eyes, and I literally ugly cried for over 10 minutes. And it’s not just normal easily controlled crying, it’s full on bawling, with my hands shaking and everything.

I hate this mentality and stereotype because it reinforces the idea that people who work these jobs have ‘failed’ and that seeing your childhood bully ‘stuck’ in these jobs is almost like karmic punishment but the real world doesn’t work that way. 

I can’t get a job in the field I went to college for no matter how hard I fucking try because I’m simply not good enough and I’ve had to work on the depression and anxiety that comes with working retail 5 years after college.

I’m an extrovert and have never had any issues making friends, although i would say i have some social anxiety around people that i’m not that close to. 

I feel like I’m so close to having what it takes to become successful but this one thing is holding me back. I’m pre-med and have the grades and test scores to get into med school, but my resume is still lacking. It’s nearly impossible for me to get myself to shoot an email to a volunteer coordinator, or a doctor i’m looking to shadow under. In person I have no problem asking for these things, but when it comes to emailing, texting or even worse calling, it’s like pulling teeth. This also applies to situations such as asking a girl on a date over text. I’ll pick my phone up and stare at it, wondering what to say. Usually I end up saying nothing. How do I fix this?

I did not have a relationship with my dad, haven’t spoken to him in 6 years. I have been worried about him since the pandemic started and having dreams that something happened to him. About 2 weeks ago I brought it up with my therapist and I told her I was going to send him a Christmas card to open the lines of communication again. And then he died in his sleep the next day.

89,"I started slipping into a pretty bad depression over a year ago. I went to my primary doctor to get help and they referred me to our Mental Health clinic (in network). It was hard enough to even speak to my doctor to get the appointment but I was able to get myself to go. But then they wanted me to wait two months before I could even be seen initially! The frustration I felt was unreal. Here I was, finally reaching for help, and it felt like a slap in my face. 

I made the appointment but then of course in that long period I talked myself out of going. I convinced myself that I was fine. That I could get better on my own. 

So here I am, a year later, barely functioning and trying to get help again. Went to my doctor in early November and they gave me a referral for a clinic outside of my doctors network but that insurance would at least still cover. So this place gets my referral and I call to follow up because I haven’t heard from them at all. 

I am once again told that I can’t be seen anytime soon. I’m on a waitlist and they can’t get me in until at least sometime in January. 

I know places are overrun and busy because of the world event this year, but still, it’s so frustrating. I worked so hard to get myself able to make an appointment and able to actually go and now I feel completely hopeless. 

I feel like I’m not being taken seriously despite telling them how severe it is and how debilitating it is, yet because I am not actually suicidal at this point they don’t care. It’s so hard to cope, to even make it through the day, or even get out of bed in the morning. 

Getting help shouldn’t be this frustrating. I want to say I’ll make it until January but I’ll probably have talked myself out of it again. It just sucks",30Nov2020,1

91,"I became friends with this girl back in high school. I didn’t think that we’d ever become best friends but we did. She went to the local community college and I went off to a 4 year university. After getting her initial credits she applied at my uni and got in. I was so excited and she was too. When she moved here we hung out almost every single day. I was so happy she was here. It felt great to have someone that I trusted and could be open with. It wasn’t anything romantic, she was just a great platonic friend. We were both super bummed out when COVID made her lose her job and she had to return home. This was the beginning of the downfall of our friendship. 

I had just started a new job and she was focusing on transitioning to online classes. We’d text only a few days out of the week and it’d be dry. Then we started going a whole week between talking to each other. At that same time I had a lot of bad things happening in my family, not directly to me but stuff that needed my attention and ppl that needed my support. This led to me not talking to most of my friends for an entire month. I actually suck out counseling following this month bc I couldn’t deal with the things happening in my life. 

I did feel happy knowing that my best friend was moving back before the start of school, and that gave me some hope. When she came back we decided to go out to eat, but something was different. She was upset with me bc I forgot her birthday, but I had already apologized and tried my best to make up for it. The entire conversation she seemed annoyed with me and looked at me as though it was a chore to eat lunch with me. After lunch I asked her if she wanted to go to the mall or someplace and she simply said “I wanna go home”. She didn’t give a reason or anything, very unlike her. I thought maybe she was having a bad day and that I should give her space. 

A few days later I texted her asking if she wanted to get lunch. She told me no, and then left me on read. Fast forward 3 months to the present and she texts me occasionally to say “I miss you” but we haven’t hung out since that day. It makes me wonder if that was the day she got tired of being my friend. I don’t know if it was my personality or the fact I’m not the best looking guy. Maybe she was ashamed to be my friend, idk but I have no closure and it bothers me. 

Ik as a guy I’m expected to not care and move on with my life but I genuinely cared about her as a friend and trusted her with some personal information that I’ve never told anyone else so it hurts that she has kind of abandoned our friendship. To make it all worse she lives right across the street from me. I’m sorry for typing so much but as I type this im tearing up bc I never saw this coming. It makes me not want to trust anyone ever again.

My dad was super abusive when I was really little and I was “homeschooled” with him for first and second grade and I finally got away from him after he got arrested and felt safe and free as soon as my mom got full custody of me until I found out my dad killed himself, no note even, he had nothing to say to me and my mom, he never cared about us. My mom got super wrapped up in alcoholism right after, and since then it’s just been me and her. Don’t get me wrong, she isn’t abusive, just not really ever there for me you know, I can talk to her whenever I want to but it’s like everything I have to say just isn’t good enough to hold her attention, like I’m barely even there.

We moved houses this summer and I did all the packing, carrying boxes, and unpacking, I even fixed the walls and painted my room and hers, including the massive hole in her closet that went all the way through to the other side of the wall, but not only did she not thank me, she just went on and on for weeks about how unhelpful I was and how it wouldn’t kill me to do one damn thing for her, and then she betrayed me worse than I could have expected. She just left me here, she lives with her boyfriend now. I’m alone for days and days sometimes and I have nobody to talk to but my friends on Xbox and I don’t even like one of them, I just pity him too much to tell him how much I dislike him. My mom buys me food every once in a while, and she pays for my rent, but it’s like she’ll do anything she can to never be around me.

I have really bad anxiety and self confidence issues, and it took me half of my algebra class to build up the confidence to ask for a calculator one time, but I got so worked up that when I asked for it I messed up and people laughed at me, then I proceeded to fail the test. I’m a joke to everybody and I’m not good enough to prove them wrong. I don’t talk to any girls, everyone thinks I’m weird, I have nothing, and nobody.

96,"I am 19 yo male and I have been struggling with severe depression for around a year now and lost like 30 pounds. I graduated HS and took a gap year after moving to new country. Before the gap year I was pretty happy and was self-employed making good money. I have always struggled with isolation even though I am pretty social. During the gap year I have became pretty isolated since I was working and my family was too busy with their studies and settling down. Because of my personality which is ENTJ I feel really depressed when I get socially isolated. I also have rough time connecting with people on an emotional level and never really had a GF. For that reason most of my friends are significantly older than me. On of my best friends is a man in his 50s who was my employer and mentor we really connected since he had a young personality and always gave men manly advice which my father rarely provided me with. He was also isolated since he was divorced and his wife just passed away. He also helped me open a business which I am running while studying. RN I study in one of best universities in the world but I am not doing well I failed too classes and have to repeat the year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I have strayed from the main topic but I have trouble expressing me feeling since I feel often disconnected from my self. The main reason of my depression is feeling isolated not cuz of social anxiety but cuz when I sit alone for a while I get stuck with these emotions that I can't understand nor feel I even with figuring out my-self identity. Who I am? What I enjoy? What is my significance? I often push my self by speeding up the pace of my work and constantly engaging with the outside world and using anger and the fear of isolation to push my-self. But this strategy of ignoring my emotions is pretty exhausting since I can't enjoy life since I look at it through a logical spectrum not emotional to avoid feeling of disappointment. I think that having a significant over with a different personality than mine will help me explore the outside world through their spectrum and my inner world as well. I have also struggled with women since I am into women older than me like ( 7 years older) and have been out with them on some occasions.  The worst thing about my depression is the nobody is aware of it since I look really lively and joyful in social encounters. I have spoke with my parents and siblings about it but they just can't help me or maybe not taking too seriously.

I would really like to have a conversation with someone facing a similar feeling and exchange thoughts and ideas. No drama ofc.",30Nov2020,1

I want to vent. I want to talk to someone on the phone. I just want to vocalize this shit. I'm fucked up and going through a lot. My mother is trash. I'll put the convo below. 



You need to admit that your problem is destroying you because it is. You have to believe that it's possible to stop and that there's another way of living. You have to get help and do things differently. It's you, you're the one that has to stop. You did this to yourself. You're the one that has to make the choice every day not to do your pain pills or drink to excess. You can't keep blaming your behavior on everyone else like you've been doing. It's not your parents fault, not my dad's, Jerry's, or Alan's fault, and not my fault. You said I was on heroin. You drug my name through the mud to drink and get fucked up. Who knows what else you've lied about because you only fess up when you're caught. I will help you to change. I will not be around while you continue to stay the same. It's all on you. I do not want to lose you and I will if you keep this up. You know, I've never known you not addicted to something that I can remember. You've always chose substances over me whatever they may be. I hope I get to meet my mother someday.",30Nov2020,1
99,"I believe I am dead and in purgatory, and that everyone around me is either delusions or fellow souls. Either I am in some kind of personal purgatory, or just a large graveyard of souls. 
I also feel that everyone's care for me is a facade to build my trust, and they will all turn on me at some point and lock me away eternally, leaving me heartbroken and in eternal anxiety forever. (This also gives me the desire to end my life before it's too late.)

100,"I believe I have Adult ADHD. I filled out a questionnaire and scored very high. I'm almost always irritable, extremely irritable, I can't make up my mind, I can't shut my brain off, ever, so focusing on work, class, or even conversations with loved ones is really difficult. I retain very little information and have to take meticulous notes. I have a million reminders/alarms in my phone so I don't forget to do little things like taking out the trash or putting my frozen pizza in the oven once its preheated. (Yes, I've turned on an oven and spaced it for several hours before.)

I brought this up to my Doctor who said he doesn't want to go down that route so he sorta looked over it. I do think the ADHD symptoms is the cause of a lot of my anxiety which I believe is causing the depression. I've been on so many different medications and nothing works, most just make me feel numb and cause me to pack on weight. 

I really struggle most with people who are important: ie siblings, inlaws, coworkers. I don't get anxious AT ALL when dealing with patients at work or strangers. The less someone has a place in my life the more relaxed I am around them. The only exception to this is my boyfriend. Other than being with my boyfriend (and just my boyfriend) I would rather just be alone.

All in all I'm pretty desperate. Medications aren't helping and I'm starting to really spiral. I've tried therapy and it helps me feel happier and more in control with depression issues but the root of the problem is still there and I don't know what to do. 

Help. :(",30Nov2020,1
101,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I feel like it might be the best place for me to get some advice.

I'm really struggling with constant thoughts about how stupid and worthless I am. They start as soon as I wake up and continue until I finally force myself to sleep at some ungodly hour. I am hyper focused on my actions, thoughts, and on how much I understand the world around me. Whenever I watch a show, I try so hard to understand everything that's said, but I keep missing things, which causes this feeling of horrible, impending doom, and also tends to give me a headache near my temples. I get the same feeling whenever I don't understand anything else, or when someone says something smart that I didn't think of. I feel like I am incapable of stringing intelligent thoughts together, and I can't ever seem to defend myself in arguments. 

I'm only 21, but I also have an extremely horrendous memory. I forget things almost immediately after I've heard or said them. You might think I'm exaggerating, but I'm honestly not. Sometimes I feel like my brain is just completely empty of any knowledge at all.

This obsession with my seemingly incredibly low intelligence is destroying my sense of self-worth, which wasn't very impressive to begin with. My whole life I was a straight A honors student, and my family and teachers always told me I was smart and capable of great things. But every day I am forced to realize that I'm actually incredibly dumb. This is extremely emotionally painful, and I don't know how to break free of it. As this continues, I'm also getting more suicidal because it feels like I'm just a burden on my family and on the world. 

For reference, I've been diagnosed with clinical depression, general anxiety, social anxiety, and OCD. I definitely see a connection between this obsession and OCD related issues I've struggled with in the past, but I genuinely think I've actually just realized that I'm stupid, and I don't know how to cope with it.

I'm really looking for advice. I'm not really sure who I should go to for this issue. Should I see a therapist or a general doctor, or someone else entirely? I'm not seeking treatment for my other mental health issues right now because my therapist became too expensive. 

I hope all of this makes sense. I'm really sorry if it sounds dumb or if there are any grammatical errors, my brain feels like mush right now. Thanks.",30Nov2020,1

I have suicidal thoughts a lot and the only reason I’m clinging on to life is because I love watching anime and watching a certain streamer. I used to do very well in school but over the past 2 months when my emotions took a turn for the worse my grades have dropped a lot. I can’t find any motivation to do anything. I just enjoy sitting in my bed with some tea and sleeping. I love sleeping because it makes me feel comfortable like someone is hugging me and it makes me feel safe. If I’m being completely honest I’m not sure if I’ll make it past 18 and yea it’s probably just hormones but it feels real. I just want someone to give me real attention for my worries not just tell me that I’m not alone and that it will get better. I apologize for venting out but I just want someone to be there just to hold me and watch some anime with me. Recently I had a conversation with an imaginary friend I created.

112,"There was a sophomore female student and a senior male student.  The girl was successful.  I never knew her personally, but I know she was involved in so many extracurriculars and was great friends with many of my friends.  Nobody ever thought anything was wrong, she was always so happy.  She took her own life last Tuesday.  

The boy is pending.  He was found by his family, but it may have been too late.  He is currently hospitalized and they aren't sure he will make it.  Even if he does, the impact from it will certainly be permanent.  I did know him well, and never would have thought it of him.  He is a well-known, popular guy with tons of potential.  He attempted to take his own life last Thursday.

Watching your friends die isn't easy.  What's even worse is knowing it could be helped if we were in school socializing and able to provide in-person support to those who need it.  School is hell and teachers never seem to care, and they continuously pile work on top of us.  Most of us are failing.  An interesting trend is that both of these people tried while school was on break... almost as if they wanted to catch up first.

These precautions have hurt so many of us.  I know at least 2 other girls who I am close to that have confided in me that they attempted overdosing.  Countless other people are losing all hope... exhibited by them failing their classes and stopping all socialization.  We need to see our friends and we can't.  The protocol is put in place with hopes of saving lives... yet so many people are taking their lives or seriously thinking about it because they are lonely and overwhelmed.

It absolutely breaks me.  I want to be a good friend and be supportive to all of my friends.  But damn, we just need to hug, kiss, laugh, and cry together like teenagers do.  Our mental health is taking a toll worse than our physical health.",30Nov2020,1
113,"Hello my name is Jackson (18yo) and for 2 years now I haven't had any long lasting luck. I've been trying to get a job again. My last job was at a McDonald's and the reason why I left is because the managers forgot I worked there, I have had a few short term work placements here or there but I haven't been able to keep a job for more than 3 weeks. 

I started talking to this girl around 7 months ago during the first quarantine (this is in Australia btw.) And at the time I was having a hard time with a hospitality course at my local university I was depressed but I denied it anyway. It completely killed my passion for the hospitality industry and made me very unsure of my future. However after a short conversation and a lot of double texts I finally had my first proper relationship. It was filled with love and passion and everything in between. And even though we never took it past oral sex, I was happy. She lifted my mood whenever she was with me and we got along quite well, (she also showed me what I wanted to do in the future.)

 Even though I felt useless due to my lack of occupation I could still count on my friends, girlfriend and family to make me feel better. However after 5 months of dating this girl she got a job which meant less time together (we could barely see each other through the week to begin with.) And then Year 12 exams came along and soon everyone was busy. I couldn't spend time with my girlfriend and my family kept calling me the ""caveman"" because I would stay in my room all day to study. To this day I'm still considered lazy around the house even when I try so hard to show my capabilities. 

This motivated me to make myself useful so I studied harder and applied for more jobs. And then after 6 months of dating, my relationship started to fall apart, we broke up on semi-good terms but even today I still think about her. I meant it when I said ""forever."" It turns out the reason we didn't spend time together wasn't because she needed to study (she was quite okay with playing the PS4 all day,) it was because she was asexual. She didn't need me as much as I needed her and it hurt like nothing before when she broke up with me. I was proud of her for having the guts to tell me and not drip feed me love and affection. I look back on that relationship and all I can think of is how nice it was to have someone love me as much as she did. I fear I won't have that same connection with someone for a long time at this rate.

Lately it seems that no one wants to hire me. I have dozens of qualifications under my name and a resumé that even the careers counsellor would approve, but even when I am the first in to apply for a job I just don't get employed. My hospitality course has allowed no time for end of year celebrations. I haven't been able to attend parties due to a rule that means you buy your own food and drinks (and not to mention covid-19 restrictions). I feel out of place when I do attend parties.

I feel useless and everyday seems like I get to do less and less of what I love. I want to see my friends, I want to be loved, I want, I want, I want.  Life's not about getting what you want, you have to put in the effort to get what you want. I know that. But how am I supposed to when I'm not even given the opportunity. Next year I'll be moving out to the big city to do my teaching course and I don't think I'll have the funds to even dream that big. What started as an achievable goal has turned into a pipe dream. Can someone tell me that it's not my fault?!",30Nov2020,1
114,"Hi, I made an account for the first time to post this. I need some mental health advice so I'm trying something different. Sorry if this is too long or unorganized for one post (feel free to leave Reddit-related advice too because I'm not totally sure how things work here). 

For context: I know the best way to work on my issues is therapy. However, I have bad insurance and have struggled for months with no luck to find a consistent therapist who accepts my insurance, has availability, and has experience with my specific issues. I cannot pay out of pocket or get better insurance. Someone at my college's mental health services has been trying to set me up with a therapist, but to no avail.

I talk to my mom about problems sometimes but she was recently put in the hospital for stress-related heart issues and I don't want to add to her burden. I feel uncomfortable talking to anyone else in my family about any problems. They're all very happy go lucky and they would not understand. Same thing with my friends, except for a couple who are already weighed down with their own mental health issues that I don't want to exacerbate. This is also a tough time for everyone anyway and my friends all have their own things they're dealing with. 

1) Recently I was diagnosed with moderate OCD which continues to get worse since I am no longer seeing a therapist. I do know theoretically how to work on it, but my intentions to do so often get sidelined by other issues I'm dealing with. Some days it doesn't affect me at all, other days it will set me into an exhausting spiral of sadness and replaying events in my head. 

2) Every day I am constantly switching from one extreme mood to another. Friends joke that I only have two moods: crazy, goofy in a stupid way, chaotic, partying too much, immature, --OR-- super focused on my schoolwork (usually for 8+ hours at a time), introverted, thoughtful, quiet, not participating in the conversation but always just listening. There is no in between and I hate that. I fluctuate between these moods multiple times a day. Any ""normal conversations"" that don't allow me to fully immerse myself in one of those two moods have little interest to me. Thus when I'm in a situation that requires me to have a regular conversation, I appear uptight because it just doesn't come naturally to me, which is often a turnoff to acquaintances. Either that or I turn on a very fake super-sweet personality where my voice goes about 3 octaves higher than normal. I don't like when I do that but it's better than being just uptight but I can't keep it up for long. So now you might be wondering, why I don't just grow up and turn down the goofiness when necessary? But the thing is, whenever I try to get it under control, I slip past what I would consider ""normal"" and right into introverted phase. Likewise, when I try to engage more with people, I can't turn up the extraversion a little bit without becoming so over the top, so that's when I instead become uptight or fake nice. I just always feel so uncomfortable in the way that I'm acting at all times, like I'm so out of control. It has become extremely tiring.

3) So there's that, and in a similar way I have two overarching moods. Sometimes I feel like life is great and that I want to make the most of all of my time and I'm always trying to see the best in people. This will last for 1-3 days until something sends me into a spiral of sadness, overthinking, and lots of crying. The triggers of this are either usually something OCD-related, thinking about something really embarrassing I said/did either recently or a while ago, suddenly hating a certain aspect of myself, convincing myself my SO doesn't like me (despite having great communication in my relationship ad no reason to think this), or randomly getting anxious about something obscure. For that last part, for example a lone bug bite could send me into a hours-long full frenzy/search of the house to make sure I don't have bedbugs. Then after a few days of being overwhelmed and sad or anxious, I'll suddenly feel like I'm on top of the world again. When I feel like this, I adopt a healthy eating and exercise routine, I don't procrastinate at all, my bedroom is spotlessly clean, I read a lot, I even started learning German the other day. But then when I inevitably become sad again a few days later, my room becomes a pit of messiness, I eat horribly and I don't work out at all, and I don't do any of my school work. I thought this might be a sign of something along the lines of Bipolar Disorder, but the very short time frames on which I switch back and forth made me think otherwise.

It's been like this for years now but recently became very extreme and intense. I think this might be due to the fact that last year was the best year of my life: I started my freshman year at the college of my dreams on a full ride and had a movie-worthy perfect year, I met an amazing boyfriend and made great friends, then suddenly that all came crashing down when we got sent home to due Covid-19 and I wasn't able to see my friends or my boyfriend for almost 7 months and had to spend a lot of time alone at my childhood home.

I'm not sure if anything I wrote makes sense to others but I needed to get it out. Basically I feel like I'm in a positive feedback loop that I have no clue how to get out of. It's very draining and I strongly dislike my constantly changing personalities/moods. However, I don't know if I'm making the situation worse than it is by holding a magnifying glass to it.

If you made it to this point, thanks so much for reading. Please, please, please - if anyone has any advice on any aspect of what I wrote I would be extremely grateful to hear it. I'm just feeling very alone right now and need a place to get some feedback and suggestions as to how to move forward when I feel so weighed down.",30Nov2020,1

Also what I mean by asking for help is that I am asking them for a prescription I have gotten months ago, but my parents have refused to get because they would say things like that (Prescription for stress bc I went to the doctors when I was having really bad chest pains often). Also there are days where I don't eat at all. Like I just go without eating bc I just don't want to, but then there are days where I over eat. Then I just go to the internet so that I can get distracted from all of those problems and end up not going to sleep that day or going to sleep at 5am on a school night. Then when I need to do something I cry. I just really want to cry every now and then. Then since it has been months with this awful feeling I just think that life is so unbearable, but you don't want to die bc what if you hurt someone. Like you really don't want to cause them any trauma so you get those thoughts out of your mind, but they are persistent. Then since you don't want to worry people about it you act happy and joke about the fact that you have panic attacks and that your chest hurts and that everything hurts and you feel so tired all the time, but you shouldn't worry people so act energetic and talkative so they won't ask about your mental health so then you start believing that you are healthy, but then go back to that horrible state of mind and start thinking *""your faking everything""* or *""It's so hard to live""* (Also I have asked for the prescription multiple times bc I don't want to hurt anyone and I really want help, but they don't listen...why do I keep begging...) What should I do now? I'm kinda just getting tired of asking for help. Just fake everything? I'm getting tired of that as well.

120,"I don't know what to do, these dreams all vary in nature; but they are all too intense and, somewhat painful... they make me doubt reality.

Sometimes they are just horrible, but today the actor made me realize some of the dreams are beautiful, and then I get thrown back, to my bed, just to realize I am just this guy who lives in this world called earth, and the life I was living was a life; it felt like an entire life, I was convinced of it, but, it wasn't, I had been sleeping, for 4 mere hours; what happened with that life, with all the friends I made, it wasn't earth, it was a beautiful world, and it wasn't me, what... I was, just a child; and it felt, like an eternity.

The actor said, to this child, that this wold wasn't real, that this was the real wold, and I opened my eyes; as memories suddenly invaded me, as I had to literally start to remember; 4 hours, but, it's been years.

You might wonder who the actor is, but such is a constant, like an entity, appears in every dream; and sometimes I feel fear, in reality, that such is going to appear, tell me, this isn't real either; the actor has appeared in this world after all, during post dream hallucinations.

It makes me feel terrible irl, makes me wonder, who is who; who am I?... the actor had made me live so many realities, after becoming someone or overcoming some circumstance I can pull off the same skills in real life; he told me that was his purpose, to make me fit for life.

But all the people (or creatures) I have met, that have been left behind, they felt real... some felt more real than this reality.

I can classify the dreams between hyper-realistic catastrophes, second lives and dream collapses; the worst being dream collapses, which is when the simulation crashes, literally, which lets me, in real life, with broken thoughts and takes me hours to recover; often with post sleep hallucinations lasting minutes to even hours in worst cases, because my brain is in a messed up state; and the actor, he freaks me out.",30Nov2020,1

132,"I'm so sorry for the format, I'm on mobile.
I feel incredibly alone and at my worst right now, I desperately need to vent. I've (20F) been with my partner (26M) for a year. He broke up with my at 8 months, telling me he was sorry for leading me on for that long. We got back together a month later. Over the course of this year, he's flirted, sent disgusting messages to multiple women and caused me a lot of heartache. He always apologizes, tells me he won't let me down again, and then does it again. He claims messages aren't bad, even if it does include nudes and openly flirting and being overly sexual with other women. He blames it on the alcohol and drugs, says he doesn't remember doing it and says ""I dont know why I do what I do"". The amount of pain he has caused me has led me to some very dark places. I am getting counselling now and moving in to my own place (he wanted me to move in with him). 
I only see him in the weekends, but even then he sits on his computer, drinks, goes out with his friends. I don't get mad that he sees his friends, just that he leaves me alone at his house for 6 hours and comes home incredibly wasted and continues to ignore me. 
I feel neglected. Broken. Constantly questioning what hes doing, who hes talking to. I'm exhausted. Constantly on the verge of breaking down. I recently got diagnosed with Bipolar and Emotional Dysregulation and this stress is not helping.

What hurts the most is that I can see all of the awful things he has done and continues to do, and I continue giving him my unconditional love, care and support. I can see it, but I can't seem to tear myself away. I desperately want to just be able to break up with him, forget and move on, but I am lacking so much happiness in my life that I dont think I can handle the breakup.

I know I put my feelings into the characters, but it's starting to feel more like I'm using this as a way to make myself happy. It kind of feels like I'm thinking ""if I can't be happy, at least I can make my characters happy"", if that makes sense.

I (20,F)am in so much stressful situations,I am an college student currently,living in my native country bc of the pandemic and is scheduled to go back to my uni next sem as usual which is in another country.
My mom is a single parent and spent her life on rasing me but now she has late stage melanomia cancer and all treatment except one new trial drug that is barely stopping it from spreading more is working on her so her time is probably limited.
(the longest a patient have been able to use this drug was 3 yrs and she has been on it for 6 months)
She was treated and relapsed right after my grandpa,her father,died out of nowhere,and now my family has only 1 economic income which is my grandma due to the fact that my mom can't work and my aunt is unemployed(I grew up there since middle school so they live and worked there and built a small but ok business but for mom's treatment we had to move back to our country and considering the age and the pandemic,aunt can't find a job)
Grandpa's death itself was a huge mental shock to me bc it was my first lose of family member I evet experienced and made me insomniac and couldn't stop crying every night in worry for the last sem. I also had to stay in w grandma and mom in a one room apartment trying to manage online classes ...which brings out the procrastinative+short attention span side out of me ...all in all, I couldn't handle some of the high level classes and thought it was better for me to drop them ,and it worked,i got a decent grade and managed through.
But then in this sem I was trying to do the same thing by using some nice distractions(binging shows and whatnot) and lighter loadwork to balance between work and my mental health,and I am already conditioned to this sort of working style,I need frequent breaks in order to fit my attention span.but my aunt(always had a bad relationship w her and she uses abusive language but she takes care of the house and stuff my mom can't so I can't rly say anything) just yells at me when mom is not around for smallest things and it ends up abt me being a bad daughter and not ""caring"" about my mom because I spend lots of time on distraction ,more than w my mom.She says either work hard for my mom or spend time w her.I know that and I feel bad about that too but when I am with mom I get reminded abt how she might die any second and panic and not be able to do any work. Mom took really much pride in me going to a good uni and I don't want to fail any classes due to a mental breakdown or show her I worry and cry so this was kind of my middle ground for that...
I wish I can be what aunt said and study 24/7 for mom's sake but I just can't,I need these shows to bring comfort and distraction so I can live halfway normally.I want to interact w mom more and not rehret when she is gone but I literally start imagining abt how might it be when I am around her and become very upset.
I worry if I go back next sem to my uni I will not be able to be by her side when she passes bc due to pandemic who knows if I get to come back?
I regret choosing social science as my major which my mom gave me full control to bc it is hard to find a job here w that degree but when I chose that our family condition wasn't this bad.also she always wanted me to go abroad and explore w my job options but seeing as everyone is back in home I probably will have to study for a gov job test anyway.
I just have no clue how to do things now, I try to explain to my aunt that I have my hardships but she won't listen, I can't sleep well so I tire myself out by staying late.I feel conflicted abt interacting w my mom.

3. those people ALWAYS self diagnosed themselves. how can you even diagnose yourself with an ilness? apparently its perfectly fine to self diagnose with mental health issues. but how fudging weird would it be if someone was like: ""oh yeah I have cancer. no doctor ever told me but I looked up the symptoms on the internet and I have cancer."" that's just crazy and how is that different than diagnosing yourself with mental problems. 

I'm not saying my problems are worst than theirs, everyone has their own stuff they're dealing with. but saying ""oh yeah I was depressed too, I was feeling very down for a few months and didnt have a lot of motivation"" is so disrespectful to people with actual depression. every human feels depressed at some point in their life. but FEELING depressed and HAVING clinical depression is not the same at all. 

I wish for all of us suffering from it that depression was just feeling low and not having motivation. but we all know that it's so much more. it's so much worse than that.

I personally struggle with depression and anxiety so I'm not some random healthy person stumbling into the subreddit to tell you all that your mental health isn't a big deal. Just want to make that clear :)

**Main:** 

I've been going to therapy for a few years now + take antidepressants as part of my treatment plan. I have struggled a lot in the past year, mostly due to covid and the social isolation that comes with quarantining. I am very open and always discuss my mental health concerns with my close friends and family. In addition, I was always told that I was very strong for being so open about my struggles, which in a way motivated me to share my thoughts even more frequently so that I could work them out with the people I care about.

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed, however, that after years of visiting online forums and receiving support through many different outlets, my situation never really improved. What made a big difference for me recently was reciting daily positive affirmations to build my self esteem and confidence in addition to improving my posture and becoming more mindful of the way I physically carry myself at home and in public. Because of covid, we spend a lot more time alone, and as a result we have a lot more time to listen and engage with our mental chatter. The goal of my affirmations are to change this mental chatter/mental narrative from constantly thinking/worrying about the mental problems I have, to a narrative that focuses on the positive aspects of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I focused on my depression and anxiety and made it my identity in conversation with others, my symptoms became worse. I think this is because I subconsciously became aware of all of the tiny moments in my daily life that re-affirmed this identity in my mind. If I got nervous when talking to someone, I thought ""yeah, that's because I have anxiety"". If I was unmotivated to get out of bed I thought, ""yeah, that's because I have depression"". However, by consciously changing the content and quality of my thoughts, I started noticing all of the things that were good in my life, while all the bad things started to take a back seat, which was a breath of fresh air. Our thoughts shape our reality, and the mental narrative we tell ourselves can also reinforce negative, neurotic thoughts that we want to be rid of. Simple repetition of negative thoughts and phrases can make us believe that they are who we are, which is not true. You're not defined by your thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some of the affirmations that have helped me most:

&amp;#x200B;

""I am worthy of love, happiness, and fulfilment

I forgive myself and give myself a big hug

I let go of the past, surrender concerns about the future, and openly receive the experience of the present moment

Failure is ok, no one is perfect. Loving yourself leads to improved performance. 

Crying is healthy, it elevates mood and relieves stress. Do not be afraid to let it out.

My emotions are valid and I have the right to express them""

&amp;#x200B;

That's it, just wanted to share a positive change in my wellbeing that I hope may relate to some of you.! :)

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I am not a psychiatrist, so don't take this advice as replacement for actual therapy if that's what you need. I am also not advising anyone to repress their negative thoughts and emotions, only to be mindful of them and try to develop positive ones. I'm also not saying that you shouldn't discuss your mental health with others, I'm saying that by making it the focal point of your attention, it may make you fixate on them more and prevent you from getting better.

157,"I really don't know what I want to achieve by writing this but I need to vent it somewhere. Keeping it to myself will definitely not help me right now I suppose.

Actually I should be happy about my life, I have almost everything a person could wish for. But despite that I feel empty, lonely and depressed. Because of this I feel guilty, ashamed and not worthy. I've had 2 episodes of depression before, gradually becoming worse every time. Therapy helped me before and I even felt great after that for a while but I can't seem to hold on to it. I feel like I'm not worth being happy. 
The thing that scares me most right now is my sometimes almost delusionlike state of mind. Thinking the world is fake, nobody is real, it all being a simulation and killing myself would be the only way to escape it. I know these thoughts are not real but sometimes I really can get stuck in them, like a loop. Playing everything out in my mind, over and over again. Getting scared of becoming psychotic. 
Also, my anxiety is back at it again as well, waking me up during the nights to make me ruminice about stupid things I should have done differently in the past.

I'm now at a point that I'm scared to tell my SO about it, he does everything for me, always tries to make me happy etc. So when I tell him about feeling depressed again I feel like I'm hurting or failing him. I'm just trying to keep myself together but I don't know how much longer I can take it. I feel like crying and laying in bed all day, but I don't have time for that. I have to keep on going. I hope it will get better. 

The stupidest thing is that I'm working as a nurse in psychiatry myself, I KNOW what could help me, but I can't seem to find myself important enough for it. Practice what you preach... 

I'm just so fucking tired. I should just fucking start doing something about it. Maybe telling this to strangers on the internet is a good first start after all :)",30Nov2020,1

its getting to the point where i don't even wanna step outside the house because all i sense when im outside in public or in class is rejection, and i know im probably not being rejected but i have such a deep belief that im just not supposed to be liked, therefore so far I've made no friends on the course, even tho i do get on well with them during those rare moments that I actually talk to them
plus the work load is so much, im missing tons of work and i am so unorganised rn that im too scared to reach out for help cause I think my teachers will be disappointed in me

all because I felt like I just couldn't go on with college anymore

163,"so i live in the dumb place called middle east, where the whole culture is based on male-domination.

164,"I'm almost 25 and it has become clear to me that I want to end my life.

When I was around 15, it became clear I wanted a university degree. I was an underachiever in school and my mother kept pushing me to drop out of school. She would scream and insult me when I resist. But I kept fighting back to stay in school, often involving counsellors to defend me because I felt I wouldn't be listened to if I spoke myself.

I didn't meet the requirements for university. My mother pushed me into a graphic design course I did for 6 months, then I pushed back into a university preparation course, then she pushed me into an arts degree after I completed the university preparation course, I did that for a year even though I didn't want to, then pushed back and started a Computer Science degree.

As you can see, there was no clear plan. Just two different conflicting ideals. But sadly for her, it is my life so she can fuck off and stop controlling it.

I did a year of a Computer Science degree. I consider going to university and doing a degree of my own choice the proudest thing I've ever been proud of -- because my mother made it her mission to make sure it doesn't happen. Yelling at me to give up and forget it.

The process of staying in school and going to university was a hurtful and intense experience which redefined what I want out of life, and my parent's roles in my life. It didn't happen once; it happened every year from 15 onwards until I no longer needed to rely on them. My sister believes my mother did nothing wrong and believes I'm just blaming her -- I believe she's just too blindly loyal to see any wrongdoing in my mother's behaviour.

After a year of my degree, I fell into deep depression and left university for 2 years. One year I was on the welfare, the next year I worked at a supermarket (grocery store). They didn't appreciate me there. I was honest about my struggles with mental health early on, and had issues with talking to myself in the isle. It was a tough experience.

After that, I quit and came back to university.

I have an ongoing backward-thinking habit. I don't know where it comes from, but it has existed for my whole adult life. I continually think about people, places, and memories from my past, and feel a frequent urge to search them up online to see how they are now. I feel regret at hurting others and smile at the nicer memories. I still think about YouTube personalities I used to watch at about 10 years ago who haven't uploaded videos for years.

I've seeked out EMDR because I believed it was trauma. But now I'm not sure. I don't know why I continually live in the past, but I believe it is a lifelong habit I'm stuck with.

Now I'm almost 25 in a week. I've seen many of my peers in the 4 different courses at 3 different institutions I've done graduate, I'm watching peers from high school and university have babies and get married. Every day I'm just reminded of how far away my high school years ago, and watch as peers keep moving ahead with their lives.

Even if I do graduate and get a degree, so what? I'm still going to keep looking backwards forever.

I've decided I don't want children because the inability to move on from past experiences isn't practical.

I've also had a lot of fun in my youth and it seems from here, it gets a whole lot more boring.

So I don't really see much point in being alive anymore.

I want to end my life and just write on my suicide note that if there is a funeral, my sister and mother aren't welcome, so they can have a good think about how they've treated me.",30Nov2020,1

I have become depressed, stressed and anxious and have even developed what I believe to be itchy psychosomatic spots all over my body. I have come pretty close to ending my relationship numerous times and find myself blaming the relationship for my stress and everything. This was not me and I have never been prone to mental health issues nor have I ever second guessed anything and was generally optimistic and enjoyed life. I have no idea what triggered this spiraling down into depression. I have managed to sort out financial issues and that doesn't stress me or anything.

last night, i lost my earphones. i broke down about how everything important to me keeps getting lost because of my family and myself. i almost broke 2mos of soberness from self-harm because i couldn't keep myself grounded and i kept blaming myself for losing my stuff, making my friends worried, and crying for no reason.

earlier today, my bracket came off, making the wire come loose. i couldn't put the wax on which made me feel worse. then i couldn't play the new game i got with my cousin, which hit me hard. i felt like everything was going wrong and i felt like shit for crying about small things.

167,Is being screamed at a lot by a parent an example of a type of trauma? My mom loves me and she does care a lot ..perhaps too much... (I’m 21 btw) and throughout childhood she’d get mad easily and just YELL at me so much bc she wanted me to do well . She also tries to control what I eat a lot of the time because she wants me to be healthy ...Also .. a few nights ago she noticed the SH scars on my wrist and had a complete breakdown and told me how much this is crushing her and “why do I hate the life she gave me” etc etc...rlly bad experience. I had awful nightmares a few nights later related to the incident but haven’t had any since that. Does this count as a mini instance of trauma? I’m not fishing for attention I’m just trying to understand why my mental health is so poor and SHing tendencies have been so strong for nearly a year now :(,30Nov2020,1
168,"I have come to realize I don't want or enjoy anything anymore. Even food. I'm getting thinner by the day for months now due to loss of appetite, like my body just decided to quit. I just stay in bed not really doing anything until I pass out, wake up late, get ready in a ritual of subpar hygiene and go to work. I'm basically only up at work — when I go to work, that is. No will to live. No will to really experiment life. I've given up on life but still haven't chosen death so I'm in this weird limbo where I'm kind of afraid I'll slip any day now but also not at all afraid if that's what ends up happening.

And this massive anhedonia isn't just about the present either. I have lost my dreams for my future. Nothing matters, I don't care about anything. And I know this isn't how a healthy mind is supposed to be, so I looked for a therapist last year and a psychiatrist a couple months ago.

The first antidepressant the latter prescribed me helped make me feel a little better about no longer functioning or enjoying anything. I mean I still lay in bed all my free time without energy to so much as pick up a t-shirt off the floor or brush my teeth or shower or watch something or play anything or whatever, but I was kinda sorta okay with being in this almost comatose state, as opposed to feeling horrible about it which is what I had before the treatment. The side effects were too aggressive though and we had to switch.

The second antidepressant gave me all the same side effects and none of the... benefits, if you can call them that. So my psychiatrist told me to stop taking them and scheduled an appointment for a new prescription. She stood me up and offered me a slot the next day but then I slept in and didn't hear the alarm clock or anything. And now I'm like 2-3 weeks without any meds and I'm not doing as ok as I thought I would.

My Dad asked me what I want for Christmas. He said my half brother is traveling abroad this week and could bring back like a tablet or whatever. The thing is, I've been thinking about it and the more I try to come up with something I want, the more it hurts because I reeeaaally don't want anything anymore.

I'm not exactly suicidal per se, as there's a certain nuance to this. But I *am* walking a fine line between not wanting to live and thinking it would be less cruel to me to just die. The single thing I want is to go back to wanting stuff. My only desire is to desire to live. Does that make sense? The thing is, that is also fading. Today I woke up positive that there's no hope left and no treatment will work and I'm beyond saving.

Then it hit me: you don't prolong the suffering of a patient who can't survive. You don't even prolong the suffering of say a stray dog fatally wounded. Why do I have to undergo a torture that even a stray dog doesn't have to endure? I'm essentially making a case for euthanasia at this point. And again the single reason I'm holding back is the thought that my perception is skewed by depression and that there is hope even if I can't see it.

I just can't stand it anymore. I just need some way to fast forward to recovery, like in an actual coma or something. Or alternatively just peacefully go to sleep and never wake up because in all honesty I'm so fucking exhausted.",30Nov2020,1

172,"Hello all hope your are all having great days.

I'm 17 and from the UK, My life is great and although there are bad things I am in a very lucky position, I have a family, A job and I'm doing decently in my education. In order for me to kind of give you all an indication of what has happened in the last few years I have to tell you some things about me.

In 2017 I lost my mother, Me and her weren't very close due to many reasons that I don't really want to discuss on the internet but her death still effected me for some time after, In December 2017 I started feeling sad from about 6PM until I fell asleep, During this time I'd numb it out with games and talking to online friends. This sad feeling eventually led to what I felt was some form of Moderate Depression. I was 15 lonely, sad, angry and lost and numb. I had no idea what to do and I felt weak if I reached out but eventually I visited the doctors on January 16th 2018. I told the doctor my symptoms of feeling helpless and tired all the time as well as unmotivated. The doctor just gave me a card with a helpline on it and that was it. I went home and felt the lowest I had ever felt. Around March of 2018 I started feeling better and regained the feeling of happiness that my favourite things brought me such as games, music and my friends. Then it began again, In April/May of 2018 my best friend of 3 years got a boyfriend and we slowly drifted apart. I want to make this clear, I loved her and wished nothing but the best for her even if it meant I couldn't see her. I spent the rest of 2018 missing her and feeling as if someday she'd come back and things would go back to how they were but they never did. Fast forward to 2019 and this was actually an amazing year for me, I felt like I grew as a person and accepted new challenges such as handling my own future and education, I got a new Job and started college. Things were amazing and I really started feeling like I had found myself but then 2020 hit. Another thing I should mention is that my now 16 year old sister is a nightmare and steals from my family and causes all kinds of trouble for us and I don't know why but I think I hold myself accountable to some degree as I will see my dad being upset over what she has done and I feel as if I have done something bad.  Over the past few years, That feeling of lowness had stuck to me, eventually turning into what I and my older sister believes is Social Anxiety. Of course it's not all the time, I have good days and bad days but some days I will want to be alone and not talk to anyone even my dad, I'll walk to college and not look anyone in the eye or talk to them, I feel so disconnected from my friends and feel like I don't fit in, I'll say something and instantly cringe and regret saying it because I assume everyone around me is judging me. I feel as if everything I do will never be enough and other people are better at everything than me. I feel worthless sometimes and feel as if I'm not worthy of getting better. I think my older brother sees through me and knows and understands what I am going through but I feel weak for reaching out. Although these intense feelings have subsided now they return in full force for a few days/weeks sometimes although recently has been OK. I want to know what I am feeling and put a label on it so I can finally get better and learn how to cope and be my old self.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think it is depression as I am not numb anymore and I don't have some of the more serious symptoms as Clinical Depression. I don't know what this is and it comes and goes and I don't know what to do. After typing this out and reading it through a few times I don't feel ashamed and I'm open to talking about it to friends even if I will regret it later.

179,"Hello,

My LDR partner has always had something happen to him. Everytime he buys something new, it’s broken or the wrong color, when he needs to use the TV, it doesn’t workX or when he adopted our cat, she ended up having an illness and when that got solved, she started breaking everything in his apartment.

Usually, something good happens, and then a moment later, a lot of bad things come piling up (different things stop working at once, the washing machine starts making weird sounds, the cat pushes his camera off his desk, etc.).

I’ve been with him for almost a year now, and it’s amazing how often this happens. He’s well-off so none of these things are “cheap” products that should glitch or break easily.

He has also started thinking that I’m an actress going against him. I understand how he would feel distrustful of everything around him, and I believe he has some undiagnosed delusional issues. I try not to confront him, when he’s in these delusions. I’ve tried asking questions to help him maybe get a “reality check” and calm down, but those don’t work so I try to back off.

I’ve asked him to get professional help and I even told him that we could go together, but he’s not up for this because he met some psychologists in the past, who said they’re only there for the money or that they don’t really care for his illness.

He has chronic stress which is also because he’s stuck in life (career-wise) and his personal project has been delayed 2-3 months. And he tells me how hard it is to deal with the cat alone, and that he needs me there. I believe these also contribute.

It’s now been two weeks straight, where something new has happened almost everyday. 

I’m a person, who might be too optimistic and laid-back, whereas he’s more emotional. I’ve read so much about how to cope and support him and give him reassurance, and it works. 

But now it’s been two full weeks and I’ve only seen his normal, unnaffected self twice.

I really miss him.. even now he writes to me asking me and some “production crew” to to stop messing with his phone.

We don’t live together right now, and we haven’t tried to yet, so I don’t know if it’ll be better or worse.

He apologizes so often and tells me that he feels selfish for wanting to stay with me, but that he would understand if I left.

Can I please hear how to deal with this? Either from the point of view of someone with mental health issues or from someone whose prtner is similar.

As a general principle, the self filters out much of the greater ego in service of momentary purpose; but doesn’t get rid of you,  the ""observer"" that exists before and after our thoughts come to fruition.  So for many, much of the issues therein lie with the parameters of filters themselves.

If we were to talk about redundancies, it's all too common to hear the claim that evolutionarily evolved behaviors aren't necessarily effective in modern environments - but this is a drastic oversimplification; and leads to folks saying shit along the ethos of ""Well, why don't you just adopt these (so and so) better habits Johnnyboy?""  

well motherfucker/Stacy/Steve, to rEtOrt:

Today's given absolutist contexts and definitions of survival are quite warped from the demands our ancestors faced, and have been for some time.  We don’t even name it as survival as this point; we’ve invented a billion ways to rephrase it in corny, self-sacrificing, or academic ways such as “living our truth,” out-of-touch political discussions, or “self-realization.” Selective perception isn't just a mechanism of attention, it serves as an excellent temporal representation for the entirety of one's being as well. If we are within the realm of ""modern environments,"" it suffices to state that a majority of the filter here is judged on preconceived notions from these experiential(which even intertwines with epigenetic mechanisms) elements of what lets the human believe it's functioning - a greater subset of biologically evolved survival instincts.

Fighting to survive doesn't just include when you're about to die.  It's a lifelong process, and when one becomes coerced into a hyperaroused and hyperbolic state of survival early on, it not only limits the type of world they can experience, but the innate components of themselves that are smothered over by over-defined
predispositions that scream ""survive! hide! stop!"" 
Personal history like that won’t necessarily devolve into something like full-blown disassociative identity disorder, but feeling like being a percentage of a person, only being able to experience different sides of yourself at different times is a very real fucking thing. 

This is all too easy to vent about, but it's something noticeable and frustratingly indecipherable when daily tasks that require basic amounts of focus seem impossible to do unless the ""time is right(mania),"" or until you contort yourself w/mental gymnastics such as playing the character that's ""bullshits everything"" in order to protect himself.  You then one day trip on so much LSD that you spend what legitimately feels like 5 years in a single day through psychedelic time dilation watching yourself perpetually loop only to realize the brand of self-deception you put yourself through for much of your life, enabling its continuation by rebranding the same lies over and over.  It's the reason you're now obsessed with dichotomization, hyper-reality, and have now effectively hit the ""reset"" button by ironically coagulating yourself for the first time by self-identifying as an ""abstract individual."" After all, it was the only remotely correct definition.  And it’s the first time things have started to get better, however cyclical or frustrating.  So fuck it.",30Nov2020,1

Being angry when everyone knows you as a funny person is weird because you can see their faces. It's not like I don't have friends who will listen to me, I do.

184,"Basically i went to an all-grades private school for 13 years (since kindergarten) and i hated it a lot for all of the 13 years. Every year i begged my parents to put me in another school but they refused they said i cant run away from bad situations, i got bullied by teachers and students too but i was straight a-s so nobody cared. I have graduated and never been back nor do i plan to, but everytime i see school age children or someone mentions school i feel horrible and i get angry and start crying sometimes. At home im not allowed to speak about my experience or how bad the school was bc my sister goes there too and she loves it, also my parents said they dont regret it bc it ‘made me stronger’. Because school is everywhere and such a central part in everybodys life i know i cant avoid it, so how can i chill about it and not get super angry???????",30Nov2020,1

186,"I’ve never been close to my parents. I’ve always felt that the other siblings always had it better than me and that I was treated different. About a year ago I was at college and my parents were trying to convince me to leave. I had made pretty good grades but started to drink and smoke marijuana. 

One day while I was back at my parents home my parents ambushed me by taking my car and telling me I wasn’t going back. My mom and I went back in her car to get my belongings. When we got there I told her I didn’t want to leave and that I was paying for my college so I should decided if I’d stay or not. 

Things got ugly and she went back out to the car, grabbed her pistol and told me that she’d shoot herself right there if I didn’t leave with her. My younger brother was waiting in the car and witnessed it happening. All I could hear at that moment was my brother (I.R.) pleading with me to get in the car and looking at the pistol in my mother’s hands. I got into the car but it was as if I wasn’t alive. I knew I was present in the moment but had no feelings as to what was happening... just numbness. 

I remembered feeling this before, there was a time when I was younger. My mother asked me to find her shoes from the closet. I was having a hard time finding them when all of the sudden I was kicked from behind( I was bent over looking down into the closet). The kick was to my testicles. I was in a lot of pain but more emotional than physical. I remember getting in the car after that.(we were on the way to somewhere that’s why she wanted the shoes) I remember her apologizing profusely saying she only meant to kick me in the butt. All I could do in this moment was fixate my focus on a quarter, flipping it around looking at all the details. It was as if the quarter was the only thing that mattered. She later claimed that it was her addapex (a weight loss drug) that caused her to act in such a way. She stopped taking the drug but started again later on. 

I replay the situation in my head everyday pondering about why my mother would do any this. I think about my childhood and realize she wasn’t that great of a mother. I had a picture painted of her in my mind as someone who was caring and supportive but as I continue thinking about my childhood it just seems like a lot of manipulation and lack of respect. 

Flash forward to present day and my mother and other brother (J.R) had a big fight about manipulation that was occurring between my mother and him. My name was brought up and the situation that happened. After the fight she texted me saying she was sorry and that maybe one day that I would forgive her. She was referring to the pistol incident. I can’t help but feel like she’s just saying it because she’s feeling guilty and not because she is actually sorry for what happened. 

Sorry for this lengthy post. I just don’t really know what to feel or what to do. I love my siblings and my parents but it seems like the next time I choose to face them that this topic will come up with my mother. And I really don’t want to talk with her about it. I wish I could have had a different experience. That way there wouldn’t be so much strain on my relationship with my family. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.",30Nov2020,1
187,"for some time, my mindset, confidence, and mental health state has been negative. on top of that, i have been struggling to focus on my daily tasks, such as my school work. this burdens me every day, and the amount of missing assignments i have are starting to snowball. i know that many would say that i did this to myself, and i would agree with that. although, i have a difficult time focusing on my school work. even when i remove any distractions, i begin to feel tired, or frustrated while doing my assignments. after that, i give up most of the time. but, i don’t understand why this is happening. last quarter, i scored A’s, and a couple of B’s. but, now, i’m slipping. besides my grades dropping, my mindset has become negative, i’m feeling lonely, my family and i struggle to get along at times, my boyfriend and i are going through a rough patch, i lost motivation to do my school work and get back into shape physically, i’m always feeling tired, and i’m having lots of mood swings. as i’m typing this, i’m losing hope. i feel like i won’t end up doing well in school this year, because it is becoming harder and harder to keep up. what should i do?",30Nov2020,1
188,"I’m 17 (M) , and over the last 3-4 months or so I’ve felt more mentally out of control. Like I know I have something wrong in my brain but I’m not sure what’s going on. I’m already fairly certain I have some type of anxiety issue, but I don’t know how it ties into other things. 

I self harmed 2 separate times in those few months,  under short (few hour) episodes of intense sadness that I never experienced before. Of course, the sadness had a source/reason, but I never experienced it with such intensity, or any thoughts about self harm. I also felt the impulse to drink alcohol or smoke when I’m having rough times like this.  

I also feel sensitive or weak. I was never someone who cried, even getting my heart broken I barely cried from that. But recently, I feel more like I could cry about anything. 

I noticed that I feel fully drained out while having a bad day, when I was, or am upset. I’ll walk around at my job slowly and with a rather blank gaze and won’t speak much. 

Yesterday, under a period of extreme stress and anxiety I looked at the blanket on my bed and saw a “face” . I moved the blanket around to get rid of the illusion, then looked back a few moments later and saw a face again. I know seeing patterns in things is normal, but it felt different. I felt like my brain was playing a trick, because there’s no way the blanket looked like a face twice. I don’t know if this is normal for someone under high stress, like a predatory instinct, or if it’s a bad sign? 

One thing that really concerns me is that while smoking weed around 2 months ago, i’ve heard a deep voice speak to me directly. It instantly freaked me out and I rushed myself to sleep. The next day I did it again and heard what sounded like a crowd of people speaking. Since then, it’s become a pretty common occasion that when I smoke weed, I’m paranoid, for example, looking behind my shoulder at a burger shop because i’m worried about the people standing behind me. and my inner monologue/voice seems out of my control. I could involuntarily imagine a friend saying something. However, I never heard a voice speak directly to me again, like the first time. This is only happening while high on weed, so I don’t know how to interpret it. Do I just not mix well with marijuana, or is this a red flag?
 
Anyway, I just really want to know if anyone relates to these things and if anyone has advice on a “low-cost” way to get help or figure out what’s going on.",30Nov2020,1
189," 

Stress and anxiety are one of the most common problems. If not taken proper care of our mental health it can cause serious issues with our health as we will keep thinking about the same thing again and again. Sometimes we put so much pressure on ourselves that the stress and anxiety will kill us from inside and we will lost all the happiness of life, whenever you feel stressed try to get out of it, give yourself a little time forgetting about all the tensions and it will make you feel calm and again bring you back to joyous life.

What mistakes do people generally do is whenever they feel stressed they keep thinking of the same topic again and again which causes serious problems like depression. Try to be calm in every situation because every single thing can be sorted out with just patience. If you are worried or are tensed about the lot of work try to break the work into parts and try to calmly complete it and you will notice that you have been able to complete the work much more faster than if you would do with tension in your mind.

191,"Hello I’m a boy currently in high school and recently I can’t feel anything anymore and sometimes the feelings I feel are so vague that I couldn’t tell. 

I even question myself about the people I was attracted back then “How tf I was romantically attracted to that girl?” 

but at the same time I am longing for something I feel like I have an idea what I feel before and It feels like it’s nothing compared to a feeling that I was finding now. 

and for all of the girls I romantically before is nothing compared to the feeling i feel now that’s why I could say that all of my past relationship wasn’t love because I had an idea maybe it was love I was longing for

Even if I wanted to fall in love I just can’t feel it to anyone and I think they couldn’t match on what I am looking for It feels too empty like there’s a hole in my soul that I could convince myself that i’ll be alone for the rest of my life. I don’t want to commit myself to a person that I don’t love it’s scary to live a lifetime to that person. 

at first I couldn’t even tell what I was longing It felt like I’m finding someone maybe a place or a feeling I couldn’t tell but my feelings for it are too intense 


I feel lonely and anxious because my school days are almost over and I still don’t have new friends (have old friends before i transferred but communication are rare and only through online) I knew I will just isolate myself after I finish school and I want to have friends before I’ll finish school",30Nov2020,1
193,"Hello, I want to preface this by saying that I am not trying to invalidate anyone's mental health struggles. I personally struggle with depression and anxiety so I'm not some random healthy person stumbling into the subreddit to tell you all that your mental health isn't a big deal. Just want to make that clear :)

&amp;#x200B;

I've been going to therapy for a few years now + take antidepressants as part of my treatment plan. I have struggled a lot in the past year, mostly due to covid and the social isolation that comes with quarantining. I am very open and always discuss my mental health concerns with my close friends and family. In addition, I was always told that I was very strong for being so open about my struggles, which in a way motivated me to share my thoughts even more frequently so that I could work them out with the people I care about.

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed, however, that after years of visiting online forums and receiving support through many different outlets, my situation never really improved. What made a big difference for me recently was reciting daily positive affirmations to build my self esteem and confidence in addition to improving my posture and becoming more mindful of the way I physically carry myself at home and in public. Because of covid, we spend a lot more time alone, and as a result we have a lot more time to listen and engage with our mental chatter. The goal of my affirmations are to change this mental chatter/mental narrative from constantly thinking/worrying about the mental problems I have, to a narrative that focuses on the positive aspects of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

When I focused on my depression and anxiety and made it my identity in conversation with others, my symptoms became worse. I think this is because I subconsciously became aware of all of the tiny moments in my daily life that re-affirmed this identity in my mind. If I got nervous when talking to someone, I thought ""yeah, that's because I have anxiety"". If I was unmotivated to get out of bed I thought, ""yeah, that's because I have depression"". However, by consciously changing the content and quality of my thoughts, I started noticing all of the things that were good in my life, while all the bad things started to take a back seat, which was a breath of fresh air. Our thoughts shape our reality, and the mental narrative we tell ourselves can also reinforce negative, neurotic thoughts that we want to be rid of. Simple repetition of negative thoughts and phrases can make us believe that they are who we are, which is not true. You're not defined by your thoughts.

Here are some of the affirmations that have helped me most:

&amp;#x200B;

""I am worthy of love, happiness, and fulfilment

&amp;#x200B;

I forgive myself and give myself a big hug

&amp;#x200B;

I let go of the past, surrender concerns about the future, and openly receive the experience of the present moment

&amp;#x200B;

Failure is ok, no one is perfect. Loving yourself leads to improved performance.

&amp;#x200B;

Crying is healthy, it elevates mood and relieves stress. Do not be afraid to let it out.

&amp;#x200B;

My emotions are valid and I have the right to express them""

&amp;#x200B;

That's it, just wanted to share a positive change in my wellbeing that I hope may relate to some of you.! :)

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I am not a psychiatrist, so don't take this advice as replacement for actual therapy if that's what you need. I am also not advising anyone to repress their negative thoughts and emotions, only to be mindful of them and try to develop positive ones. I'm also not saying that you shouldn't discuss your mental health with others, I'm saying that by making it the focal point of your attention, it may make you fixate on them more and prevent you from getting better.

194,"I don't really have any family as a result of growing up with an abusive single parent and an absentee father. I am NC with them, and I only have maybe 2 friends and my boyfriend. Granted, these are awesome friends, my relationship with my boyfriend isn't so great, and my employer is terrible. I feel like throughout my life, I've been promised things time and time again by people...

""You'll get this raise if you finish this project."" ""You can have this day off."" ""I promise I won't do \_\_\_\_\_\_\_"" And they keep doing it. I've been cheated on. I'm constantly taken advantage of by employers. I've had landlords promise one thing, and then not follow through with it. It'd be one thing if people lied or promised things and then didn't have the same standards for me, but I'm always expected to clean up other's shit.

I'm at the point where starting new platonic friendships makes me really anxious, because the last few that I have ended very poorly - they all lied to or took advantage of me in incredibly important ways, like cheating on their significant other, or with one of them, even being upset that I have a job that took me out of homelessness because it made him feel better ""having someone to save"". And yet, I keep being told by people that I open up to about this that I have to ""lower my expectations"" - just accept that the people closest to me will lie and hurt me in really important ways and that that's how people are. That I need to appreciate and forgive friends like my old ones.

I've been told the same about relationships too. Pretty much every time I take issue with people being assholes, I'm told that ""That's how people are."" and that if I keep having ""high standards"" on who I'm around, I'm going to end up alone. That thought keeps me up at night... that if the world is just filled with liars and I'm the weird one for not just accepting it and getting over it that there will never be a place for me, and that people treating me like shit is normal and that I have to ""stop being so sensitive"" and ""let it roll off my back"". That I'll never have friends and family and that I'll always be alone. I only get to talk to my therapist every other week or so, and coping with this stuff on a daily is hard for me.",30Nov2020,1

I have accepted the fact i will die and it wont be pleasant at all the social worker at the cancer hospital says i am dealing well with it and so did the therapist i saw.

My problem is 2 of my friends they wont deal with it at all. they just get upset and fall apart when they see me. I under went a massive weight loss over 100 pounds was 267 pounds very overweight to 162 pounds in 13 months (my ex family dr was quack that didnt listen to me and left it go for 2 years)

I sat down with both of them last week and laid it all out told them the chemo will only stop when i can no longer tolerate it then once i recovered it would start again it would never end till my death. I told them the good news that the tumors are shrinking and there is a chance they will shrink to nothing but will come back and will will start it all over again not much to look forward to but its life.

While we were talking Sarah saw my chemo pump under my coat and started crying she got upset and said i was not dying and got up and left. Her husband Dave said give it time and she would be ok.

I said she needs help to deal with it as time is the one thing i no longer have. Sarah and i have been friends since 2nd grade over 40 years. we became friends as she was the new kid and was the only one to talk to her.

My other friend Rick is not dealing well with it. We have been friends for over 30 years we bonded over our love or r/c planes and cars and have done this for 30+ years. He just will not talk about it. He keeps acting like nothing is wrong and life is normal.

Chemo kills you it gives you chemo brain where you just don't think normal it makes you weak and sick and you dont want to do anything other than sleep for days they both ask me why i dont see them more and do the things we did before. Hence the talk i had with them both. When i had the talk with rick he started crying and said he didnt want to hear it i was ok and things were normal.

I love both of them very much we are closer than my 2 brothers and i want to help them deal with this before i die. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",30Nov2020,1

It was really good. He was so nice and listened without judgement even when I was judging myself and making self depricating jokes. He thinks I have depression and possibly anxiety, but with the way our health system works he can diagnose anything.

But yeah. Anybody thinking of going or struggling, I know it is an immense and scary task. But it's worth it ! Even just talking for the hour was great, hrs the first person to ever have genuinely listened and cared how I'm feeling.

I am scared to death of telling these thoughts to my friends  because they wouldn't understand and I don't dare tell my family. They'd consider me mad ,attention seeking or possessed even.

205,"The day before yesterday I self-harmed for the first time in nearly three years. It had been such a long time I nearly had forgotten I used to do it and had never given it much thought. But the day before yesterday I was going through a moment of frustration and, out of the blue, very impulsively, started beating myself and scratching. I tried to stop but kept going for a while. I have some ugly big scratch marks on my face and I beat myself to the point of tears. I have no idea how it started or ended, it was like I was in a trance the whole time. I am afraid if it happens again, I could grab something sharp and stab myself on impulse, or hurt myself really badly. I have no control over myself in these moments. Three years ago I once almost strangled myself before I realized what I was doing. 

I'm also experiencing severe loss of appetite. It's weird, I wake up with an appetite but a minor inconvenience happens and it's all lost. For example today I prepared my first meal of the day, then I dropped the plate and spilled al the food. It didn't cause me any bad feeling, nobody was mad at me, I cleaned it all up in 2 seconds, it was just an accident, but still that triggered an inability to stomach anything for the whole day. I've already lost a lot of weight in a pretty short amount of time.

208,"Hello everyone. I am a 20 year old who has been struggling with depression and anxiety for the past few years. I was beginning to learn how to cope towards the end high school and I was excited for college. I got into the Honors Program at the school I wanted to go and the school was 2 hours away so I was excited for a fresh start and to get away from a toxic home situation. Long story short, I found my girlfriend was pregnant about a month before I left for college and my mental was in shambles after that point. 

I was a nervous wreck every day while college. I knew I’d have to transfer once the baby was born, so it was such a bittersweet experience to go to college and know it’d be over really soon. I was fine with making the sacrifice eventually but I still had those depressive feelings resurface. I lost about 15 pounds in 12 days, I wasn’t leaving bed much, I never made any close friends while I was on campus because I was embarrassed about how fragile how mental state had gotten. I was a wreck and I felt like I had no one to go for a long time. Depression is a very big taboo in traditional, Christian, black families and it’s not something that I ever wanted to bring to my family out of the fear of being judged and just being put back into a worse hole than I was already in. 

When the baby arrived, I was obviously excited to be a new dad, but I still felt like I was so consumed by these feelings of guilt that it clouded my ability as a father in the early stages. I felt like I was on this constant autopilot. Every day felt the same. Half of the time I felt like my brain was turned off for days at a time. It felt like I was fighting for control of my own thoughts and happiness and I was definitely losing and I still feel like I’m losing a lot of the time to this day. Detachment and a severe lack of motivation are my biggest symptoms. I didn’t even feel like my life was real. Like I was in some long, fucked-up dream that just kept playing on repeat. 

If I’m being quite frank, I don’t feel that much better right now than I did when I felt like I was rock bottom. What I do know is that I’m a great father, boyfriend, and a lot of people in this position wouldn’t have been able to survive some of the feelings I’ve felt. Every day is still a constant struggle of trying to tell myself that things will be ok. It’s a struggle to be vulnerable around my toddler who adores me so much. It’s a struggle to look my girlfriend in the eye who has been there with me through with all and admit that I’m not okay. I still haven’t even told a single family member yet. 

My pain has taught me that despite how weak and vulnerable I constantly feel, that I’m the strongest person I know. My pain has taught me that people who struggle with mental issues deserve a normal life and good things, that we just have to convince ourselves of that. My pain has taught me I don’t deserve to feel guilt for something I cannot control. My pain has taught me that it’s okay for me, a black man, to cry and to feel and to yell. My pain has taught me that I have nothing to be embarrassed about. My pain has taught me that I’m not alone. My pain has taught me that if I’m still alive to type this, then I can make it through whatever is next. My pain has taught me to appreciate the fragility and beauty of life. 

I don’t know who this will reach, but please don’t give up on yourself. I have been so close so many times. I’m not the type of the person to be cheesy and say there are people out that care about you, because I know that only ever made me feel more guilt. But I’m telling whoever is reading this that your life is worth living for YOU. YOU deserve to share your pain to the world. YOU deserve to turn your pain into something constructive. YOU deserve to be at peace. I know these words might not mean anything to anyone who reads but I’ll take the chance that it’ll touch at least one person. 1",30Nov2020,1

This is going so far that I actually think my friends don't really like me and just hang out with me to be polite.
I can't even really talk to people without thinking they absolutely hate me sometimes.

210,"I’m not diagnosed with anything, like depression or anxiety though I’m in the process of getting help but its taking so long and I just need to get some things out because I’m sort of bottling them up.

 I feel absolutely horrible sometimes I never really have the words to explain, I lose motivation and I can’t get myself to do anything, I just can’t. It’s so painful. When I feel like I can do things, even then its so overwhelming I need to get everything done now that I can then I don’t because its too much.

I’ve had ‘attacks’ before, I’m not sure if there anxiety attacks, i get too overwhelmed, sweat, cry, get dizzy and twitch. this hasn’t happened too many times but its getting more frequent.

i feel like my mental Health is just getting worse and worse, like its deteriorating I can’t deal with it anymore. Its effecting school, sometimes i get really nervous and cant pay attention, and overall i hate being school.

sometimes I scratch myself with my nails when i get frustrated. Recently i had a thought that could probably stab myself in the arm, not to kill myself just to hurt, I’m not sure i would but its in there now and I’m worried.

I’m not sure anyone’s going to read this but i really needed to get it out. Does it sound like i have problems or is this normal?",30Nov2020,1
211,"I'm suffering with this for year. First of all, I had a fight with my mother in December of last year. It was because of my university. She was crying and talking that she was a bad mother. She even said, that she will leave the house and die somewhere on streets. I feel very hurt. Fortunately, she is stayed at home. When my grandmother heard these news, she had a stroke. At this night we carried my grandma to the hospital. My mother stayed with grandma here while I'm trying to finish my semester. After that, they carried grandma to my house. She was happy, but after some days, she is dead. At December of 2019 I lost my grandmother.

Then we have coronavirus pandemy. We must now sit in self-isolation. I'm always studied for good grades, but now I'm burning at work. Then my father started experiencing serious health problems. Fortunately, he is alive.

I should to mention that I loved DeviantArt website. But when they changed it to Eclipse, the whole DA community leaved the website. People are angry with changes. That was very depressing to me because I loved this place. But... I lost this website.

Although, my parents are pretty strict. And they think that I don't have psychical problems. Sometimes I'm shaking with my hands because I have panic attacks. My family is pretty religious, and sometimes my mind is fulled with images of Hell, Apocalypse, sins and dark moments from Bible. I tried to pretend to be an atheist so these thoughs would not bother for me. Although I saw many shits happen in the world. 

Sometimes I'm dreaming to become a supervillain, who want to destroy this rotten world and release all the human souls from their material prison. I have lost faith in humanity and I think we are living in rotten dystopian world. Those shows about heroes beating evil is nothing but just a like, I thinked. In this world only evil people can achieve success while good are suffering in pain. This is the real world. And this is why I'm wishing for it's destruction.

I'm sorry for maniacal thoughs. But I really feel bad mentally. I don't see any reasons to make this world a better place.",30Nov2020,1
212,"Hi, so I'll cut to the chase, I'm 19 and was recently diagnosed with ADHD and put on Elvanse/Vyvanse which was titrated up to 70mg. It's completely changed my life in terms of letting me function as a normal person, but recently it's started causing absolutely unbearable anxiety.

For reference, I have major depression and generalised anxiety for which I am medicated for too. The only anti-anxiety medication I'm on is pregabalin but it doesn't seem to help much anymore, yet I can't stop it because of the horrible withdrawal.

My psychiatrist initially tried adding 40mg propranolol taken 3 times daily to help with the anxiety, but it doesn't do much at all, and I got to a point where the ADHD medication started effectively causing anxiety attacks. I've tried lowering the dose to 20mg (the minimum dose) but even then it's still causing a bit of anxiety yet it's nowhere near as effective compared to 70mg.

Does anyone have any experience on how you can cope with this? 

I'm getting to a point where I feel like I'll have to stop taking it, but this would be a devastating blow to me because it helps me so much (unlike all the antidepressants etc I've tried).",30Nov2020,1

214,"I've been in my current relationship for about 7 years.  My wife was diagnosed with OCD, her major problem are her recurring thoughts which bother her a lot. Bills to pay, work to do, thinking she's ugly, not good enough, you name it. She will think about that sort of thing over and over.

That kind of thing got better over the years, but she end up shifting into a depressive state since June. Now she's cold, and extremely sensitive to ""negative"" things. I can't express any negative thoughts, and nothing bad can happen, or else she will just give up on any effort to get better. She becomes even colder than normal, and wants to sleep all day. She's taking Luvox for her OCD, and now Trazodone for depression.

I'm not perfect either. Im either bipolar or borderline (my psychiatrist is still having a bit of trouble to decide) Im constantly getting all positive, upbeat and hopeful about my relationship or life in general but then something ends up happening and all that is very quickly destroyed and I become a mess. 

So I end up spending like 4 or so days treating my wife like a queen, then she does or says something that triggers me such as ""I don't know when ill get better"" or ""please try to not bother me with your problems right now"" and it immediately kills my positivity, I just wanna cry non stop, leave the house and stay far away, etc. After a few hours I manage to get myself together and become all upbeat and willing to help again, but my wife just hates it. I take lamotrigine.

I feel so, so trapped. I love my wife so much and I want to see her better, but the only way to supposedly see that happening is to just kill all my emotions and allow her to heal and get out of her depression. So I gotta just shut up and be nice.

I feel very, very alone. My friends just can't understand my mental issues at all so I stopped trying to talk to them. My wife could always talk to me and used to be very supportive but I lost that too.
I have no one to talk to, nowhere to go, I'm so so trapped. All I have is my wife, and I'm afraid that if I don't sort things out somehow I'll lose her too.",30Nov2020,1
215," 

It has now been 10 years since my life fell apart, and over that time, things have gotten progressively worse. I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety back in 1998, so that was an underlying condition, causing me to avoid contact with most people and be relatively asocial. In 2010, I found out my partner of 8 years (first and only relationship) had been cheating on me with my mom’s home healthcare worker, who was 10 years younger than her and a lesbian. They married each other behind my back in October of that year, and in January the following year, moved out of state with our 2 children. 

The reason that November 2010 is of particular note is that it marks the last time I was intimate with someone. After the betrayal, I developed strong trust issues and stopped seeking out any sort of relationships with anyone else. At the time, I was unemployed and had waay too much time to ruminate about my situation. I was fortunate enough to get a job, though not one that paid a living wage. I spent 5 years at that job, until, in 2016, the stress of the job caused a nervous breakdown where I almost committed suicide. I was put on short-term disability, but have not returned to any work since. 

In 2019, the result of a DCS case rendered my parental rights to my daughter cancelled (this is due to 2 years of a case that I don’t want to detail here). Also, during this time, my mom (who I live with and am caregiver for) ended up in the hospital twice, and required a heart valve replacement. During that time, I gained 50+ pounds. I’ve been overweight since I was 9, but that now has me at my highest weight ever. 2020 was...2020. My mental problems got worse and I completely embraced the “shelter in place” life, and have become weaker, duller, and with an apathy that makes me not care about anything in life any longer.  

Yesterday, I decided to write all of this out to see if someone can help me figure out how to get unstuck from this life. This past decade has felt like everything just froze in place and I stopped progressing in any way. Mentally, I feel much younger than I am, but I’m 42, and feel like life has left me behind. One thing in particular hit home yesterday when my mind was on the subject. I’m so tired of being by myself, having no one to care. I don’t feel good about myself physically to believe that anyone would want this. 

Anyway, I don’t know if I’ll get any responses to this, but I’m hoping.",30Nov2020,1

I had an “inner voice” pop up out of nowhere and it sounded like me but deeper and threatening. All that I heard was “hey” but it definitely freaked me out. 

Fast forward to last night I was trying to sleep and the voice came back. My thoughts were racing before bed and they started being more intrusive until that deep voice appeared for the second time saying “do it” as my head was thinking a lot about death (a family member actually passed away in the middle of the night after this happened).

218,"I am having two issues, memory issue and really strange and vivid dreams.

1. Hazy memory issues: I was sexually assaulted when I was 4/5 yo, and ever since then I have been always depressed and withdrawn from everything around me. Due to this my memory is badly affected mainly short term memory. Things get hazy/foggy and I just can't to remember things. Even when I'm talking I forget simple words and get stuck. Is there a way I can improve my memory at least a little bit?  
Memory is only thing that's had affected my UG college performance and I don't want my grad to be effected as well, please help me out.

2. Another thing that I have been suffering from is really strange and vivid dreams. They feel so   
real almost like a VR, and I am able to control my actions as though I am in a game. The   
theme/environment are so bizarre like me running away from alien invasion, or passing by an   
extremely graphically detailed accident where the person neck was decapitated due to accident.  
I don't watch any movies at all, neither do I play video games nor do I watch any youtube at all.  
There was only one game I have played my entire life, freedom fighter, and I watch movies that   
are either animated and that too once about 3/4 months so I have no idea where I am getting   
there dreams from every single night.   
And they feel really really realistic since they include the surrounding that I live in, for example   
the alien one where I hid inside my bed, everything was really detailed about the bed, like how   
the insides of the bed is divided into 2 and way you open it, everything was realistic. It's affecting   
me a lot, reality and dreams are getting more and more difficult to separate. I am getting   
confused as to what is happening is real or just a dream. Please please help me out. 

And if this is not the right place for this, can you please let me know where can I get the help.  
I have tried explaining this exact thing to my therapist but she's not able to understand what I mean since I don't know what I am suffering from to begin with, maybe someone who suffers from exactly same thing can help me understand or let me know how I can explain to her please please.",30Nov2020,1
219,"I'm tired of living. I can't stand breathing. I've felt like this for as long as I can remember. I had my first suicidal thoughts when I was 13. They haven't gone away. 

My family never eanted me. My mom never hid the fact that she waited to long to go to the clinic for an abortion. She lied to me my whole life. We moved to the UK when I was almost 15, she kicked me out less then a year later. There was no one around to judge her every move, so now she could be rid of me without any judgement. I got pregnant very young. I thought I was finally getting the family I always wanted. I was so happy.

My husband abuses me in everyway except for physically. So I don't have any proof. I am bound to him by a visa, I can't get out. My kids treat me like shit no matter what I do to try and make them happy.

I can't even go to university because I don't qualify for finance. I can't make my life better. This is it. I gave up my whole future for a family that hates me. I can't go home because that family never wanted me either. I was never meant to be. Just a one night stand gone horribly wrong.

I had this piece of wire in my hand all the time, fumbling around and so on.

226,"So I just eked my way through a BA this year, but my parents said I shouldn't be idle so I signed up for a 2-year degree at a technical college. I thought it'd be fairly easy, but the course load for my program is actually heavier than I'm used to - 15 credits per semester - plus I think online learning makes it too easy for me to slip into bad habits. I'm probably going to get put on academic probation this semester.

I'm a shitty student, to be frank. Pair me with a good teacher and a subject I'm genuinely interested in/good at, and I can get those A's, but that intersection rarely happens so my grades swing wildly at the best of times. Often, I find myself barely working on assignments or cramming for every exam. The only reason I was able to get by pre-covid was because I'd always attend class and would absorb all the information I needed just by listening to lectures and taking notes. I'd also help my friends with stuff they didn't understand, so that kind of helped reinforce what I learned.

Online learning absolutely torpedoes that, though. I was attending lectures pretty faithfully at the start, if getting distracted by social media and tuning out the lectures for a few minutes at a time. But because I got distracted, I didn't know what I was doing as well as usual for assignments or quizzes. I started falling behind slowly, and the more I fell behind the less I guess I cared for even attending lectures. I find myself outright playing videogames or sleeping through lectures since it's so easy to do.

I'm not sure what to do, at this point, and it doesn't seem like an easy fix. Couple this all with my mental health boiling off so I'm having emotional meltdowns daily/multiple times a day, and I'm just having a rough time overall.",30Nov2020,1

I’ll just start by saying I have a long-ish history of mostly depression. Recently I’ve noticed that my especially bad episodes may line up with my period. Ive been logging how I feel every day, because my therapist said it was possible that I have PMDD. But now I dont know if they actually have anything to do with my period. Like, it definitely makes sense that I would think that though. Because i'll have a series of days that are just so incredibly out of hand that I dont even recognize or feel like myself. But the thing that I hate is that I think it has to do with men. Or whoever I’m interested in at a given time. Because I hung out with my boyfriend on the 28th at night after 3 days of crying nonstop, and the 29th and 30th I’ve been fine, other than the fact  that Ive been thinking about my mental health nonstop and have had trouble sleeping. And I still havent gotten my period, 2 days late according to the app. I think I just need to  come to terms with the fact that I get obsessive over certain people. Its weird tho because when my boyfriend was over it wasnt like I was all better; i needed to be talking/thinking about something else constantly or else i would start crying. I was really sad to think about how sad I am lol. Like i would start crying because I would think about how if I was alone I would just be laying in bed depressed, or how tomorrow I'll be hopeless again. Or just like always casually thinking about dying, just in the background of my thoughts. Or the pointlessness of everything or whatever I’m doing. Ugh I just need help sorting everything out. I see a therapist but idk its just not accomplishing what I want it to. I feel like my depression is becoming my entire identity/all i ever think about. 

Basically, I'm not asking for a diagnosis. But I felt weirdly comforted at the thought of having an explanation for my mood swings (PMDD), as much as having that sucks im sure. I just hate the thought of this being completely normal, but like I cant handle it for some reason? Idk if that makes any sense. Im scared to post this lollll",30Nov2020,1

233,"For a long time I’ve tried to figure out what I could do to make others feel better when I’ve felt like complete shit myself. I always thought that if I could put a smile on someone’s face then it might help with my own. I always go out of my way to say “have a great day” and show endless amounts of kindness and respect towards others. I’ll wait that extra minute to hold the door open for someone who is half a mile away. It’s frustrating when people think you’re being sarcastic when you’re just trying to be polite. “Thank you so much sir, have a wonderful day” when I buy something at Stewart’s. People turn their head and kind of roll their eyes. Does it really take that much effort to be nice? I hemmed and hawed over making those really cool painted rocks with a few words on them and spreading them around my community but I don’t feel like I have that energy yet. I recently had someone leave a rubber duck on the door handle of my jeep with “you’ve been ducked - duckduckjeep” written on a little piece of paper and thought boy that’s a pretty fucking rad way to make someone’s day. I kept it for a few weeks and decided to share it with someone else parked next to me at the dollar store. So basically what I’ve landed on (which EVERYONE and their brother is doing) was make an Instagram account with the intent of posting all of the affirmations and awesome things that have been taught to me in therapy. I’m not going to be copying anyone else’s posts - they will all be original (although quotes are quotes) and will be posting one every morning. If any of you think this might be a decent idea I’d appreciate all the support I can get. I don’t have very much social interaction outside of my husband and work so I thought this would be a nice way to make that happen, even if it’s minuscule. My husband is my biggest supporter and said it would be pretty cool to make tshirts or stickers too. I’ve literally been to each end of the mental health spectrum being bipolar and having anxiety, depression and PTSD. I don’t like to talk about it very much but I really think it’s the little things in life that matter. The - “have a wonderful day” could make someone want to stay alive for another day.

236,"I'm sorry if this disjointed and jumbled.  I will answer any questions, clarify, or move to a more fitting sub.  I just don't know where to begin and the MHA search I did turned up zero results even tweaking the search with broader categories and distance radius.  TL;DR:  Help for an 60m with *possibly* undiagnosed dementia/Alzheimer's but definitely depression at the very least who is NOT receptive to help.

So here goes it:  

My dad needs help. He will be 60 in January however my brothers and I noticed quite a few years ago (approximately 5 years ago) that his mind seemed to be going.  It's small things but we've kept an eye on it.  After talking to my grandma at the time (his mother) she passed it off because dad can be quite flaky and goofy at the best of times but after I brought it up she did start to notice out of character behaviors.  Very short term forgetfulness, conversations become disrupted because he seems to be thinking and speaking to something completely irrelevant to the conversation.  We started considering early onset Alzheimer's or dementia since his dad had it too but he is absolutely against help or health checks.  He doesn't refuse outright but he will pass it off, placate, then distance and avoid anyone who brings it up.

He was never good about taking care of himself but it's coming to a head now.  His long term girlfriend recently broke up with him.  It was amicable but she couldn't handle the responsibility and she had her own stress/life to handle.  We are on very good terms.  With all of that and Covid it goes without saying that he is absolutely battling depression at the very least.

But now his posts on Facebook can be interpreted as suicidal, when my brothers and I visit, his normal wit, humor, and easygoing disposition are gone.  Many people have commented on this to me as they've noticed it as well.  He can barely manage a forced smile.  He's quicker to cry.  Hes never been embarrassed of crying but it's just now it's more.  His ex girlfriend confided that he's not changing his clothes.  His apartment isn't bad by his normal standards.  If anything it seems a bit more tidy than normal.  (He's always been a messy person and somewhat of a hoarder) but I worry that will be another area to get worse as time goes on.  

He's been unemployed for a while using an inheritance as a cushion but he's very bad with money so I doubt there's anything left of it but he won't accept any new job even though he's had many offers.  I'm not even sure if it's wise to take anymore work in his field anymore, honestly.  With his lack of focus and forgetfulness since he's always been blue collar, working in a factory setting and using heavy machinery I worry he could hurt himself or othera.  His driving even worries me.

He stonewalls, placates, dismisses any attempts from family and friends to address concerns or offer help.

I'm at a complete loss as to what to do.  I'm also worried that his sister's may be pushing him in an unhealthy way.  Though they are very well intentioned, they are assertive, Type A, driven people while dad is the opposite.  I'm afraid their assertive approach may do more harm than good overall and he'll further retreat in an effort to alleviate embarrassment and pressure.

But I'm broke, live a bit further away than the rest of the family, and Covid prevents me from wanting to go do my own wellness checks and food delivery for him.  But I'm so worried and I'm at a loss.

I need help.  Direction.  Resources.  And how is the best way to get him to want help???  Or at least accept help.  I don't want to being any more identifying but we do live in south-eastern Wisconsin if that helps.",30Nov2020,1

238,"This is going to be a long post i might cover multiple years idk.
 
I'm currently 17, I will be 18 in a month and I'm doing my last year in high school. I don't know how it happened, it was going well during the first year, but I'm all alone. When 1st year of high school finished to my surprise no one ever contacted me. So I stayed whole summer at home inside, and I didn't think much of it. I started learning a new language, watched a lot of movies, TV shows, it didn't effect me much. Year 2 comes and I sit alone in every class (the desks in our school are for 2 people). They would make plans about going out, going to parties etc. in front of me and don't ask me or include me. So naturally I ""evolved"" to not care about it, for example if I'm talking to a class mate and another comes by and starts asking him about hanging out, i would just stand there quiet. I was sad about it but again nothing much happened to me. Occasionally I would get invited to play football when they don't have enough players and they need me, but nothing else, they didn't made any effort to talk back to me. I took every chance to hang out with someone thinking they would see that I'm not bad to hang out with.
 
Around this point I noticed that I was starting to get paranoid. I would check the messages to see if the invite is real and I didn't imagine it. It stared getting worse as I would check multiple times before going, I would stop in the middle of the road to check if I imagined getting invited. I really noticed it when I had to call my barber because ""i forgot what time I was supposed to come"" when in fact I thought I imagined calling an appointment. Since then I started putting on my calendar whenever I make plans to make sure I haven't imagined them. Fast forward to year 3 and I tried changing up a little. I changed my focus to another group of my classmates. Because I was staying at home all this time I learned a lot of things off of the internet. I found out about cracked apps for smartphones. So I showed that I have a lot of apps without paying for them. Everyone wanted me to make them Spotify for free. And I did. People were liking me a little now I guess. They would come and talk to me occasionally and I would share a new app that I found and give it to them. But I started noticing that they were doing it only because they had something to gain so I stopped. At this point I was out of ideas what to do when I'm alone so I just sat there either day dreaming or thinking. I have spent days if not months thinking about the universe, timespace, planets, god, religion, countries, war and much more.
 
I noticed that when I start thinking about big things like the universe or existence I get more depressed. I know life has no meaning, and when I start thinking more into it, I start getting suicidal (i swear if someone comments the 1 800). So I try distancing myself from those thoughts, but I have very good arguments about a lot of that kind of stuff. That's the 1 out of 2 things that make me depressed. The second is the missing out. Thank you corona for giving me some free breathing space on that.
 
Nothing much happened between 3rd and now 4th year.
  
 I started noticing that my thinking has changed. If you've ever meditated, you know the feeling when you get lost in thoughts and you pull yourself to the moment of right here right now. I get those moments of awareness from time to time, and sometimes I don't know if shit is real or not. I started to experience stuff differently, I have gone to museums and never feel anything, but now everywhere I look I am aware of everything. Like right here before me someone died in war.
 
The most recent moment that made me write this on the first place was some time ago when I went countryside and planted some trees. I would look into the mountains and valleys and I didn't knew if anything is real, if I'm really there. Even the next day, my back and arms were hurting but I was still in doubt if that really happened. Everyone around me knows it did but I don't know what's happening to me.
 
There was a meme about someone sending a random messages of numbers to a schizo person. And I was like oh shit I would totally start believing and doubting everything and lose my mind. I saw a small paper on the two bottles of water I drank that had the numbers 5 and 1. And I don't know of I believe something is up with that. It's starting to get more frequent. I'm afraid I'm losing my mind, I'm afraid I might be a schizophrenic and I think all is happening because I've been alone for 4 years. Like I haven't even hugged someone in at least 4 years. I see how I'm disappointing everyone around me. I went off course for a little never mind that. Even while writing this, I got a random notification and I thought what if this is a sign that I'm not supposed to do this. Also do you ever think that you're being watched and nothing is real and ""they"" want to see how long it would take to figure it out? And if you die you will be back in the real world or something idk.
 
Anyway probably no one will read this because it's a fucking novel so tldr i guess. I'm going crazy. People of Netflix If you're doing a documentary of me because of something I will do in the future, hello.
 
Shit while I'm here I might say this too. I think I'm smarter than everyone now. At least this last year. Like no one is able to think like me, no one can understand things like me I'm smarter than you go fuck yourselves, smart people always seem crazy to the mindless ones who are still buying iPhones and tell me it's better, like bitch i know more about hardware that you're whole generation knows about reproduction.
 
If you're still here, thanks for listening, you're the only ones that I've ever told this, and maybe ever will",30Nov2020,1
239,"She stabbed her, making sure to put all of her strength into that repeated motion. There was nothing else she could think about other than that she wanted her gone. She could not even hear her screams anymore, and she was not sure if this was because the other was dead already or if her rage made her unable to even hear. 
There, happy? she thought. She had also stopped seeing after a while of this. She did not need to. Her motion was as close to the previous one each time, so even if she could not see, her knife would still hit its target. Are you out of your misery now? she thought again. The other had complained multiple times that she was not happy with her life anymore, that she just wanted to not exist for a while. Now you will never need to return to your normal life. Too bad that I will have to remain behind. But not for long. Do not worry my dear. I will join you soon. I just need to write a letter, for the both of us. We cannot leave without an explanation. that would be just cruel. And probably even annoying. We do not want to annoy anyone, now do we? 
Then she realised how tired she was, her arms especially. she halted her motions, slowly regaining her senses. She looked down at the body of the other, at the wounds on her chest. How many times had she driven her knife into her? It did not really matter. All that mattered was that she was gone. 
she examined the torn flesh, the blood that was coming out of the wounds like a small spring. I wonder where its destination would be. In what sea it would end up. Would it merge with another river on its way? No one would ever know. Because the river would at one point dry out and be forgotten. That is how these things work, right? When a body of water just dries out, that's that. Humans do not even seem to care when that happens. What could such a small river do to change that? 
Hopefully the bottom of the ocean is welcoming, she thought. It is probably not warm, but it would be nice if someone welcomed us there. Otherwise, how would we know that we have arrived at the right place? The ocean is so vast after all.
I wish I could have seen the light once more. It was always so bright. The light of the sun was annoying most of the time because it made her sweaty and uncomfortable, but that light was different. It was a warm light that was somehow always there when she had needed it. It never did anything to comfort her, but just its warmth amid the cold of being alive was enough to make her think, ""what if things could have turned out differently?"". Maybe it was not meant to be in this universe. maybe in a parallel universe she was braver and with the help of this light she managed to succeed. succeed in what? that does not matter, does it? she thought bitterly.
she looked down at her again. Her face had an expression of panic and horror, her hands also had slashes from when she tried to defend herself. That did not last long. she was as weak as her killer after all. they were both weak. 
Will someone even find us here? Hopefully. I don't want anyone to be left with any doubt about what happened to us. Sure, that would be an entertaining story for the Internet, but that would bring pain to anyone who knew us and cared. I wonder how many would feel pain. 
She realised how tired she was from the whole thing. Thinking was always so exhausting these days. It was not healthy. It made people sick. not the light though. The light was too strong to become sick from thinking. 
No matter, not even the light is here to save you! she thought bitterly. That was true. The light did not know everything after all, as gifted as it was. The light was not there to see her stab the other to death. To see both of them fight for what they thought was best for them. To see who won in the end. Nobody was there to see that. Only the winner. And isn't the winner the one who writes history? 
She was starting to feel nauseous. She may have been cruel, but she was still human. The smell from the corpse was starting to become unbearable. She had to get rid of it. She would not be able to write a proper letter with such a horrible smell bothering her. 
She began dragging the body from its place in the middle of the room and towards the door. Outside it would be better. It would also decompose faster. Would it not be cooler if they found a skeleton instead of a half decomposed body? They would also have a difficult time figuring out the cause of death. Nobody needed to know that. 
She did not mind the trail of blood that followed them across the house. In a few days nobody would be here so it would not be an inconvenience to anyone. In time, it would dry out and become a part of the floor. Yes , the plan was perfect, simple as it was. 
She went inside and began writing. There were a lot of individuals that she needed to address. A lot of loose ends. A lot of plot holes. First, the family. Then ""friends"". Then, the light. Then, some teachers who had been nice to both of them. They were not perfect and they had also caused them suffering, but they had also not bothered them in every single lesson. lastly, She explained why everything happened the way it did. Not that it was important to her, but for others it must have been somewhat important. After all, she had learned in school that when writing a letter you have to state the purpose of the letter. 
She furrowed her eyebrows. Damn it. That goes in the beginning of the letter. how stupid can I be? She got a new sheet of paper and began writing again, this time making sure to write the purpose of the letter first. After she reread that a couple of times and deemed it good enough, she began copying everything else from the other sheet of paper. When she finished, she made the first attempt into a small ball and tossed it out of the window. she did not need it as much as she did not need her. 
She made sure to finish the letter in an appropriate manner and reread it again and again in order to make sure that she had not made any mistakes. That would be embarrassing. They would think she was stupid! So after she made sure that it was all good, she put it inside an envelope, and on that envelope she wrote their names and the date.
She placed the envelope on the desk, and left the room. Then, she went and lied down next to the other.

240,"It's not even like I just love winning. I like winning sure. But I HATE losing. It's in everything that involves competition.

I don't care if it's something like a single player game. But if it's like an online game, a sport, a competition for who's better at what, I want to be the best at it and I don't want anything in my way. 

I have other healthy hobbies like music which is personal, but even that's becoming a competition because I DON'T like it when I see better pianists. I hate being 2nd place. 2nd place is just the first loser. 

But I agree that this isn't a good habit. It's even come down to competing against my own family members. I compete with everyone at school and with my friends. And when I lose, it's not a pretty feeling.

It's not like a little ""oooh well. It's okay! Practice makes perfect!"" I'm not a Kareoke machine. I want my opponents knowing I'm the best.

I'm probably gonna hate the comments flooding me with sarcasm and how I'm so toxic, but that's the point. I'm venting cause I can't take it anymore. I hate hating losing and it's so unhealthy. 

I'm developing anger issues and I feel like I'm gonna get fucking depression. I already have social anxiety which I also hate because it gets in the way of my winning. I hate being vulnerable.

241,"I'm not sure if this is the right forum for this. Also, my first post on this reddit, I apologise if I overstep/overlook some rules.

I live in a country where mental health is a huge taboo topic. I remember when I was in 9th standard, I was prescribed anti depressants for the first time. My mother was okay with me taking medicines for my health till she realised what they were and then threw them away because I shouldn't need those.

Things have only become worse since. I'm in law school and it's taken a massive toll on my mental health, along with some traumatic experiences I underwent. I have never been able to find a decent therapist, again hugely because of how taboo the subject is and I would've had to lie to my mum to get the money for it. 

My mum's become a lot more open minded since the pandemic and I had to move back home and my mum actually insisted I look for a therapist. I finally found someone that I thought I could talk to. My first session was supposed to be two weeks ago but I woke up with this massive sense of dread and this heaviness in my body. I just couldn't go through with it. So I dropped her an email saying that due to some issues, I wouldn't be able to attend any sessions for 2 weeks. She was disappointed about the short notice but she seemed understanding. 

I am supposed to have a session with her this Wednesday and I am freaking out. I don't know why I'm feeling like this because I have been actively looking for therapists the last few years and I've finally found someone who I think will be a really good fit for me. I have this massive urge to make an excuse and I know I shouldn't. 

I don't know how to explain this but, if anyone's seen videos of hedgehogs? Where they're all scrunched up and you wave food in front of them and they sort of open up? It's the exact reverse of that - like you play a video of that backwards and that is what I feel like is happening with all my organs.",30Nov2020,1

255,"I'm not sure why or how but lately I've been feeling a bit separated from reality a little bit and it's a recurring feeling I've had through most of my 18 years being alive. Trees, roads and people's faces and voices seem so distant even tho it's all so physically close; almost merged with my physical body. If I'm touching tree bark and feeling the texture or my feet are pressing against the street crossings and side walks; the air dancing with the fabrics of my clothes and hair as cars zoom past with people rushing in there own little bubble of a life. These things are close to me and I feel present in them, but I don't feel connected. 

It's like I'm kind of not here but here, and I don't mean not mentally here but physically here but more so I'm here mentally and physically, but my mind gives this perspective like others are more present then I am regardless, like I got a cheap ticket to reality that I at some point thought was a good deal. My ticket made the cut but I'm not getting all the features others are getting, almost like I'm half ghost half human. 

This is a very hard feeling to describe and I've ignored it so much that it's kind of become a filter over my mind's eye that I just accepted as normal, but recently it's like I'm pointing at things that thought they had slipped in my mind without consequence or me noticing, but by their surprise I see them clear as day and feel like I'm a undertrained body guard asking them to leave but they are giving me a hard time or taking advantage of my kindness and softness and just ignoring me as I'm trying to escort them out of the building. 

What a strange post, but I would appreciate any thoughts or possible people who can relate, like am I actually alone on this? I'm not sure, but have a lovely day whoever is reading this and thank you for putting in the time. Stay true ❤️",30Nov2020,1
256,"19F. I have been taking Zoloft 25 mg and Trittico for severe anxiety, mild depression. My problems started back in September, after not being able to move out to uni in another country and staying at home doing online uni when all of my friends went away. I also had a massive scare about cancer because I had some very weird symptoms and I believe I also got health anxiety from this experience.

Since then, every day has just been constant self-checking and googling various symptoms. At first I used to get genuinely anxious about illnesses, thinking every night that I was not going to wake up the next morning because of an underlying condition I don't know about.

However, as I finally recognized that I need help and started taking meds, things took a different turn. I had really bad side-effects in the beginning and I also had COVID I believe, although very very mild. Now I am starting to feel better, but something is still off. It's like I still have all of these nasty physical symptoms every day and I just can't stop thinking about medical conditions. I don't think I'm going to die anymore but I intentionally spend so much time reading about and researching diseases that I could have when I experience a certain sensation.

I wonder if this will also pass with time as I take my meds? I feel a lot more neutral about these things now as zoloft has helped me with the bad thoughts but I still very much get intrusive ones. I just react to it a bit more bluntly. 

I was never told by a doctor for sure, but I have started to believe I may be prone to OCD. Even when I was younger, I remember having really weird thoughts about what would happen if I jumped off a cliff or I pushed someone from a height or something. I have no idea if this makes sense but I really want these bad thoughts and feelings to go away.

Please give your advice",30Nov2020,1

258,"Hey guys I just was wanted to get some opinions on what should do to feel better about my life and where I'm at. I'm 23 years old I turn 24 next month. I was on meth in my late teens into my early twenties. I have not used hard drugs in close to 2 years. the reason I quit doing drugs was because I got tired of day to day living and living based on  other people giving. since I quit that path I now live with my dad ,work at a logistics warehouse, have my own car, a good laptop, and other nice things that I would never had before. I also completed a 14 week Data Analytics boot camp back in the spring this year. I was doing really good at the school and surprised my self with how well I adapted to a new field one that I enjoyed as well. however I graduated the program when the pandemic had just started so job opportunities where nowhere to be found. I've had the job I have right know for 13 months, I do not like the work I do at all. my payrate is $18.50 which is a lot better than being homeless, but is not enough to live a life in which I'm able to more than just survive. on top of all this I'm also single and will not be with just any girl that will take me because I don't want to be alone ( I have been single ever since I quit the drug life).

260,"As I've said - I feel totally blank. Of course, I still feel anxiety if something goes wrong, I feel sad when I get a bad grade - I feel negative emotions, but since some time, I'm not able to feel happiness. Of course, I get those little ""happy"" moments, from time to time, like when... what? It's another topic, tightly connected with the one in the topic - my memory and my mind. Since I remember, I have always been a person, that always asks ""Was there any homework?"" Even if we had the lesson yesterday or ""Do you have a hairband?"" when we have P.E, even if we have it 4 times a week.

I also don't enjoy my main hobby anymore - drawing. Even though I still draw, I do it only if I don't know what to do anymore or if (even for a second) a small lightning-bulb appears in my head with a plan for a drawing.

I feel bad about myself. But there's my ability - I am able to think about nothing for such a long time (for an example - watching youtube, staring at a wall), that when I start doing something else, I'm starting to have a ""restart mode"", when everything I was ignoring, comes to my head once again. Pros - I don't remind myself of embarrassing moments when I fall asleep - my body and mind go numb.

Since some time, I started to get some problems with my grades - I can't focus or even if I can, the pressure goes up - I start doing everything faster almost against my will, my heart starts to beat faster and I get scared that I won't be able to pass or make it on time, even if it's still early. Problems with grades... even if I'm cheating with my textbook and notebook and Discord with my friend on chat open - such a shame. When I look back, even a week or a month, I'm starting to understand - the life of mine, has been such a shame, that even if I cheat, even if I win a competition, even if I mastered a foreign language - I will never be fulfilled because I have nowhere to go. Nobody to meet, nothing to wait for.

Go the fu\*k away with those things like ""Everyone has a goal in life if you will die somebody will miss you"" or any bullcrap like that. It doesn't work. Yes, I want to become a doctor, yes it's a great job, but I don't see any value in it, except money and overworking myself at university.

Human life? I don't know, I have one, I was at some funerals, I don't have any grandfather so I don't know how would he act... I didn't save anyone, I didn't bring anything into one's life, at least - anything good. I don't see anything great that would come, even if later. 

I know that I probably offended somebody by saying that I don't exactly see a value in life. It's a great point. But I don't know what it's like to lose somebody and I don't think I want that. I'm just saying that I don't see a value in my, in my life and who I want to be. I'll probably become a terrible doctor and end up in prison for assigning bad medications for somebody anyway - not that I want to though, maybe that somebody has more valuable life than mine - maybe they have kids, or a lover - or both...

But I don't have anything to do. I don't know why I wake up every day. Is it because I have to? Is it because I have to do my work and go to sleep again? Never-ending cycle? Paradox?

Hi everyone, 

I have an issue thats been on my mind for a while. 

I have come to the realization that I need alcohol  or other kinds of drug to like, and even feel love, for other people. This is not only for acquaintance but everyone. I have never said i loved someone and really meant it except when being drunk or some other drug. Nicotine can also make me feel tempory positive feelings for people but is very short lived.

This have led to that in order for me to be able to approach and really feel attraction to women there initially always have to be alcohol involved and there needs to be a constant intake until we start to have sex. After the sex, unless i drink more alcohol, most or all the romantic feelings disappear. 

In the same mannen, the only time I have told my family that I love them and really felt it, is when i am intoxicated. I would say I love them sober because i would die for them without any doubt but i dont feel a strong feeling of connection and mutual understanding. For this i must have some kind of drug or other thing that makes me feel high on life as a large accomplishment in my career. But these are all very temporary as well. 

I should say that I have had long sober periods and this have not change a bit, only that people likes me less because I seem to be quite indifferent to them which is kind of true. Everyone likes me more when i am a sporadic smoker/drinker than not. I therefore feel like i need to self medicate to feel normal towards people. 

I have a lot of ”friend” that if if i hang out with them sober our relationship quickly deterioate because I just dont feel any positive feelings towards them, but then we drink together and i feel ”genuine” love for them again.

I have had two girlfriends (of course initialised by alcohol) but our whole relationship was based on sex which gave me that natural high. After the honeymoon phase alcohol was needed but this of course was not sustainable so it all broke apart. 

Also, I have never felt ”natural” attraction towards any women but i have to go into a mode where i set up a goal that I want to sleep with her. So there have to be a chase involved in order for me to even be able to persue a women.

Is there someone here that might have a clue What is wrong with me? I am a healthy and somewhat successful 28 year old male that seem to have an emotional problem. 

Any answer is appreciated!",30Nov2020,1
262,"First year of uni, recently went off my anti-depressants, life is better then ever. Thing is, I moved away from home so I cant see my psychiatrist. I have a history of depression, anxiety and self harm, I've been clean for a year but last week I came very very close to relapsing. Im noticing old habits and destructive tendencies reappearing and Im having trouble keeping up with work. My support system tells me I should talk to my university's student wellfare.



Whats stopping me? Well I'm afraid of being treated like a nutcase. I know what its like for everyone to walk on eggshells around me, and I dont want that to happen, I dont want to get special treatment from my professors, I want to be just like any other student. Im in a new place with new people who dont know my past, I dont want to bring it back up again.



I know its what I should do, but Im scared that if they know my history of self harm they wont let me work with sharp objects or dangerous equipment, I dont know if these fears are reasonable or not, I just dont want to be treated like a basketcase.

263,"Edit: trigger warning // mention of getting abused and mention of a suicide attempt

Hi, i’m 15F and i was badly abused mentally and physically by my father for years. I never said anything until 1 year ago maybe? 
I have Severe anxiety and ADHD. I am scared to do anything. I am even scared to go outside and to go to school. I have to work in a room on my own or with my friend because i’m scared of other people. I have a therapist and all i do is cry. I just get so scared and i can’t even say anything. Every time i think about it it makes me upset or scared to the point where i shake. My therapist knows i have really bad anxiety and understands, but i feel like i’m wasting her time. I have 1 friend who is really really nice to me and she understands me. I haven’t told her what happened but she knows that i am not ok. I do talk to my therapist alot and stuff but the main thing about this question is that my father used to call me names and make me feel usless and small. I am 4ft 10in so yeah, but small as in scared. 

I can’t help but feel small. Everything is big. Everyone is so much better than me and they can do things that i can’t. I am even scared to eat in front of anyone so i don’t eat much. I eat in my room and it’s only snacks and things. I have been in hospital for a suicide attempt a few months ago because i was scared of seeing my father again. I am ok now but i can’t do this anymore. 

I feel small and helpless and usless. I can’t even pay for things by a cashier. I need my mother to do it. I am really really shy. I hardly ever talk to anyone. I do get bullied for it, and i guess i’m used to it idk. My friend and my mother are the best people in the world to me. My best friend even got her mother and herself to come to my house because i was having a bad anxiety attack and they calmed me down. She lives 20 miles away. She is the best person.

265,"When I (17M) was a child in kindergarten I didn't socialized like others did because they kept away from me. I might was very boring person to talk to, now I'm too. One girl told me in kindergarten that she hates me so much and also her new friend does (she was new in kindergarten). At this time it made me feel very bad. Now and from school life I've had problems with keeping same sleep schedule and I still have problems getting up in the morning. Until when I was 14 my life was repairable in social life but now everyone where I live and have lived think I'm bastard or something like that. One familiar person told me that almost all people where I live have been made memes of me in social media (in FB and made it private for me) and call me with 100 names but not when I hear it. At 13 I was curious about myself why I never get mad and I started forcing my self to be mad. I thought I'm not a man enough if I never get mad. I know that a real man never use his strength against females with no reason. With that I almost put myself in a life-threatening situation. I scared my mother with empty gas canister, I pretended to be starting throwing that lightweight thing to her because she started screaming about me how failure I'm and she threw me with a glass bottle towards to head. I protected it with my hand which has wound or trace now. This was last time I was violent to someone until I got surveillance which actually ruined my life. I started smoking nutmeg and drunk 3 - 5 beer bottles at 14 when I was surveillance. I was sober for a year, but this year I drunk over 500ml of vodka and some other alcoholics drinks. When I smoked nutmeg, It made me angry and violent to people that I live with. I heard neighbors talking about my self, where I go and what I talk about but when I was high on nutmeg I screamed to them that I'm going to kill all of them who are listening me by that police surveillance app or what ever stuff it is called. I've missed school a lot from when I was 14, because nothing invited me there. I had only one friend from school who didn't want to talk to me but talked to me when someone else didn't want to talk to him. Fundamentally I've been lonely almost all my life because I'm still very boring person who rather listen to other people. Yes maybe I don't deserve having friends because of what I've done. Year ago I found out I'm not 100% hetero but I'm fine with it. When I was 13 I was very interested to islam maybe I wanted to inhibit that I'm not hetero and I wanted to convert to islam. Now I have problems with studying, I don't understand anymore like It is relevant to at my age. I almost fall asleep every day at school. I'm also addicted to internet and music (it makes feel better), I try to find out what's wrong with me. I don't isolate dreams and real life, I don't know do I dreamed while sleeping or it was real life. I've had false memories too. Most of the time I think should I live or not because my life probably becomes a mess when I have to go to work.

268,"10 years ago I lost my dream job of being a pilot. I had worked really hard for 2 years and gotten a scholarship to be a helicopter pilot at an aviation university. I was living my childhood dream. I loved flying and knew that was what I wanted to do with my life. Everything was going great, and then I was raped and developed PTSD. I was no longer able to pass the mental health requirements for my flight physical, and my school took the flight scholarship away. Because of the medications that I have taken since then, I can never fly again. My dreams were completely crushed. Between that and my PTSD, my life really went down the drain. I became suicidal and felt as though my life was over. I had no goals or hopes for the future. I was apathetic and had no desire to do anything else.

 In the end, I decided to go into the medical field; I thought that perhaps in helping others I could help myself. I became a paramedic, and I've been working in EMS for 5 years now. My career field is often considered a stepping stone to other careers like nursing, PA school, or the fire department. As a result, many of my co-workers are just passing through to get to other things. It's nice seeing their enthusiasm in pursuing their dreams, but at the same time it makes me really sad. I feel incredibly apathetic about my job. It's nice to help people feel better in bad situations, but I really have no passion for my work. I've realized that I'm really unhappy and something needs to change. I've been trying to look into other things that I'm interested in, but it just makes me really sad. I feel like a complete failure and go back to feeling that my life is over and wishing I was dead. I think about how my dream of being a pilot is gone and there's nothing left now.

272,"I don't self-harm but I just feel like THE definition of flat/meh. (Warning: Long ramble ahead sorry for lack of proofreading)

(This is going to be a ramble because I only had fifteen minutes to write this)

&amp;#x200B;

I have felt this way since March 2019. I just feel kind of blah. I have a roommate and he has friends come over but I just don't feel any joy or happiness even engaging in things that I used to love like watching videos, playing games, listening to music, talking, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean stuff just sounds kind of blah to me lately. Games just seem very meh, anything on youtube/netflix/OTA/etc. is just eh at best and blech at worst. Like I just both feel blah and meh but also don't feel anything at the same time. I mean I just feel like everything takes effort it just nothing matters. I don't feel love, joy, etc. Music just doesn't sound as rich, nuanced, good, etc as it used to. I've tried various genres, speakers, etc. and nothing has really helped. I know part of it is my hearing loss but it just feels like that some of it just does not work. It feels blah and lifeless and honestly not that much better/exciting/fun then I remember music/sound hearing during the one or two day comedown/hangover where it sounded extremely extremely flat. I used to do dxm which come December 20th I'll have been sober from for two years.

&amp;#x200B;

I have also had many memory issues lately. I can not for the life of me remember anything really. I mean it just feels like I have lots of memory issues. I mean if I set something down somewhere I'll forget where it is. Like I misplace things constantly especially at work. I'll set down a box-cutter or scissors or a clipboard somewhere and immediately forget where I put it just thirty seconds or so later on.

&amp;#x200B;

I have done some really good things in the past 18 months. I quit doing any drugs minus energy/caffeine and nicotine back on December 20, 2018 was my last time. I lost 100 lbs although I have been keeping that off in a terrible way. I have been fasting/taking a lot of fat burners and walking on those days that I do fast and I've done that up to five days in a row (longest I've gone without fasting is 136 hours). Although I haven't fasted that long since late September. The longest I've made it without eating the last two months is 64 hours. Some days I'll ""splurge"" and eat up to 11000 calories! I have fluctuated between 150 at my lowest and 180 at my highest (If I hit 180 within a day or two I immediately put the brakes on and just fast. I was around 260 to 280 prior to this. Right now as of typing this I am 173 lbs. I ate really bad the last two days (Thanksgiving and Black Friday) so now I'm going to try to fast for at least two/three days to get back under 165 lbs.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do. I always withdraw and just sit alone in my room. I do not interact with my roommate much at all. When I do bring my laptop out there to play Destiny 2 with him on our gaming laptops it does not feel good at all. I mean I fake having a tiny bit of fun and I guess maybe I do. But it seems like my absolute absolute best mood I've had lately is maybe a 6.5 out of 10 and that's either only when I've over eaten a ton of food or have done way too many energy drinks. Most often I feel like I'm a 5. Now at the absolute absolute worse I feel like maybe a 4. Like I said I have no want to self-harm or hurt anything or anyone. I do not want to damage my health and I do want to continue living.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even enjoy or feel like I love my cat as much as I used to. I pet her and such still sometimes but I used to feel a comfort and warmth in her that lately I just do not feel whatsoever. She just seems like almost everything else to me lately. Blah and uninteresting. I mean sometimes I find her cute and comforting but nowhere near what I used to.

&amp;#x200B;

Now one thing I will say that might disappoint or make some people on here mad is that on my own volition back in January 2019 I discontinued any anti-depressants/psych meds I was on. In fact I scaled back my meds completely down to just two nose sprays because I have ear/nose problems. It was with the doctor's guidance though so I weaned off of them I did not stop cold turkey.

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of ear problems I also am extremely worried about ear/hearing damage. I withdraw bad when there's loud noises even when it's only around 75 decibels or so I believe it will damage my hearing. I mean I've spent $60 on some 3m worktunes connect + am/fm hearing protectors. I got those because specifically they block out around 25 decibels of noise and because they are supposed to have two settings of volume limitation in them where they are not supposed to go above 82 decibels. I walk a lot and sometimes there's jerks that rev by in extremely loud cars and I'm afraid that it may have cost me some permanent hearing damage. I would go with in ear earbuds but I can not stand the way those feel. That is not a recent issue I've always been like that since at least a teenager which is when I can first remember trying those out so that isn't related to this at all but my point is that.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyways with all of this out of the way I just don't know what to do I am a mess. I have a neuro-psych evaluation to see what is going on with my memory issues and a psychiatrist appointment set up and I also have counseling set up but I just don't know anymore. I do not want to harm myself and I do want to continue living but it's just so blah.

&amp;#x200B;

Actually the main reason I got off of my anti-depressants in the first place is that I was worried that I was going to have serotonin syndrome caused because at the time I was still doing dxm (cough syrup) that is known when combined with anti-depressants can cause serotonin syndrome. I don't think it ever happened but I don't know. Now I've been sober three weeks shy of two years off of that but now the reason I do not want to get on anti-depressants again and want to try everything else is because of my weight. I do not want to gain weight again. I know being this much slimmer has been good for my blood pressure and stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing is that I need to work on my eating habits. I just feel so empty. It's either I can completely go the whole day without eating or I eat up to 12000 calories. Leptin doesn't exist in me it seems. I will eat until I am sick. It's all or nothing with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Please help me out with this. I would have proofread this and condensed but I have work to get to. Thank you very much for your help and sorry about the long ramble.",30Nov2020,1
273,"Hi, I just thought I'd share something thats been bugging me for quite some time now because I feel it be safer to explain it here.

There are 2 sides to me.

1: The one I show, The one I am.
2:The one Ive forgotten, the one that was locked away.

Life is hard of course and throughout the years I have made many mistakes but learned from them, becoming a.... adapting to a more quiet lifestyle, and thats all I want honestly, a quiet life......
I'm not much of a ""people"" person, to be frank I hate people in general but not hate as in despise but as in I neither like nor dislike you but anyways heres my dilemma. 

Often times there will people who will just stare at me, bully me, instigate a confrontation, and just try to cause problems to me. They will do these things and I can't help but think, ""am I being punked right now, is this a prank show? It's like people just seem to assume that I'm doing something towards that requires them to instigate, when I will just be on my phone, waiting at a bus stop.

I also work in a grocery store and have to deal with customers who don't treat me like a human being but more of an ""object"", there will be customers who invade my personal space, touching me, coming up behind me, pressing up against me. I try my best to suck it up and just try to get through the day but.... but theres always that one person who pushes it one to far.

Those certain ones who push me past my limit make the part of me that I've tried so hard to forget, to lock away come out.

Those certain people push me so far that I can feel that other part of me taking over. 

Those certain people make me want to kill them....

I start muttering to myself ""I'm going to kill you"" while my mind says the exact same thing. I can feel my body slowly becoming lifeless or numb, my mind starts to go blank, my eyes just become trained on them, I stop talking, and start walking towards them but thankfully I still have control over myself and because of this covid situation, I don't see that much people nowadays but when this pandemic ends, then what?

I used to be that loner kid everyone was afraid of and just 2 days ago my mother told me that shes afraid me....

My neighbors assume I'm a douchebag who yells at his mom yet they don't even know what shes done to me.

People's assumptions are a disease but what if I become that cure?

This is my question for you reader
This is my plea for help

What do I do?

274,Does being unproductive make you feel worthless? Does the anxiety of paying for college only to work a job you have no passion for set you over the edge? We are basically paying our lives away to survive. We go to school to get a degree only to work a job to pay bills. I understand that are other routes to take but for a majority of people this is unrealistic. Not everyone has the capital to be an entrepreneur. Not everyone has the time to sit down and develop their skills. In American we are slaves to the system until we die. We work until we are full. We pay bills until we are poor. We are deprived of happiness through means labor to gain profit for people in power. Humans were not meant to work 40+ hours of week to have two days of freedom during the week. We are worth more than what we are able to produce to society.,30Nov2020,1
275,"This might be a long one, I feel like I need to start this off by saying I don't want to die or kill myself. That being said, sometimes I picture myself with a gun to my head, even in times of happiness. Right now I have a lot of stressful and bad things going on in my life. I love being alive though, I have a son that I would literally do anything for and I couldn't picture leaving him behind by my own doing. Why do I picture this image in my mind?

Also, I've been told I lack emotions or I don't deal with things properly. A family member died recently and we were very close, he helped raise me and was always there for me. I didn't cry when he got sick, I didn't cry when he died, and I didn't cry at the funeral. I loved this person very much and I was sad but it feels like I was over it before it even happened. I feel like we all die so why be tore up about it, it happens literally everyday rather it's someone you know or not. Animals dying hurts me more then people dying. 

I've been told I lack empathy and guilt, I can definitely agree with the guilt part, I've done some things that were quite shitty and honestly could not have cared less knowing it could hurt that person. I'm aware that it could hurt them but it doesn't bother me as much as I feel it should. 

Any insight would be nice, I've been diagnosed with depression but that's it. I tried killing myself a few years back but I was in a drug fueled spiral at the time and nothing was really great then.

276,"I‘ve experienced something traumatic 3 years ago and I was also told during a school doctors appointment that there’s a possibility of me having PTSD and/or anxiety, but I never dug deeper into it aside of telling my parents about what the doctor said. Anyway I’ve noticed, with my trauma anniversary being around the corner, that it might be the time to reach out to a doctor, but since I‘m only 15 I can’t get an appointment by myself and here comes my question: 
how do I bring up the conversation with my parents?
On a side note: I‘ve already been in therapy 1 1/2 ago but I really don’t want to go there again, how would I respond if my doctor only recommends therapy?",30Nov2020,1
277,"I know this will sound like it's nothing big but I just can't take it anymore. 
I started not doing anything and stopped swimming almost 4 years ago because I just felt like shit and didn't want to do anything. My grades dropped, my family, especially my mom, tried to push me to do everything I used to since I wasn't leaving my room and refused to do anything, my mom took me to a mental health hospital but I just pretended to be ok and refused to stay after checking it out.
The next year I started going to school so I don't worry my mom. I still skipped because I just couldn't make myself go into the school for some reason. 
But everything seemed to start going better last year when I transferred schools and started going to one of my dream schools (specialized sports school) but then soon after starting going there my coach showed his true colors because for some reason he hates me. So every single day he told me how worthless I am and since I was already obviously not ok my mental state just got worse and worse. At the and of the last school year I wanted to leave the school but I knew that I couldn't go anywhere because my grades were not the best. So then this semester started and unfortunately I started having individual morning practice every day because of the age differences in our training group. After a race that didn't go well my coach gave me a 20 minute lecture on how I'm useless and my life has no value and how I'll never achieve anything in life. After this he started just ignoring me for a while but then he just started putting his anger out on me and there wasn't a day when I didn't leave practice and went to my room as fast as I could so people didn't  see me cry and have a breakdown. The coach knew that I was crying even during practice because he once when he was yelling at me he mentioned that I can't do anything and just stand there with tears in my eyes. 
During these last 2 years my mental health has drastically decreased and now I just stay in my room all the time doing absolutely nothing, having no motivation and just wondering what's the point of going on.
I honestly never had any friends but when I transferred I met my best and only friend but I just can't make myself tell her anything about how I feel worthless and a burden to others. Same goes with my family I just can't do it.
Also I am very unsociable and literally can't speak in situations like speeches which is why I now have to burden my teacher because I can't join the zoom classes and am missing a lot of assignments because of this. My heart starts beating really fast and I get extremely nervous when I even have to answer a simple yes/no question and my heart doesn't stop beating fast for like 10-20minutes after that. 
I literally can't tell my family anything because I always try to pretend everything is fine and when I have a problem even if someone is yelling at me my voice just won't come out and if it does and I say something I just instantly feel anxious about what I just said and what they're gonna think. 

I'd feel like a burden to my family, teachers and friend if told them any of this so I'm posting and hoping for some responses even tho I don't know what you could say to any of this.

Sorry for the long story, I tried to make it as short as possible, leaving many things out, but you can get the gist of it from this I hope. Sorry for the troublesome post.",30Nov2020,1

280,"This is my first reddit post ever and i’m a 19 year old who never payed attention to their english teachers growing up so grammar and spelling are out the window. bare with me. this year as a whole hasn’t been forgiving or rewarding at all. almost all of us witnessed losing a job, losing a company, maybe losing a family member or a family pet alongside a global epidemic that has ruined our basic way of living and coexisting with each other. Well, all those things I listed, happened to me. I turned 19 this year thinking that it was going to be one of the best and memorable years of my life, boy was I right but not in a good way at all. but let’s start from the beginning. 
i just graduated high school in 2019 and had a job at a local mexican restaurant which paid OK, but the management and the workplace was a sh@$ show. i knew i was going to work there for long so i had to apply somewhere else quick. i always dreamed of working at a nutrition store like GNC because I had been working out and going to the gym prior for almost 2-3 years. i went there whenever i could scrounge up some lose cash or did some chores in my freshman and sophomore year so i’ve always had a passion for trying new proteins, preworkouts etc. i apply and finally get a job there in mid February. I work there for almost 2-1/2 months and then covid hit. i lost my job, was forced to stay inside, and wasn’t going to school at the time. so... as a usual teenage 19 year old boy, i started smoking some weed pretty often. but something inside of me was just “changing”. i felt like i had a pit in my stomach and i started to question a lot of things and end up worrying myself, i had no idea what was going on. i lost my appetite completely and i would only eat if i smoked. i knew it wasn’t good to rely on a drug in order for me to eat so i told my parents what was going on and what ive been doing and they scheduled a doctors appointment for me. 
the time comes for my appointment and they’re feeling around my stomach to see if they feel any lumps or anything. nothing. they go to the extent of having me do a ultrasound. they found nothing, they actually told me i had a healthy gut. a couple days after my doctors appointment, my jack russell terrier i’ve had for 17 years had a stroke in front me and we had to rush him to our local vet hospital. due to covid, we couldn’t walk inside, we had to check in and get evaluated in order to go in which took forever because other people were there too. so we had to hand our dog, indy, to one of the workers and wait in a line... the time comes where we’re at the front door and one of the doctors comes out and tells us that my dog is in critical condition after the stroke and he advised us that it would be best to put him down so he doesn’t have to suffer. so we did.

my story’s kinda everywhere (my bad) but also last year before i graduated my great uncle slipped and fell where he lived and had to get rushed to the er. they did some blood work on him at the hospital and his whole body was being affected by brain cancer and pancreatic cancer. it was so far developed that we dont know how long he’s had it. he was unconscious before he died and when i saw him it wasn’t like how i saw him literally a month prior. this death in my family was very impactful because my great uncle was looking after my great grandpa and making sure he was taking his medicine on time and such. but since he wasn’t around, my great grandpa forgot to take his medicine and he also fell while taking a shower. he ended up recovering and was in a care home, but every time we visited him he’s forget more and more who me, my dad or my mom were. after some blood work was done he had pretty bad lung cancer and something else, i dont remember. the time came where he was asleep but wasn’t waking up. my and my family ended up seeing him that night along with my grandpa and grandma and there was this almost croaking-like noise coming from my great grandpa. my grandfather asks me, “do you hear that? that’s death’s croak” idk why he told me that but he did and he said he would be passing soon and that we should get home because it was late and my parents had work and i had school. 

while all of that was happening that year, i was trying to maintain a relationship. we were dating for almost that entire year and were actually planning on moving in together eventually. blah blah blah, teenage romance BS. long story short, i really loved this girl and i hope she’s doing well. i wasn’t in a good headspace and wasn’t treating her like i should’ve and she dumped me. 

graduation came, my parents couldn’t make it because work was bush and my other family members couldn’t make it. so i graduated alone for the most part and didn’t go to any parties. it was kind of depressing, i expected a little more out of that night.

but here i am today. i dont feel myself anymore. i stopped talking to my friends that i had because whenever we would go out, it’d end up with is resorting to smoking weed and nothing else. i felt like that wasn’t who i was so i stopped talking to them and playing games with them and started keeping to myself. i stopped talking to a lot of people that i had mutual relationships with out of nowhere. when i would try to think of things, it’d be dark. i thought there was no purpose to life and that im not going anywhere in life. it was bad. but luckily a local gym was open during the lockdown so that helped with the unnecessary stress i put on myself. i still dont talk that much to the friends i had. when i do, i run out of things to talk about and i kind of worry. i just remember LITERALLY a year ago i was having a blast with life and could keep a conversation going but now i can barely start one let alone keep one going. idk why im writing this, it’s probably not going to get noticed but. i dont talk to a whole lot of people that much anymore and idk what’s going on with me. but if somebody can help or just give me advice, i’d love to hear it.",30Nov2020,1
281,"Hey guys, recently I was switched from my antidepressant to Latuda because after spending time in the hospital they told me I was misdiagnosed by my family doctor and that I was in fact bipolar. I struggled to believe this because nobody in my family besides my great grandma had this but I do have a lot of the signs of bipolar. The latuda at first really helped me and I just felt numb to all emotion and just super tired. Now that I’m back home and have been on it for almost two weeks I seem to be feeling how i did before, is this because it has no effect on me anymore? 

also some insight to what I struggle with is constant mood changes, going from super low lows to highs. The sadness Could span for months and then I randomly feel good one day, but it’s more so mood change within the same day. I can wake up in a really good mood then an hour later I can feel like I have nothing to live for and feel defeated completely. I have hard to keeping positive relationships with multiple people, I usually have one good friend and go to them with “some” problems but I feel like a burden and feel super guilty for how I’m feeling half the time. I feel like everyone is annoyed with me for the smallest things even if they aren’t telling me that, I just perceive it that way. That then leads to people thinking I’m being dramatic all the time, which then makes me angry or puts me into a depressive state.

Sorry if that was a bunch of rambling, i suck at putting how I feel or what I go through into words lol. Any insight or advice is appreciated!

285,"If I (15f), for example, lose at a board game or come last in Mario kart I'll get really upset and angry, have to try not to cry, yell or start having a go at whoever I was playing with. I know this is a silly reaction and a stupid thing to get mad over but my problem is that I'll feel the same if that happened as, say, I failed a big exam.
All of these situations feel the same emotionally to me.
Some other examples of situations where I have this emotional reaction:
I make a joke and no one laughs
A teacher vaguely implies that they're disappointed in me
Changing a duvet cover
Not understanding something
Losing at a sport in PE
You get the idea

 I'm really competitive as well so that adds into it

So is this normal? If not, what's wrong with me? What can I do to change it?
I hate this aspect of my personality because it makes me feel so stupid and immature for getting mad like a little kid over something j know is silly (not to mention that it causes my family to make fun of me for reacting that way)

286,I want my concealed carry but am afraid I’ll be turned down at the sheriffs office for my involuntary stay at a hospital for my mental health.

I am almost done with the exam which has taken 8 hours of reading today. This week I’ll do the 2 hour range time. After I’m certified I have to take my certification to the sheriffs office to have a background check done before I’m provided with my license for concealment. Will that show up on my record?

289,"Just wondering if anyone could offer some advice on how to help out my dear friend and housemate (22f) who is having a really hard time. 

She's been getting worse over the past year and is crying every day. She struggles with lots of intrusive thoughts and says she thinks she is a horrible person. She denies herself things like food and drink when she's in a bad way because she doesn't think she deserves it. I love her so much and I really, really want to help her get better but I don't really know what our options are.

We are in the UK so she should be able to get free counselling on the NHS, but the waiting list where we live is 18 months long. She says she'd be reluctant to take medication as she's been on it before and felt it didn't help, and the same goes with the counselling offered by our university (we are students). Neither of us can afford private therapy at the moment (again, students), which I feel guilty about as I found it to be the most useful form of help I've ever had, but can't give to her.

I want to be able to talk through her options with her but I just feel like there's not many options available. Can anyone shed some light onto what else I could suggest? I try to help by doing things like cooking/spending time/working together and talking about it, but I feel like she really needs some medical help too.

TLDR: Looking for advice on medical help for my depressed(?) friend, when we cannot afford therapy &amp; she is reluctant to take medication.

This depression started years ago, and its only gotten worse. Being alone all day, sulking, and laying in bed unable to sleep or get up doesn't make it any better. Every day, I'm expected to get my work done by the time my dad is home from work, which of course for me, is now near impossible. My father did tell me that he 'wouldn't be hard on me' for work, because he sees I'm not well, and sure he got me to see a counselor. Though it just isn't enough. He's almost ignoring the fact that I need help, more professional help. I need to see my doctor by now. Sure now is probably a horrible time, but isn't every time a horrible time? I can't wait any longer. Constantly holding back tears is becoming increasingly harder, and getting glared at and lectured by him for not doing my work isn't doing anything at all. He can put as many programs, limits, apps, or whatever the hell he wants on my electronics as he wants, It will not change the fact I can not go a minute without thinking about the past or how much I want to kill myself or others. 

I have told him my issues, what I think, how I feel, and yet I only get an ""I'm sorry you feel that way"". You are my only guardian. You aren't just my father, you are my mother too. Yet that's all you have to say? You don't help me, you don't hug me, you don't tell me everything is going to be okay, you just sit there and stare at me in complete silence like I'm an idiot.

When this began a few years ago my  conscience felt so bad that I stopped socializing with people and locked myself in the school bathrooms during breaks to avoid these thoughts. It kept on getting worse  with me starting to block out emotions and developing social anexiety when in larger groups of people(however I had no problem with being on stages and acting as I then could take on the persona of the character I would act as). A few months thereafter by doing this I succeded in blocking out the thoughts and was able to socialize somewhat by taking on the persona of my former self(as I had blocked out ""myself"" I in a way pretended to be the same way as I were before). However Through some lucky encounters I aquired a few really good friends and this led to me in time completely being able to completely return to actually being myself. But with me getting this part of me back and being able to become so much more happy, also came the bad thoughts again. It feels like there is this voice constantly whispering bad things about the people I care about. For an example, I recently met this cute girl which I really would like to ask out, but the moment I decided on this my brain starts to point out everything wrong.

 I've asked her to treat me the way I treat her and tried to explain why you don't talk to people let alone your family or sister that way and it just doesn't go through. 

And always goes back to her saying that I don't love her enough, that I'm an idiot, that I'm selfish for leaving our city to make a life elsewhere, if I'm living in a fantasy world, that I don't understand her, that I'm fake that I'm a witch that she's going to curse me with black magic.

My husband has commented that it affects my moods, and that he can tell when I'm speaking to her by how I get. I have noticed a stomach pain when I speak with her that I'm guessing is stress and if it has gotten to the point where my relationship with her is hurting me physically I'm just bot sure how to handle this kind of abuse. Sibling abuse I guess I could call it? 

We are trying to start our family soon and I just don't want ly future family to be mixed up with all of this... Idk I'm just out of ideas of how to have a healthy relationship with her.

Aby advice would be greatly appreciated.",30Nov2020,1

302,"Recently I’ve broken up, the quarantine hit again and we suppose to stay at home. I have a cat she soothes me a little bit but Its so difficult almost with no human contact... i have no job, i try to freelance with sound engineering but its difficult to get gigs.. I try to make music in the  time I have but constantly feel demotivated or uninspired and I just make nothing that satisfies me.. i want to make it in music industry but it is so hard now when I have a lot of time but completely no inspiration and so unsatisfied with my work... most of my friends are at home with their partners and dont communicate too much with me so I dont have almost no one to speak with normally. How do people deal with this much of emotions ? And the worst part that after my breakup, my ex like in few days slept with one of my good friends and she lied when we broke up where she was going to stay(said at her cousin) but guess who picked her up, that shattered me",30Nov2020,1
303,"I’m sure this is pretty common, but it’s really the first time I’m experiencing something like this. This is gonna be a little bit long, bear with me I’m sorry.

Throughout my college days I’ve always been very outgoing, always having a good time. I loved the people around me, and I felt really connected. Unfortunately I wasn’t satisfied with my university’s program for my major so I made a drastic change by transferring. Unfortunately, the transfer has occurred in the midst of this pandemic. The last half of my last semester at my old college was online, and this whole year at my new college is also online. I got my own place, because the family home was getting crowded. I’m still nearby in the same town, just in my own apartment.

During my final semester, I started having bad panic attacks and anxiety. My brother smoked weed at the time and my mom told me to come and smoke some with him to calm down. It seemed to work for a while until this summer, where I had a really bad experience. I got high, my heart started racing and I had a massive panic attack. That was the last time I smoked or drank anything. My anxiety continued to worsen and I had to get an inhaler. I became extremely worried about every little thing I was experiencing. Chest pain, headaches, any hard time breathing, I couldn’t help but panic about it. I made several trips to the doctor. I was put on Lexapro, Trazodone, Buspirone, and Hydroxyzine all at different times and all had horrible side effects on me. I was taken off of all medication around October.

back in July I had a long-standing, great paying job, and as a result signed a 6-month lease to this apartment that I could afford with that job. Due to COVID-19, the company restructured and I had my pay significantly reduced and I could barely keep up with work AND school. I divided my time up and sent it out to everyone else but myself. I ended up picking up two additional part-time jobs to try to make ends meet even though I realistically could have ridden out my lease on my savings. I decided to call it quits on that long-standing job to save me about 24 hours a week. I hated the job anyways.

I should also mention that 14+ hours of my time per day has been spent looking at some sort of screen for about the past 3-4 months. I have also been alone most of the time, spending most of my days with no actual face-to-face contact with anyone. I think this might be playing a huge role as well. My friends are online, my work is online, and my school is online. This has resulted in a sedentary lifestyle with basically no exercise. I often forget to eat until after 3-4pm or so and really don’t have a consistent appetite. I always need to drink more water than I do. Now to describe the troubling symptoms...

I’ve found what I’d describe as a disgusting pattern over the thanksgiving break. I find comfort in screens and discomfort in reality. I look at a screen and I feel bad about what feels like a ton of time being wasted. Doing any sort of work right now feels mentally straining. My mind starts to get tingly and feels extremely stretched doing very basic schoolwork, even. Just sitting through lectures gives me this weird brain tingle in the front of my head. I often press on my forehead when I feel it to try and alleviate it. But the screen is still more comfortable. If I look at a screen for a long enough period then look around, it’s almost as if I don’t exactly recognize my own room. Not necessarily, but I don’t seem to recognize my own existence. I’m completely isolated, so the only effect I have on others is online. Online doesn’t feel real. I do go and visit my family sometimes and I do have a psychologist I talk to but he’s overbooked. 

When I look around, I get uncomfortable. Today I went to the store. I felt almost dizzy, discomforted by the feeling of surrealism just by entering the store. I don’t know how to describe this feeling at all, I just felt like I wasn’t at all connected to what I was seeing. I was just there with the objective of finding one thing. But this happens everywhere I go, and it’s begun to close in on my own apartment. I can’t look around much without feeling very uncomfortable. It’s like a constant fight-or-flight experience where I just have to connect back with the real world to complete essential tasks before going back to the screen. 

I’m mentally exhausted. Most people tell me it’s normal and everyone is experiencing it. Ok, but why? This isn’t normal at all! It’s horrible! I’m very aware of it but I can’t seem to escape it. It feels like a prison. I feel like a shell of who I once was, only a fraction of my old potential. I don’t know what to do. I just want to reverse this. My family knows, and they don’t know what to do other than refer me to a psychologist. The psychologist says it’s normal. This isn’t normal. I can’t keep living like this, I want to improve. Is there anyone who understands me?",30Nov2020,1
304,"I have always dealt with mental health issues but my living situation is making everything so much worse. I was happy as a child even though my father never cared about me and disappeared from the face of the earth when I was 14, never even found out what happened to him. I lived with my grandparents who were very loving towards me and my mother, I had everything I needed to be happy. 

I think things started to get really bad when I was raped at 13, in that moment something changed and I was never the same person again. Then, when I was 16, I started dealing with anxiety and a year later my grandfather suddenly died of a stroke. After that the panic attacks were a daily thing and to top it all my grandmother developed dementia two years later. My mom and I took care of her until she died in 2014. Ever since then it's just me and my mom.

 In 2010, after months of suffering with severe urinary symptoms, I was diagnosed with a chronic bladder disease that basically ruined my life. I can't sleep, I can't go anywhere, I can't work, I can't even enjoy food or a drink because I have to be on a strict diet to not cause any flare ups. I basically starve myself... I tried to kill myself in march because I was in so much physical pain, I hadn't slept for almost 6 days. 

A few weeks after I got home from the hospital after my suicide attempt my mom got covid and she almost died. She suffers from hypertension and had a heart attack in 2012, this means she's in the risk group. We don't have close family or friends so for 17 days I was locked in a small apartment watching my mother throw up and pass out. I was so scared and I had no one to talk to, not a single soul. Now, my mom, who's the only person I have, is showing signs of dementia. I can't imagine living without her, she's my only friend, the only person that cares about me. I have no one else, no friends, no family.

 I also have no way to support myself because of my disease, I quit school in 8th grade because I was bullied both physically and psychologically for years and I couldn't take it anymore. I promised my mother I would go back to school the following year but then my grandfather died. I was dealing with multiple daily panic attacks for months and a few months later I got diagnosed with this bladder condition. I could never go back to school or get a job. Now I don't know what will happen to me, I will lose my best friend and I will be homeless. The cherry on top: I have Covid right now and I'm having to self isolate from my mother. I was doing okay but seem to be getting worse. I have been closed in this tiny bedroom for days and I miss her. I just want to end it all.

I don't know why I created this post. I guess I just needed to vent, I feel so alone and lost.",30Nov2020,1

306,"Firstly I just have to add a big trigger warning, even to me someone who is hardly hardly triggered this triggered me immensely so just note that readers discretion is advised, same for viewers discretion for the videos I will be linking below. 

Triggering topics include: derealization; depersonalization; disassociation; dementia, Alzheimer's; the losing of one's self;  loud noises and crackles; unsettling white noise; general unsettling topics, noises and sceneries. If you are not in a right state of mind currently I do not recommend topic. 

Secondly I have to credit the incredibly talented artist that goes under the name ""the caretaker"" with his incredible album ""everywhere at the end of time"", here is the complete album: [https://youtu.be/wJWksPWDKOc](https://youtu.be/wJWksPWDKOc) . 

Thirdly, I have posted this to multiple subreddits with only the title changed because I'd generally love to see different people's opinions on this, show this incredible piece of art to more people, spread awareness about dementia, derealization, dissociation and depersonalization and generally share my point of view to start a discussion of this incredibly interesting yet morbid topic, and also share my experience with how I felt and a direct description of my derealization and dissociation episode that I got during around minute 18 in this video: [https://youtu.be/l\_x08kbj-Fk](https://youtu.be/l_x08kbj-Fk) ,which is a detailed description of the 6 hour album. Further in my post I will mostly be referencing this video as well the album itself, but here are some other links to videos that I also find interesting about this topic that were also talked about in video linked and talked above in the video ill mostly be referencing, as well as some others I've found interesting while in this rabbit hole, to which again I say trigger warning:

**Now to talk about the album and the subject matter itself**. To note: I'm not in any way shape or form trying to belittle dementia by comparing it to derealazing, but it's the only thing I have actually experienced under the umbrella of losing one's self and that is why I'm hugely referencing it. The music itself, even if I didn't get to the end of the 6 hour masterpiece is an incredibly beautiful piece of artwork really. It felt like it hit so close to home even if what they were portraying was a long life struggle the 20 minute format the video was in was the best representation in words I've ever seen describing someone lose themselves. Maybe because it was so short it hit so close since my episodes usually never last more then a few hours, even if its supposed to portray a disease that eats slowly at someone on the matter of years. Even if dementia is memory related, and I might have dug to deep here, I feel like the loss of that ones memories is directly correlated to the loss of ones self, what makes them them, the them loses itself and I believe that's why it felt to me at least like a walk I've done 100 times but this time the road was twisted to a destination that I couldn't remember, but of which I knew.

I am sorry for not being able to add more to the subject, but I greatly feel that saying more about the piece would mean much much less the intended. That is why I really recommend the video to be watched and maybe even the album been listened to in it entirety, because its worth it, it leaves you speechless the good kind of speechless and its an experience that's worth living.

**My own experience with listening to the 20 minute video about the album:** 

I usually listen to documentaries in the shower, the burning water hitting my skin caresses with soft spoken voices of things that otherworldly, world or so much resembling one that it switches to the other. Never had I felt the need to stop a video unless I didn't understand a sentence, but this time I needed to stop it because it felt like life flashing in front of my eyes while I was seeing dark, when all it was were my hands flickering into a void cause they felt the need to be held, while I was carelessly watching not nurturing like id usually do. The moment I stopped the video that moment my tears from the words heard before had stopped. That moment the panic settled in. That moment my hands went sporadically to scratch myself, as the me that's me when I'm not here was trying to itch the outside layer of myself off from my inner self to protect it, like a dog at an owners gravestone after the panic of loss had settled, they feeling of a knife at their neck while sobbing numbly. While the harsh finger nails were digging deep into my back and although what I was actually watching with my very eyes was a blurry representation of what was in front of me, I felt as if I was in my head or as if my brain was making me choose to also me in the back of my head. Watch myself from a 3rd person perspective in my head on a chair in a large room as large as many men greater then me  had been driven mad at the thought of its size before. I was watching a horrid yet unusually calm video being played on a wall with a projector. The mini film playing was of me in the position my body had been seemingly stuck in for the time being as a young woman on a wooden stool, that made the decision to turn herself into stone, at the end resembling a Greek statue, in fear that the rodents at her feet would eat her up. The shots of the movie playing go as follows, the woman on the stool, the rodents come to her feet, she makes no change in expression. Following shots are zoomed in on each part of her body from the feet to the head. You can feel her fear as soon as you'd think the human eating mice would touch her flesh, then her feet turn into stone, what follows is a chase, a chase inside her mind, a chase of her being turned into stone while the rodents go up her petrified self, she makes no change in facial expression, but i feel her experiencing a courageous breakthrough as before her right hand is turned into sculpted marble she waves it in the air, leading to her final stone shape as an angel reaching for heaven. The movie playing then goes back to a full shot of the woman. The rodents that were on her frail body before disappear as fast as they came. They didn't puff in thin air, they didn't care what happened next their goal was defeated. With a glitch of the movie tape being played the switch from one frame to the other leads to their disappearance. The movie felt like was in slow motion, but my mind was making me watch myself watch it in a speed up manner so much that it seemed so distorted.

I am rarely able to state what happens in a derealization/disassociation mind set but this time it cut off right before amnesia kicked in. It cut off in a way making me feel complete, like if one second less or more had happened it would have all been shattered. It left me feeling complete, as if I had finally understood that I am what reality makes of myself, that is if reality even is, which I have not making that feeling even more strange yet familiar at the same time.

This YouTube rabbit hole has to have been the best one I've ever fallen in. I am deeply sorry for my lack of better words in which I didn't add much to the original, other then my experience and that is simply because during my listening of it I felt as it spoke for me. 

Thank you for listening to my rant about this topic, its highly appreciated if you did get to the end, but now i have to ask you, how did it make you feel?

308,"Had to make a throwaway acc for this, incase someone i know might see this. 

I am a 17 year old male. I think this all started around 1 1/2 years ago. 

Sometimes i feel really good and well. I like my life and everything seems fine. But then, i suddenly start to feel down, even to the point which makes me feel like self harming, and even gives me suicidal thoughts. This doesnt result from any situation, i might be having a good time, and suddenly feel like absolute shit. This makes being in a relationship hard. Not only i get super down, i become angry and aggressive. Cant control it.

This issue has definetly gotten worse after i moved on my own. I've been feeling really down for the past few months. Nothing special has happened that would cause this. I might feel really good for a couple days, but always end up like this.

Tried to talk to a friend about this. She seems to not care, though she said she feels bad for me. After that ""conversation"" i havent talked to her, she doesnt seem to want to talk to me anymore.

I have been in a relationship for almost 2 years, but i am terrified of telling my girlfriend about how im feeling. Dont want her to freak out.

Its gotten to the point that i cannot sleep well and eat well. Though i usually only get around 4 hours of sleep, i never seem to be able to sleep at night. More sleep doesnt help either, it makes me feel even worse for some reason. I havent had interest to cook any food, and i havent really been eating too well. 2 or 3 meals a day, and the amounts are small for my age/size. Yet i do not feel like eating at all.",30Nov2020,1
