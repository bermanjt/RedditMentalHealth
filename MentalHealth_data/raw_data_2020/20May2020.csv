I end up staying up way too late and feeling even worse not being able to give people adequate advice. The only reason im posting is because its related to this sub and its affecting me.

2,"!!SEXUAL ASSAULT TRIGGER WARNING!!

Long story..

In high school I had this friend who had a crush on me, he used to creep me out but as he was mates with everyone I hung out with I just put up with it. In the early years of high school he used to bully me a bit I was a goofy 11 year old with wonky teeth, non straightened hair and obv no makeup. Soon as I started to wear makeup and bother about my appearance around 13 he added me on an instant messenger (msn) and kept hinting at beautiful and great I looked today. It went on for ages he would put love hearts on his name with my name on it. I wasnt interested what so ever I mean yeah this bit is innocent cos we was kids. I used to shower and see 50 missed calls off on my mobile off his home phone. I used to have to appear offline as he used send me hundreds of messages even if I didn't reply. I was always kind to him and let him know I wasnt interested nicely. After about a month of this he finally got a girlfriend she was one of my friends.. I was so happy for them but also happy he was off my back. (They are actually still together now) well fast forward to 2007 I was out at our local park drinking with my friends being stupid care free teenagers. And he came up to me and told me that him and my friend had broken up. Next thing I know he stuck his tongue down my throat and I laughed it off and tried get away. I sat on a bench with my friends baring in mind I was drunk as hell (stupid I know) next thing I remember is him putting his arm firmly around my neck and saying please come talk to me up here, I've always been a people pleaser and felt sorry for him considering he just broken up with his gf (and I was drunk). He then took me into a forest I can't remember what exactly happened but I know I said no but I was too drunk to care or give consent. He lay me on the floor had sex with me shoved my head down there and did things to me... I cant remember if he finished or what happened all I can remember after is stumbling off home with no underwear on. I felt weird when I woke up the next day I had never been interested in this boy at all he used creep me out and surely if I wanted him I would of done it before. I wasnt the kind of person to sleep with someone like that randomly especially as I was only 14. I just felt sick and when I saw him in school it just made me feel so anxious and nervous. I never told anyone as I didnt want to be the person who split up our group. I didnt want him to get into trouble?! He told his best friend and bragged about sleeping with me but I just denied it as I was so ashamed. I really didnt want to. I've always put myself down repeatedly thinking I'm a horrible slut over this and its something that's affected me for YEARS. I see him now dropping my kids off at school and I get that same feeling. Was this rape? I have had very bad depression/ocd/anxiety and this is one thing that keeps me awake at night still. I find myself constantly questioning if it was assault or not as I didnt run or shout or noone would believe me because I seemed to act as normal as I could to him for the rest of my high school life. I've always thought that we was just kids and he didnt know what consent was?? Please help me. I just want to sleep.",20May2020,1
3,"I’m finally going to be seeing someone for my mental health, but it’s scaring me since my mom is so controlling. I went to a counselor last year in school, but she ended up telling my parents about my whole fucking life + everything I had told her. Then I went inpatient for an ED. When I went outpatient I was “assigned” a contact person (I don’t really know), and he also ended up telling my parents everything about me. I don’t know who I can trust anymore, my mom is so fucking controlling.",20May2020,1
4,"I don't know if I can find the words to describe how hellish what I'm going through is, but I will try.
So I've always been kind of shy, and socially anxious. In school I usually had a few close friends, and that's it. About 2 years ago, I noticed that I started feeling self aware around my friends, which didn't happen before. This started to get worse and worse, to the point where when I was around my friends I constantly felt self aware and didn't know what to talk about. I also started feeling very empty and depressed, which resulted in a suicide attempt a year ago. Now, another year later, the situation has worsened even more. Now, even around my family I feel strange, every second of the day I feel self aware. My family feels like strangers, like I have no connection to them at all. I can't have a conversation anymore, my memory is terrible, and I've lost all my friends. The feeling of loneliness is indescribable, i feel like i haven't talked to another human in years. I honestly wish I had succeeded in my attempt, because this is not living, this is pure hell, infinitely worse than any depression I've had. I've given myself till the end of 2020, if its not any better I'm ending the misery.",20May2020,1
5,"So i spent a lot of time this quarantine reading post on here and ammm i felt like this can be a place to tell a part of my life story. So here goes nothing...


So i live in west europe and was born in a pretty big family (lots of aunts,uncles and cousins yeey) with high expectations and weird traditions ( but that are other stories for another time). 

Unlike everyone else in my family i was an only child and grew up surrounded more by adults rather than children. So i was mature at a young age and socialised easier with older people( but since i was a child nobody kinda listened to me).

Growing up i was considered super weird as i was different from the way a girl “should be“( you know playing with dolls and doing other stuff like that) but this stereotypes are the only way people think in my hometown.

I was always passionate about magic, mythology  and history and was considered not normal but my childhood friends. Also i was fat since I couldn’t exercise due to a leg and back problem and my love for food.

So trough out school i was bullied not only by my classmates but by teachers, especially my geography and history teacher ( that  told me i’m weird and miserable which idk in English exactly what it means but in my language means something that has a miserable soul and life)

But the worst was my “bff” who constantly reminded me that I’m ugly, fat, stupid, a mistake and a totally miserable person. After some time I started believing her and even was thankful that despite all my issues she was still my friend. Soon she told me that if she wanted her to be my friend i had to lose weight .

So I started to force myself to puke or i would refuse to eat which didn’t help me lose weight only made me weaker and sicker. 

During this time my mother was on a course abroad and dad worked a lot. The person who took care of me were my grandparents , especially my grandfather who taught me to write poetry, paint the world and forgive the people ( he would call them the three arts of life) .

So after having enough i told my friend I couldn’t lose weight. She then told me i had to move ( as i was her desk colleague) , started to spread rumours about me being a satanic person that those magical rituals and other stuff ( and they believed her bc apparently liking Harry Potter makes you part of a satanic cult). And the worst thing was she dated my crush. ( i mean not the worst but hurt the most).

So this resulted into an alone me bullied by everyone for having own ideas and standing out. So i entered a bad state of depression (which i’m still fighting but i’m much better). So i got some suicide  ideas even  tried it twice but failed and was caught by my grandparents. So they told my parents and they started worrying and had me checked my a psychologist. 

They asked me why i wanted to kill myself and i told them because the dreams said so. I always had dreams where i die or the people who i loved died and to escape my dream i had to die. Sooo basically I taught my life’s a nightmare maybe if kill myself i’ll wake back to the real world.

So with help from some people i got better and the got really bad again. All i can say is stress + fake friendships + falling in love= bad stuff. So i had what my grandmother called a death crisis where i tried to kill myself on my birthday ( that was my last try) and failed obviously. 

Let’s fast forward a few months into a nice night on February when my bed caught on fire because of an old electric pillow and nobody but me in the whole house realised there is smoke around ( we have very high quality fire alarms systems) but luckily I survived without any physical damage. 

Of course I remained with a little trauma and some phobias and nightmares but the experience woke me up.

I went in my room and looked at my bookshelf and said i almost died and i haven’t read all the books on my shelf or I haven’t visited the whole world. And that made me go in a better place. And from then each they i gave myself a reason to live from small things like learn french to major thing like full-fill your dream and become an anthropologist/ part time writer.

Soon my parents signed me up for a extracurricular activity centre. And they became my second family. They shared my passions and supported me. Soon i made a small group of friend ( not much just a couple kids my age) and they told me i can be whoever i want to be. 

So i swallowed the fear and started being myself. I died my hair crazy colours because i felt like it. I sang on the streets like i was in a musical. I spoke my mind. I finally commented on a post. I publishes some of my story in the school newspaper. 

Of course it was a long time till i gained confidence ( and i’m still working on it) to so so but they helped me trough it. My parents sat with me or slept with me even as a teenager in case of panic attacks or nightmares. All my friends were there when I needed them like the moment my grandpa passed away or the moment i came our as bi. And now i am one year away to entering university and full-filling my dream and  everyday it’s another day that i know
I survived.

What i want to say it’s that nothing is permanent, not even pain. And no matter what gender or race or sexuality or type of person you are, you matter to somebody even if you don’t feel like it now. And yes there are going to be some clouded and rainy days in the future maybe even some storms but the sun always shines trough.

It will get better and until it will give yourself a reason even if it’s watch the Percy jackson disney adaptation or learning to count to 10 in a new language. No matter what you’ll be fine and you’ll get trough everything, we’ll get trough it.

Thank you to anyone who read my life story :) !",20May2020,1

9,"I've spent so many nights trying to find any results on Google as to what I'm experiencing and come up with nothing, so I guess the only way forward would be to come to somewhere like here and ask instead. 

Earlier today, I had a friend mention in a group chat about his girlfriend and he really went for it; ""she's beautiful"", the whole 'love of my life' speech, the works.

Other people in there were saying how it was all so sweet and that they were happy for them on their behalf but I couldn't help but feel my stomach churn as I read through the blocks of text.

I felt disgust towards it, going even so far as to feel physically ill, like I was going to vomit and the worst part is that I've felt this feeling so many times before; hell even just describing it now I feel myself getting a weird taste in my mouth like I'm getting ready to lose the contents of my stomach.

Whenever someone expresses a legitimate, positive emotion, particularly if it's one that goes beyond the realm of just a material possession, I feel a strange combination of anger and disgust towards it and I don't know why.

It all makes me feel so disconnected from everyone else and that I'm almost responsible for my own feelings of social isolation because I can't have the right reaction.

I can't find any results for the description via the internet and I don't know what it is so I'm really hoping I can get some answers; I didn't really want to come to Reddit because I thought it might not really help all that much but I've really exhausted everything else at my disposal.",20May2020,1

I will get so overwhelmed with life, feel trapped or just plain overcome with so many emotions, and then get brain fog to the point where I can’t comprehend things I read or what people are saying to me. Usually I find that and other dumb things (like today, my boyfriend taking an eyelash out of his eye) hysterical and I’ll laugh until tears are streaming down my face and I’m on the ground just trying not to pass out. In my mind they’re not funny whatsoever but I can’t control the laughter! I’m constantly fighting off actual crying towards the end of laughing when I’m hyperventilating. The brain fog between laughing fits will hit hard, like today when I was literally paralyzed when my bf asked if I was okay.

13,"I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and PTSD, and with the help of medication I’ve completely turned my life around. I used to get off of work from a job I hated and just cry in bed in my uniform until I passed out and it was time for me to go back. I would stay up all night worried that COMPLETELY illogical things were going to happen to me (trees falling onto my house when I slept, worrying about being in a car accident everytime I had to leave my house, worrying that everyone I know secretly hates me) I finally went to a doctor and tried a few medications, found the ones that worked and I’ve been on a great track.

I left a toxic relationship and moved on into the greatest one I’ve ever had, I found a new job that I enjoy, I bought my own car, I’ve signed for my own apartment, and I just found out today that I got into the school I want to get into. 

Everytime something good happens to me, I just feel like I have farther to fall. I’m so terrified that something awful is just around the corner and everything I’ve worked for is going to be temporary and end in a nightmare.

In the middle of the fight he said his psychiatrist said that my sis and I were just being evil by doing this to him and ""abandoning"" him. Which is not really true but I'll spare you the details, too much of a backstory.

Is it normal that a psychiatrist would tell something so one-sided and aggressive to someone seeking mental help from them?
How does this even help solve our problems?

21,"Hi all, so I'm thinking this is a fairly common issue with those of us who struggle with our mental health. 

A little background: I've struggled with depression for several years now, but a few months ago it's become severe enough to prevent me from working. I'm trying my best, but this horrible illness keeps dragging me down at every turn. I'm going to counseling, taking meds, seeing a psychiatrist, taking supplements, and so on. As it is though, I can barely function through the day.

About two or three weeks ago, my moods started to really go downhill. I got even worse than my baseline terrible mood, and my wife noticed it. Not a whole lot of support from her, although she did ask what was wrong. It got bad enough that I had to go to the hospital last week. I couldn't function, and couldn't stop crying. 

I was discharged with a referral to an intensive program, and and urgent appointment with my psychiatrist. I thought this was a positive thing, because nothing else was working up to that point. 

Since then, my wife has been noticeably more irritated with me, and we get snippy with each other quite often. Today she blew up at me because I asked her to lose the attitude (over something really minor). She said she was completely drained from dealing with me, and that I've sucked the life out of her. She also accused me of not doing anything to improve myself since I was unable to work. I was also blamed for a few other things too. 

So, I guess what I'm saying is: how do you make someone understand how difficult it is to live with this condition? How can you make them know that I'm not being lazy or difficult? How do I get someone to see that I'm in pain?",20May2020,1

24,"Hello,
Man what a time to be lonely

As the virus has continued I find myself getting sadder and sadder. I have felt lonely for some years now, but it usually gets distracted when I am at school. 

I am young so I know there is a lot of life still to come, but I haven’t felt happy in some time. I haven’t had a girlfriend in two years, the more I achieve the worse I feel about myself, and sometimes I get stressed about my future. 

Two years ago I left a long relationship to pursue hook up culture. As an person who hasn’t had many relationships, the idea was thrilling. To my disappointing surprise, hook up culture is not very common. I tried going on dates and starting relationships. I met a girl that I had very strong feelings for. Not to be a simp, but she was truly angelic. A very compassionate person who was genuine and down to earth and just drop dead beautiful. But, she did not want a relationship. I was crushed. I felt so bad for such a long time and eventually got over it. Even so, I was getting rejected left and right and since have been rejected at least 10 times.

Another thing that makes me really sad is how my accomplishments don’t make up for my loneliness. I am very skilled at music and recently got accepted into Stanford. While I am very excited to go there, I still find myself very empty and sad. It seems the more I do the worse I feel. I think about how someone like myself that has all these things shouldn’t be sad, but it only makes it worse. I try talking to my mother about how I am sad but anytime I get moody or down I just get told I am ungrateful. 

Everyone I’ve talked to about my feelings tells me i am young and there is a lot left for me in the future. But sometimes I really don’t think so. I want to be my best self and I want to achieve great things. But I feel that it is impossible to feel truly satisfied with myself without feeling shitty about myself. I feel that I have missed out on a lot in high school. Being a kid who is smart and likes music, there are not a lot of opportunities to party and mingle. I have a few great friends but most go to a different school. 

What finally made me crack tonight was being told I cannot go to a party (and the only party I’ve ever been invited to) because of COVID while all my best friends and people I envy are enjoying themselves tonight. I have to watch what could’ve been all night on Snapchat. 

If anyone has read all of this, I truly appreciate you. I guess all I am asking is some advice on how to deal with all my emotions and my loneliness. Sometimes I can handle myself but nights like these really make me think bad thoughts.",20May2020,1

27,"Last night after watching a movie and drinking, me and my brother got into an argument. I wasnt very drunk at this point in the night, but definitely still tipsy. It ended with me running out the backdoor and taking off. Ran about a half mile and sat  on a hill next to a road for like a half hour. I was barefoot and didnt have my phone or wallet or a jacket. 

I ended up standing on the sidewalk of a small  bridge holding a  6 foot mirror and aiming it at cars..

I think about it now and it sounds crazy. 

I end up throwing the mirror off the bridge and walking home feeling strange and bad. Like a full blown panic attack but like PURE 100% fight or flight mode. So i spend the walk home trying to calm down because at this point I realize I'm having a panic attack or a psychotic episode or something,

I get home and sit in the bathroom trying to calm down for like an hour. Eventually I decide to go to bed and go to get a glass of water. My brother comes downstairs and says something to me and I ignore him and he essentially called me a drunk idiot or something then he goes upstairs, So I throw the glass straight into the sink and shatter it.

I sit down for a second bleeding all over the place and started writing notes. I dont know what I was writing but I kept crumpling them up and throwing them away. then I just wrote fuck you on a piece of paper and went upstairs into my brothers room and handed it to him and slammed his door and went downstairs, 

Then I sit in the kitchen still bleeding really bad from my finger and I finally fully break down and start bawling my eyes out. i sent texts to them and my brother essentially having a breakdown. I slowly calmed down and went to the ER to get stitches and go home at like 5am then slept for 12 hours.

The full context here is that my brother is a manipulative, racist, misogynist narcissist that has told me on multiple occasions that he  does not feel empathy, hates women and thinks their inferior to men, and that blacks and asians and hispanics are sub human.

I was kind of getting close to him recently by just biting my tongue and nodding along to whatever shit he was spewing. But now I am seriously scared of him and can't even look at him. 

Earlier tonight he asked if I was still down to go on a trip with him and his friend and I didnt answer right away because I was dissociated staring at the wall he yelled my name and said I was acting like someone with autism. 

I told my parents that he is destroying me and my sisters mental health but they didnt really hear me. They dont know about the mirror and all that but they do know I cut myself and was acting crazy. 

I used to not live at home with them and i moved out a few months ago, I moved out of my parents house within 3 months of my brother moving back in bc I was losing my mind. I was alright on my living on my own, only had a few minor panic attacks here and there due to accepting a promotion at work that moved me across the country and didnt train me.

33,"Hi guys, I’m a 14 year old male. Recently I’ve just been really sad, after my breakup, and like I have no motivation for anything. I have so much school work to catch up on, and whenever I try to do some, I just zone out and don’t really care. Like I honestly don’t really care about my responsibilities anymore, and I’m starting to question why I even exist because there’s nothing special about me. All this time alone to myself has made me realize how the world literally doesn’t need me at all. And I feel like a waste of time, food, resources, when it can be going to someone more deserving. I feel like giving up, and the only thing that I really care about anymore are my friends and family. I  used to workout and eat healthy, but like now I could care less, and barely even get off of my bed anymore. I honestly would kill myself if it wouldn’t cause my friends and family so much pain. But I honestly don’t see why I still live when there’s nothing to me, and I’m a bad student. I just feel like an empty shell, because my I loved my boyfriend so much, and I felt like I found my purpose with him. Now that he’s gone I honestly don’t know what to do, and no one will ever love someone as stupid, bad student, insecure, and awkward person like me anymore. I feel like such an asshole too, because my parents always get mad at me for not doing my work, and I seriously try, but I honestly have no motivation at all.

34,"Hi folks,

I'll cut to the chase. Any copying tips appreciated.

Had an abdominal surgery 7 months ago.

It's been difficult since. Gastritis. Motility issues. The whole shebang.

I tried to continue drinking socially for a few months. My doc even said a glass of wine or two once a week would be fine. But I found that even that would make the gastritis and nausea come back (just for a few yours). So I realized that I needed to do everything in my power if I was going to feel better - and that even small indulgences were too much.

Since then I've really basically eliminated alcohol. I think I've had maybe half a glass of wine in the last month. And that was to make a toast for a special occasion.

The problem is that — at 34 — I feel like a victim and sorry for myself because of this. Which is making staying off the alcohol mentally harder. I also work a ton and that feeling of ""I deserve a reward"" (a drink) is still active to some extent.

Are there any recommended ways to stop feeling sorry for myself and like I've drawn the short straw in life?

I feel like once I can move past that feeling and just accept not drinking for what it is I will have a much easier time not resisting it mentally.",20May2020,1
35,"Just as the title says, I’ve struggled with this literally my entire life, from the first time I interacted with students at school. (I’m not sure how to truly express this, as it is the first time I have, so bear with me.) At school, I would consistently lie to others about stories which haven’t  actually happened to me, and I would constantly compare myself to others, even at a young age. At a young age, my mind would constantly race with thoughts of what the other kids were thinking about me and what adults were thinking about me. This has progressed throughout my elementary and middle school days to where I have developed deep insecurities about my face, height, weight, athletic ability, intelligence, and creative abilities. I also believe I have developed pathological lying tendencies, as I literally can not stop lying to save my life. I lie about almost every single little in my life, from what I had for breakfast to when I got to school. I would lie to my counselor about my family and their achievements and such, mostly about my father.(who was abusive?) However, I believe I do this though to impress other people, I’m not entirely sure. I need help, I can’t form healthy friendships or relationships as I constantly lie about everything, and I see myself as dirt. I’m not sure how to explain it any better than that.

36,"Disclaimer: I'm 24, Male, have been prescribed many different forms of medication and have seen too many therapists.

Ever since I was younger, I had a severe lack of confidence and emotional stability. For as long as I could remember, I would get offended easily and react poorly to anyone or anything that made me feel humiliated or inferior, whether it be some sort bad social encounter, doing poorly in a sport, etc. When I feel this way, I lose all sense of human decency and normally have to do everything I can to prevent myself from getting angry and physically hurting that person. Sometimes, I would wallow in self pity and beg others for validation. I have been like this almost my whole life, I'm now 24 and I still continue to experience this. 

Because I've been trying so hard to find solutions to my problems and get professional help for almost all my life, with no success at all, I'm starting to believe that this is who I am.

41,"Hi reddit, I'll start by saying that this is the first time I've ever made or used an actual account here, my extent of reddit before this is just reddit pages on instagram.

I (F 20) don't really know where to start, other than to say that right now my mental health is at the lowest it has ever been in my life, and I am really running out of options on what to do - if I'm being honest, mental health hasn't always been something ive addressed as I've always gotten along just fine, but since this lockdown / quarantine, I have felt so helpless. I'm not sure if this story belongs here as it is also relationship-related, so please let me know if there's somewhere more appropriate for it.
For some context, I'm currently living in the UK and i come from a more ""traditional"" family background - they dont let me date so they didn't know about my relationship.


Like most people, my life was doing quite well before the pandemic; academically i was improving, I'd found an amazing friend group, and was in a new yet very happy relationship with my best friend. Come the first couple weeks of lockdown, i could feel myself slipping slightly, but nothing i wasn't used to. I managed to meet all of my coursework deadlines, and whilst i was struggling i was always glad i had my boyfriend to give me a quick pep talk or cheer me up whenever i was feeling low. However, i wont act like we were perfect, and the stress from not seeing eachother and being inside with just my family all the time i think made me more irritational, which lead to us arguing over minor things that we would never have argued about had life been normal.

I don't know what exactly caused me to react the way i did, but the day after my last deadline i had a complete breakdown - i had been arguing a bit with my younger sister in the morning, and had the slightest disagreement with my boy, not enough at all to be considered an arguement, but i just had the worst possible reaction around late after. The day before i was actually really happy, called a few friends on video call and had a few drinks to celebrate me finishing the semester, but i did a complete 180 and felt so bad to the point i was having suicidal thoughts and tried to hurt myself. I spent hours just crying that night and felt ridiculously anxious and insecure, and the next day i still felt the same, plus guilty for the way i was thinking the night before. I felt so far away from 'me' that i didnt speak to my boy because i couldn't think of how to explain it, plus i didnt want him to feel like it was his fault, as he sometimes will feel guilt if im upset even when it isn't to do with him. Because of that, i ended up feeling ridiculously insecure, and i sent him messages saying how i didnt feel like i was good enough and so on. He tried to reassure me, but the next few days i just felt really awful in myself, and felt like i was bothering him constantly. I told him one night how i was feeling really bad in my mental health and he was supportive, but two days later, when i still felt like things weren't right, i asked if things were okay and he told me that he didnt have feelings for me anymore and ended the relationship. 
It was a relationship that i truly believed would be flourishing right now had things been normal, and i saw it lasting for potentially years, but i do realise that the circumstances were unpredictable and we weren't ready for something like this, both in the relationship together and mentally in ourselves.

This all happened a few weeks ago now, and for me i feel like the sudden change in his feelings only began after the breakdown i had and was feeling low. I've since tried to accept this and just try to be friends, but the struggle for me is now that i don't feel like i have that person anymore to talk to.
I have teached out to other friends during this time, and tried to stay busy or distracted, but really there's so much one can do, and a lot of the friends i have are not the 'message every day' type, so filling in them small gaps of the day that normally would have been him is now just a whole lot lonelier.

Its kind of difficult to explain how exact im feeling right now. For me, the loneliness is the biggest takeaway from all this. The uncertainty of the world we knew before, and all the things that may or may not happen are all making me feel really anxious and worried, but the worst feeling is that I'm isolated from all my friends. Whilst i still talk with my boy on friendly terms, i feel like im getting anxiety whenever he doesnt message or responds in maybe a more 'cold' manner, and the way time is passing by it makes it feel like he doesn't like me and it'll be like this forever, when all i want is to just talk and hang out soon maybe. The way things are going makes me feel like the possibly of actually seeing people again is so out of reach, and that theyre all thousands of miles away, almost as if im left behind. 

Every time i am alone with my own thoughts they're all just negative ones of anxiety and loneliness, and the most things i can do for distraction is watch movies, because i don't even have the energy to do my hobbies or chores like cleaning my room. This quarantine is making me feel lower than ive ever felt before, and it has been like this consistently for close to nearly a month now.",20May2020,1

She has this weird sense that someone or something is watching or staring at her most of the time, This does be when she's alone I'm not quite sure though how it is when she's with someone.

Also, At night odd times she does see these sort of shadow figures or objects moving around her room this does come and go but recently got alot worse. She texted me not too long ago today saying that it got alot worse and she ended up getting really edgy and paranoid but she couldn't explain it as it happened tonight and she did not want to speak about it.

She has dabbled in drugs a bit too but has not touched anything in maybe over 7 or 8 months, But she did say the whole watching thing got alot worse after doing them.

The closest I'm linking it too is maybe schizophrenia or a some sort of psychosis but then again I'm not sure, If anyone can help me find what the problem is and how I can help her handle it I'd greatly appreciate it.

My best friend has also had very similar mental health struggles in the past, yet she has been incredibly unsupportive. 

She is on this high horse like she knows everything that's best for me and she just loves to tell me when I'm ""making a stupid decision cause you're depressed."" I've wanted to hang out with her several times over the last couple months and every time I reach out to her she immediately has some half-assed excuse for why she can't spend time with me. 

When I brought up how she was making me feel she turned it around on me and started talking about how much I had ""hurt her"" by being depressed and told me that she forgives me but ""can't forget"" about it. I acknowledge that during that very dark time I wasn't always there for her and I know that she was very worried about me and my self-destructive behavior, but I have apologized and tried to explain that I wasn't well and that I'm in a completely different headspace now, yet she seems pretty intent on continuing to make me feel like shit for having a mental illness.

Some nights I refuse to go to sleep because I feel vulnerable and am scared the things I see will get me. For so long I slept during the day and stayed awake during the night. This went on for months and my sleep schedule is messed up because of it. I've had voices in my head tell me to hurt myself. They don't stop unless I do it and depending on how much I damage myself they stay quiet for longer. I've been sent to the hospital for self inflicted injuries twice and all the others I kept hidden from my family and friends. I stabbed myself multiple times in the hand and arm with a kitchen knife. I felt no pain. At one point my arm felt strange, like it was foreign and didn't belong there. I attempted to cut it off to relieve me of this feeling. I managed to stop myself because I knew this would not end well. Three years later and I'm still experiencing hallucinations and these strange feelings but not as badly as I once was. This particular night happened, I went to bed at around 9pm and began to hear voices and he said to me ""Stab the underside of your wrist and drag it down towards the end of your forearm."" I tried to ignore him but he insisted I do so. He yelled at me and got more aggressive. As tempted as I was to do it I knew that if I hit an artery I would probably bleed to death. As much as I wanted to be alone in my own head I refrained from acting out what he wanted. This was ongoing from around 9pm to 4am.

52,"Hiya.

This is less asking for help, and more trying to gain an understanding, which I suppose is asking for help in a way.  Anyway, thanks in advance.

For a few weeks now, I've been plagued by the thought that my old therapist is a monster or alien or what the hell ever, caused by bizarre episode where her face was distorted (about two years ago); I'm not going to go into the details, simply because I'm sick of writing it.  

At a very high level, I wouldn't say I'm convinced of this, but I've hit a bit of a wall regarding ""disproving"" it, and this is not the first time this has happened.

I've spent time coming up with various counter-arguments to this idea, such as:

1. it was just a weird glitch from being tired or something  
2. I have undiagnosed schizophrenia  
3. I have a brain tumor  
4. she really is an alien

I've tortured myself arguing against her being anything non-human, and have managed to shoot down any and all ridiculous idea that my brain can come up with.  I know, at a high-level at least, that option 4 should be the *absolute* least-likely, bottom-of-the-barrel bullshit answer available.

The problem is, the thought almost... sticks.  My brain seems to be giving it too much weight relative to the other options.  Basically, I can come up with as many counter-arguments as possible, but my brain will not stop acting as if this a legit possibility.

My question is: what the hell is the deal?  If I'm not delusional, as my therapist has told me repeatedly, why is my stupid brain getting stuck on this?  Why can't I say, with certainty, that option 4 is just wrong and move on with my damn life?

PS.

I know I shouldn't even be entertaining the idea, and should just ignore it as best as I can.  I've slowly been doing this, but this is just infuriating.

He went into his “void” (that’s where my bf and gf can interact with each other, they describe it as an endless blackness but they’re illuminated like there’s light)  gf tried to calm him down in the void, but then a wall got put up between them he said. He described it as if he was in some monsters mouth. The walls were bloody and fleshy, while also mechanical with teeth. He described it as a night terror but while he was awake.

Is this a normal thing that can happen in dissociation or DID? Things do sometimes “spawn” in their void though, such as a bed or table, but nothing like this. Gf didn’t expect his though, just bf.

55," I have anxiety, depression and PTSD. I have worked really hard this past year on my mental health, and I was very proud of my progress. But during this pandemic, I feel like I am going backwards and all my progress was for nothing. 

I love my parents. I really do – they are sweet, funny and kind people. But I cannot stand them during this pandemic. My mom has studied Microbiology (so, viruses) and my dad has never gone to school. They have both spent way too much time on their phones and have fallen into the trap of conspiracy theories. They genuinely think the whole virus is a hoax. And its either a way to control the population or get us to get vaccines or chips or something to control us or it doesn’t exist at all. They have so many theories that it doesn’t even make sense. I don’t necessarily blame them – they’ve showed me some videos and honestly, they’re kinda convincing. But no, I do not believe them at all. I am finishing my undergrad with a major in Biochemistry and a minor in microbiology. I consider myself a decently smart person (with respect to biology, virology, viruses).

I absolutely HATE conspiracy theorists. Especially with something so sensitive as a virus. You have a lot of privilege for coming up with theories from home while people are dying. I have already been super anxious with school closures, staying home for 2 months, and just so much that has put my life on hold. I am genuinely really scared about this virus and what the world will turn to after this. I have lost all passion for anything I want to do. Even watch shows or reading. I can’t get myself to do any of it – whats the point. I have lost all desire to actually do anything. Showering has become a weekly thing , sometimes even longer. I used to go to the gym every day and now I sleep till 6 pm (literally). 

But with all this, I am starting to really resent my parents. ALL THEY TALK ABOUT is this damn virus. It isn’t even productive. From where I live, cases are really declining, and normally that would be something that might help me think rationally but I can’t even get that pleasure because they keep insisting it’s a hoax. They also have a goal of trying to convince me. They know I am academically smart – If they convince me, then I guess it’ll truly confirm what they think. And I HATE IT. I don’t wanna talk about the virus. ESPECIALLY if it’s a damn conspiracy theory. They think **I am the one that’s naïve.** They grew up in countries where the government can never be trusted. None of it makes sense. Our government has spent MILLIONs to allow people to stay home – they are literally giving away grants for students and people working at home. I hate that they have so much privilege and don’t even realise it. I hate that I can’t think about anything else (no I’m not falling for the conspiracy, I just now am thinking of COVID-19 and doom all the time). I don’t want to think that all my nothingness in the last 2 months is going to continue. I want life to go back to normal. I don’t want to sleep all day and do nothing. And when I am awake, I have to hear about their dumb theories. I want to scream in their face “YOU ARE ACTUALLY STUPID”. It is truly getting to that point.  But that’s disrespectful, and my dad is already super insecure (and gets super angry with me if I bring up a valid point) about his education. IDK what do.

56,"So basically to get to the point, I dont know if I use bad luck and shitty events as an excuse to not improve my life or if I just get fucked by life alot. Examples being during my senior year in highschool I got really sick and failed because of it, when I recovered I got a ged and started working to make up for it, then I broke my leg, then covid happened, now I'm having issues with asthma. And with all of these things I've used them as an excuse to put plans on hold and continue when the issue is better.

60,"Hi, I hope your quarantine is going okay. I'm here to ask for some input if you have the mental energy/the time. 

I have some recurring issues that I'm not sure how to deal with, because I'm not sure how to understand them, so I'm here to get some input on how to...interpret my situation, I suppose. I hesitate to self-diagnosis and say this is caused by mental illness, but I feel like this is not normal. I already have an anxiety disorder, but I'm not sure if this stems from that or is something else entirely. I apologize if the organization of this post is confusing- it's sort of a stream of consciousness that I'm not sure how to best organize. 

Okay so without further ado: 

I'm extremely scared of the dark and I can get panic attacks from my paranoia over something potentially attacking me in the dark, or something laying in bed next to me, etc. I'm 22 years old and I have to sleep with the lights on, and even when I do, sometimes I feel like something's standing over me or in my room. When I'm more stressed (like from exam week, or problems in my personal life) I get increasingly paranoid about strangers/demons in my room watching me, though I don't actually hallucinate and see them, but I get like a sense of them in the room. Ex. I have to keep looking up behind my shoulder when I wash my face at night, because I get scared something/someone might come up behind me. I do have time periods when they're not a concern at all (like if I've had a lot of positive social interactions), but they always come back, and they seem to be correlated with me isolating myself or feeling detached from society/reality. (Then I get caught in this loop where I want to be around people but I don't feel like myself enough to have a real interaction with someone, which further distances me from my sense of self). I have a big imagination, so it could be that taking over when I'm unhappy, but I don't know..it just bothers me that I've never talked to someone else who experiences something remotely similar. 

I grew up in a heavily religious family who said spirits were real, but they themselves aren't paranoid or scared about it, so I'm not sure why my brain took it to the extreme. Fun fact (idk, this just came to mind, and I feel it's better to give you guys a fuller picture): when I was in middle school I saw a horror film that caused me to fully visually hallucinate (unlike what I experience nowadays, which is more along the lines of feeling like there's someone around and seeing it in my mind's eye clearly) and I believed my parents were possessed by demons (when I got home after the movie). It was really bad- if I closed my eyes I could see it more clearly, and if I kept them open, I could see demon faces superimposed on their's, like some kind of Augmented Reality game. (I contacted a Psychiatrist in later years to ask about that, but they said it's common to hallucinate after a really scary film. Idk, I'm still doubtful because of my other persisting issues). 

I've talked about these experiences here and there to friends over the years, but I haven't encountered anyone who's gone through anything similar (or at least, no one who will admit to it). So I'm not sure how common this really is, but I'm tired of not having anyone to relate to about it. I used to tell myself that when I grow up it'll just go away because only kids are scared of monsters/the dark/other imaginative things, but I'm 22 now and it's still really bad, so...here I am :/ 

No tldr because idk how to condense this, but if you read through, I appreciate your taking the time to look over my problems when you probably have your own to deal with. Hoping for some advice/thoughts/opinions on the matter- really anything that helps me to sort of understand my situation. Thank you.",20May2020,1

While hanging out on r/depression (which probably isn’t good for me, to be honest) I noticed a lot of depressed people say “hope is a prison.” And here’s the truth: Hope is cruel, yes, because when you inevitably fail at some point it feels like you wasted that effort. That’s life. But hope is also the driving force that keeps you making that effort until someday you WILL stand up and stay up as a changed person. Thanks to retaining even the tiniest bit of hope through repeated failure.

She’s constantly messaging me telling me she loves me, misses me, wants to cuddle me. In addition to this always wanting to go for social distancing walks and just generally just chat and message throughout the day. 

I’ve told her that I was going to turn my phone off a couple of times and it felt like she was annoyed about me doing so. As if I couldn’t because who would she then speak to?

69,"So I have a half sister- share a mom- that is 11 years older than me. She is a narcissist and very manipulative which I only realized recently. I understand the title may sound click bait-y but I am starting to remember what she did to me and my other fully related older sister- by 2.5 years- and to be honest I don’t really know how to take it and I’m starting to wig myself out over it and just want a to hear an outsider’s thoughts on it. I have confronted her about all this but she laughed it off as a joke. 

So I first started to realize she wasn’t such a good person when I got into college and tried to turn me against my parents and religion- Christianity- and tried to make me into her gofer. And then I have basically cut ties with her about a year ago at her wedding. Here are some things she would do to me from 3 yrs old to about a yr ago. 

- lure me into her room full of friends with a puppy pic and then pull my pants and underwear down in front of them. They would laugh as a I tried to run and stumbled away

- when babysitting me and my other sister she would play ‘games’ such as holding our breathe or hide and seek or such. She would then put a pillow over our faces and smother us- holding breathe game- or throw us in a closet and lock us in for someone else to let us out or make it so we couldn’t get out from our hiding spots, or sit on us, particularly our heads. 

- one of our cats died from a vet error and she convinced me as a 4/5 yr old that I had killed him because I played with him too roughly

- when in a pool she would force my head underwater and hold it there while I struggle, laughing. she would also get her friends or boyfriend to do this as well as ‘a joke’ and when I cried they mocked me

- she tried to give me drugs- I didn’t know better but still refused- saying it was candy

- she had stoner friends at a party in our basement and I snuck halfway down the stairs to see and she put them up to try to get me to go with them. I ran to my bed. 

- as early as 3 rd grade she would accuse me of wanting to steal her boyfriends and called me a slut saying I played footsie with them. Even though she encouraged them to hang out with me. 

——— note by this time I learned to avoid her and I was bigger and heavier than her so she couldn’t physically do much of anything

- told me I had to put out and do sexual favors to get a boyfriend and keep one- described in detail and started this when I was in middle school

- said I needed to drink alcohol to be fun and tried to give drinks whenever she was around

- constantly bullied me and talked behind my back about my appearance 

- when I started college she ‘wanted to start a new relationship’. For two years she confused and tried to manipulate me into thinking my religion was a cult made by my parents to trap me to them for the rest of my life. Said that now that I was away from them I can ‘learn to be me’ and start sleeping around and partying like she did. 

- tried to alienate me from my biological father- she hates him- by bad mouthing him, making up
lies about him, and has called the police on him and us on false claims in order to get him in trouble

- when I started to have depressive and suicidal thoughts growing up, she found out about it and encouraged me to do it, telling me ways to do it too

So when all this was happening I didn’t realize what she was doing. The first couple yrs in college I had to seek out professional counseling because she messed with me so bad. A big part as to why I believe if she had gotten a chance to kill me she would have is because when I was small and she smothered me or pushed my head underwater, she laughed. I could feel that she hated me in those moments and wanted me gone. Me and my other sister. She has said she blames my dad, sister, and me for taking our mom away from her. Her biological dad was an abusive drunk that abused our mother and she left him and took her with her. Our mom met my dad and had my sister and I. She believes if we were gone then she could be happy with our mom. 

I’m conflicted. I’ve slowly been going through my memories of her and she was just awful. I’m kinda shocked rn and a little bit terrified that I lived and love someone that wanted to end my life before it really began. I truly believe that if my sister- fully related one- and I hadn’t been early bloomers and got bigger than most kids our age and if she hadn’t have been petite like she is then she would have followed through. 

I don’t talk to her or even see her anymore. After she yelled at me and accused me of many many lies after her wedding- I was even a bridesmaid- I cut contact. She now has a husband that enjoys her behavior and finds it entertaining, and she continues to be a hostesses and him a striper out west so to each their own. She’s done some other messed up crap to my fully related sister too like successfully got her into drinking alcohol heavily, and other explicit stuff that I won’t share. I still love her on a base level because she is my sister, but I know she does not have the best intentions for me. She encouraged me to ‘be myself’ while telling me to change myself entirely. She egged on my depressive thoughts and manipulated and confused me so much that it became how we interacted. I remember her hatred of me but also me crying because she ran away again and I would miss her. I’m not sure how to categorize her anymore in my life and I guess this may be her last manipulation trick. She always wanted to be the center of attention and right now I guess she is to some point and I don’t want to give her center stage in my thoughts ever again.",20May2020,1

Your a good significant other and they cheat and tell you you'll find love....

Your a good person asking for help and find someone who is your exact copy, you get close. Real close. Then she pulls away. Guess what happend to my happiness? Someone else got it....

How long do you wait for your happiness?

The effects from this are really kicking my ass though and I was already in a pretty rough place. Nicotine withdrawal has nothing on this. 

I've also developed a marijuana dependence over the past couple years. It's been off and on, but it's full on right now.

I am sure I am only hurting myself by self diagnosing, but I have found several personality disorders that describe my toxic traits perfectly. Explains my series of failed relationships and broken friendships.

I found out a few weeks ago that my brother was diagnosed as Bipolar 1 which means I'm much more likely to also be bipolar. This stung for some reason, but was also a relief. I have worked with my GP on so many different medicines over the years and even when things worked, I often still struggled to get out of bed and be who I wanted to be.

Osgood-Schlatter's disease.

She’s driving me fucking insane!!!’ Her back door faces our bathroom and kitchen window (very close proximity) and she just yells at us. About sewer pipes that don’t exist. She says we have sewer pipes that had a leak on the side of our house and killed her husband. She has said her self he died of a heart attack and has also blamed the hospice people if there even were any. Almost she says can be taken as truth. But she has said she’s frank Sinatra’s god daughter. Which is scary even if she’s lying. She said she was gonna cut us up into little pieces today.

Since they let her out again, we have to go to court on new charges, have it delayed by a month over and over for 6 months again, go to court 2 or 3 more times because she somehow gets out of showing up.

Throughout my years I've been off and on with my temperament. I know that I have had a temperament issue since I was a child. I would have outbursts with me yelling out the top of my lungs and breaking things because I would refused something I didn't want to do ect. haircut. What makes my temperament stand out, however is how long it can last and how mad I can be over the smallest mistake either I or someone did. I can stay mad over something for days that took a minute to upset me. Its an anger so clouding that i can't break out of myself from it even with distractions. It also becoming too common with having a temperamental breakdown about every other week. I've also had this weird tick that I've done as a child. I punch my thighs whenever I am stressed out or feeling discomfort.

I'm currently in a relationship that has been slowly deteriorating due to my temperament. I can get mad over a simple mistake like genuine accidents and just petty language. That will lead to a incredibly long and pointless fight that I continuously instigate towards my partners. I become so clouded in this anger over nothing that I feel that I must direct all my anger towards that person. I will bother and say in and do everything to make them unhappy and i don't stop till I've made the other person cry and realized what damage I've inflicted.

I have become so abusive in this relationship its terrifying and can't seem to grasp why i will lose my temper in a otherwise perfect relationship.

This isn't exclusive to the relationship. I impacting all my family members. I also lose my temperament with my father and mother as well.  I will yell and say obscenities and also just say things meanest things without thinking.

The major issue with this temperament is how self destructive I become afterwards with myself once I have realized what I have done.  As of late last year however i've been trying to make a difference and learning to control my temperament. I keep trying to get back on my own feet making steps in building a healthy routine for my life by eating healthy, excercising, studying, ect. but once I have lost my temperament it takes days for my psyche the revert back so I may have some motivation to continue. During that period though I am just self loathing and taking steps back on my mental health. I am very bad at taking the right steps to help my break this cycle.

I believe I am very self aware of my issue but I take no action to fix it or nor do i know the right actions to fix it. 

I have done mental health counseling in the past but for a different issue. I've tried 4 different ssris and every single one has cause a different side effect that negates the benefits of the ssri. I've also had a gp experiment ativan, and adderall. The adderall boosted my productivity but I became a bigger asshole than I already was. So I decided to cut it off. I've also tried psychedelics which did help me process one extremely major personal issue i had. However it has only helped in that aspect which sexual abuse as a child. I want to try more lsd but my trip that helped me process this behavior was a really traumatizing trip, but in a positive way. Pain is needed at times to come to realize something i believe. I'm just not emotionally ready right now to use psychedelics to reveal all my flaws to me at once. I know im very hot headed however I need  to be able to slowly address this then be able to have a more level headed discussion with myself. Thats why i am desperately trying everything to get myself in the right track be setting up another mental health counseling appointment.

that's not the end of it.

90,"Hey everyone,

This is my second post. I just made my account and I'm so excited to contribute to the community. Apologies for grammatical errors. I'll work on those later. 

TLDR at the bottom. 

I've been working on getting better at dealing with my depression for 11 years and personally think I'm constantly making ground, even though I still experience disruptive episodes.

During my last episodes, while talking with my roommates who are some of my greatest supporters, (quick shout out to my mom and dad too,) I identified something pretty important about how I treat myself when depressed.

When I stop being productive, whether that's due to depression or triggering depression, I subconsciously punish myself for it by not allowing myself to make time for anything else.

This obviously makes things worse, I lose more productivity, and become paralyzed/bedridden/stuck.

I find this to be different than the age old advise to do the things that are good for you, becuase I've directly acknowledged the blockage made of shame and guilt. I can now start dismissing the blockage instead of trying to will myself over it. 

Just identifying this behavior is a huge milestone. 

Today, during my current episode, I remembered this, and was able to remind myself that going and doing something fun or healthy, without guilt over not being productive, may be the thing to snap me out of it, and if not, it will be better than laying in bed.

So not only did I identify it, but I'm already working on doing better at this. I'm so excited. I'm really hoping that  this will make a huge difference in the way I bounce back, and may prevent me from reaching my deeper stages of depression.

If not, that just means I've got another exciting project coming in the future. 😁

TLDR: I figured out how to give myself permission to do things I enjoy while depressed.",20May2020,1

I lie and twist things to myself and to my friends and loved ones out of fear of judgement or rejection normally only making things worse.
I feel more comfortable alone because im free from other peoples judgement and expectations and this keeps me from making real and meaningful connections.
I resent myself and resent the fact that im alive.

I am taking medication and seeing a therapist monthly but it doesnt seem enough. I would see the therapist more regularly but its hard to find a therapist with regular fortnightly opportunities.

My mental state moves in waves from reasonably high to ridiculous lows and the low points are where my toxic behaviours and damging personallity traits start to show, and even the high points are muddled with self doubt and anxiety.

I dont know how much longer i can go on like this, im tired of hurting and tired of living like this. Its like 24/7 heartbreak blended with a chronic migrane and today i found myself thinking of a plan to end it all and thats what scared me into making this post.

105,"Hi everyone. I’m a filmmaker based in the UK and mental health is something very close to me personally. I think it’s important to me to use my art to create something to help continue raise awareness. 

I’m creating a documentary focusing on mental health in men. I’m looking for any men who have experienced mental health difficulties to share their stories with me over voice recordings. 

You will remain anonymous in the film, but for your voice. Your voice recordings will accompany the visuals in the film. 

The aim for this film is to try and highlight even further the ever-growing awareness being raised for men’s mental health. Additionally, it is also to try and create a short film that will resonate with men of all ages and backgrounds. I’m hoping that men watching and listening to other men opening up won’t feel alone. It’s also about trying to destigmatise the notion that men can’t cry, or be vulnerable. 

For those interested, please send your voice recordings to - jonnyvisuals@outlook.com

Some questions to consider: What do you feel physically? How has your mental health affected personal and professional relationships? Do you feel supported? Can you at all describe visually what you see/feel in your head? Have you ever felt suicidal - what triggered this?

The voice recordings don’t have to be professional quality, you can just use your phone if you would like.

If anyone has any further questions, please get in touch and thank you to anyone in advance who shares any of their experiences. I hope your words will resonate with other men that are struggling, whilst concurrently helping you by talking.",20May2020,1

108,"Here’s the whole story: I’ve been under a lot more stress than usual. First, over the weekend, my abusive ex had basically a mental breakdown where he became delusional and thinking I was doing and saying things that I never did or said, and he ended up choking me and just all around trying to hurt me. Then, on Monday, a close friend I’ve known for a few years killed himself - my other close friend was the one who found him and described every detail. That night, (yes I know dumb decision) I smoked crystal. I also had a very very stressful fight with my mother this whole day. Everything was fine, until about 10 hours later well after the high wore off, and all the details I heard from my friends suicide and images just started racing through my head and I had the worst panic attack I’ve had in months. I took 4 vistaril and fell asleep. When I woke up, I just felt.. off. Things don’t feel real. I know they’re real, but they’re just different. It’s hard to explain. I can’t feel anything but anxiety and depression. I feel absolutely horrible in every way and the longer it goes the worse my anxiety gets because I’m scared I’ll be stuck like this forever. Then I googled derealization - and it was spot on. The article I read said derealization can be caused by extreme stress, be drug-induced, and can even be an effect felt after panic attacks. I literally have ALL 3 of these. I’m so scared, what if I got a bad hit of dope and now I’m messed up forever? I’m not hearing or seeing things. I know I’m real. It’s just almost dream like, I wanna go back to normal. I’ve been in and out of mental hospitals and I really don’t want to go back.

It's currently 4:40am, I've (20f) been trying to sleep for over an hour but I can't. For the past couple weeks I've been falling asleep pretty fine from around 2-3am and wake up at a decent time. Recently I can't. I wake up, stay up for a bit, then take another 2-4 hour nap. Then another nap later. By the time I've left my room it'll be 2-3pm.

I'm currently bombarded with flashbacks and things I don't wanna think about, I thought I pushed them deep down. I'm tired of constantly being reminded of things people did to me. I'm tired of constantly remembering assaults/abuse I didn't even realize were an assault/abuse until recently.
I'm not sure if this is all cause I got into a relationship recently with a guy and I've never properly dated a guy before (I've mostly dated girls but they've all ended badly), so now I'm dealing with constant flashbacks/memories of things guys have done to me and I want to cry but I can't.

Everytime I try to cry my eyes just burn up and I don't wanna continue, I keep having these dreams of me self harming, having a panic attack or telling my bf about traumatic things and he has these extreme reactions towards them in the dreams. I'm not even sure how he would react irl because hes so numb to things. 

I really wanna breakdown and just cry in hopes of it all releasing but I can't. I don't know what to do. I'm in Ontario, we are still in a slight lockdown and I've been waiting over a month for mental health resources.

I'm not saying that my life is perfect, because it's not, but its just not easy for me to cry about it (repression maybe?). Although, I must say that it's easier for me to cry about movies etc, so I wouldn't say I'm emotionally numb yet. But that night of my birthday and some days before, I had so much pain and deadweight on my chest that I figured that crying was what I needed. I've been overthinking too much (but some of the overthinking does make sense and it's not like I'm worrying over nothing kinda) and I've just felt so out of place. Also I feel compelled to say that I'm a homebody so it's not like quarantine is taking a huge toll on me. Anyway, I cried like a motherfucker. I cried over the little things, over some slightly bigger problems and just generally everything. I felt fine moments after it and the next day I felt relatively calm. I've been wondering if that was like an anxiety attack or what did the constant pain in my chest mean? Why did I feel so terribly unbearable? I've also thought about the possibility of having ADHD. I truly relate in some aspects about it but I haven't gone to a therapist to talk about it. I don't mean to self diagnose/ask to be diagnosed here or offend anyone who has it, but my mind is elsewhere and I just don't know who to talk it to or how to make sense of my feelings.

Anxiety not just about losing people but about not having achieved anything real of being a looser and blah blah blah you know.

But then I started looking it the other way around. I am not the reason that people are not sticking around with me, fuck them who needs people anyway. And there's nothing wrong with not having achieved anything, why does that have to be wrong? I'm good enough but I'll not stop looking and finding and pursuing that moment when I WILL ACHIEVE something. 

Loneliness was a big factor in my life too but it's okay to be lonely sometimes. I am grateful for those 2 friends that show up sometimes that sometimes make me laugh. And for other times when I feel more lonely than ever, I have my books I could read and get into that character's mind and make new friends there :)) 

I am not saying that I have mastered these and stopped being miserable. There are still nights that are harder than others, times when I don't know what to do, times when I feel so lonely that my chest aches. But it's okay to have those days. now instead of avoiding those days, I go through it. Instead of avoiding all the thoughts, I try to face all of them.

All I'm saying is that instead of being miserable I am trying my best 'cos why not? what's there to lose anyway?

I know it can be a lot harder for some people but why not try to take that one step and see where it goes?

Thank you.

Let me know if I helped you in any way. I'd really appreciate it.",20May2020,1

128,"I've had a really tough last couple years... in essence I grew up in an abusive household, had to leave for uni before I was realistically ready for independence, and the uni I'm at has not helped - all the societies (regular social groups centred round something like a hobby or interest, or a place to meet specific folks like you such as LGBT or ASD groups) I could possibly have joined with my anxiety did not run. I complained plenty to them, even set up a society of my own, but they did nothing and nobody came to mine. Basically, I've been really painfully alone for 2 years - no physical friends from school in the same city (and they're very flaky online due to their own anxiety, so I've only been even more alone with the awful thoughts about myself from childhood day in and day out for 2 years).

I knew I needed a group of friends near me for a very long time and some good therapy so I decided a while ago to make the drastic move of changing unis. I verified the other uni's societies work properly and that the course is all good and I got accepted, so I was finally able to see a way out of this dark place... but then this FUCKING virus happened and now they might not even have face to face lectures or any social things for the whole upcoming academic year when I'd be moving

I feel like there's no escape for me now and everything is falling apart and breaking around me (my friend group has been even more flaky in the stress of quarantine and some people have snapped at me in ways which have really hurt as a response to it too) and I just dont know what to do

130,"Lately, I haven't been so much depressed, but moreso struggling to find a point in doing things in life when one day, it won't mean anything anymore. For example, I'll be a senior in high school next year. I only have two friends  right now, and I'm not very close to them at all. So, I see no point in trying to make a bunch of new friends next year, or do all the senior activities, when I won't see or talk to 98% of these people ever again in just a year.

I also don't know if it will be worth it for me to make a bunch of friendships and be active on campus in College either. Within four years, I will never see nor talk to 97% of the people I meet there ever again.

131,"Some background story before I start:


I have 4 friends in my group. I'll give them fake names just in case one of them finds me here.


Jasmine = She got a online boyfriend who was manipulating her and guilt-tripping her by saying he will commit suicide if Jasmine doesn't do what he says. I managed to convince her to leave him a few months ago. She broke down in school multiple times and I have accompanied her to the counsellors a few times. Now she has a therapist.


Jane = She cut her left wrist a lot of times, and sent me a photo of her standing on the window with one foot out. She doesn't tell me anything. She refuses my help and wants me to forget everything I saw, which I don't obviously, and told two teachers anonymously to keep an eye on her in case she does something. She doesn't have a therapist, and she doesn't want professional help at all.


Carly = She told me that her parents don't love her, and her mother is a piece of shit gold digger and her dad doesn't care. Her dad cheated on her mom. She also stood at the balcony wanting to jump. Carly and I have a mutual agreement that we would both talk to each other when she feels depressed or when I'm sad. She doesn't have a therapist.


Emily = She was worried for Jane, and said she might be at fault for Jane's behaviour. She gave me picture examples of what she tried to do a year ago: standing on the window, and told me she stopped cutting last year. But then recently, like a few days ago, she told me she cut her herself. I convinced her to tell her dad, and to have him look at the wound 
because it was really deep and I was scared.
She also doesn't have a therapist.

Please keep this in mind that the fact that all of them, except Jane, is 14. Jane is 13. I'm also 14. And to be the one who has to listen to everyone of them being depressed is making me go insane.


Before anyone comments down that I should leave them and find positive people to hang around with, I should clarify that they do make me happy, and all I want is them to get better and be happy.


I am the ""mom"" or ""caretaker"" of the group. Whatever happens, I am always there for them. If one of them does something wrong, I try and tell her calmly why it's wrong and how she should fix it. 

But this, have been going on for nearly a year, and I have been trying to keep myself together. I've been trying my best. 


So a few hours ago, I was talking to Carly and I started to get emotional. She suggested that I tell it to everyone, which I did. I vented for an hour, telling them how they are precious to me and how I'm so frustrated at the fact that they keep rejecting me. I voiced out all my complaints, I got mad at them, and told them everything. I told them I cried, and cried thinking about them and how they shouldn't cut themselves thinking it would fix everything. I told them that school counsellors exist, and I'm not a superman who can fix problems just because they trust me. I am also a human who has emotions, and I shouldn't be the one who they turn to when they need help. They need help from professionals. And I am not one. 


I am just merely a 14 year old female, but I know damn well myself what I should not do and do. I know that self-harm isn't the answer and neither is suicide. But what I don't know is that whether the fact that my outburst was good enough to make them realise and stop, and see how it's also affecting me. Make them tell an adult, get help from professionals who is not me. Because. I. Am. Not. A. Professional. 


I have went through this ""phase"" (?) before when I was 10. But I managed to change my mindset and always see the positive things thanks to my parents and the Internet.


I have been giving advice, convincing them to not jump or cut to them everytime. It usually works, and sometimes it doesn't. I try giving them talks, about how they're worth everything and their skin isn't a canvas to cut. I tell them how much they're gonna miss in the future if they leave now. I tell them that it's not worth it, and stop before you regret anything. I tell them that life is worth living, and everyone deserves a chance to be happy. It's just that the chance to be happy may be in the future.


They don't seem to remember the fact that although I act as if I'm older than 14, I am still 14 at heart. I don't want to deal with all of this. I have my own problems to deal with already. I know this is hurting me. 


I know how unrealistic it sounds that I am 14 and dealing with this. I have asked for advice but no one believes me because they don't believe I'm 14. Surfing the internet at a young age exposes your mind to stuff, and plus my parents with their good parenting skills makes me think that I am at least more mature than most 14 year olds. (I would show the conversation I had but I don't know how to post images. Unless someone is willing to guide me, I will post it.)



I love them, I really do. I want them to get better, but my words fail to describe my feelings. 

How can I show them that life is more than just suffering, and there's so much more waiting for them in the future? 


How can I show them, the way I see living life as?",20May2020,1

133,"Everyone always tells me I have depression. Or at least asks. But I don't think that's true. I'm happy almost all the time. It's really the main emotion I feel. It's just always been like that. So that's why I'm posting it here. Because it wouldn't fit in r/depression . So I hope I read the rules right 

I'm living my 3 greatest fears currently in life. I'm not gonna go to deep into why, but I am gonna give some necessary information. I'm 15 yrars old. So as you could imagine this involves school. That's basically all that's necessary so here I go, explaining my fears amd why I feel like it. Because hey, nothing better than ranting online because I never want to tell anyone any of this irl.

My biggest fear is having one small action ruin everything in my life. It's always been their, just a creeping anxiety I guess. And that's whats been happening for 2 years.  You don't actually have to read this next part. It's very long and redundant. Just read the other 2 fears below if you want 

I started having to walk to school, leading to me missing the first 2 periods of school almost everyday, leading to a court case, after winning the court case, having a distrust for authority, leading to acting out, leading to trouble, leading to detention (at lunch), leading to me skipping detention because of another fear, leading to argument with mom, leading to temporarily moving in with Dad, told friend that, teacher overheard and told principal, principal tried to kick me out because of stupid law that I don't want to get in to, won that, was informed that all my teachers were told to try and watch me for mental illness by another teacher (god bless him), more distrust in authority because I was just expressing myself and was branded mentally ill for doing it. Despite me just joking around in class. Like throwing paper at friend, met girl at start of 8th grade through her cousin, who was in my friend group, figured out she basically had no friends besides her cousin, her cousin doesn't like her very much, I wanted to guarentee she had friends till at least I went to high school (she was in 7th grade, so no matter what I couldn't guarentee that for 1 year of high school), I did that, I basically hung out with her constantly during school, she asked me to go with her to a school event, I promised I would, I then got suspended for something I did about 3 months before, she said it was fine, but was visibly upset, after that I learned she went through a similar court case as me, and was constantly targeted by staff of my school, more distrust, I then wrote Ram Ranch on finals, principal read it back to me, I laughed because it's the funniest shit, he told me to tell the lyrics to my Mom as punishment, told him no,  bell rang, I ran out because of another fear I'll get into later, told everyone I knew about it (basically everyone in the 8th grade) they started making fun of him, I promised all my friends I'd go to the same  high school (a school I've wanted to go to since 2nd grade) I got in trouble for telling everyone the principal recited Ram Ranch to me, he told me he told the other principals in the district about me, which I was informed by my brother he did, since his principal talked to him about it, skipped school because I was incredibly upset, next day I got pulled into the office, school safety officer threatened to steal my bike (he bought the chain), threatened to whip him with the chain if he tried to take my bike, and was told to not come back, snuck back in at lunch to tell my friends about it, told that girl only since everyone else I was friends with was absent, she basically ignored me, she seems to have been hanging out with other people (really happy about that), it's been a year, I didn't get into that school, went to a random charter school because it was the only one that would accept me (my local school has had multiple murders occur at it, so fuck that) made no friends because I desperately wanted to get out,started skipping school because how much I hated it, called a teacher pretentious and dumb because he called incel a political terrorist organization. Which was pretty funny, like I don't like self titled inclels either.  But it isn't an organization lmao,and he talked about ""mumble crap"", also said he looked like a sex offender on an assignment, was told to right an apology, I did because I legitimately felt sorry for calling him a sex offender, because that could have real consequences for him, didn't apologize for calling him dumb, or saying that his wife divorced him because she married him because he looks rich, but isn't, because that's funny imo, I got kicked out, and I officially haven't had a real irl conversation with someone who's around my age in 1 year. Besides one friend. Also haven't talked to that girl in a year. 

Now that you're caught up, I'll explain my other fears. In less detail because I basically just gave you the short story version of the past 3 years of my life. 

My 2nd biggest fear is wasting time. So as I said before, I walked out of a meeting wity my principal because of this, I walked home with that girl every day. So since the bell rung, I had to leave to walk with her. I didn't want to miss it because I only had 2 months left of school. After that I can't guarantee I'd ever see her again. That's also the reason I skipped all that detention I mentioned. Because I had limited lunches. And I didn't want to waste any. That lead into my current life because I haven't made a single good memory with friends this past year. It's been one huge waste. Now I'll have no good school related memories for Freshman year. Largely of my own making too. Which leads into my next fear...

I fear living a life I regret. I don't have to explain this one at all really. I don't regret what I did necessarily though, I regret what I didn't do. 

I feel this horrible feeling everyday when I think about this stuff. I can't really explain it either. It's like a pit in my stomach

If you made it this far. Please diagnos me. Or give me some advice. Something at least. Call me retarded I don't really care. If you need more information, just tell me to elaborate.

136,"The world we live in today is a very different world than the one we lived in a few months ago. Nobody knows what the new normal will be, or whether there will ever be any normal. We are all cooped up inside our homes, waiting patiently for things to get better. Hence, there is no denying that our mental health is bound to have a few hiccups on the way. But we, as adults, are emotionally equipped to handle such fluctuations, or at least recognised that there is a problem. However, staying home all the time, not meeting your friends or teachers can have a huge impact of a child’s well-being. [Child therapy](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/child-therapy/), in such cases, becomes important. That is mainly because this is all so new that nobody knows what to do about it, especially the kids. Not having a routine can mess with an adult, now imagine the impact of that on a child. It is also worth noting that it is not just the mental health, but also the physical health of kids that is in jeopardy during these trying times. 

As we have iterated before, this is all too new to know anything for certain. It will take a lot of studies to truly understand the impact of a pandemic on kids. This is not to say that this is the first ever pandemic the world has ever seen, but it is the first time where have access to the internet, where communities are a lot closer and dialogue around mental health is on an upswing. If you are worried about finding a [child psychologist in Mumbai](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/child-therapy/) for your kid, fret not, because the city has some of the best therapists. This is all too new for us. Nobody knows what happens next or whether something will happen next. In such times, it is imperative that you keep your children happy and occupied. 

The power of a routine is often underrated. It can fix a lot of issues in your life as an adult. And as for kids, it is even more important. Hence, now that your kid can not go out for play date, or an even football class, make sure that your kid has some sort of routine in place. Do not keep it until the day comes to decide what to do. Have a fixed time for your kid to wake up and go to sleep. Homeschool should be at fixed hours with scheduled breaks in the middle. Even the[ best child psychologist in Mumbai](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/child-therapy/) or any other city will tell you that a fixed routine will have a huge impact on your child’s well-being. If you have the privilege of an accessible garden or a rooftop, take them there every day. Let the kid have some physical exertion that they were so used to earlier. Yes, we might not know what is in store for us but what we know for certain is that the times are unprecedented, and we need to take care of ourselves.",20May2020,1
137,"TL;DR: I got stressed and felt angry for no reason, and don't know why it keeps happening

I went downstairs in a good mood this morning. I'd been up all night, but it's because of my sleep schedule.

I was going to make myself breakfast and try to have a good day, but my mom had to shut down my positivity because my sister's pet gerbil died (she doesn't seem torn up about it, but I know it's probably affecting her). Since I wasn't too bothered by the death and usually keep to myself anyways, I started to quietly play Animal Crossing. My brother wanted to watch, so I showed him my tent (my sister came over and sat on my other side to also watch.

We started to talk, but as they were talking the sound of their voices started to get annoying. It felt like they were too loud and irritating, and I tried asking them to be a bit quieter but they wouldn't listen. I ended up giving my sister a turn to play Animal Crossing and went back to my room without food. My heart was pounding and I was angry for no reason.

This has happened so many times before, and I'm sick of it. People call me an asshole when I lash out about it, but I don't want it to happen.

139,"I’m sorry if this is long/completely all-over-the-place. I’m also sorry if I get anything wrong in this post—I’m new to this.

I’m worried and don’t know what to do. So, I’m a minor and I’d had this (non-human, adult) ‘imaginary friend’ for a long time, but they was always asleep in what I called my ’safe-space’. Even though they were asleep, I always knew their name and only told a few school-friends about them, since y’know, imaginary friends are sort of normal.

However, recently (roughly the beginning of 2020), they woke up and I started getting to know them. About that time, I learnt about DID, what it was and how it worked, through the YouTube channel ‘DissociaDID’ (they’re all awesome). When I watched more and more videos, things seemed to ‘add up’. Why I felt so weird sometimes, like I was in 3rd person/inside my head. Why I had a different appearance in my safe-space than I did IRL. Why I didn’t outgrow my imaginary friend and world. Why the friend felt so real.

I have a safe-space, where I can freely communicate with the friend. It’s sort of small though and I can’t really go too far in it, but it’s beautiful.

I felt... terrible when I saw how similar all this was to DID. There’s nothing wrong with having a mental disorder, but to put the puzzle together from strangers on the internet? It didn’t feel good. Of course, I’m reaching out to other strangers on the internet now, so I probably shouldn’t complain. I learnt that some people called what I called my safe-space their inner world and that the ‘imaginary friend’ was called an alter. The thing that made me feel the worst was seeing their ‘are you traumatised’ video, where they discussed symptoms of different types of trauma and I displayed all of the symptoms listed in the second type (dissociative trauma).

My first major concern is about what happened? DID is caused by repeated trauma, and I don’t know anything in my life that I could call abuse. Even if I wouldn’t know what it is (I believe the other alter is both a protector and trauma-holder) my parents would, and they seem to be really loving and caring, etc. . I only have a few possibilities that I could even consider, which are neglect, assault or... school.

First, neglect. I find it unlikely that it could be this one. I don’t have that much human interaction throughout the day. I also have an extreme aversion to loud sounds and human touch, mainly because they rip me out of dissociating and make me feel nauseous and gross.

Second, assault. When the other alter was created, I barely remember anything except the emotions of the situation and something I said. The emotions were fear, hurt and anger and I said “Get away from me,” while crying. Then we both think the friend fronted. However, I’m sure my parents would know something about it and they’ve never brought it up/treated me differently and, since I was younger, maybe it was over something trivial.

Third... school. It’s the most lucrative one, but I had some serious stuff going on back then. There was a girl who kept trying to steal my only friend, my only friend constantly betraying me to her and giving me trust issues, severe stress from schoolwork (I was a ‘straight A child’ and always had to be. My parents never pressured me into this, but it was a common expectation) not to mention I literally moved continents during this, from a relatively wealthy country to a third-world country which was a very jarring move. However, I seem like an entitled kid for saying this one, especially when there are victims of sexual abuse on this subreddit, which brings me to my last point.

I don’t feel like I have DID. Like I don’t deserve it because I haven’t been through enough (to my knowledge). I feel like a huge fraud, like I’m taking a label I shouldn’t have, even though I’m pretty sure an alter has been co-conscious twice now and fronted once long ago, it feels like something out of a book/movie. I reached out to a friend and told them all this and they’ve been really supportive, which helped a lot. And... even if this isn’t DID, I’ve developed some strong bonds to the friend.

P.S. : If you’re wondering why I don’t go see a therapist, it’s because

* the country I’m in doesn’t have a good physical healthcare system, let alone a mental one.
* DID is so stigmatised and badly diagnosed that it’d be bad if I tried to get diagnosed.
* if I saw a therapist... they might ‘integrate’ the friend. They’re like a parent/sibling to me and I don’t want to lose them or myself.

I don’t expect a diagnosis, if you give me one, I'll take it as an opinion, but I do need advice/knowledge from past experiences.",20May2020,1

I told them I started taking it a week ago, I haven’t and I’m not going to. I want a second opinion when covid is over but for now I have to deal with them. Does anyone know what an antipsychotic would make someone who doesn’t need them actually feel like? I was on abilify such a short period of time I don’t remember what it made me feel like. Like would there be 0 effects or would it make me lethargic if it was something I didn’t need? I honestly have a tele-heath visit w my therapist tmrw and should have been on my meds for a week now so I need to know if there’s anything this should make me feel like if anyone knows!!!",20May2020,1
144,"Throwaway account for reasons that will become obvious later on.

I've struggled with severe depression and anxiety since I was 11, and bulmia since I was 13. I have been placed into partial inpatient hospitalization and taken a million medications for these issues before when I was a teenager, however I no longer have the need to take medication. I have a family history of mental health problems as well. I'm in my 20s now and I've learned how to manage my mental health issues to a surprising degree. So now that I'm noticing new symptoms it's freaking me out.

For the past 6 months or so, I intermittently have difficultly sleeping and start having paranoia and very mild visual hallucinations. I keep ""seeing"" something out of the corner of my eye, or become convinced in a dark room that someone is standing there, watching me. I can't sleep with the lights off anymore unless someone is with me. Even with the light on, if I'm not distracted I can't sleep because my mind keeps going; ""there's someone right there. there's someone right there. there's someone right there. there's someone right there."" Even though there never is.

I also notice during these times that during the day I am much more agitated than usual. I'm usually not the friendliest person, but this has become way out of character for me. I keep getting into intense arguments/fights with my spouse over stupid, stupid, STUPID shit and getting very annoyed at my close friends. I also have more difficulty than usual with focusing on my classwork and work during these times as well.

Last week really scared me though. There was a big misunderstanding with my college's virtual graduation event, long story short I had been nominated by my department to give a speech at this event but I wasn't chosen and the department didn't tell me. I had every right to be upset at what happened, but that's not how it went. I have never been so infuriated in my life. I wanted to punch a hole in my drywall and I wrote out several nasty emails to the dean (that I thankfully did NOT send). My jaw was clenched so hard that my teeth hurt. 

My spouse called me to try to calm me down and it only made me angrier. I started screaming about how dare they not chose me, I have accomplished more than everyone else graduating, I did more for the college than everyone else, I am smarted than everyone else, I was entitled to it, how dare they disrespect me etc etc. It doesn't sound as bad as it actually was in writing but it was very extreme and not in character for me at all. I \*have\* accomplished a lot, and I have been awarded over 5 awards from my university for my achievements, but I am usually very humble about it and I don't like to brag at all. I find it incredibly annoying when other people do that so I don't want to be ""that guy."" I am very cognizant of the fact that I am rarely the smartest or most accomplished person in a room and I can always learn something from others.

A few days later when I calmed down I realized that these are all symptoms of a manic episode and I likely had a delusion of grandeur. Bipolar disorder runs in my family, so I always knew this was a risk. The issue is that it's taken me a decade of suffering to figure out how to manage my other mental health problems. I don't want to have to do that all again or take medication. The other issue is that I want to pursue a political career in the future, and I know that will be difficult enough with just my current history of mental health issues. If I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder I am terrified that it will ruin my career. Some one, please please please tell me that I am overreacting and I don't need to see a psychiatrist about this.

TLDR; I have a personal and family history with mental health issues and I've noticed that I have  symptoms of a manic episode every month or so. I don't want to see  a psychiatrist about it because I don't want to ruin my chances of a future political career or take medication. Please tell me I'm overreacting.",20May2020,1
145,"So this quarantine has been pretty hard for me and it has been actually a mess. I can't really explain but I'm going to put a list of what i have noticed.

-constant stress without stop
-intrusive thoughts that i can't control 
(i can control it better now recently)
-hard time concentrating.
- constantly switching sexualities. 
And this part i have to explain thoroughly.
Remember the ocd part? Yeah that has been going for so long and only recently have i been able to control it. This is relevant to what I'm going to talk about and i have no idea how that works.

I have this loop in my brain where i go
Whenever i am straight i have an ocd and whenever i control it i either become bi or gay and whenever i try to do something about it i become autosexual (im inlove romantically and sexually to myself). Then i go back to the sequence. 

Im not sure how this works but it's really messing with my mind and i hate it so much.

All he's done is sleep. He hasn't done schoolwork for the University he wants to go to, he hasn't even been playing video games anymore. He's stopped eating. He started smoking pot every day.

I feel like I'm slowly watching him die. I've already alerted his older sister about the situation and have gotten some other friends to reach out but I'm not sure what else to do. He refuses any kind of therapy.

148,"Long story short: I spent all of my teens and early 20’s at home due to mental health (social anxiety, anxiety, depression), I haven’t had  any friends in real life since I was 16 in school. I’ve recently started a new job in March which has for the first time allowed me to have a routine and something to look forward to everyday and now due to the lockdown I am back to square one of being at home constantly. 

I can tell my line manager at work is getting annoyed (even though she doesn’t say) because of my lack of work I am doing. Everyone is supportive at work and they understand my difficulties, but I just feel so useless. 

I want to be able to sit at my desk at home and do work (I am in a marketing role so it’s quite creative to an extent) but I am lacking any motivation what so ever to do anything. 

I don’t associate being at home with anything other than being ill with mental health. It’s lack I am just getting paid to sit in bed all day and sleep and I hate it it’s so degrading.

153,"I'm a grown man in my 20s but I think I've been struggling with some sort of emotional baggage all my life. Looking back over the years I've definitely been able to help myself to an extent manage my emotional well-being and how I respond to situations. I work in Law and have a demanding job which I've learnt to handle very well, and I don't find myself phased by it. I've started to speak with a counsellor too but haven't really reached this topic yet in our sessions. 

I'm really embaressed with myself with how I handle certain situations. I'll explain the most recent scenario. I recently managed to get my hands on the camera I've wanted the past 4 years (photography enthusiast), was really happy and felt relieved as I had the opportunity to get hold of something I actually wanted and enjoy using. Then, one of the buttons break after just under a week of use. 

I was out on my walk when it happened and didn't let it bother me, but when I got home it eventually began to really bother me and I became very sullen and upset. It really effects me to the extent I lost all my energy, don't want to move, and my family notice it and I get very embaressed. I feel frustrated and my eyes water. I get thoughts like 'it always happens to me', 'typical', 'nothing good ever happens for me', 'it's not fair'. 

I feel really embaressed becuase I can handle other situations very well, and I've for the most part been a very patient and capable person. But through my life I've noticed that over small things like this, I get really effected. It's silly and it makes me feel worse becuase it's over something relatively trivial. I handle the situation really well at first and then I gradually begin to crumble and become a bit more emotionally stale.  My camera broke yesterday, and even though I have a solution to get a refund, I'm still feeling really upset I can't get a replacement (sale, second hand) and that even when I get my refund I won't be able to afford the actual camera body and I'm stuck with lenses. I really think there's something very wrong with me - I seriously feel upset about this, more than I should probably. Yes it'd frustrate anyone but I'm legit feeling like there's no energy left in me. 

I'm just venting more than anything or seeing if anyone has had similar experiences. I don't know what the issue could be, I seem to have some emotional problems, probably buried and needs to working with.",20May2020,1

157,"I’m the oldest sibling, and my younger siblings are Megan (14F) and Hannah (8F) [both fake names]. Hannah is what Megan and I believe to be a “budding psychopath” because of her behaviors. 

When she was born, everything seemed normal. My sister and I both loved the idea of having a little sister. Hannah was a normal cute baby with big blue eyes. Then around the time she started walking, tantrums started. For any and everything, she’d go into hysterics. I remember once she was screaming and crying while holding her hands up as if she wanted our mom to pick her up. When she did, she began crying louder as if she wanted to be put down. It was like nothing anyone did was right. 

When Hannah was around 4-5, whenever she’d get really mad at Megan and I, she would pee next to us, right there on the ground, sometimes peeing on objects. My parents would chalk it up to her being scared, but Megan and I knew she did it to piss us off. When she’d pee, she sometimes stare at us and smile while doing so, if not during, then afterwards. She would do it out of spite, and revel in the fact that we were made to clean it up for “scaring her”. 

When she was around 7, my siblings and I all went with our grandparents to their cabin. They lets us walk alone on path since they lived miles from anyone else. Megan and I wanted go alone, but our grandparents insisted we bring Hannah with us. As we are walking, Hannah grabs a big stick and begins charging at me and Megan while swinging it us, at one point I ducked it as she threw it straight at my head. The crazy thing is, it seemed like she only did it for fun. She was giggling and smiling as if it were a game, even though she could see how distressed Megan and I were. We continued walking and we saw an injured bird who’s wing seemed damaged walking on the trail. We all knelt down around it and Megan held in her hands and suggested we take it back to our grandparents and I agreed. But Hannah disagreed and said (paraphrased), “why would we do that? We should just kill it.” When I asked why she said “birds don’t live as long as humans. By the time we walk back, tell papa, and he drives it all the way into town to get it fixed, the damage will be worse and the bird will die. We might as well kill it right now so it won’t hurt anymore.” I could’ve believed this was the rationalization of a child to want to save a hurt animal, albeit twisted and abnormal, but when she said ‘we might as well kill right now’, her eyes lit up and those pearly blues had a certain eagerness/excitement to them. A chill ran through my body and every hair stood up. It was like she wanted only to kill the bird, and the rest was just a justification. When I turned to Megan, she had the same “wttff” expression as I did. We walked it back to our grandpa, he drove it in town, and they fixed it, gave it back to my grandparents to nurse back to healt, and it flew around their garden all the time for months. Megan and I never told them what Hannah said. 

Now, aged 8, Hannah knows how to get Megan and I in trouble almost effortlessly. She can get under our skin to the point where Megan (who’s an extreme pacifist) has tried to attack her; luckily I was there to stop her from striking. We’ve also heard our parents saying that she doesn’t get along with other kids at school and has gotten in trouble for “conduct issues” for the things she says or does to her peers. My parents are turning out to be the scapegoat parents who make excuses instead of opening their eyes. They believe Hannah’s home behaviors are “normal siblings behaviors” even though me and Megan can assure you that they are NOT normal at all. They also believe her school behaviors are because “she’s more mature than other students, so they don’t always understand what she’s doing.” WTFFF!???!!? How can we help her? Should we get other extended family members  on our side? Tell teachers at our school? Will that even help?

I damaged my liver slightly at the start of the year from taking a staggered overdose of paracetamol and I went to a&amp;e after being convinced by a friend.  It wasn’t a suicide attempt just a stupid form of self harm and I didn’t do it again for about a month.  Then I was doing it on and off, the last time being just 8 yesterday which I tried to throw up after realising how stupid it was.  I’m scared I’ve done serious damage since I’ve had mild pain that’s mainly uncomfortable that comes and goes ever since.  The other day it was hurting but I hadn’t taken any in about a month I’d say.  

What do I do? I’m scared of going to a&amp;e again, I’ve told my mother the last time was over a month ago but not about yesterday.  When I threw up it was probably half an hour later and my food from the day and possibly crumbs of paracetamol came up so idk if that’s any help but it’s been uncomfortable again today.  I was sick but I had an energy drink and I don’t usually have those / caffeine and a bunch of anxiety so I don’t know what that was about.  

I’m freaking out.  I don’t know why, I knew it was stupid but it’s probably because I could do serious damage makes it real.  I’m too scared say I took any yesterday because I did just take 8 and I did throw up soon after and I hadn’t in a while before then.  Is there anything I can to help my liver?

160,"Hey there. I need your help. 
One of my internet friend (UK) that I've known for several years now is having a real hard time but it has gotten so bad that he is in full denial. 

When I first 'met' him (online), he was that really depressed guy with some trouble but he was still kind of connected to reality. Then it got a bit funky with the time and I noticed that he was suffering from strong paranoia, believing that people were following him in the streets... until today. Today it's a complete mess, he's paranoid and imagines himself being linked to some government secret operation and that he was chosen to spread the covid-19 and is overthinking numbers everywhere, saying that everybody is plotting against him. Sometimes he can get super angry, some fits of rage and threatens to attack people (especially random people outside, cars being too noisy 'to intimidate him' etc). 

Few weeks ago he managed to finally see a therapist, and got a prescription to start taking care of his paranoia bipolar borderline disorders, but he read the notice and got scared by the undesirable effects. Then it evolved quickly since the beginning of the pandemic and now he believes that the treatment is to make him shut up about that whole conspiracy against him and refuses to take it. 
He is currently living with his family who thinks he is taking his meds because he lied to them (at this point i have no idea how they cannot notice how bad he is feeling inside) and doesn't want to go back at his own place because he thinks he is being poisoned there and that his neighbors are also plotting against him. 

With few other friends we tried to discuss with him and show him that his conspiracy theories against himself are all produced by his brain but he won't listen and it is only getting worse and worse.

163,"Hi good day to all. I really do not know where to begin but this is my first ever post, specifically created a post just to vent. so yeah if anyone sees it or not its alright, at least this is a journal for me to talk things.

Background story, I am a guy suffering from this condition: Keratosis pilaris (KP). Based on google images, I can safely say I am one of the most worst cases (rate 8-9/10 i guess haha). KP is this tiny red dots manifesting all over my forearms, arms, a little on the legs and in my buttocks. This condition has no cure, with little to no clinical trials done, and is extremely stubborn to treat. I seriously hate this, like I am really low self-esteem in this. Though, I never got bullied or ostracized for such a condition. In fact, I interact rather well with my friends and even work out pretty often.

Now you must be wondering: If I am never bullied, and seems to be having a relatively ""pleasant"" life, why would I still struggle with self-esteem issues? I think the root of the answer is how I anticipate people will perceive me, when they see the redness and bumps on my skin, especially my **forearms, upper arms and my back**. The arms are the most visible area when I wear a T-shirt. I always have ""weird"" postures of my limbs especially when under a bright white light, as the redness and bumps are **extremely red and apparent**. It makes me really question myself: Why am I struggling to show my forearm/arms, when almost all people whom I've met are never ever bothered by such problems. I literally turned down every opportunity to my friend's invitation to swim or any activities that involve taking off my shirt. I absolutely hate this - the fact that I could not have fun and enjoy like most of other friends do. 

On the other hand, most people in the gym are proudly showing off their guns in tank tops/sleeveless-tee, and I know that I will never have such an opportunity to ever be proud of my biceps covered full of red dots, no matter how hard/lean I train.

I had searched for countless therapeutic treatments online, and all have never once made a significant difference for me. I even consulted several dermatologist, who also provided therapeutic treatments that did not offer significant effects. 

I really feel absolutely crushed and hopeless, knowing that I almost will never get out of this world full of skin rashes. I never knew whats it's like to wear a sleeveless-tee for a minor trip of shopping or chilling with friends, and I probably never will. This waves of hopelessness just keeps coming, and I pray to God (am a spiritual person :P) that I can finally see light at the end of this tunnel.

171,"Hey!
If you're reading this i first of all wanna say thank u 👌🏻 I've had this particular issue for a while now and basically wanted to see if it was a common thing.
For a bit of background, around 5 years ago i suffered with body dysmorphia which then led into me occassionally stress pulling out my eyelashes. Recovered from the ED now and pretty much stopped the eyelash thing but essentially since these issues began i don't feel as if i have had the time to figure out who I am.
Basically i will go on to instagram or see a person and be like 'omg i love their aesthetic' and then i will buy clothes to match that, decorate in a way i think represents this etc, but then someone else will come along who is totally different and i'll swap and change to whatever their aesthetic is. So for example i find someone who dresses in the korean street style, watches anime - i will do the same. Then i will see someone who is into rock music and dresses alternatively, and i will then change to that.
It sounds so ridiculous when i write it out, none of these things affect my personality (i always behave the same way) and i do enjoy rock music, anime etc but i feel like because i've been on IG so long and seen people who have very specific aesthetics, i feel like i need to dedicate my entire being in one direction if that makes sense? I am getting better with it and i'm very aware i'm doing it as well, i seem to be able to recognise and stop it quicker these days but i will fall into the same trap a few days later.
The only other thing i can think of is that i have spent so long feeling as if i am not good enough that i haven't allowed myself time to figure out who i am so i latch on to other peoples images. 
I have unfollowed the people on IG who i feel trigger me as well so hoping that helps.
I have written this as honestly as i can so hopefully someone can identify or at least pass on some wisdom because try as i might this keeps happening and its getting super frustrating. Feel free to ask any questions.
Stay safe dudes! ✌🏻😊🧡",20May2020,1

173,"So I was doing some introspection the other day and I realized that the way I acted and behaved when I was around 8 years old could be indicative of serious mental issues (I've never been diagnosed with anything so there's no way of knowing what I actually had) but I thought I'd share this on here to try and figure out maybe what my issues were. In case anyone asks, both my parents and my school seemed to either not to notice, not to care, or they thought I was just weird and avoided the subject. As an 8-year-old I was too ashamed to ask for help and honestly I didn't know I needed it in the first place, but adult me is seeing some big red flags. That said, here's what I was like at that age:

* When going to bed, there was a certain thing that my mom would have to say to me before I would sleep. It was like a scripted thing where she'd say ""goodnight OP"" and I'd respond with ""goodnight mom,"" and then she'd have to say something like ""I love you OP"" and I'd have to follow with ""I love you m-o-m"" (I'd have to spell it instead of say the word) and so on. It was around 30 seconds long and every word and gesture had to be replicated exactly or else I would throw a fit until my mom repeated that part of the ritual the correct way. Only she could do it. If my dad tucked me in that night or if there was a babysitter, they weren't supposed to do it. So I was fine if it wasn't done, but if she tucked me in, she'd have to do it.

* I had several comfort objects. I had a small blanket that I would refuse to sleep without and I had a small stuffed toy that I needed to be kept under my pillow every night. If those things weren't there, I would freak out and I wouldn't sleep until they were found and placed there. Replacement items wouldn't work.

Before I continue, in case you're wondering what my parents' reactions were to these requirements, my mom would laugh and tell me I'm being silly, and my dad would make fun of me. He'd change his voice so he sounded like a little toddler and say things like ""I need my...widdle blanky...goo goo."" My sister would just smirk and go along with whatever my parents said.

* Because of how my parents (and sister) treated me about stuff like this, I was very prone to tantrums. They would say stuff about my quirks that would set me off and I'd yell and scream and cry for hours, and I'd talk about how I hate everyone and say really awful things, and then I'd talk about how I didn't need those things anymore but then I'd throw an even bigger fit because I realized I did and I thought I was pathetic. I cried myself to sleep a lot as a child.

* Now let's talk about school. I cried a lot in school too but it wasn't tantrums. If I realized I forgot something I was supposed to bring, I'd break down and cry. I was extremely afraid of getting in trouble. If I was scolded at school I'd be inconsolable because of how much I'd cry and withdraw into myself. One time I forgot a pencil and I was too afraid to admit that I didn't have one so I just sharpened a grey crayon so it was really pointy and I tried doing my work with it because I thought nobody would notice, but I realized how different it looked from writing in pencil so I sat there crying until a teacher gave me a pencil.

* I ate lots of stuff that wasn't food. I wouldn't just chew on my eraser, I'd eat it and swallow it. I did the same with crayons. Eventually it got really bad and I moved on to pencils (as in I'd chew and swallow the wood and the graphite, but I'd spit out the metal after I'd tear it off the pencil with my teeth). My teacher would see me doing this and just give me this death glare, like ""how dare you?""

* I let work pile up like crazy. Every student had a folder of unfinished work that they kept in a bookcase in the classroom. Everyone's folder was slim with 2 or 3 things in it but mine was overflowing with dozens of papers in it.

* I had zero attention span. I would often get in trouble for not following directions because my brain would wander and I'd daydream. I'd do things incorrectly and when called out on it I'd start to cry because I thought the teacher was holding out on telling me how to do something, but really I just wasn't paying attention.

* I had a very inflated sense of ego. Despite all the stuff above, I was fairly intelligent as a kid, and this included reading extremely well. I would sometimes boast that I was a genius and needed to skip a grade, and I would tell my parents about how everyone else in my class was stupid. Yeah, I was a dick. Really I just read a shit-ton of Magic School Bus and regurgitated the info.

Most of these behaviors disappeared after second grade, but for some reason during that one year all this stuff was really strong. The only behavior that lasted beyond second grade were the bedtime rituals and objects, everything else went back to normal. The bedtime stuff went away about a year after that.

Does anyone think they know what was wrong with me? You'd probably think OCD, but like I said, after a while I just stopped doing these things abruptly with no therapy or anything, but I was the only person in my class who was like this. I was thinking maybe obsessive behaviors set off from some kind of anxiety, but I'm not a psychologist so I'm unsure.",20May2020,1

175,"So I used to be very big on internet arguments but now I have changed a lot as I have now grown up and whenever I see an internet argument happening I now say ""This isn't my fight.""

I still post things on reddit that of course are bound to have people hate on it but I'm just glad that I keep myself away from them.",20May2020,1
176,"I'm 23 years old and live with my grandparents and my sister. She is 16 and has always struggled with academics. We have always given her the benefit of the doubt and even put her in lower loaded courses to help her catch up. She's now a freshman in high school and we were all very proud when she performed very well in her first two trimesters (3 semester system). She was even in the ""normal"" classes! 

Unfortunately this didn't last, quarantine hit and the schools began online course work. She did her school work for the first week and then didn't do ANYTHING. Grades were reported and there was a conversation where she said she wasn't motivated (No reason was given as to why) and then ended with us agreeing that I would help her stay on track. This mostly included scheduling her school work and ""assigning due dates"". These were typically before the actual due date and spread throughout the week as to help her stay on task and not overwhelm her with assignments. This. Worked. Wonders. She was doing well again and she was all caught up with late work! I even noticed that she was performing this well without any non-organizational help! I told her what needed to be done and she crushed it! I told her she was doing well and that I would be stopping moderating her. I showed her how to check her due dates online and what not and I genuinely thought she was in a good place to moderate herself. Turns out I was wrong. Her final grades came in and she failed 3 of her 4 classes. She wasn't turning in her assignments! I knew something was wrong but I just didn't know what, it's possible that I STILL do not know.   


Yesterday I sat down with my grandparents and discussed a punishment of sorts for her failing this many classes. I suggested that we take away her electronics or possibly limit her usage of them. I believed this would be effective as she spends most of her time in her room watching YouTube, TV, and playing on her phone / other devices. It was then that they told me that they found out she's been engaging in self-harm. This obviously pushes her punishment on the backburner of my priority list but I have no idea how to proceed. Do we take her to a doctor? A therapist? Do we just spend more time with her and see if she opens up?   


I'm fucking clueless. I had no idea this was happening. I feel like a shitty brother for not knowing what she was doing but I did exactly what she did when I was in high school (Didn't turn in assignments and spent a lot of time on electronics) but I never self-harmed / was depressed! I just didn't know.   


I'm a 23 year old with no kids or experience taking care of another human. How can I educate myself on self-harm / mental health and provide her with the best support?

A few months ago I was diagnosed with severe depression and I started on meds about one month ago. I disclosed this to my boss around the time everything happened. I just had a discussion with my employer who informed me that I was under-performing and must now be put on an improvement plan (probation). Do I have any protections in this situation?

I am employed by a UK-based charity, if that matters.

192,"hello,


i have schizoaffective disorder and an avoidant personality disorder. I don't really know what to do anymore and thought maybe someone here can give me advice. I've always been the quiet one as long as I remember. I am always afraid of other people. I am still not sure if I am really afraid of other peoples negative judgement or if it something else and i maybe am just not compatible with people.

I also had manic phases, but even then I was kinda afraid. I was talking very loud and had lost of self-esteem etc, but even then I did not go out, when school was over. This leads me to believe, that my character is just flawed and even if my chronic depression was cured, I would still not be content with myself.

I've tried accepting, that I just can't connect to people, because I don't know what to say and am always kind of inhibited.

I don't know what do anymore. My job is boring, but I don't think I am capable of anything else than I do now (Customer service basically, but without any direct contact to customers). I live for two years in this city where I work and I have literally zero friends here. What I do after work is lay in bed the rest of the day and just watch some youtube. I think I have degenerated mentally over time. I can't really learn anything much nor have any drive to do so.

I've had three long-term talking therapies, tried 15+ different medications and was in a mental hospital three times. Nothing really helped me. I am from Germany. Now my main question besides venting is, is there anything more I can do? I read about ketamine treatment, but I don't know if my psych would prescribe it to me since i've also had psychosis an mania. I've already had CBASP in a hospital, but it didn't do much in the long run. There's ect, it could maybe make the depression better, but there's still the problem with my bad character flaws., which I can't seem to fix nor accept. There's deep-brain implants, but I don't know if I am maybe too young for that, I am around 30. And then there's the easy way out ofc, which I do think about all the time, but I will not do it, though if I am not better in ~ the next ten years I will.

Maybe someone of you has an idea for me.

I think, that a good psychotherapy May be better to adressing the root cause than medication/ect, what do you think?

Other people often say, when they were able to live their lives again form the beginning, they would do things very differently. I've often thought about this and I always get the feeling, that no matter how often I could re-live my life, with this character flaw, that I have, I would always end up in the same hole I am in right now.

She has been told she is ugly and fat and she is not. I do not know what to do now I have told both her parents and she is at her dads house due to split custody every week and she would like to be at her moms more I think. I asked her if she is having any bad thoughts today and she said Eh and that scares me. I do not want anything to happen to her. I trust her and she has never given me any reason not to trust her. I feel as if someone is set on killing them selves they would not care to lie to someone due to not having to see how it affects others. I am scared and kind of just empty? I do not know I just am upset. I need help. I know most people will say call police and stuff but law in her situation would just make things worse I feel with the custody thing because her parents hate each other more her dad hates her mom for kicking him out after abusing her.

My senses feel 10x more heightened than everyone else. Everything makes me want to cry, scream, and tear my hair out. the sound of walking, breathing, bags, chewing, tapping, clicking, My clothes feel very uncomfortable on my body, i can only eat 2 things because textures are way to much to handle, same with smells. everywhere I go I have to listen to music with the volume all the way up so I dont hear anything, or if people get to close to me i explode. 

Everything makes me angry and uncomfortable, And when I tell my family they un porpoly breath in my face and laugh at me. I cant take it. 

I know this sounds exetreme but it makes me want to die, Everything is to much to handle, i cant take it anymore. and nobody will listen to me about it.

That led to me not going to classes (I’m in college) and isolating from friends and family because it was easier to deal with stuff when I was alone. I have ups and downs but downs are bocoming longer and ups shorter. 
The reason why I’m writing this is because in the past few months I started having thoughts how it would be easier to just end it all. I haven’t made any plans yet and I dont think I could do it but that thought gives me some sort of peace in the worst times. I have never talked to anyone about this and I dont know if I could.

205,"This might be a strange question. 

The only options seem to be a therapist/psychiatrist (which seem to be for mood/emotional/mental health issues), or a Life Coach (which seems more for losing weight or motivational support to achieve specific things in life). But what I'm talking about is someone who will spend a significant amount of time with you for a few weeks, and completely learn your life and circumstances and needs and then be extremely involved in the execution of fixes. 

It appears to me from frequenting this subreddit and many other mental health resources, that some people (me included) are just struggling in ways that a 1 hour a week therapy sessions or a life coach just won't be able to fix. I'm wondering if there's any other options?

I 100% agree that each person has to take responsibility for their own life and be the one doing the fixing, nor do I believe that God or the Flex Tape guy should come solve all your problems while you sit on the couch. But given how complicated modern life can be, and sometimes you end up in a twisted web that just gets worse and worse, that some people simply cannot make it work despite putting in the effort.",20May2020,1
206,"Disclaimer: please proceed with caution! This topic can be extremely triggering.

Hi everyone, this is my first post. Something traumatic happened last night and I could have taken my life. I’ve actually attempted OD before in 2015, however I don’t remember much.

Last night, I got a sudden rush of sadness in the shower. This is normal for me though, so I didn’t think much of it. I got dressed and I proceeded with my night. An hour later, I began to feel extremely alone, like I truly had no one. I started to cry. And cry more. And then I stared at my wrist for a solid minute. 

*I consider myself pretty emotionally intelligent and ever since my last attempt, I’ve become better with my tendencies. 

I then couldn’t stop picturing a blade to my arms and I knew that I couldn’t do that so I got out my eyeliner and drew lines on my arm just to trick my brain. I felt a little better for the moment, however, I think that just caused an even bigger trigger. I then stared at my backpack which had my pills in it 

*I had to go to the hospital for a heart problem this fall and I still have a full bottle left for pain

Suddenly, I just wanted to hold them in my hands. I didn’t think I was going to do anything. I poured all 100 tablets into my hands and I just stared at them. They were small and white and very pretty to me at the time. I began to cradle them.. I started to cry even harder. I put them so close to my face, it was at this moment that I truly did not know whether I was going to take them or not. I’ve had suicidal tendencies before, but in the back of my head I knew I couldn’t do it again, but this time was different. There was nothing in the back of my head. I haven’t questioned a suicidal ideation the way I did last night since 2015. It’s been five years. 
I blocked out a lot of what happened, but I put the pills away. I then texted my friend because I didn’t know what I was capable of that night anymore but I could barely type. I was crying so hard, my hands were shaking, my body was shaking, everything was horrible. After a few minutes though, I just had to hold them again, so I poured the pills back into my hand and held them and started crying. Nothing was going on in my head. But the words started coming out of my mouth with no thought process.
Crying hysterically, I whispered 
“I’m just going to hold you. I’m just going to hold you. I just want to hold you. I just want to hold you.”  
“You’re so pretty you’re so pretty you are so pretty in my hands” 
“You won’t hurt me right you won’t hurt me you won’t hurt me” 
“I will protect you I will protect you I will hold you until you fall asleep and I won’t let *insert name of friend* hurt you” 

And I repeated all of these again and again. It was at this point my brain just turned off. My body was moving on its own and my brain completely switched. I tried putting the pills back but I couldn’t. I felt so bad for them and I kept them in my hands for longer. 
The only thing that got me to put the pills back was when I heard my parent get up to use the bathroom and I quickly rushed them inside the bottle and I said it’s okay it’s okay I’ll be back. And I closed the lid. I waited for my parent to go back to their room and I am STILL crying and my brain suddenly said they can’t breathe so I grabbed a pair of scissors and I tried jabbing the lid as hard as I can until I got a hole for the pills to breathe. I was about to put them back in my backpack but then I was like no they’ll be miserable in there so I put them on my table. 
Remember, at this point I had no conscious. I stopped crying. I got up and I felt light. I walked to put back my scissors and a sudden thought was like PUT AWAY THE SCISSORS but my brain, now running on its own motor function, didn’t. My hands moved on it’s own and I put the scissors on my chest. I knew I was going to do it though, I just wanted to feel it. I did this a couple of times but I finally put it away. 

I needed to use the bathroom but the entire time I was walking on my tippy toes, almost dancing gracefully to the bathroom. I did this all the way back to my bedroom where I got ready for bed. I climbed into bed and I couldn’t feel 3/4 of my body. My legs were frozen and the only thing I could move was my head and my arms. I then texted my friend I was okay. But I suddenly felt like I wasn’t in my body. Like I was astro projecting. I didn’t feel anything. I couldn’t feel the temperature and all I could do was lie perfectly still and look around my room. Then the walls started closing on me, I could actually SEE the walls coming in. I started panicking and cried again. I felt delusional guys. I was talking to my pills. I was dancing. I saw my room getting smaller.

I told my friend, I think this was my brain’s defense mechanism. I told her I was gonna research it today, but I couldn’t find anything specific to this. Maybe I just suck at finding things.
I feel better now and I feel normal. I don’t remember a lot of last nigh, again defense mechanism I think. However, I’ve never talked to my pills before.. I’ve never tippy toed danced before.. I’ve never seen my walls closing in on me. I truly felt delusional.
Please tell me what happened last night. Are there any articles or research on this? Please let me know guys. Thank you for reading this long essay.",20May2020,1

211,"Hi Guys, 

first time posting here and not sure how to express myself really but here it goes. 

Since my wife has entered the maternity leave I believe her mental health has gone worst week by week and since we had the baby last year its pretty much a mine filed now and anything can trigger her to lash out and I get sometimes frustrated and literally dont know what to do.  
According to her I am the one that is always making the mistakes and small things become like a big deal now and when i am tell her that this is getting out of hand she threatens to either leave me or it just gets really horrible and she isolates herself away from me and if i come anywhere near her she pretty much freaks out. 

Today for example.   
The day started off well. we had breakfast, fed the little one. And I got ready to work from home. My wife decided to tidy up the flat but and re-organising the flat (bare in mind we live in a tiny flat in london, so it can collate clutter quite easily.) When it came to dusting and moving away some trays which i didnt agree with and i told her to be careful as they are valuable, it literally triggered her and she got so mad that she decided to smoke (which she doesnt do, or hasnt done for years) and continued to threaten why she lives with me and that she should have left ages ago and continued to insult me which made me feel worthless. When i tried to get closer to her, she literally raised her voice by telling me not to come any closer and not to touch her. So i decided to take the little one out of the house for a few hours to calm the situation. When I returned she would still not talk to me. She did apologise (which recently she has done more often when she lashes out) but there is still a very bad tension in the room and she is isolating her self again, by either going to a dark bedroom or watching TV all day. 

When i try to talk to her she either refuses to talk to me or just gives me abrupt and short answers.   
And its very hard for me to stay quite all the time and let be ignored pretty much. 

i am sure this whole corona isolation has added some more stress to it too and being in the same room 24/7 surly doesnt help either. 

So yeah, I could probably continue talking about this for another hour or so. But the bottom line is, I am stuck and I dont know what to do anymore and I am looking for advise.

Thanks",20May2020,1

216,"I have a friend(24), we'll call him Joe, that is struggling with delusions and mental health and I'm trying to figure out the best way to help him. The problems that are at hand currently involve the idea that I, his best friend who has lived with him for nearly half of 15 years of friendship was abusing him throughout the years and causing traumatic damage to his head causing him to forget things that I didn't want him to remember. He believes that if I were in the same room with him that I would attack him. He also thinks that his parents played a role and are hiding things from him and doesn't trust them. Not long ago he has written collegiate papers about how his mother was his biggest role model and about how strong their relationship was and how it motivated him in life. He has always had a strong family support system, myself included, and was never physically or emotionally abused in any of the extensive time i have spent in his home and life. The problem has shown signs for several months but the severity of the situation has just now been brought into the light. Several months ago he seems to have created an idea that he and another close friend of ours, we'll call her Lucy, had potentially hooked up or kissed at a party at which he says I was in attendance. He started asking vague questions about something happening between them that I may have remembered because he couldn't remember the details. These questions didn't seem to unusual as we often spent a lot of nights together drinking in excess and I didn't doubt the idea of something potentially happening between them. The strange thing was that after I told him that I didn't know what he was talking about he began to create the suspicion that I did know something and was withholding information in order to steal Lucy from him. (She has been a long time friend in our group and at points many of our guy friends have had feelings for her) He has sometimes been possessive of her in the past even though she has always viewed him as only a friend and often felt as though he deserved a chance with her because he had been friends with her the longest and was often the reason she was introduced to many of the guys, often times within our friend group, that she would talk to in a more intimate manner. The idea of him having had a drunken moment with her that he forgot and that we were withholding for him seemed strange but we (his friends and family) didn't do very much about it because he would often approach us about it very sparingly and without much detail. However, he did mention earlier in the year that he wanted to try and find help about his thoughts. He was able to get in touch with a doctor but with the quarantine beginning he never got the opportunity to meet with a psychiatrist. Things seemed to be relatively normal between us when we would occasionally meet up but sometimes late at night the questions would return about this situation. About a month ago he finally built up the courage to ask 'Lucy' about the situation and asked if there was any way that she felt the same way about him and why they were not together. She responded by telling him that she always viewed him as strictly a friend and even as a brother. He took this poorly and told her that he felt that their relationship made him feel ""gross and used"" which was saddening because they have been friends for almost 15 years and he has made remarks saying that he threw away 15 years of time. Lucy told other members of our friend group what had happened and it made us realize that he was still chasing the idea of this scenario he created where we somehow interfered with his relationship. This is where things took a serious turn, he then began locking himself in his room and discontinued communication with almost everyone in his life. I figured he was hurt by the rejection of this girl that he had had strong feelings for for a long time so I didn't think it was bad for him to spend some time to recover. I still tried reaching out to him a lot but only via text and we sometimes played some video games but all of a sudden everything ended. After spending many days alone in his room, refusing to even talk to his parents, many of his friends and family became very concerned and tried reaching out to him even more. He seemed to be aggravated by the idea that people were only texting instead of going and visiting him but the limitations of social distancing were preventing any normal hang outs with anyone. Eventually things got so bad that his friend that lives next door was tired of him not answering any texts asking to do anything that he went over and confronted him. After talking for about three hours his neighbor called me on the phone in tears telling me about some delusional things he had heard from 'Joe'. He said that he believed he had been abused over the years by his whole family and by Me throughout our childhood. The claims made against me were very concerning because 'Joe' is my best friend and I actually moved out of my own home to live with him for the majority of high school and some years afterward, and before that i used to spend almost the entire summers of 6-8th grade at his house and go on frequent weekend ski trips on winter weekends. I regard 'Joe' as my brother and his family as a one that I am a part of. This idea that I had caused him trauma in the past made no sense to me so I wanted to seek more information by trying to talk with 'Joe' about how he could make these claims. The shock factor that accompanied this news made me very concerned and I tried to get 'Joe' to meet with me and our friends (the neighbors) but he said that he still needed to ""figure out what had happened and that he would remember more by smoking weed and that it gave him more clarity' he also mentioned that he had stopped taking his adderall, to which he had been prescribed for three years, because he thought that the adderall was being used as a method of deleting his memories in order to keep him from remembering trauma. A group of three of us (myself and the sibling neighbors) went to his house and tried to get him to come out but when he saw me sitting at the bottom of the stairs he ran into his room and locked the door. This brought about a lot of crying for everyone and we became very scared of how things were going to turn out. His parents didn't know the severity of the situation until this point when they found out about the delusions and are trying their best to do whats right for him but i'm concerned by their lack of understanding in mental health issues and their previous claims that he ""needed to snap out of his weird behavior"" and sometimes setting dates as an ultimatum for him to improve his actions. He has an apartment about an hour away from his home and after convincing his parents that he was going there to get a doctors phone number that he had previously gotten in seek of help he left on his own to stay there. He told his parents that one of his roommates was also going to be with him but that turned out to be a lie and I think that spending more time alone and creating more delusions is only going to make things worse. I think that some of this behavior is made worse through his smoking of marijuana that has gotten much more frequent as these behaviors have gotten more intense. They have made an appointment for him to see a psychiatrist tomorrow morning and he says that he will go but i'm concerned about what the next steps should be for him, god forbid he skips the appointment. I've tried to connect as many people as I can to create support for him but it has created more mistrust for me and he has told some people that they should not be trusting me or his parents because we are the problem. I'm having a hard time accepting that maybe i need to step back a little from the situation because he has been my best friend for most of my life and I am so deeply imbedded in his family relations and almost all of our social circles overlap. 

I'm hoping someone can offer some advice as to what I should be doing right now to help and also what to do if he is not being honest in his pursuit of help through psychiatry. I don't want to create more mistrust by being the one who sends others to talk to him but i can't sit idly by and let my best friends mental health deteriorate any further.",20May2020,1
217,"I’ve [16M] been really angry for seemingly no reason the past few weeks. The other day I lost my shit at an online friend [15F]  for no reason, and I feel awful for it. I have no idea where that came from, I’m normally a fairly calm and compassionate person and I always try to do what’s right. I apologised to her a bunch of times and she seems to have forgiven me, but I still feel awful. I’ve been trying to help this friend of mine with her mental health for the past few months, but I’ve gone through a lot of trauma in the past as well and it taken its toll on me. I care about her so much and it hurts to see her in pain, especially this time where it was my fault. I promised I’d always be there for her, and I feel like I’ve let her down. 

After some reflection, I think that deep down, I’m just absolutely terrified and have been using anger to hide that. My life hasn’t been great, I’ve gone through a lot of traumatic stuff, but for a while, I was actually happy, and was turning a new leaf. But then, in the last few months I’ve been through hell, time after time, without any time to recover. I recently started cutting again for the first time in years and I had to turn to alcohol to calm myself down when I had a panic attack the other day. The only good thing in my life is my friends. I love them so much and I honestly would’ve killed myself if it wasn’t for them. 

I’ve been so angry lately but I’m scared more than anything. 

I’m scared of losing my friends, they are the only good thing in my life and I couldn’t live without them. I’ve lost friends before and I’ve lost family members, everyone that I’ve ever cared about seems to either die or leave me. But now, I finally feel like I belong somewhere for the first time in my life, and the thought of losing that terrifies me. 

I’m scared of getting sick again and ending up in another coma.

I’m scared that I might never have a girlfriend or boyfriend, and that has made me irrationally mad at people in relationships lately. I just wish that when I woke up in the middle of the night, sad and afraid, like I am while typing this, that I had someone to hold me and tell that everything would be alright. 

Most of all, I’m scared that I’m too broken to keep going anymore. There is nothing in this world more terrifying than having to watch yourself turn into someone you hate. Watching yourself become so twisted by anger, regret and fear that you become a mockery of everything you once stood for. I’ve gone through this once in the past, and I barely managed to pull myself out of it. I was happy for a while, and then my world fell apart again. I can’t go through this again, I’m not sure what to do",20May2020,1

It annoys me how I can see the scene, feel it, but have that invisible wall between me and it. I don't exactly feel numb, I just feel like a puff of air, a breath. I feel like I'm easy to accept different opinions and that I have no center. Reality seems like a river to me: always flowing, always changing. I can put my hand in it. but the water runs through my fingers. I'm taking a class so I can become a CNA. I can see it being my career, but I'm only content with it. I don't feel like I have veins connecting me to this world, I feel like a cloud moving close to the ground.

So...
Today , my private math teacher called my dad because i copied on one of my tests. I got really really scared because I thought my dad would yell at me. (My parents are divorced, and this week I am staying at my dad's place). Now don't get me wrong, He is a caring and womderfull dad. A couple months ago he bought and asambled for me a very expensive pc, and bought a complete setup for me.He only gets mad when I do things like this in school or on my online private class. So, back to the story. I got really really scared when he talked with my teacher. I got so scared, I started staring at the furniture in our kitchen. I've been staring at it for so long, not moving my eyes, that I started seeing things like there was a fog. I had been staring for 32 minutes, while he was talking to my teacher. After 32 minutes, he hung up. I got so scared I started praying that he wouldn't ground or yell at me. After the call, he called one of his friends. After the second call, he wasn't mad at all. He talked kindly to me and everything was ok. I think I might have depersonalization disorder or something because I do this preety often.

For a little background of my life (maybe this will help), I grew up in a very broken home. My mom and dad would always fight in front of me. I would always try to protect my siblings from being in the middle of arguments. Those arguments my mom and dad had, are one of the only things I remember from my childhood. My mom and dad split when I was around 8 and I have been living with my mom and siblings for 10 years now without a dad. My dad visited around 4–5 years ago and we went to the cemetery to say hello to a deceased family member. I don’t have good memories of my dad, so I hardly speak to him. While we were in the cemetery, he told me about things we would do when I was little, like visit cows and horses on the farm he worked at, but I don’t remember that. I keep telling him I didn’t remember and he was probably lying. He yelled at me and my mom saw and yelled back at him. I ran to the car and sat by the tire. I feel like many of the problems that happened were because of me.

I don’t know if a backstory would be helpful, but I put one just in case.

Thank you and sorry for the long post. I hope someone will help me. I don’t want to make things worse with my mom and siblings because of my forgetfulness keeps us from coming to a conclusion. I don’t know of much arguments, but they always tell me when I try to talk to them after an argument.",20May2020,1
224,"I need help surveying a bunch of different ""labeled"" individuals with disorders, disabilities, was a former inmate, homeless and addicts to help with my non profit work. I am creating a non profit. I am purposely building it to create a self run and worked business with only using the ""unhireable"" or however you want to call this huge society of ""Labeled"" individuals.. these people shouldnt have to struggle even more. And why do we sculpt the job for a human instead of allowing the human To sculpt themselves and allow the employer to evaluate all the skills they hold rather than only the ones they want with the other half they have to teach..? This is insane. And time/talent wasting. More people can make more money on the individual talents and inavasions one can bring than hiring roles to be filled. Why is there a negative perspective with the word ""disabled"" the definition is stupid as well.. if you dont have one of your senses for example, wouldnt that make someone have 4 super senses? I hear autistic individuals speak about not being listened to or the other side of the spectrum and being not accepted. Our whole society is based on others perspectives what is good or bad, what others believe what is right or wrong... I believe depression and suicide has a lot to do with unaccepting people and disconnection with society.  I believe we all play a part in subconsciously accepting these behaviors and not realizing what we are actually influencing in others lives. Why do the patients feel limited as well as the employers feel u are limited when learning of a diagnosis? Why are all diagnoses bad? Why is it that these labels have to be someone's identity? Why do we stereotype these and judge? I am trying to make sure my business can handle much of these issues along with tweaking as I franchise out to other states to create this business for others around the world to balance whatever they need in each of their communities.

225,"So my partner suffers from mental health issues that can leave her extremely stressed and agitated at times. Sometimes me trying to talk to her and cheer her up ends up making things worst.

We're trying to work out a system where she can signal to me what mood she is in without having to actually tell me as she finds this hard sometimes.

We were hoping there would be some sort of app to help where she could press a button on her phone and I'd get a notification on mine telling me what mood she was in. Ideally we wanted a traffic light sort of system where green means she is okay, orange means she is stressed or upset but I can try and cheer her up while red means I should leave her alone and give her some time to herself. Unfortunately we couldn't find any app similar to this.

He diagnosed me with disthymic disorder and I've been on buproprion ever since. Well, come today I'm in the process of submitting documents for the Air force HPSP and fill out the medical form, I'd figure I'd be honest about my mental health and my improvements on it.

235,"Title really says it, but I'm freaking out... again.

Lockdown has had me feeling quite good, if I'm honest. It's a lot of time to be creative without the stress of exams of school. So I had a meeting with CAHMS to... I don't know, assess my mental health in general? But seeing as school exasperated my problems, the meeting was just me trying to remember how I feel when I feel bad (considering I struggle remembering anything that isn't happening... now); and appearing happy.

And I found out that I've been turned away from any further CAHMS treatment. I felt fine with this, but in the past three days, my mental health has quickly plummeted to the worst it's ever been.

I can't sleep; I can't remember what it feels like to not see yourself as an outsider; I can't remember *anything*; I don't feel inspired and I have art block/writer's block; and for a few minutes two days ago I lost it.

I was feeling awful already and then I just lost it. The gender dysphoria and feelings just got too much. I, thankfully alone, started flapping my hands until they hurt, hitting and biting myself, screaming without any noise, just grinning. I kept having horrible thoughts of pulling my eyes out and headbutting the mirror, and my mind was unhinged. I couldn't think straight at all. I can't explain it, but I just feel like I went insane for half an hour. Like really, truly, I wasn't coherent in any way, and words can't explain how bad it was.

And then I just stopped. I just made myself stop feeling like that. I don't know whether I'm pretending, or what, but I just decided not to feel and pushed the feelings away.

I vent to my friends, but I feel like I'm a burden. None of them know what to say to me, and as much as I love wholesome memes, they don't help. I'm scared to talk to my parents because whenever I do, it's 'come out of nowhere' and I can't explain to them how ill I feel. I'm too nervous to contact online services, and everything seems to lead back to nothing.

I'm at that point where I need someone to intervene, but no one will. I've never learnt how to cope with my feelings and I think 5 years of declining mental health is starting to come out all at once. I'm too scared to do anything, and it's just getting worse by the day",20May2020,1

243,"Hi, I am brand new to Reddit, so I'm sorry if the formatting is strange (I don't know how flairs work, etc). But I thought I'd share some recent experiences. Apologies in advance for the obnoxious length.

**Some relevant background information:** 

* Late twenties, female. 
* Spent the last several years living a relatively sedentary lifestyle due to university, only the usual things like walking my dog and the occasional inspired jog or rushing across campus, etc. 
* Countless all-nighters (at least once a week), highly irregular sleeping schedules, and many skipped meals and random snacks during this period. 
* Had depression and felt suicidal two years ago, but haven't seen anyone about it. Just kept a journal to track my thoughts and tried to keep positive and busy. 
* I have been feeling a bit better in the years since then, but I'm aware that my mental and physical health has taken quite a bad hit. 

Four nights ago, I kept waking in the middle of the night. This in itself isn't all that unusual, but around 4am, I woke up feeling *extremely* *paranoid* of objects in my room: My partly opened door, my closet, the head of my bed, my bulletin board -- I was convinced that all of these things were silently threatening me and watching me with a focused intent to harm. I didn't feel sleepy, I felt very sharply aware and I was very frightened.

I turned on my phone thinking the light would be comforting; the original plan was to shine it on the door to make the door fuck off (I know it makes no sense, but this was my thought process at the time); but just as soon as my screen unlocked and the light came on, I became extremely scared that the light itself was trying to harm me and was somehow watching me very intently. 

Of course, in hindsight I know these things are unreasonable; but that was not something that crossed my mind at the time. I was very ""animal-scared,"" and very much 100% convinced I was in danger, with no better way to describe it. 

Most notably, I glanced at my bookshelf and noticed that all of the titles on the spines were very curly, and this was extremely terrifying and grotesque to me. To clarify, the titles on my books didn't become curly as I looked at them, they were already curly-looking when I glanced there. And it wasn't them looking different (they're not curly in reality) that scared me, it was just their actual *shape*. The shape of curliness seemed to seethe with malevolence. Kind of like looking at a wall covered in shivering hornets that share a hateful hive-mind.

I was convinced all of these things had a silent intent to hurt me, despite not moving.

**Some things to note:** 

* Like a lot of people, I frequently and vividly hallucinate spiders when I am exhausted. However, these hallucinations don't frighten me. This recent experience had me extremely scared. I was absolutely convinced that I was in peril.
* On extremely rare occasions I think I hear voices when I'm alone, but I'm 99% sure this is just in my imagination and it's just random thoughts conversing or something of that sort. However there is a difference between these voices and the voices you hear when you're reading a book, for example, or recalling a memory. It feels physically closer to my ear (possibly inside). 
* Also like a lot of people, I sometimes catch glimpses of things that turn out to be not there, such as a person standing in the corner of the room, or a face peering through a partially opened door (usually very near the ceiling or very low near the floor). Again, much like the voices, I think this is more attributed to me feeling paranoid for no reason, or due to an overly active imagination (it's been like this since I was a small child).
* Very vivid dreams throughout life. Color, music, emotional, movie-like, complex. Can return to an old dream and pick up where left off, etc. Figures in dreams recall our past interactions and make references to other dreams, which I guess makes sense because they're all figments of our brains.
* This is my first time experiencing this kind of unreasonable paranoia. It seemingly had no build-up or signs. I'd chuckle it off, but it was really scary. 
* I doubt it's relevant, but I have no issues socializing and I'm not even a quiet person. Just an energetic introvert like many.
* I could breathe during this incident.
* I could move during this incident.

For the next couple of days I resolved to get at least eight hours of sleep. No further paranoid incidents.

But just last night, I hallucinated a polo shirt on my ceiling. I wasn't scared this time, but it's still got me worried. The edges were ripply, and I couldn't decide of the shirt was melting or not, but I was wholly preoccupied and even frustrated with trying to reach a decision on the matter. For some reason that question was very important to me, as stupid as that sounds. 

Partway through I realized something was weird and I tore my eyes off of the shirt to send a text to my friend, which currently reads like this:

&gt;*Help I'm halluimayijg again*  
*I dunno what it is but I'm lying here in the dark a nd see a floating white shirt in my ceiling*  
*Just a shirt*  
*I stated supeihard for sometimes your brwi tracks you*  
*But no critter evolution entail lemole*  
*Left in the to his own drbices*

The reason I bother to include this in my post is because I only remember sending the very first line (the ""*Help I'm hallucinating*"" bit). The rest I have no recollection of sending at all. 

My friend suggested that I possibly blacked out, but I distinctly recall feeling extremely stressed after sending ""Help I'm halluimayijg again;"" I couldn't decide if I wanted to text any further explanations or not, and felt very torn. And that's when I gave up and just continued staring at the floating shirt. 

Well, apparently I *did* text further explanations, because the rest reads like I was trying to say ""I stared super hard because sometimes your brain tricks you."" I just don't remember sending it. And the rest of the messages are complete nonsense and I have no clue where they came from. 

===============

I asked my mother if we have any history in the family of this kind of occurrence. She told me she's hallucinated before, but it was only a side-effect of her chemotherapy medications, and she's never felt the scary paranoia that I described.

I'm not entirely sure who I'm supposed to talk to for this kind of thing, and I am very concerned. But I also think it might just be a one-off deal. If it sounds like I'm making mountains out of molehills, I'd like to know.

I just thought I'd post this here in case anyone had any similar experiences or advice. Who to call, who to see, etc. If there's no reason to be concerned.

Cheers and hope you're all keeping well and safe in these times!",20May2020,1
244,"I just got back from failing to start a job for the second time in a row because of something resembling a panic attack. I start borderline hyperventilating and it seems like every neuron in my lizard brain is urging me to to get the fuck outta there before something happens. I don't know what this something is. Logically, I know it is nothing. The logical side of my brain feels like whatever the fuck is going on with me is turning me into a whiny drama queen that just doesn't want to work. But the panic feels so real in the moment. 

I've always felt there were two ""voices"" in my head. One Logical and one Reactionary. I compare it most readily to the scene in *The Two Towers* where Gollum is talking to his other personality, so I'll be referring to these voices like they are people from now on, because that is actually how it feels. Reactionary voice panics over something, logical voice says that is silly. A back and forth goes on. Up till two months ago, it's only ever really affected my ability to socialize. As Reactionary like to tell me I'm not worthy of friendship and Logical could never quite convince me he was wrong. 

Before the pandemic, I was getting ready to make a trip to Europe to try and get a certification to teach English overseas. I put in notice to my work, I saved money, I booked my flight, I got out of my lease (by the book, no one was screwed over) and as consequence of that I soured my last friendship I am pretty sure was toxic anyway. I decided on this course precisely because I have nothing tying me here but my family. I've got no friends. I've never had a relationship. Probably in part because of Reactionary. In fact, I had recently got rejected by a friend who zigzagged on getting into a relationship with me (first said she would like that before doing a 180). I felt like I was making no progress in my life, I was working a job that was spiritually draining. So yeah. Seemed like a good idea. Then the country I was going to go to closed its borders. 

Now I'm living with my parents at 31 and my old job won't hire me back. I've applied to several places, and gotten called back my a few. I've honestly tried to go to these jobs but my brain starts screaming in fear at the slightest provocation and I can't hack it. Even just going out to get supplies is more stressful than getting chased by a bear for me.  At least I would know what a bear will do once it get me. Reactionary is worse than ever before and Logical is not doing shit for me anymore. 

Everyone else seems to have such an easy time functioning in society and it is just getting more impossible for me the older I get. I don't see a happy or uplifting ending to this story. I'm pretty sure my own family things I am a hopeless, lazy mess that just doesn't want to work. Even I think maybe I just being a whiny bitch. My life hasn't even been traumatic enough to warrant a fear of bees, yet I can't go to the fucking store without panicking about an eventuality I can't even put a name or face to. 

I want to be normal. I just want a normal life. How the fuck can I do that?

If he's not online, and one of a very small handful of the guys I play with isn't on I just stare at my xbox home screen and cry.. For hours.
It never stops. That is my entire life at the moment. 

I'm constantly upset and hurt and my brain never shuts off. I over think everything , sometimes its even hard to tell when its just me making up scenrios in my head or if someone else actually feels how I think they do.

I've had friends in the past, but these days I don't feel like I have anyone.. I'm so god damn lonely its painful.
Ever see those memes when people feel like the background friend and even though there's people there you doubt they ever think about you when you are not there.
That's me, all the time.

254,"Sorry beforehand if this isn’t allowed but I need to vent to the only people that can somewhat grasp this. 

Most of everything can be considered a prison. The universe, this world, life itself, your mind, body, emotions, pain, etc. Hell even death since when you’re dead it’s not like you have any options to get out of being dead forever. And the thing about death is even when you want nothing more than to die and think it’s the closest thing to actual freedom you’ll still be trapped. Trapped forever in nothingness. Absolutely everything is out of our control and those who say we atleast have the ability to react to what we experience don’t know how mental illness effects those reactions.",20May2020,1
255,"My dad broke my headphones today and it felt like loosing a loved one. Is this another mental health problem? I already have ocd and social anxiety, could this be a symptom of one of them? Can someone point me in the right direction?",20May2020,1
256,"I always try to say good things, offer help and support. But I always end up saying something awkward and generic. I know there are so many fake depressed people on reddit, but you never know.",20May2020,1
257,"I’ve never taken meds or anything but I def have been diagnosed w panic disorder , OCD and GAD . I always tell the doctors I don’t want anything but my friend gave me a .25 Xanax . I drink a lot to help not feel - if I take this when I’m sober will it help ? I’m weird about taking pills lol",20May2020,1
258,"So I sometimes think I’m ok looking - I’d say I’m a 6/10 and I know that the attention I get from men is only because I have a nice body. My face isn’t so nice, I have bad skin, not so feminine features, I have a long face and it’s very asymmetrical with a big forehead. I would absolutely kill to have a nice pretty feminine face, the kind of face all my friends and family seem to have. 

My sister who is close in age is absolutely stunning, she gets attention constantly from everyone and everyone I meet always tells me how gorgeous she is and how we look *nothing* alike. My mother used to tell her she should become a model someday, and would compare her to Beyoncé etc etc. She told me that the only profession she could see me in was an office clerk. I once found out my sisters boyfriend was commenting on how ‘ugly’ I am with all of his friends, to which they all agreed. So you get the idea, I’ve constantly competed myself to her growing up. 

Now I do this with everyone I know. Everyone I know is so much better looking than me in my eyes, I have no confidence as a result of this and it makes me even uglier. I can’t seem to enjoy anything if I don’t look good enough. It’s consuming my whole personality, I don’t know what to do.",20May2020,1
259,I’ve been struggling atm with things in my life and the only person I trusted has broke me down and i dont know what to do. I can’t live like this anymore,20May2020,1
260,"I can't relax, at all, in the slightest or in any way sometimes. If I misinterpret a joke I get stressed out and get insecure about reading the joke wrong and make a fool out of myself, my boyfriend said he wanted to take a nap instead of talk to me and I read that as him not liking me that day and I think I made a fool out of myself for being too paranoid, any fucking time I take anything out of proportion I think that I just made myself look like an idiot and wonder ""look at how high strung and unrelaxed I am, I can't believe anyone likes me"" or something similar, even when I do calm down I go to my past texts I just read on how stupidly overreactive I was and think ""Jesus, I acted that way? I'm fucking worthless"" and to back to the same exact state I was prior, thinking the exact same things and feeling the same exact way, what the fuck is wrong with me? Why am I literally unable to relax in any fucking form whatsoever? Why am I such an embarrassment to everybody around me?

I'd talk about it to my psychiatrist but the virus is making that difficult, and he's been highly unresponsive, and I'm 17, and PLEASE don't say ""well you're a kid"", no kid should be this much of a stressball, this is fucking ridiculous, I have no reason idea what is so wrong with me and I despise myself for it",20May2020,1
