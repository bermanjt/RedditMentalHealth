Sometimes i see a random person and i think to myself ""i could definitely get away with murdering u"" obviously i would not do that, i am not crazy in that way.

7,"Early 2017, I hit a dark phase in my life. I had just come out of an emotionally abusive relationship a few months prior. But I ended up doing something really bad. I locked myself in my room at university for just over 3 weeks. I ran out of food and the last two days I started eating salt and I was beginning to think I had people in my head telling me what to do. I self harmed a bit too due to this. I was being controlled by a shadowy figure. I could not see his face, he wore a black hood. Kind of like death, but he was in charge of the emotional situations in my life. And will try to force me to change things for the benefit of myself. 

When I finally knew it was time to get some help I told a counsellor. He spoke with numerous professionals about what it could be... schizophrenia? No, Autism, no any form of psychosis? No. It just bowed down to having a very creative mind which I have always had. 

With my creative projects I have a big attention to detail. But what really intrigues me is what I can do in public. I am extremely and unusually observant. Doctors have noticed this from a young age but can’t pin anything to it, just said I was very smart. But I feel like there’s something that’s not right about my head. 

E.g. if I am at a bar with friends, I can listen to my friend’s conversation and listen to a strangers conversation on another table without focusing.. I could tell you how many ice cubes the guy in the blue shirt, standing at the bar had in his glass and the eye colour of the girl in the red dress that walked by at 10:34pm. My spacial awareness is very high and it is quite annoying as I find myself listening to conversations or automatically finding out something I don’t want to know at times. 

Recently I hit another depressive episode. I did not lock myself in my room this time, but now I am having very vivid dreams and night terrors. My dreams turn out to be connected in one way or another. Like it’s an ongoing story. But when I am nodding off to sleep, I can sometimes hear sounds and voices. E.g. I once heated the sound that sonic makes when he jumps on a trampoline, and the other night I heard a girl say my name. It creeps me out. My dreams also contain death. The guy who I felt like was talking in my head. My dreams show him stood over me when I’m sleeping or death with his scythe in a field of wheat. It’s very strange.",21Oct2020,1

TW: mentions of suicide 


Ever since then I think ab reaching out to my ex every so often, less now but I still do, the only way I could do that is over email. It feels horrible that I was the one blocked on everything when he said I did nothing and it wasn’t my fault. That doesn’t make it feel like it. I only have one close friend and she’s away at college I’m seeing her this weekend but I still feel so alone. I want to make new friends but don’t know how and now more so after the breakup I feel like nobody could care ab me as much as I care ab them. 

There is this really cute girl at my work and I want to be her friend and even kinda have a crush on her. But I don’t know her that well.I don’t know how to approach the situation.I don’t understand myself sometimes. I just want to love and be loved why does everything have to seem so twisted?

I have not done a school assignment in about two weeks and at times feel useless as an individual and don’t know who I am. 
I am going to therapy but it’s just so hard without proper friends, which I don’t think I have had in a very long time.
 
Nobody tells you how to do this stuff and I feel like I have tried my best with the knowledge and experience I have and I just give up or give up before I even try.
How do you leave someone in such a state and just never bother to check up on them?(my ex)
It makes me so angry bc he said he cared.

I think about suicide semi-often because I feel like I don’t have anything to look forward to and am unsure of how to create something by myself.
It’s so difficult and sometimes I wish the few people that care bare minimum would just stop so I wouldn’t feel guilty for going away.  
 
This post is kinda all over the place but so am I. I just wanna speak what comes to mind sometimes. This is high key a cry for help if you can’t tell I just need to write something in the hopes that some stranger will read it, just listen, even if I don’t know them maybe we could keep each other company for a while.Despite not knowing each other we may be connected in how we feel which is so amazing and I just want to be connected to something even if it’s just for a moment.

11,"Hello, this year has been just awful. I started a great job in jamuary but was laid off in april dudme to covid. Not longer after, I got a bad infection and then my ex of 4 years broke up with me and I had to go back in with my parents.

I started a new job on August 26 (about a month and a half now) and I just feel like I'm doing a terrible job. I do think that it could be because I'm so hard on myself, and I really don't have much of anything to look forward to these days. None of my coworkers let me know when I'm doing things right, and when I do things wrong they go to the boss instead of confronting me. I'm just so frustrated. The girl who trained me didn't do a very good job, makes me feel stupid at least daily, and gets mad at me for not knowing how to do stuff when she never showed me how to do it!! 

I've cried a few times about my job already. I went to the office manager on my third week and asked for more help, I have yet to see that. I also told the office manager that the girl that trains me makes me feel stupid. 

Am I stupid, or just too hard on myself? What things can I do to be nicer to myself?",21Oct2020,1
12,"Hello everyone. I hope you are all doing well. 

So the title is a quote that my therapist shared with me. I have been wanting to tell people I’m somewhat friends with in my grade about my mental illnesses and suicide attempts. I went to the hospital in April and that’s when my parents found out and my therapist found out and when I was diagnosed with MDD. 

So its been a handful of months and I’ve been kind of stir crazy keeping in such a big secret from people I see everyday...

13,"I always just thought I was depressed.
It’s been a constant, since I was just a kid and didn’t even have complex emotions. I was always sad.
I was five and wishing I could become invisible, or disappear, or die.
When I was seven I moved to a new school and in the first week we had to write a poem based on a feeling and I chose black paper and wrote about loneliness...which I know, was a real emo thing to do. 

When I was fifteen the only thing keeping me tethered to earth was the fact that I was raised Catholic and if you committed suicide you went to hell. 

I’m twenty three and I learned to live with it because what else could I do? My parents - bless them - were wonderful in so many ways but the one time I opened up to them I got burned (‘what do you have to be sad about?’ My mum yelled) so I kept it to myself. And I learned to cope.
And it was fine! As fine as it could be. Because It had to be and I didn’t know another way to live so it became easy just to deal with it and move on as much as I could because what else could I do, y’know? 

But recently I’ve been realising it might not just be depression and it’s fucking terrifying me.

The first clue was when my anxiety started to develop more in my teens. 
I don’t really get ‘panic attacks’ like you see in movies or on tv, I almost disassociate in a way. Everything slows down and I get trapped in my own head. My fight or flight must be broken because I just freeze and I thought that was normal until someone told me it wasn’t. 

The second was my paranoia. I figured that was my anxiety or something, that it was just a fun side effect I had to learn to deal with and I moved on.

But in the last year my partner (who has known me for seven years, knows me better than I know myself) started pointing out little things that I thought was normal.
My mood swings, my irritability. My depressive spirals, how they were bookended by a week or two of increased activity and drive that would just dissappear as quick as they came. How my impulse control would disappear too, how irritated and mood-swingy I’d get.
I always thought that was just how I was when I wasn’t ‘depressed’, that those weeks were me ‘snapping out’ of my depression, that those weeks were my default setting but we did some research and we are going to doctors and they think it might be something more serious.

Borderline or Bi-polar II is the current guesstimate and I’m so scared because depression is a beast I learned to live with over two decades and constant struggle. I’m not scared of it anymore because at this point it’s more familiar than my reflection (although my body dysmorphia could be to blame for that too). 

These almost-diagnoses, these ‘maybes’ terrify me because I was ready to live my life underwater but this new stuff?
I don’t want it. 
I can’t do it. 
Psychologists are expensive, medicine is expensive, stigma is real, what if what I am is too much for people.

I’m in Adelaide, south Australia, and I’m so scared right now because if it turns out I’m not just ‘depressed’ I don’t know what to do.",21Oct2020,1

16,"I got a new job a few months before the start of the pandemic. Loved it, but when the pandemic began business took a hit and we struggled. For the past months we've slowly been increasing sales but not fast enough to appease corporate.

I'm feeling more and more overwhelmed and hopeless in my position. This job came with the promise of another promotion with a pretty big pay jump, but now I'm wondering if I want any of this. The money is great but I am not happy at the job anymore. 

Then again, I started a new antidepressant a little over a month ago now. I can't help but wonder if its fucking with my head, but when I got the job I knew that I wasn't sure if it is what I wanted to be doing long term. 

This past week has just been a spiral downwards in terms of how I feel about everything.... I've even noticed a difference in how I interact with my family and my boyfriend. 

And while I'd never do this, I keep fantasizing about just not going back to my job, because I have gotten to a point where I have no joy in my position.

17,"So I suffer from social anxiety and general anxiety which I'm medicated for and going to therapy. But recently, even with the meds, my mood had been awful. For the past week and a half ive been feeling like im faking my emotions and reactions. Not every second, but on the whole I feel just... Not the emotion I'm portraying. 

For example, I'll smile and laugh as a reaction to something someone said either because it seems appropriate or because other people are laughing and smiling. The smile feels fake on my face. Later, when im home and thinking about these moments I don't associate these memories with happiness or fun. Even times when I feel genuinely loved by someone, later on it feels empty. 

I dont know if this is normal and it's making me very sad and guilty that I'm pretending to enjoy moments that my friends clearly enjoy. Is this something other people have felt before? Any help or advice that y'all can give would be amazing. Thanks in advance.",21Oct2020,1

21,"So I’ve had issues for a few months now with disordered eating. It started off with dieting and slowly progressed into becoming restrictive eating, starving myself for hours, etc. I was incredibly irritable, and I hated people giving me their two cents on my dieting habits. 
I eventually started giving myself diarrhoea by drinking heaps and heaps of coffee, so that I could purge myself each day. This is when it became a serious problem. I recognised that what I was doing was unhealthy yet I couldn’t stop. I was obsessed with purging and then weighing myself afterwards. It brought me joy but it never ever truly satisfied me, if that makes sense?

I’ve been to a psychologist but psychologists can’t actually make diagnosis’s, only a psychiatrist can. I don’t know what the hell I would even call this issue that I had, but I know it was really serious up til the point it was consuming my life. And I would still look at myself as fat. So I was never diagnosed with anything. 

I learned to stop restricting myself and stop dieting altogether. But the coffee problem still remains. Idk if I could even call it purging it’s just a habit now. It’s honestly destroying my daily life. I can’t even be productive because I’m so obsessed with drinking coffee and I sit on the toilet for hours, afterwards I feel so sick. 
Does anyone have an idea of what this could be, or any similar stories that they could share. I feel very alone because I haven’t heard of anyone doing this before. Not to mention I have little support in my life for this issue.

23," To give some background, I'm a 23F currently enrolled in college and just moved to a new town to be closer to my best friend who is basically my sister and biggest support in my life. I feel like I have been working to heal from a past of verbal and physical child abuse, lack of father/any male figures in my life, toxic family dynamic, and have switched colleges 5 times and majors 3 times. I have tried therapy a few times in the past, but struggled expressing my true inner feelings and opening up about the depression has been prevalent in my life for 13 years, as I have internalized it for so long that my feelings often feel too heavy to share and fully receive help for. My depression and anxiety come in waves. The highs and lows used to be much more extreme than they are now, however my motivation for the most part is extremely low day to day. I suffer from commitment issues and have been putting off getting a job until the last minute and my savings has been used completely, because my anxiety and general fear revolving COVID and the state of the world feel too overwhelming for me to be able to get back ‘into the world’ so to speak. I feel like I’m at war with myself every day, unable to break free from my own mind’s limitations to see that my quality of life could be so much better. I do have nice moments, thoughts, and feelings from time to time, but it’s become depressingly apparent to me that my default mode is a general sense of dislike for myself/my own company, disappointment and feelings of hauntedness from my mistakes of the past and my lifelong experience of shaky and toxic relationships with my family members. I saw my dad once after a few years in July and I’ve never seen someone so depressed in my life, he told me he should have killed himself before he had children and my mother also told me around the age of 12 that she was going to commit suicide because no one loved her. I feel like so many of the experiences I have with adults/caregivers that should have taken care of my wellbeing were instances that they loaded me with their own adult grief and issues that had nothing to do with me and expected me to solve them, and over the years I have just not been able to shake that guilt no matter how clearly I see that it isn’t my fault nor my guilt to hold. It feels like I have a negative filter over my view of the world and my experiences, and that no matter what I do, I’m just deeply sad or dissatisfied. I don’t wish to die as I know these feelings aren’t truly me, they are weight of unfairness but it doesn’t make them easier to carry and I feel I lack the tools to let them go. I don’t have health insurance, or a job, which is also causing a sense of loss within me – I can’t get professional help for my mental health without an income or insurance, yet I feel I’m unable to get a job until I get a better grasp on my mental wellbeing because I’m just….not doing well. After my most recent relationship ending last night, partly due to the fact that I clearly couldn’t properly consider his needs or feelings if my own are not being met within…its hitting me that I’m lacking a sense of direction. I would really appreciate some words of encouragement, or guidance over this huge sense of just being lost and numb because I don’t want to feel this way. I want to play my part in healing the world and enjoy life. I do love yoga and practice often with deep stretching, as the stress in my body has built up to physical pain over the years, which is also something I would love guidance to begin healing. I know better days are ahead. I would ideally love to chat with someone who has life experience and advice they’re willing to share, or who could possibly help me breakdown these areas through genuine conversation so that I can process my mind to a healthier place while I continue working to get better.",21Oct2020,1
24,"Hi! I'm looking for suggestions on how to combat my extreme social anxiety. 

I've recently started a new relationship. We've been dating for about a month and have been together for about two weeks. We have a lot of fun together, but I'm worried my anxiety is hampering things. We often have long awkward silences and I find myself unable to think of any conversation topics. This realization generally makes me more anxious and causes me to spiral.

I'm generally great at speaking over text message, so it isn't as though I can't find things to talk about. I just go blank in person and it's incredibly frustrating. 

I want to get a handle on this before it gets out of hand. I don't want her to think I'm bored or disinterested. Even worse, I don't want her to think that of me. 

I've expressed these feelings to her as well, and she has assured me that she understands. However, I know she will only be able to tolerate this for so long before it becomes a burden on our relationship.

Some background on me: I've been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety in the past. I no longer attend therapy or take medication for financial reasons. I realize these things would probably be my best recourse, but they aren't in the cards until at least the new year.

So, I did put a self harm TW in the title because this is, by the most literal definition, self harm, however, I want to clarify that I do have a self harm history, and this feels nothing like that. I get the urge to do it when I'm either very confused, or having a hard time regulating my sensory input. I am in the process of getting diagnosed with ADHD and one part of that for me is sensory issues, because of that I do stim and that's what this urge to hit myself feels more like. Essentially, when I get the urge to do it, I feel a sort of pull in my head and my dominant hand and/or I involuntarily imagine myself banging my head on a wall or desk. 

I just want to know other people's opinions on why this is happening because it's really annoying and it's pretty scary that I could potentially concuss myself if I don't resist the urges enough. Am I right to think this is an unfortunate new stim? What could be happening?",21Oct2020,1
29,"I remember at my lowest point at my time at school; bad grades, low social life and feeling like shit, my mum sat me down and complained that I was a burden to her. I can't let that go, mainly because she thinks that the good times I have with her matter. If she can't even understand how I felt, why the fuck should I care. It's funny because when one of my close relatives passed away, I was the one to look after he screaming and crying. She always manages to make me feel guilty but at this point, if I'm so bad, she should leave me alone. I told her my aspirations and the first thing she does was tell me to come up with a backup plan. I'm sick of it. She is why I'm stuck in life. And I swear to god, I don't want to hear anyone say some shit like ""you can't blame anyone"". Yes I fucking can and at least I'm recognising the situation and changing it. I've been hating on myself and for what? I feel so stupid. I had anxiety and she made fun of me for it. I cut myself once and she made fun of it but she had her little one-sided talk and it's all okay. She compared me to my cousins as a kid and even does it now subtly and she tells me to ""let things go"". And because we're a ""functioning family"" I can't complain. Parents are fucking awful. What, just because I'm not disabled, in a third-world country I can't be sad I can't be depressed - actually I only got diagnosed with GAD at the time (I was fucking 13) but who guilt tripped me into not going to counselling, you guessed it my mum. I used to think that with everything's she's done for me I should be happy, but she always made sure to make me understand that I was a burden for her. Her upbringing and background is obviously different from mine but I reject it. 

I'm even more pissed off because I write this slightly in fear that she'll read this. I shouldn't give a fuck about her opinion yet I do. I hate it here. My time at school was terrible and she made it worse by making me dependent on her but making me feel bad for it.

I'm currently breaking down after my roommates had an ""intervention"" type thing with me to tell me that I have been unbearably aggressive and condescending toward them for weeks.

""I don't know why I'm like this! I'm sorry! I'm trying to be better!"" 
and then heading off to talk to someone in the infirm at my boarding school.

I'm really struggling with the fact that one of my roommates is going somewhere else to sleep for the night because I am so unbearable. It's tearing me up. 

I think this might be because my two roommates are close, they walk on our two-person-wide sidewalks next to eachother closing me off, and I guess I just feel like a side piece or burden. Like their experience would not be affected at all if i were not there. 

I think I just might not feel supported? I'm 17, roommate A is 17, and roommate B is recently 18. I have also felt like B is holding her one year of ""maturity"" over everyone's heads as a way of commanding authority, but I've only felt consciously bothered by it when she explicitly says it while talking to someone, like it makes her any wiser.

I'm asking for help in figuring out what has made me so mean during my senior year of high school... I can't stop crying thinking about how shitty i must be acting towards my friends and I'm only partly aware of it.

if it helps: I go to a boarding college prep school and all students have been stuck on campus due to this year for ~4 weeks now.",21Oct2020,1
37,"i feel like i’ve been falsely diagnosed with depression. as hard as i try to fit into the symptoms i don’t feel what a depressed person seems to feel. I have numbness, the occasional guilt and fear of karma but no lasting emotion leads me. my whole life i’ve felt different and i relate to so many symptoms of aspd. I guess one sign was as a child i enjoyed torturing my friends pet bunnies, and gunnies pigs and would watch them run from me with a huge smile on my face until someone noticed i wasn’t just playing with them. when i got a dog my favorite hobby was pushing him until he’d bite me. i began manipulating my mom when i was 8, which she deserves for being so naive. in middle school i began using my sexuality to get what i wanted from boys with no actual desire for them. in all my relationships i have to be the one with the most power and am attracted to weak men who can be easily persuaded. i easily manipulate my entire family with no remorse or guilt when i hurt their feels. with the exception of my dad, he’s always been hard to manipulate because i believe he’s a narcissist. i don’t think i’ve ever apologized and truly meant it. i cried when my dog died so i feel some empathy but not love, especially for humans. i don’t really believe in it, my parents seem to care for me so i give them want which is for me to i love them but the majority of the time i say it out of pity. it’s easiest to fake that emotion through text, it’s hard to mask it in person. the only time i really resonate with the symptoms of depression is when i’m bored. and the only time i actually feel alive is when i think i might die. i just wanted to get this off my chest before i see my new therapist, i don’t know whether it’s worth bringing up? does this sound like i’m depressed or anti-social?

ugh even as write this i want to edit so i’m guaranteed a response it’s so annoying.",21Oct2020,1
38,Just when I didn’t think I can break anymore on the inside I found out she’s pregnant. I can’t take the pain the suffering the thinking about it anymore. I fell in love with a girl I work with knowing she had a ex/ history with a guy in another department we were together a year an half an she would reassure me there was nothing there she would talk about all the shitty an fucked up things he did an that she hated him. she told me and our group of friends I had nothing to worry about. And then 2 months ago she breaks things off an says she’s gonna try again with him having to work with her and see her every day is killing me on the inside and then to see them together just breaks me I’m in tears as I write this. And I found out today she’s knocked up with his baby and it just shatters me I can’t take it anymore.,21Oct2020,1
39,So every time this certain thing happens(i don’t really wanna say lol) i get really dizzy and my heart starts beating like crazy and sometimes i literally start shaking and have to try and catch my breath and for the first time today i realized this wasn’t a normal reaction and it could possibly be a trigger. The thing is what causes this trigger is just really weird and I even know why I might get “triggered” at this but I still think it’s so weird idk so I was looking for some answers.,21Oct2020,1
40,"I’m 19 years old and have probably like 3 people I’d full heartedly call friends, each is like an individual friend, we’ve never hung out as a group and they have their own best friends and group of “the bois” I’ve also never been in a bois group chat or used the expression getting a cold one with the bois. I don’t even make online friends in PlayStation cause I’m at that level of being socially anxious and awkward. Is it okay that I’m 19 and pretty much not have friends? Ps all my friends are leaving for collage and we’ll probably loose contact, they make friends easily but I’m terrified I’ll actually die alone, no gf no friends and no family (my relationship with my entire family is extremely messy so that’s that “family” part)",21Oct2020,1
41,So I'm not sure what I'm doing to myself today but I ate abit when I woke up and now I'm starving but I feel like crying for wanting to eat. Like why is this happening. I feel super anxious and it's starting to make me feel really weird. But I just feel guilty for wanting to go get food. This has happened a few times in the past. I just feel disgusted with myself and don't deserve to eat anything.,21Oct2020,1
42,"  I’ve been VERY conflicted about this for a while...
I have an inkling I have PTSD symptoms from being assaulted continually (1st n 2nd level, nicknames, physical contact/touch only, nothing worse) since I was maybe 5-ish? Continually as in several times a month from my mom and (less) dad, who are good otherwise. [I love them though, they take care of me...]

  The list of stuff:
1. Hard time sleeping, I usually don’t get sleepy until 12-2 am
2. I start sweating+have trembling+sick to my stomach and spasms when I think about it. I have to squirm and hit myself or wave my hands to relieve some stress(?)
3.  Lots of nightmares including violence or assault, or sexual stuff when I wasn’t aware of it happening and didn’t want it to happen esp. feeling disgusted after the dream.
4. Intrusive thoughts + daydreams abt violence or assault. (Esp in the car, or when there’s nothing else to focus on)
5. Unreasonable suspicion of others having malicious intentions.
6. Getting sweaty and stressed when around lots of people in close proximity, esp. men and older women.
7. Suicidal ideation, feeling like nothing is real, disconnected from others and unfocused.
8. Similar sensations to getting assaulted on my right hand and inner thighs, faint tingling feeling. Activates when I touch certain textures.
9. When people touch or poke me, (sides, neck, stomach, etc) I yell+get irritated, it makes me feel weird and bad afterwards.
10. General sluggishness, not wanting to get out of bed or do my hobbies or talk to people.
11. Seeing sexual things is jarring, things about assault especially— make my heart beat fast and stress/worry set in.
12. After getting triggered really bad, I feel weird anticipation(?) or fear(?) probably horror. Intense need to self harm to cope with need to physically express pain.
13. Last one, I get euphoria/joy from pain— I try not to, so that I do not get addicted, but pain feels good sometimes. I tend to laugh+feel my face heat up when my body is physically harmed or at risk.

But, there’s some other factors that make me doubt;

Almost all symptoms; except for numbness, suspicion,  intrusive thoughts, and the getting freaked tf out when assault is mentioned have only arisen recently. I haven’t had any panic or anxiety attacks either (I used to have bad stomach problems (but it skips a few years and the last one wasn’t too bad I think). 

I didn’t realize what my parents were doing wasn’t normal until now,, I wonder if I would’ve been okay had I not realized it. I get stressed out because I don’t want to be faking it and ruining my own life + insulting others. Maybe if someone is like “oh naw, u faking” I could drop it and be normal??



I also *sometimes* get weird pain when aroused.?
Pain like jolts coming up from down there and going into my organs and stuff—and it stays until the feeling is gone. Is that normal?? I’ve had that for a while now, it got me thinking.

Thank you for listening to my deranged ramblings, I hope that it makes some sore of sense...",21Oct2020,1
43,"Alright so a lot of people have a voice in their head, and they always want them to stop. But i like mine, he's pretty nice to me. He's talking to me constantly whether I'm consciously thinking about it or not. He helped me get through tough times. For some reason, he's gone silent, leaving me alone to slowly realize how quiet and lonely my situation is. Is there any way to get him back?",21Oct2020,1
44,"So, to give some context I am a (currently) 15 year old girl in highschool, I have some self esteem issues (I believe thats normal for my age). I have difficulty with trust, even in my own family. I feel cowardly and have a hard time dealing with situations were I need to stand up for myself because I usually get shut down and called narcissistic etc.

When I was 11, (fifth grade) I was going through a hard time. A few years before that my parents divorced and I only recently started seeing my dad again. My mom married my step dad and I wasnt used to him yet, mainly because my grandparents and dad we're screwing with my head and telling me that hes a horrible person. I believed that, and because I was living full time there and I thought my younger siblings were too young I put the responsibility on myself to not tell anything to them. I was also bullied and left alone at school, so I was living in a house i wasnt used to and had no friends. Then, a Girl who moved into my small neighborhood (we live outside of a small town with a population of about 4000 people) started to talk to me, If I remember correctly she was a year or two older than me. We started to become close friends and for the longest time I had someone I could be myself around, and then one day she asked me : ""Can I kiss you ?"" Honestly that phrase still hurts to this day... I said no because i was too young to feel that way towards anyone. But, I didnt want to lose my only friend. So for months, I quietly let her touch me, kiss me and do all types of things to me.. She was like twice my size so I couldn't physically defend myself even when I asked her to stop. After she moved away I still felt scared whenever my brother talked to about her to my mom. Because I was young and didnt really understand that I was violated I pretended it never happened. Then after that some guy grabbed my boob (I was an early bloomer) and another one dry humped me, but that didnt really scare me as much as the first incident of sexual assault. All my life I was told to not dress slutty or else men would want to rape me, I was 13 when my grandmother gave me the speech about girls being raped and violated. 

I find that the whole incident has left me with big trust issues now. I had a girlfriend and we got along but I never felt comfortable having her kiss or touch me, I always felt panicked knowing that she could take advantage of me at any moment and use me... I dress up in big baggy clothes and never show off my body because I always feel like im being watched and Im always scared that someone will hurt me. I have a hard time building strong friendships, because of that fear of betrayal. I want to be intimate with someone, I want to have someone to share the deepest part of my soul to, to be able to trust someone enough to know they wont hurt me. I really want that confidence, I think its really hindering at my self confidence and is really screwing with my head. Ive been struggling with suicide attempts and such, and lately got the urge to cut myself again. Ive done councelling but never talked to any councillor about my sexual assault because I didnt want my parents to find out. Are there any ways that I can get help and learn to cope with that seering fear and paranoia?
thanks :)

i’ve never used reddit before so i’m not sure how much this will help but i was hoping for some advice. I’ll just get to the point-
I’m a 14 year old female and my parents are on the stricter side. i am constantly sad, not just bummed out all the time, i just never feel motivated to do anything, i feel like i just exist. i get little spurs of excitement but they don’t last long. i am also a closeted bisexual, and have had suicidal thoughts since i was in sixth grade, i told my mom about these thoughts and she comforted me but ultimately just told my siblings “to be nicer” to me. when i was in seventh grade, every day i would have suicidal thoughts, i was always way to scared to cut myself since my mom has mentioned that if she ever finds cuts on me, i’m going to a mental hospital. (when writing it, it sounds a lot more aggressive then it was, she said it in a joking tone) i told my mother about these thoughts and unlike in sixth grade she got angry this time, she explained how since we have a big house and i am fed and clothed i have “nothing to be sad about”. i soon played off the conversion as not a serious topic and she seemed to as well. she hasn’t mentioned it since, i am now a freshman and still have these thoughts at least once a week. i am the comedic relief in my friend group so i never feel important. i have been on migraine medicine before and when i asked my mom if i could start anti-depressants (she is a nurse and my dad is a doctor) she said that the migraine meds are the same thing. now with my lack of medical knowledge, i have no idea if this is true. my best friend’s mom (whom i am in a club with along with other girls where we basically just vent about school and learn to mediate) is a psychotherapist who has diagnosed me with major anxiety, which my mom says is “all in my head”. not to self diagnose but, i also am convinced that i have insomnia, it takes me hours to try to fall asleep, constant headaches, even when i sleep i constantly feel tired, i have major anxiety, and can never focus on anything. my mom would take it very badly if i ever asked to see a therapist and probably post about it on facebook, i’m too scared to talk about it with my best friends mon since i see her as more of a best friend than as a therapist if that makes any sense. i may be over exaggerating and this is probably nothing, but i wanted to ask what i could do as a minor who can’t give constant to anything without my parents knowledge.

I’ve been seeing psychiatrists and counsellors for 6 years now. Been in the psych ward multiple times, been in dbt, done group therapy and one on one counselling for years and have been diagnosed with ptsd, anxiety, depression, bipolar, adhd, and bpd. My psychiatrist stopped diagnosing me with things a long time ago and has just been prescribing me meds. The last time I saw her she told me I’ve been on every antipsychotic that I could be already. She said there’s really nothing left to try, and I don’t know what else to do. I don’t even want meds anymore. I’m still in addiction therapy treatments, so it’s the last thing I need. But I’ve had issues with my memory for a long time and dissociate pretty bad sometimes, assuming its my ptsd And that my very sudden mood changes were bipolar. But I’m starting to think maybe there’s something else going on. 
Every appointment I have my mom likes to pop in just to say what she’s noticed in me and she always mentions that I seem to switch my mood. One time they were talking about it And when my psychiatrist talked about bipolar my mom chimed back in asking “well what if she has mood changes like that, but instead of over time it’s.. idk.. all within an hour or even few minutes ??” And my psychiatrist said that’s not normally what bipolar does. But then she never looked into it. Even when my mom brings it up constantly. And I don’t see the mood changes like she does, I don’t see it at all until I’m back to myself and not having episodes of some sort Idek what to call all of it Anymore. 
I just don’t get it. I’m so stressed out constantly and so confused. I don’t even feel like myself I don’t even know what’s real. I always chalk it up to addiction, concussions, and all those diagnoses but idk anymore. Is there something else that could be going on..? Cause this doesn’t make sense to me and I just can’t take it anymore.",21Oct2020,1
47,"I am hoping to get some advice on this as its my first time realizing this feeling and therefore my first time realizing I don't need to feel this way.

This feeling is rare, and only happens maybe 1-2 times a year. It varies in intensity but always comes with a wave of unshakable depression. I am hoping to get some advice on it so I can get pointed in the right direction for getting help.

This first began when I was young, between 5-7. I remember it starting when I got an infection on my toenail which caused it to fall off. Enduring this experience gave me this horrible mental feeling, like the world around me was not real, I was the only one real, and I was trapped in this makeshift world where everything was secretly rotting away behind a thin coat of paint. I remember not wanting to do anything, I was always an active kid but during this time I laid in bed, did the bare necessities and had no energy.

For about a month this went on and I was so sure I was dying. I didn't tell my parents because I didn't want them to worry so I just silently suffered until one day it literally just went away as if it never happened.

It didn't happen for a very long time after this, I'd say into my teen years and early 20s. It would start just as it did before, and I recognized the feeling. This time it would last for about a week or two in comparison to a month, and it went away pretty much the next day if I rearranged my bedroom or did something to totally change up my daily scenery. So thats what I do, every time i get the feeling I just start rearranging stuff and it goes away.

Well, i just moved in with my boyfriend a month ago and i woke up today from a terrible dream I had about his grandmother dying. Now, she is dying, she is in the later stages of dementia and it terrifies me to see her this way, so I started looking into dementia today after the dream.
Here is the thing, the dream triggered this feeling, but it was mild. I was mopy and depressed today but mostly okay once i forced myself to go out and enjoy some time with friends.
When I came home I recalled coming across something called Everywhere at the End of Time, which I came across while looking into stuff about Dementia. I decided to give it a listen, not listening to the full 6 hours for my sake but out of curiosity I gave each track about a minute listen.
It broke me, and my already fragile mental state tumbled into that same sad scared little girl I was when I first got this feeling.
I discussed it with my boyfriend and we are talking about trying to get a therapist for me to discuss this feeling so it doesn't go on to get worse, I just feel so lost because I don't have a diagnosis, I can't say ""oh thats just my *insert diagnosis here,* acting up, let me go over my coping mechanisms and try relaxing,"" because I can't, I don't know what this is, I don't know what to do, I can't put a name on it and I can't do my typical rearranging right now where me and my boyfriend are living.

Talking about it helps, making this post has helped, but all I can do from here on is distract myself from the feeling, I can't shake it yet. But I really want it to go away.",21Oct2020,1

some background info: so my best friend of 10 years (we’ll call her haley) has been dating another close friend of mine (we’ll call him john) for a couple years now. they had dated previously but had taken a break. haley and i are seniors in highschool and john graduated last year. their relationship is long distance, i live near haley. 

john has come to me in distress multiple times because haley tells him he’s the reason she s/h. 

john texted me tonight and this is the current situation: haley and john were in a call. she hung up on him. i believe she told john she was going to hurt herself because he “pissed her off and stressed her out about coming on a trip” (the trip is this weekend, i’m coming with them with another friend) john also said “i mess shit up for her and ruin her life and make her hurt herself” which i don’t know if that’s her words or his, since he talks down on himself constantly. 

i told john that it’s not ok for her to be blaming him and putting that on him. after that she called back and i am now waiting for a text back from john. 

they both struggle with mental health, depression, and suicidal thoughts. (as do i so i’m struggling to help this situation without making it worse) i’m also not sure how much they know about each other mentally since they are both closed off about it. 

i know that john has been in a deep depression for months and everyday is a struggle for him. i worry this relationship is damaging his mental health even more. 

the thing is haley doesn’t know i know any of this and i don’t know what to do. i know this is toxic behavior and i can’t just sit by and let this continue. i don’t think it’s healthy for either of them.

61,"i went through a very hard time mental health wise this summer. i just didn’t feel okay at all, i had horrific mood swings every single day. I had this constant unexplainable feeling. it was like a constant war with myself and the whole things felt like it was being done for attention. I was annoying everyone around me because i was so overly hyper around people. i was so attached to my boyfriend (and still am) that it was just not normal at all. in my head he literally can not doing anything wrong ever. the only mental illnesses i’ve been officially diagnosed with are OCD (which affects me greatly), ADHD (which i refuse to believe i have) and just normal anxiety disorder. During the summer i started worrying that i had BPD. I think that after i found out about bpd i started following the symptoms of bpd much more. it was as if i wanted to have it, even though i didn’t but maybe i did i don’t know. i started to become weirdly obsessed with the idea of it although i didn’t want to be. all of this stuff or at least most of this stuff slowly started to fade away for a while. it faded into just a long period of OCD being my primary focus of everything.

62,"I've got a little bit of a life story time and then a genuine question after i sort of set the stage, because im not sure what else to do to be better at interacting with the people i love.

I'm currently 18 (nearly 19) but to preface, at about the age of 12, my family sold my childhood home, and we moved onto a boat, and to a foreign country, until we finally retuned back to the USA permanently when I was 16. during that time I was extremely sheltered from any real social interactions with anybody remotely close to my  age, and really even anyone who spoke English.   
 

When I finally ended up back in the US, I was still ""homeschooled"" (which was a whole nother failed can of worms) and didn't have a job until just earlier this year, so i still didn't really have a social outlet besides some of my online friends. so i always found talking to people my age extremely stressful. For example, I got in touch with some of my old publish school friends who i vaguely kept in touch with, and planned to meet up with them to hang out after all these long years, and just in the car ride to get to them alone, my entire insides were twisting and my stomach felt like it was filled to the brim with zillions upon zillions of butterflies, and i had to stop myself from nearly vomiting, the entire car ride, just thinking about talking to people my age, and trying to think of what the heck i would say to anyone. once i got there it wasn't nearly as bad as i thought it would be, although still very awkward and i definitely had no idea what to say and relied 100% on others carrying a conversation. but the feeling i experienced in the car ride was enough for me to dread ever doing that again.   
 

 Time went by and i VERY slowly got better at not feeling that horrible feeling, although i only saw my friends maybe once every other month, but i ended up not seeing them anymore since they lived 2 hours away, and i didn't drive so m y parents always had to bring me, so it faded away within a year. The big change came when my parents basically forced me to get a job (which I'm now incredibly grateful they did) and the feelings all came back at the thought of an interview. To save everybody reading this some time, i stressed about it BIG time, but ended up  taking it like a champ and got the job (Target!).   
 

I've worked there for 6 months now and have met so many wonderful people and made some really amazing friends that I honestly think are going to last a life time, I even met my now boyfriend there. Target has seriously made up for my complete drought of social interaction that i missed out on. I'm not nervous to hang out with my friends in the slightest, and i feel genuinely comfortable with the people i consider my friends, and that AWFUL feeling hasn't come back and I'm positive it's gone for good.  


 So We're now currently at present date, and while i no longer get the immense stressful feeling of what i think used to be social anxiety, i still have a really obnoxious issue that i really can't figure out how to improve on or get rid of. When it comes to talking to people, usually about more serious stuff, i lock up really badly. Whenever anyone talks to me about something serious i almost completely physically freeze up, and I'm pretty sure you can see the cogs in my head sparking and smoking. most of the time i can blur tout a generic response that does nothing but let the person know I'm still awake and listening, but it's always the same, I can never think of anything even almost meaningful to say. And my worry now is that it happens a lot with my boyfriend, i love him to DEATH, i truly do, and the last thing i want is for him to ever think i don't care about something he's telling me about, or god forbid, that i don't care about HIM, because i SUCK at saying helpful and meaningful things that show i care. Because i do truly care so much, I'm just SO bad at being able to show it when it comes to words. And sometimes ill even say something borderline stupid when i freeze up and panic and start realizing I'm taking WAY too long to think of a response, and later on i cringe so hard and want to scratch my eyes out while thinking about what i said.  


 Another tiny thing that i don't even care about compared to my previous issue but i figured i'd mention it in case it may be linked. I started winking at my boyfriend with my left eye to be cute, and now i can't stop. If I'm talking to mainly him, but it's also happened with other people, about something that makes me nervous, i almost compulsively start obnoxiously winking really hard. i can usually stop it, but only after i catch myself doing it at least once by accident. I don't have any other weird spasms or anything like that, that's the only one.  


 So what the heck is wrong with me, why can't i properly speak to people and why do i just freeze on the spot. Am i just a lost cause and i have to deal with this forever, or is there actually some way i can fix this and get better? Even if it's some sort of therapy or counseling, i don't care, i just want to be normal. And what the heck is up with the winking lol",21Oct2020,1
63,"I have been feeling not secured in my masculinity lately. Like I know I have some aspects of my perspectives of what I believe a man should be, but I feel like as if I’m not seen as a real man. Like I am very responsible, and I would say I’m a 7 or 8 out of 10 on the attractiveness scale, I know I’m not ugly. I just don’t feel like a man, I really don’t know why, I’m 17, I am taking 9 ap classes right now, I am a manager at a place, as well as being in EMT night classes. I feel like I’m not fulfilled and I am not a man. I am usually very lonely and I really am a very outgoing person and very extroverted, I have lots of friends and love people, I think my masculinity and fulfillment would come back if I could find a girlfriend but after I caught my girlfriend having sex with multiple men it has just been hard for me. I also understand that I never-really had a male role model in my life with my parents being divorced, but it just is kinda hard and it’s annoying.

66,"Morning, this is my first post, my son advised me to reach out on here.  I am 52 yrs and have spent most of my life struggling with relationships/ friendships. I grew up knowing that my mum felt differently towards me and favoured my sisters. A few years ago she finally admitted that she struggled to have the same feelings for me as she did my sisters. I lived the first 6 months of my life in an incubator, back then she was unable to hold me at all. 

I have spent my life trying so hard to be liked and over compensating, however, when I start getting close to someone I start with drawing as I fear I will not be liked when they get to know me properly. I end relationships as I assume they will walk away eventually. 

I do not socialise and live on my own, which I do not mind but I also know I should try and socialise some more, but how can I change my mind set and feelings that I have had all my life ?

Any advice would be appreciated as I would like to like myself a lot more and no longer afraid to let people get close, I have built a large brick wall in my head and I would like to start knocking it down.",21Oct2020,1
67,"(25f) started dating this guy (27) over two months ago. We started talking on a dating app about a month before meeting (he was out of town for a bit) and two weeks after I broke up with my ex, who minimized my feelings, had crazy double standards, and was dishonest with me multiple times. I had gone through the grieving process of ending that relationship before i actually ended it, since my ex was the only person I could socialize with in person for a while since I work in healthcare and my friends parents or SOs are all at risk for getting super sick from covid. Call me a user. My ex came from a very patriarchal and proud culture and I knew would not have talked to me anymore if i broke up with him, despite the circumstances where I was one of the only people he could see in person. Not that I would have blamed him.

Fast forward to now. My now bf (we'll call him James) is honestly what I didn't know I needed. He is kind, understanding, crazy intelligent but very humble, honest, sweet and makes me laugh. We clicked instantly and I'm honestly happy, for the first time in a while. He is a lot like me, kind of different but uses his quirks to his benefit. He is in almost finished with a doctoral degree with an awesome job lined up and is super supportive of me in my grad school endeavors. He is also positive, very open and is a good listener. I feel like I can trust him, which is an awesome feeling!

I honestly feel like I don't deserve him sometimes and already feel like I'm a huge disappointment and am just waiting for him to politely say that we aren't compatible or that he can't feel a connection anymore. He has not given any reason for me to think this would happen anytime soon. It's all in my head. 

I have OCD, anxiety and depression and was finally diagnosed with ADHD which was an additional cause situational anxiety and depression. I am getting a counselor, got my anti anxiety/depression meds increased and am going to try focusing on taking better care of my mental health. I grew up constantly being talked down to and abused by my parents and helped raise my younger siblings, esp. when my mom went off the deep end, so between my mental health issues and growing up being told how shitty I am by my (truly) borderline parents and looking out for my siblings, this feeling of healthy emotional nourishment is like drinking cool water after hiking for 5 hours in a desert. With my neurotransmitter imbalance I can't help but get very anxious and start preparing myself for when this happy period is over. 

I know I sound crazy, probably for a couple reasons:

1. James and I have only talked each other since mid July and have been dating irl over two months. The thing is that I have dated a lot (often dated just to date and learn about myself and men, and have had serious relationships) and I haven't felt this in sync with really anyone like I have with James, even with those I've dated for months or even over a year.

2. Between the stress of work, grad school, having a nutjob family, a traumatic work experience (that I and multiple others fled a couple months ago) and covid changing so many things, how could I think my thoughts about myself hold enough truth for me to fear what they are telling me is true? I KNOW they aren't based in rationality.

I know how my neurotransmitter imbalances affect me and WHY I feel the way I do, on a scientific level. Why am I so afraid of fucking up my future and ruining any chance of a happy future I've always hoped for to the point where I am already depressed over it? How screwed up is that? I'm so pissed at myself.

Tl;dr:

My boyfriend is incredible, truly unlike anyone I've ever met, let alone dated. Why am I letting my mental health issues get me so down when I know these negative thoughts don't hold truth? Why can't I just be happy?",21Oct2020,1
68,"I’ve handled worse, I’ve done so much more...

I’m 25M, I’ve worked 4 jobs all while juggling university, exercising, and maintaining good health. 

During university, I worked as a bank teller, a research assistant job at university, I did Uber/UberEats and tutored math virtually and in person for high-school students. 

On top of all this I suffer from depression along with ADHD. 

Yet i still fought through all of that, and today I’m proud to be working in my field (even though I hate the particular location I’m at) 

Additionally I have planned to study for the CFA exam.. but nowadays I can’t do anything.

My mental health has literally just gone down the drain, I’ve started smoking an intense amount of weed on a daily basis, my ADHD meds don’t seem to be doing much, my room is a mess.. my washroom is even worse. (In terms of tidiness and clutter)

I’m having horrible mood swings, my sleeping pattern is ridiculous, the way I’ve been eating is disgusting... and I’m constantly hit with a wave of depression that pretty much takes up my entire day until I light up a joint which will numb that pain for a short period until my body starts to crave more.

I don’t talk about my feelings to anyone, I’ve tried multiple times and it’s never done me any good. 

I am not a fan of therapy for both the economic cost and as well as the fact that I don’t feel it would provide me any benefit. 

I want to tether off of medication because I feel as if it’s just making everything worse. 

I’m in a family of 6, and I’m the only one working with a stable income and I really want to make sure I can get myself together because if something were to happen to me then this family would shit the bed.

I’ve been feeling a little suicidal, I’ve been feeling overwhelmed with every thing, I can’t focus at work, I can’t focus at home to study, I don’t eat, I don’t sleep... Every day just seems like a dreadful chore.

A week and a half later I took a couple hits of a blunt and felt the panic attack symptoms when I went back to my dorm. This time I could hear my thoughts. I almost had a panic attack but realized I was feeling the same as last time which calmed me down. After that day I would become very anxious and feel very derealized. The day after I only had two shots and of alchohol with my girlfriend and that’s when my derealization straight kicked in. Ever since that day I feel very anxious anywhere I go,  im starting to question my existence and whether what I’m seeing is real, and I’ve been depressed. Is there any way I could go back to normal.

77,"Anxiety is not my primary issue. It's definitely depression. But I've been told it can be a bit of a horseshoe (people with severe anxiety can peak with an experience of severe depression and visa versa). My anxiety attack ""moments"" have gotten more and more regular. I call them ""moments"" because at these points I feel as though I am balancing on an edge. If I ask someone to hold my hand and tell me about their day I almost always come out of it. It's awkward, but way less awkward than the alternative. About 25% of the time I vomit a minute or two before the point of no return.

However, the moments leading up to it have become increasingly similar and increasingly intense. My vision seems to split, with a portion leaning towards gray-scale. Then I can remember my dreams (those that would've been otherwise completely forgotten or lost) in excruciating detail. It even tastes like I am dreaming. If I continue to attempt to remember or accept that state of dreaming an anxiety attack is most certainly imminent.

80,"So, I have been on a bout with bad medications for a while. I have pretty severe depression and anxiety. I have an appointment next week to get this fixed, but it’s causing me to have no interest in anything - especially my job. I can FEEL myself being bad at my job, but I just can’t gather the energy to try. And that makes me more depressed and so on.

I feel so empty and hollow all the time. I feel like I’m in a fog and my meds have numbed all emotion. But if I skip a day, I become the most irritable person ever. Any little thing causes me annoyance. So I stay on them. 

I just don’t really know what to do. My boss knows I have health issues (just because I go to doctors a lot - she doesn’t know they’re therapists), so I would hope she’d talk to me about it before firing me out of the blue.

But this could also be my anxiety. I get decent marks (above average) on performance reviews, so really I have no reason to believe I’d be fired.

Does anyone else’s imagination... for lack of better description, take away from their real life? Like, constantly going, never stopping, and not in a good way?

I’m in my early twenties and I know well what my reality is. This isn’t some imaginary friend shit. It’s something else. Constantly, when I’m falling asleep, waking up, in class, at work, or even in the midst of a conversation, my mind is constantly dreaming up these alternative scenarios. Like, I’m someone else, somewhere else, in this whole different reality and a different personality. As I’m having a conversation or listening to another person talk, I can always hear what this other me would say and eventually I’ll have a whole different “conversation” or set of events carrying out in the back of my head while reality goes on.

It is so frustrating. Part of this is because “other me” and “other world” is usually some kind of reflection of all the things I hate about myself, my body, my life, and so on. Like, this other person is openly themself, or they already have top surgery, or they’re just... I don’t know. Cooler? More likeable? I guess that sounds juvenile but the point is that this has been going on for literal years at every waking moment, and I can’t for the life of me make it stop.

Since My freshman year (I’m straight out of senior year starting university right now), I have struggled with OCD symptoms; intolerance for uncertainty, attachment issues, and excessive guilt. And Quarantine, starting university, and a personal matter hasn’t made it any easier. 

I still feel like absolute shit every day. However, I have been fighting like a battleship lately to be proactive about my mental health and I am proud of some of my victories in all areas of my life. 

1. Academics / Studies. Starting university was a bumpy road definitely. I would occassionally miss a deadline or be too drained and anxious to study for tests, and got 50s or failed on them. However, it is getting better; I have been doing my best to study and have also gotten my fair share of 80s and above. Over the last week I aced a math test, a biology test, a lab report, and caught up completely in my studies. My average isn’t very good as of now, but I’m definitely on the fast track to turning it around. 

2. Health. I have not been taking the best care of my health. I still have trouble sleeping a lot, forget to stay hydrated and stuff. However, recently I started playing Just Dance every single day and it really helped me mentally and physically. I really love dancing to the screen and learning how to be better at dancing. Even mastered a few dances like 7 rings and thatpower extreme. Still have lots of bad health habits, but now I have one more good health habit so, that’s a breakthrough. P.S. I’m trying to master circus extreme by Britney Spears but the floor moves are WAY too hard so if any of you seen the just dance routine for that give me pointers lol. 

3. Writing extracurriculars. I took the initiative to join 2 writing organizations, where I write about mental health and sometimes other social issues like poverty and addiction. It is helping my mental health knowing my words have an impact. 

4. Found a performance opportunity for a musical talent. I’ve played piano for 6-7 years since I was little and gotten really good (can play liebestraum no 3) and I have very recently found a volunteer opportunity to play for elderly folks and people who are in sickness. I am glad to be able to use my talent to make their days brighter. It is something I look forward to pursuing and  it will intensely boost my mental health.

97,"In grade 11, I once made up an imaginary character. And she has inspired me to stand for mental health and to embrace all the awesome parts about myself. 

Let me tell you all about her. Her name is Mercy. She is a professional dancer by career and performs in a variety of locations. Her skills are incredible. She knows how to perform dances for all of today’s popular songs and can perform amazing lyrical solos too. Her costume is all red (she usually wears it most of the time), with the glistening word “Mercy” engraved on it in pink. The red symbolizes her strength and resilience, and the pink symbolizes her kindness. 

Her personality is something that I’ve always admired and aspired to be like. She is an incredibly kind and loving person to everyone she meets. She is understanding, comforting, and her presence can soothe the pain of her friends. 

If she sees someone who is depressed, she goes and comforts them. Asks them what is bothering them. She tells them what they need to hear, whether it’s an “I’m here for you” or an “I believe in you” or that “It’s okay to feel how you’re feeling.” 

If she sees her friend botch a performance, she will comfort them and remind them that she knows that they are a skilled dancer despite messing the performance up. “You are an amazing dancer and messing up the performance doesn’t change that fact. I am proud of how far you’ve come.” This goes the same for every other endeavour, whether it’s coursework, careers, or overcoming addictions. 

If she sees someone who is under immense pressure from the mounting deadlines in university or high school, she won’t add an ounce of pressure to their already overloaded and exhausted minds. She won’t tell you that you “just need to get over it and suck it up and deal with it.” She will comfort you. She will help you study. She will encourage you and tell you to keep trying if you fail. She will always believe in you no matter what mark you get. 

If she sees someone who constantly has to face the stigma of mental illness within society, she won’t contribute to it. She won’t tell you that you’re “weak” or you’re “dangerous” or that you “aren’t good enough”, all of which is a bunch of nonsense anyways. She will remind you of all the reasons you are a badass. All the reasons to believe in yourself. Everything you’ve accomplished. Every struggle you’ve overcome. She’ll tell you that she has always believed in your strength. Your awesomeness. Your power. You. 

Yesterday, I was feeling awful about myself. And I could just hear her voice tell me everything that is wonderful about me. How I treat my friends. How I am resilient. How I never give up. How I am funny. How I am a talented piano player. How I always want to be the best I can be. 

Embrace your awesomeness. Be proud of all the reason to be proud of yourself. 

She has taught me that it’s okay to be proud of who we are. It’s good for our mental health to see ourselves for our strengths and all the wonderful aspects. We need to love ourselves more and my friends agree. 

She has taught me that kindness is not weakness. You can be strong and be kind at the same time. Mercy is incredibly strong. She always keeps trying, always practicing, always not giving up on what means a lot to her. She’s not afraid to give everything her best. She gets hurt sometimes from the pressure and refuses to let it stop her. I will say it again: You can be strong and be kind at the same time. They’re not mutually exclusive. 

She has taught me what it truly means to love someone, to be there for them in their darkest times, with their darkest demons. Give them a non-judgemental, comforting friend. Encouraging them, reminding them of all the strength that is within them. Helping them find ways to feel better and cope instead of just dismissing their struggles. 

She has saved lives. LIVES. By being who she is. By being the amazing, compassionate human being she is. 

I want to be like Mercy. (Yes, I named this account after her because I wanted to be exactly like her in the way I talk to people). I want to follow her example. To be strong in the face of struggle. To persevere in what matters to me. Most importantly, to be kind and understanding to others who are struggling with mental health issues. Encouraging people. Making their day. Being there for them when they need it the most. 

In today’s climate, with all of the pressures of university, jobs, and society, we need more kindness in this world. We need more understanding. We need more encouragement. We need more empowerment. We need more cheering on each other. 

She is incredibly powerful, strong, and kind. That is why I want to be like her. And I am fiercely proud for wanting to be like her.",21Oct2020,1
98,So I have this friend that has been struggling with her mental health for years now. But I want to specifically ask advice on how to help her sleep. I believe that she needs to begin with making small steps to improve. She does not sleep at all because of her negative thoughts and because shes afriad to sleep and get nightmares.

104,"hi reddit, I’ve never made a post nor have I ever thought that I would do something like this... but scrolling through the mental health community has really I guess uplifted me? To share.. I actually don’t use reddit much, (partly because I don’t understand how to use it lol..) 

I’ve been feeling so lost the past couple of months. I fight with the thoughts of suicide and being not good enough everyday. When my life was chaos, I was just so tired of it all. now my life is still and I still struggle to want to live.

I have a beautiful life, loving family, loving friends group, loving boyfriend, shelter etc... I know I am not ugly too. But I can’t help but to feel how much better my loved ones lives would be without me. I have came clean to my trusted loved ones about fighting suicide because my therapist said it would help. While it did help... I also felt so horrible to trouble them with my issues, and that I would worry them.

I used to be very obnoxious and social and extremely confident. Somewhere this year it I slowly started to cripple away into this quiet, isolated human being. I almost don’t even know who I am anymore. I don’t recognize the person in front of me. 

I got help 5 months ago, talked to my doctor, saw a psychiatrist, I have a therapist as well that I see regularly. And I’m on meds. 

I feel like I’m doing everything right. Keeping my boyfriend in the loop (as we live together) and he is so loving and understanding but I feel so awful when he gets off work and comes home to an absolute mess. Today I cried for 2 hours in his arms because I just couldn’t bare with the pain anymore. 


I have a wonderful supportive boyfriend. We have had our hiccups and worked so hard to make this work, and he’s really come through. But I feel like I’m holding him back from his life before me aka being a bachelor, blazing and having lots of girlfriends (he distanced himself from them because they started to bully me, coming to my work and making a fool out of me... the one who came to my work is also his ex, and bestfriend when we met) I want him to live life to the fullest and not feel like he is restricted. I want him to do the things he wants to do. We might just different people and that’s okay. I have trouble believing the life we have made together is what he wants. I want him to come home and not feel obligated to comfort me or take me out and just kick back and relax. I feel legitimately awful when he has a long day at work and comforts me for hours in the evening. 

I’m kind of at a point where it’s like what’s the point of all of this? I’m in an intense and vicious cycle of not knowing my worth but also knowing I’m pretty cool too.  It’s pretty vicious because on one hand I feel beautiful and I feel confident and the other hand I feel like I’m not enough. 

I just want to disappear and come back when I am better. Time can’t stop for me to just repair. 

Tonight I thought of suicide. I think I have truly made my peace with the thought of killing my self. I don’t think I can live life the way I am feeling everyday. Putting on a smile and being the best I can be. I don’t want my boyfriend to come home to a mess everyday, I don’t want to trouble my friends, I don’t want to do this anymore. I want to be at peace. I know that putting them through my passing will be sad but I think they’ll also just get over it with time. I have thought to make a video to ensure that it was nobody’s fault and that nothing could have prevented it because I just want to rest. And I would be doing it on my own terms. I have a beautiful life, I feel beautiful, and I just think this is it, this is good, I can just rest. I’ve done my best, I did everything I could. I tried. And I’m tired. This is just a battle I don’t want to fight anymore and I’m happy with the thought of suicide. It doesn’t scare me anymore. I know it sounds fucked up, but I am genuinely grateful for everything in my life and everyone. I know I am loved, but my thoughts make it out that I am not supposed to be loved or that I don’t deserve it. I live with this intense guilt and I just don’t want to live life this way anymore. I just want to end my own suffering. I say this with a light heart, and I truly believe killing my self will help me be content. 

I’ve thought of it all. If I kill my self in my boyfriends apartment he won’t be able to sell the apartment for good value. I would need to go somewhere else. I would take a razor and cut myself deep vertically on my fore arm from wrist to elbow on both arms and then slit it horizontally at the wrist with a bottle of tequila in my best outfit and my makeup done right. I want to hang with my loved ones one last time and just make sure they know how much I love them. And then just let myself rest and be free of this chaotic world. 

If you’re reading this, I want to say thank you because it was super long, but also that I didn’t kill myself tonight. It was just the thoughts I had in my head or what runs through my head when these thoughts come up. Part of why I did not act on suicide tonight is because it is too cold and I would like to do it when the weather is nice and beautiful. I would like my last moments to be, peaceful... not out of fear and darkness. The other part of me is because my partner held me for 2 hours while I couldn’t stop crying and telling him that I loved him and that I was sorry. He knows it is difficult to ask for me to promise anything, but I can work with him and atleast take it one night at a time. 

I self harmed today and I know I shouldn’t. But hey atleast I didn’t kill my self haha 

And if you’re still reading, if you’re feeling the same way I do.. just know atleast now that you’re not alone. I looked all over reddit and couldn’t find a post where someone thought the way I did with suicide, in the sense that it doesn’t scare me anymore and that I’ve made my peace. We can fight it together.",21Oct2020,1

But I know it is. They aren't real I've made them up and I know that, but my mind says they are. I'm kind of scared of the fact that it's getting harder for me to separete what is real and what is not. 

I stayed up whole last night, because I heard this music. It was quiet, but it was there. I thought it came from my computer, which isn't possible it was closed and the sound didn't come from the speakers when I putted my ear on them. There was nothing. Just in case I took my computer out of my room, but I still heard it, just as loudly as before. 

Now I feel like I just imagined the music, but I can swear I heard it. There is nothing else that it could have come from than my computer though. So was it just my imagination? It felt so real. 

I'm scared. 

And I feel like I can't talk about this with my therapist since I feel like she always calls my mom and tells her everything. I don't want her to spread it to the whole family.

114,"Hi please excuse me if I am not making much sense. I need to rant.

When I was little and used to play outside near my house, my parents wouldn't allow me to go anywhere they cannot see. I mean they always watched what I was doing and if I went to one of my friend's house or just walked a little too far, they would scold me. They always asked what we were talking, why we were laughing ,etc.. My father always insists that he watches me whenever I go cycling and I'm only allowed to cycle rounds only near the house even now (I'm 16). 

Sometimes my father randomly walks into my room and asks what exactly I'm watching/listening. He once showed me that he knew all the songs that I listen to and he played them on the tv. I mean it's not a big deal but I just hate sharing anything with them.

My parents are weird... I don't know how to say this...they never listened to my feelings. Once I told them that I did not like how I am right now and they told me that I do not know anything that they are going through and that I have no reason to feel sad. My mother genuinely thinks that I am making unnecessary drama and she says that when I say that I have problems, I am emotionally.... I don't know what to say here... her. 

I do not like who I am. I do not want perfect grades. I just want things to end. I am crying now while writing this.

I want to experiment different things and find my purpose but my parents are telling me to become something useful. They want me to become this ""perfect"" person.

I tried to write a diary once but soon after I found my father flipping through that book a few days later and he seemed pissed out about me finding out.

I stopped attending violin classes because my parents wouldn't let me go there by myself and insisted on taking me and then complained about how difficult it was for them. They also used to tell me that I should be aware of the fact how much they were spending on those classes and that taking classes should be worthwhile. My father would show me people on the internet playing the violin and ask me to play like them.

They don't allow me to have any social media account when I asked them and they said that I wouldn't need it. I just created this reddit account today because I felt a little bit of courage today. I might end up deleting this.

I use my parents' WhatsApp to text my friends and later they read every single message that I send. Once my father found a candy wrapper in my room and asked how it came there as he did not buy me that candy.

Sometimes my parents do not tell me if any of my friends texted my parents' phone. They always ask every detail of every one who I talk to.

I have so many things to rant about but I became really uncomfortable just by even typing this out. Am I disrespectful for hating my parents?

122,"One year ago I came to this subreddit asking for assistance on how to find the joy in life again. I had given up, didn’t even think I’d make it through the rest of the year. 2020 may have been complete hell for a lot of people but for me, it changed my life. I got sick of feeling awful every day, I got sick of not being happy, sick of not wanting to wake up every day and sick of feeling lower than bedrock. I don’t know how I did it, maybe mental fortitude, I’m not completely sure. But one day I turned that “switch” in my mind off and haven’t looked back since. Now I haven’t done a full 180, more like a 145 but honestly I have never been happier. Yes, happy. For the first time in over 7 years I can finally say I am happy. My rescue dog Loki has been a huge help for that. Now I know my journey is far from over but right now I am maneuvering all the mental obstacles that get in my way, and I’m not done yet. I am going to make 2021 my bitch and make that 145 and full 180. Yeah only one person has told me they are proud of my progress and yeah he wasn’t even family, hadn’t even talked to the kid in over two years but that was one of the first things he said to me after we caught up. But I’m proud of myself. Now I want those of you struggling right now to see you this and know you can make it through whatever it is you are going through right now. You are going to be and always will be your strongest ally, but I believe in you all. I believe in the strength you all have because you are enough, you do mean something to each of those people you don’t think you do. Your life matters more than you could ever imagine.

123,"Me and my now ex-girlfriend have been together on and off for 4 years. Unfortunately very early on in the relationship she got pregnant and after a few months the reality of becoming a new mum manifested into depression and anxiety. This lead to a break up around the 4 month pregnancy milestone. We semi lost contact for the remaining pregnancy for her to focus on her new reality 

Fast forward to just before the birth of our child and we start talking and making arrangements, one of which is me making sure she has all the baby supplies she needs. Our child is born and we see each other weekly for a few hours a time for me to see my child. After 6 months the negative mental healthy comes down enough for us to try us again and for the following 2 years we have a cycle of getting better and making progress but when the ""next step"" in our relationship comes things fall apart and she doubt everything about me. This has manifested into: why is she with me, does she love me, is she just with me because I'm the only one who will, and who am I (her) now. 

We make it through though even dodging her leaving me for someone else because she wants to be with me and our family is what she wants. This was a year ago now. We go from strength to strength and when lock down hit in March (as well as me missing out on a promotion) it feels like we turn a corner. We start talking about moving location together for me to further my career and her to live with me in a fresh location and she is strongly asking me to propose already. 3 months ago I apply for a job 6 hours move away from my current location (somewhere she loves) and I get it. I sell my place, leave my job, and start buying a new place for the 3 of us. 

It's at this point we have another flare up of anxiety (which is obviously always in the background no matter what) and shes asking the question am I just with him for the family, do I love him, who am I and what do it want. 3 weeks ago she breaks up with me and a week ago she asks me not to wait for her because she doesnt like the pressure, she also does all she can to push me away.  At this point she is saying she hasn't been happy for a while but throughout the last 4 years she has steadily isolated her self from her friends, she has no job, and doesnt give herself self help and I cant help but feel these factors play more of a part into that unhappiness then our relationship where we laugh, love, support each other and have a healthy family vibe.

I know that the relationship was good and I have tried endless to support her. The old you cant help someone that doesnt help themselves. Thankfully she has now gotten in contact with old good friends, is getting out more, and taking care of herself. She is really overwhelmed so is taking it one day at a time, not thinking about us...which I appreciate and despite her being my world trying to respect as much as I can. 

My question is how should i proceed? Shes asked me to not wait for her and she has support from her friends, she knows I'm there for her but I'm the last person she wants to talk to about this now I guess. All I want to do is wait for her, i love her to bits. My female friends who have supported me for the last 3 years have told me to see other people and just see what happens one day but dont count on it but all I want to do is wait and be there for the mother of my child. At the same time I love her and want to give her what she needs. I dont want to be the ex that doesnt listen but with her history I dont want to just abandon her and this crisis. I want to be there with a hammer and nails to rebuild our relationship stronger than before so next time it doesnt fall down.

um I (18F) made a post about breaking up with my bf(19) because he was too supportive. I ended up not going through with it, well right now if I had to describe my life I would say its a mess and I'm really struggling with my mental health, at such times he is like a beacon for me, and in order to be able to help me he wants to know everything I am thinking, but I know this is gonna affect him adversely because he has been really affected from what I have told him until know. this causes me to hide my struggles from him which only hurts him more when he finds out later as he feels betrayed, I am stuck I a vicious loop, also it makes me feel like I am being needy and just doing it for attention, he has also stated calling me a synonym for kid lovingly or telling me that he will take care of everything, this only makes me feel more helpless and immature along with feeling like being treated like a kid which is a bit of a trigger for me not for anxiety but otherwise.

I just struggle sometimes and have no idea where to start improving myself and that also plays in to my thoughts of self hatred. I badly want to talk to others in person about my struggles, but its like I don't let myself. Talking online is different and its easy for me and I dont know why. I don't know where to go from here.",21Oct2020,1
130,"Title says it all I guess. I've been considering seeking a diagnosis for what I think might be PTSD because I'm personally not comfortable self-diagnosing. I also don't even know for sure if that's what it is. Like the voice in my head tells me that it's not even that bad, so it can't be PTSD and I'm just look for a way to feel ""special"" by having a diagnosis. Cause I can't stand people like that, who flaunt a mental illness like it makes them super deep and interesting, I don't want to be like that.


And let's say it was ptsd, I don't want to be medicated again and I don't think I could handle therapy, so what's the point? Other than knowing what's wrong and being able to explain it in a way that makes sense to other people.",21Oct2020,1

133,"A week ago I accidentally almost killed myself. I was taking anti anxiety medication, and was out drinking with my boyfriend. I drank till i started puking and blacking out. Obviously taking meds and using alcohol was really really irresponsible of me. It's no excuse, but I wasn't exactly in the best mindset to begin with. I've had a bad week, and was trying to drink my sorrows away.

My boyfriend knew of everything. he knew that I took pills, and what they were for. When I started blacking out he dropped me off at his apartment and continued on with his evening.

Something triggered me, I'm not sure what, but I remember grabbing the closest thing to me and slicing at my arm. I know I didn't want to kill myself, because I'm not suicidal. There was blood everywhere. My boyfriend's friend (Jay) heard me scream and rushed me to the ER. He called my bf At first, my bf didn't want to believe Jay. He said that they're over reacting or something. This reasoning makes sense Because I've self harmed before, although not to this extent. When bf got to his apartment, and saw all the blood, he grasped the severity of the situation. Apparently he got really mad.

They stiched me up and I woke up sober. I remember only bits of my visit to the ER. I don't remember how I got to the ER or who found me or what. Apparently my bf was acting like a jerk and him and Jay almost had a physical altercation.

At home, everything was okay at first. But when I was alone with my bf he refused to talk to me. Rightfully so. He said that I embarrased him infront of his friends and that I trashed the place with blood, blood that him and jay had to clean up on their own.

I understood his points and apologized. I offered no protest, and I feel awful for my behaviour. I apologized the next day to everyone involved. Including Jay. At least no one was too upset at me, although I made a mistake they said it's important that I move forward from here and not to let something like this happen again.

I went back to my own apartment. Then my boyfriend called me and said that we're better off apart and that he'd like to take a break. I know this is going to sound sad, but I don't have a support system. I don't really have friends either. All my friends moved away. That's why I'm writing to strangers online. I only had him and now he was leaving me and it was all my fault. I don't have a relationship with my parents either. My mother shunned me from the family a long time ago because I'm not in the same religious group than her. She believes that God's forsaken me a long time ago, and that not even prayer can save me.

So when he left me, i felt done. Like I've lost everything in the span of two days and I had no one to talk to about what happened. I couldn't call my mother and cry to her about how my boyfriend dumped me, and I couldn't go to one of my friends and cry over coffee. Because i don't have friends like that. Oh and my health insurance stopped paying for my therapist the following day aswell.

That evening bf called me up and said that he spoke to his mother about what happened. he said that he understands where he was wrong, that he was a jerk and that he'd like to support me and be there for me. He said that we need to focus on getting me help and getting me better first, and then focus on our relationship second. Which I appreciated. He said that if I'd like to talk or something,that he'll be there. He also said that he knows our relationship will be okay. He apologized for not being there for me, and he said that he thought leaving me would be best for me. But he realises that leaving me after such an incident isn't the best thing for me, unless it's what I truly want. Of course I didn't want that. So i took his offer.

But during this week I feel like he changed his mind or something. Or Maybe it's just my uncertainty, I'm not sure. I'm trying not to be too pushy or clingy. I understand that it's a difficult time for him too. 

I had to get my stitches removed today, and tried talking to him about it yesterday. I was concerned, scared and unsure. Obviously I've never been in a situation like this before. I thought that we could see each other, we live close by and I haven't spoken to anyone about what happened since. But I couldn't because he said that he's feeling weird seeing me. So I complied, gave him space and backed off.

Today was, as anticipated, extremely difficult for me. I went to have my stitches removed. But the cut isn't healing as it should. The skin is growing over each other and it's not even completely closed yet. I also found out that I've got permanent nerve damage. Like an entire section of my arm doesn't have any feeling in it whatsoever. I actually thought it was a pain blocker, but it was just me that cut through my nerves. The doctor said, unfortunately, I shouldn't expect it to ever be back to normal again Because nerves grow back really really slow and rarely completely . The nerve damage is so bad that my thumb is affected as well. I can't extend it to the fullest without feeling electricity. Also, my arm feels hard around the cut. It's all very foreign. The fact that this is self inflicted is literally gnawing at my sanity.

I've tried texting him but he's ignoring me. So I'm not going to push him to talk to me or anything. Maybe he's in shock. I can't imagine what effect this must've had on him.

Alternatively, I've tried downloading 7cups, then you can connect to a listener or a therapist. I can't afford a therapist so I went for the listener. But the first two listeners assigned to me almost immediately tried taking advantage of my situation when they heard I'm going through a ""breakup"" situation. So I uninstalled the app. 

That's why I decided to write to reddit. I can't keep this to myself and had to talk to someone, even if it is to random people online.  Sorry for the long read. I just wanted to get this off my chest. I want to be happy again. But I'm so mad at myself, I wish I've never done what I did. My academic work is suffering as well and this scar is a permanent reminder.",21Oct2020,1
134,"
few days ago my sister got back from a trip with her friends. the moment i saw her i knew something was wrong and so I tried to talk to her; apparently she took marijuana and got into a bad trip that triggered a lot of the thoughts she was trying to suppress for years. Including how abusive my father was (there was this incident where he touched her down there when she was a kid at the pool) and when i tried to get her to get these things off her chest she told me that when she was a kid there was this girl who used to sexually assault her in the schools bathroom. 
All of this is deeply heavy and I booked an appointment with a therapist for her yesterday and the therapist recommended a psychiatrist because she told me she might end up needing an anti-psychotics.

my sister is cannot confront herself and so she creates this image in her head about herself. She also suffers from these delusions and beliefs that people are conspiring against her and often times she might say mean things and the next second she would completely forget about. Her therapist told me to keep away any sharp objects and keep a close eye on her; since she is suicidal.

My point is; what do I do? I’m trying my best to be there for her. I’m currently a senior and working on getting my bachelor. But I do not know what do I do? how do we survive this?

135,"My girlfriend and I recently got a corgi puppy together, we had considered all the issues that may come and responsibilities and we were okay with it. Fast forward, she moves into an apartment with a random roomate who didn’t like me and only allowed me around for 3/7 days. This made it hard for my gf to take care of the dog and her mental state started breaking down. (PS. She was already suffering from depression, strong anxiety issues and mental breakdowns way before the dog) She started crying every night about how stressful it is and how she never has fun anymore or even free time. This is untrue as we still spend 4-5 hours a day watching movies, playing games or just laying together. However her saying that makes me absolutely crushed because I feel useless and no matter what I say to her , she gets frustrated at me and pushes me away when I’m just trying to help. I feel like I’m both  losing control and helpless in this situation. What do I do anymore? Do I keep repeating the same old things I keep saying to her to cheer her up or am I the problem?

Not having anyone to speak to or open up to is very difficult, and obviously COVID hasn’t done anything to make things easier.

It goes without saying, if anyone of you need someone to speak to on just about any topic, you may reach out me personally.

137,"Sorry for getting so depp but I'm just fucking tired of everything. I had to move 4 years ago and since then everything went downhill. I've been bullied for two years, including beating up and sexual harrassment. I never told anyone about it and when I tried to open up to my mother she started to blame me for the things that happened to me and that I should just get over it. My situation at home has been a constant shitshow. After school I couldn't find a job, I couldn't even get my high school dyploma so I've been staying with my mother and step father at home for over a year now. My mother can be a caring person if she wants to, but most of the time she's just a textbook BPD person. My step father on the other hand is just a straight up asshole, he has no respect for me and just wants to get rid of me. I've been applying for jobs every month like crazy but no one fucking wants me. I can't even move out cause I'm broke. I have no one with whom I could talk. Everytime I tried to open up to someone they started to blame me for everything or talk about themselves. I don't even know what to belive anymore. Am I the bad one? Maybe it really is all my fault. I feel like I'm going fucking insane. I can't sleep at night, get paranoid in social situations and constantly feel like someone is watching or following me.

140,"TLDR: My sister had an increase in an anti anxiety medication, was manic and not herself, and then finally went into the hospital and is now in a psych ward. Now she has access to a phone and laptop and is threatening my family and I just want her to get better.

My sister has always had anxiety issues and as a family we always supported whatever we could do. She was on sertraline for a while and it seemed to work. Last week her dose got increased and with that increase she changed. She started writing crazy and barely understandable Facebook posts, leaving us all messages, posting family secrets, and finally she kept changing moods and scaring her husband. This happened over the course of the last 3 days with increasing intensity. She said very hurtful things to and about me about how she didn't care about my feelings and that there would be consequences after I tried telling her that I was getting worried and that she needed to see someone. 

Yesterday she finally got to a hospital thanks to her husband calling her doctor. I thought this would finally cease, but it didn't. They put her in a psych ward where  She got access to a phone and a whole ass laptop and is calling my family, threatening to release more secrets, made a new Facebook, quit her job, and now is still in her manic phase. I haven't responded to her voice-mails, snapchats, messenger requests, or even her emails to my personal business email. My brother in law asked them to get rid of her phone and laptop as she shouldn't have access to it if she's in a psych ward and its an emotional trigger. 

 I just want her to get better but I can't visit her due to me just moving away from my home area and COVID making it so you can't see people in a hospital. I don't want to speak with her and possibly lose any progress she might get. So far all I know is that she wants out but her messages are insane and barely comprehensible. I just want my sister back.

The anger is usually not more than an hour or two, but the depression can last days depending on the circumstances. Growing up, I was always the one being pushed over and ignored, and I think that’s why I am the way I am, but I want to be content with not being the most important person in the room at all times.

142,"Hello good folks of reddit,  
TL;DR at the bottom. 

I-am a 25 years old guy who is still an academically unsuccessful university student. I suffer from anger management issues since my puberty. I will put a list of my observations on myself and my family below.

First of all a summary of my anger issue; I may enrage on pretty much anything and lose control; political discussions, constant but random sizzle of a device (such as a fan), a slowed down computer, sometimes people misunderstanding me, even high-pitched voice of an elderly women...or thought of an event that made my angry before makes me angry equally as if it happened again.  


Yet I prefer to punch inanimate objects than people, never ever hurt someone with that way but someday I might also I have cracked my hands several times already. Recently my girlfriend broke up with me and I think she feared my anger and sadly she is right about fearing... I did-not even think of harming her -ever, but of course she doesn't know my mind. I started losing people I love from my life and I suppose it’s time to get help before its too late. 

&amp;#x200B;

* I have started talking round 4.5 years old, when I was 4 my family contacted with a psychologist and run a test, psychologist said ""There is no mental deficiency also he has a great memory, he's      not talking because he doesn't see as necessity"", My mother rejects when I have asked her but my sister says ""You have Asperger’s syndrome"" not sure about it since my sister likes to make things seem dramatic,
* I've have been beaten by my sister (9 years older) until my puberty -until she wasn't able to, I suppose she had a horrible impact in my personality and confidence, she supressed me whenever      possible,
* I mostly get angry, lose control seriously quick (within seconds), start punching things or shouting and I either gain control and leave the place to get calm, if I will be forced to stay in the ground things might get ugly -that is the thing that makes me afraid most,
* I have contacted with a psychologist before for depression and anger management issue, after talking for a while she immediately handed me *the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory* after      solving it she said ""We will return to your problem but before there is something more important here, we need to solve it first"" never knew what was it since she rejected telling me and after a little while I left the city for the semester,
* My anger might be hereditary; Since my father also has anger issues, all of my paternal uncles (2) and male cousins also my grandfather. I also have 2 maternal uncles 1 has anger issues but it is      probably because of his diagnosed diabetes and other is pretty normal and calm,
* My anger might be learned behaviour; Since most of the  males I have seen in my early life was highly aggressive,
* I have some obsessive-compulsive tendencies; When I start a project or got an idea in my mind I cannot talk or think about anything else for a while, I have mild-to-moderate trichotillomania      (hair-pulling disorder) when I’m thinking on something I compulsively seek and pick out of shape beard hairs till render certain areas hairless,

**TL;DR:** I get angry over simple things extremely quick, lose control, harming myself or objects to avoid harming others, this made me start to lose people I love. All my paternal male relatives have same issue. 

Shall I contact with a psychologist or psychiatrist? Also, in my country psychiatry clinics are mostly free but even a decent psychologist charges a fortune per session so if it is a psychological problem, I have to find another way since I can barely afford my living. I will even accept using antidepressants that I won’t normally accept until I graduate and able to afford proper treatment.",21Oct2020,1

145,"I gained a healthy amount of weight during the course of my pregnancy, but after birth I was still at least 10kg above my pre-pregnancy weight. 

I've never liked my body much to begin with, and this weight gain as a result of pregnancy is messing with my body image issues even more. My postpartum depression complicates things much further.

It hits harder when nothing I owned can fit anymore. It sucks to see a whole wardrobe of clothes just become completely inaccessible to you.

I know its part of the process of pregnancy and childbirth, and I love my child to death. I've also been starting to swim every week since I like swimming, and walk about more daily for exercise. But whenever I look in the mirror I just want to give up. 

I want to find ways to cope with the body image issues that are being exacerbated. No doubt because I'm probably being impatient with myself as well, wanting to quickly shed the weight. It doesn't help that people around me (like my father in law) keep commenting that I've gained weight to my face. I feel especially stung when it's a guy that makes that comment too.

147,"Back in high school, there were many times where people have asked me to hang out but I just end up turning them down because I’m afraid that I would just end up shaking or over analysing situations/conversations in social gatherings. Looking back, it made realise that I missed out on developing new friendships with those whom I was interested in getting to know more and could see myself being great friends with - since we had the same interests.

On one occasion, someone called me to “speak up” in a group setting but I couldn’t because there were so many anxious thoughts racing in my head. In the past, there was also this loud person in my class who pointed out to everyone of how “awkward” I was and it has since took a huge toll on my confidence. It made cry and view myself negatively. Now, I am afraid whenever I meet new people. I always have this irrational fear that the other person will judge me for the way I speak/act or see me as an “awkward” person like how the loud kid saw me. As such, I don’t speak as much as how I’d like to and I think it somehow comes across to other person that I’m a cold person. Does anyone with social anxiety feel this way too?

I am very, very skeptical. 1) I don't believe I have ever had a different personalities. How abstract is the idea of personality? I will admit intermittent amnesia during some episodes. 2) The idea  that my self awareness would be so low, so low, it would scare me. 3) I have been in treatment for bipolar Disorder for years, and I feel like I more than meet the criteria for the DSM definition. 4) Even though I had moments of very intense physical and psychological abuse; to my knowledge, I  was never sexually abused (this is where I question my own memories and experiences) From my understanding, sexual abuse is the main type of trauma that causes this. 
I guess in short, what is the general consensus of the validity of Dissociative Identity Disorder? I have seen many criticisms, and many advocates. Maybe I misunderstand the general concept l, or maybe there is overlap, or even subjective.
I do take exception that my personal beliefs would by some be interpreted as delusional. I don't believe that, for example, that the general concept of ""reality"", is subjective. Religious experiences are valid. Extraterrestrial lifeforms are a real possibility. So whatever.

I don't want to burden my mother with anything because she is pretty old and she has a fair share of problems on her plate herself, so that option is out. When I try to talk about how I feel to my friends I can see they get visibly uncomfortable, and I feel that they started to despise me and try to avoid me. Because of that I started to resent them too and decided I won't speak to them any more, since they are better off without me. Only solace I had was my job there I was happy and when I felt sad I just focused on my work even more, but for about a month this method stopped working too, and my job no longer offers me protection from my own toughs, because of that I started to fall behind and I'm afraid they will let me go sometime soon. When I get home I have nothing to do, none to talk to. I thought maybe I should adopt a dog (I really love dogs) for some company, but the local shelter rejected my adoption application, and I was even denied a freaking dog that needed home (guess they found someone better I hope the dog is happy). I tried seeking help but where I live there is not much mental care provided by the state, only option is a private counselling, but I don't think the doctor would want me to get better because that would mean I would stop paying him money, also I can't really afford that.

154,"I'm 5'9"" with a thinner athletic hourglass figure. It seems like no matter how little/healthy I eat, I always have some sort of small gut and I hate it. At most, I eat 1 or 1 1/2 small meals with maybe a snack or two a day. I get so anxious and paranoid. But the thing is, I've always liked to eat, whether I'm hungry or not so much. So I havent been eating for the pleasure of it for the past couple weeks and I've been going for walks and doing some other exercises. But my mind and body has been getting super confused. Cause when you're hungry, you think of how good the food is going to taste.

So while I'm trying not to eat as much, especially not just out of boredom, I'm starting to not be able to tell the difference between feeling hungry and wanting to eat for the pleasure of it. I panic with eating too much of anything, but I'm conflicted because with the feeling of wanting to eat, I cant tell whether it's because I need it or I WANT it. I just hate looking at myself in the mirror or when I bend to one side and see a roll or two, even tho rolls are natural, but I still cant stand it. And with me being low on money, I cant afford to be too picky when it comes to good either.

I'm trying to grasp onto reality but it's so difficult. If it wasnt getting so cold out, I'd be out running my heart out. I still might try anyways. And my period is coming around and I can feel it starting to act up more and more and I'm starting to feel a little bloated from it which is making me even more anxious.

Is this some kind of eating disorder? Or am I just weird or messed up? I'm hoping this is just a phase, even tho this is the worst it's been. I remember being self conscious bout wat I've eaten before that lasted for as long as I can remember, but around that time, i just didnt care to eat much. It's worse now with these thoughts in my head. I guess I just needed to get this out there. I'm sick of always keeping everything to myself.

I constantly think or feel he actually wants that party life again. We’re over 30, me being 35. I have intense guilt and shame for my illnesses. I don’t know how to be happy.

160,"Hi all, this is my first post in this subreddit. I've had depression for nearly 20 years now, since my early teens, and it's taken almost as long to finally receive ongoing support from secondary care services. In addition to my depression and self harm I have trouble with coping, anxiety, comfort, taking care of myself, things like that.

On Monday my grandma fell in her own home and was injured. A carer has started coming in to help, but she really does need someone to stay over, which my dad has been doing. 

I initially offered to take over from my dad for a few days but became increasingly anxious and doubtful about it and, as soon as I talked to my therapist about it, she felt like it would be a huge push for me at this stage.

Both my mother and my brother are unwell too, which leaves my dad to do anything that needs doing. I feel awful about it in addition to genuinely wanting to help and spend time with my grandma.

I guess this is partially an ""am I a butthole?"" post as well - it isn't fair on my dad and I don't want to leave my grandma feeling like I just don't care to help. It's not really appropriate to tell her how bad things are for me so, from her perspective, it must be a bit funny that I'm just sat at home and yet I can't even come stay over for a few days to be helpful...",21Oct2020,1

I’ve seen a lot of people shit on the suicide hotlines as well, I personally have never called them but my friend has and she had a really good experience!

164,"Burner account. I have a long history of depression, decently managed with medication and occasional talk therapy. Still, even at my best I deal with pretty constant suicidal ideation. No attempts, no plans, and no real desire to kill myself. Just that consistent passive voice that says do it.

I talk to myself a lot and don’t realize I’m doing it. No one is talking to me, I’m not hearing voices. It’s just this repetitive monologue of suicidal ideation, saying I want to go to sleep, or saying I want to go home. 

When it’s fairly low intensity it’s easy to talk myself down and focus on other things. Sometimes it’s harder to control though, I’ll feel intense negative emotion and I’ll call out “I hate my life!” Or “I want to die!” It almost feels like a tick that comes out whether or not I want to. My biggest fear is it will come out in public and I’ll make a scene. It gets worse when I use cannabis.

At this point I don’t know what to do. Obviously I have some work to do on my emotional well-being but I’ve also been working crazy hard on that this past year. I got to a pretty good place for a while and then got my heart broken by an unrequited love. On top of that I lost my insurance and my new plan doesn’t cover nearly as much for mental health services.

170,"I'll start by saying that I've always been a been a very chill, level-headed guy. I always been complimented on how I never yell or have anger issues. I did have a moderate case of OCD that was treated with CBT a few years back, but that's it.

I dated my ex on and off for 5 years before breaking up for good. My ex was constantly breaking up with me during our relationship, and then would come within a week or two. The first breakups would hurt, but I'd pick my chin up and respect her decision and try to move on. After what seemed like the 10th or so breakup, I seemed to be hooked. I don't know if it was intermittent reinforcement, or I had just got more attached, but I started to take the break ups a bit harder. At one point during a break up, I was so fed up with her breaking up with me, I slept with an escort out of revenge for what she put through. Of course, she came back a few days later, and I felt incredibly guilty for what I did and confessed.

We were fine for a good while at this point, but of course the pattern continued, and she broke up with me again. This time seemed different, she seem committed to the break up. I was devastated and begged and cried for her to come back, but she was would not budge. However, this is where she was a bit selfish. Even though she broke up with me, she claimed to still love and miss me, but we just couldn't be together due to religious differences. She would call/text me every few days saying that she misses me, and wanted to hear me say it back. I would say it, and it would relieve her for a few days before she would call again. At this point I put my foot down, and blocked her. She started showing up to my house, and would beg me to see her. We started hooking up again, but she would not want to get back together. My mental health at this point was at it's absolute worst. I was crying all day long and could not function. I was just hoping for another breadcrumb, another invite from her to hook up again.

This is where I started thinking crazy. I thought if I get her pregnant, she can't leave again. So the next time she invited me, I went through with it. I immediately felt regretful for what I did, and we both cried, and we agreed for her to take the Plan B pill to be safe. Even though she took the pill, a small part of me still wanted her to be pregnant.

Thankfully she did not get pregnant. We did end up getting back together for 2 more years (on and off of course). But I think back to these two occasions of the escort and pregnancy trap, and can't help but think how crazy I was.

Since the final breakup, I've gotten obsessed with personality disorders, and I often get worried about having one.

I'm seeing a therapist now, and she doesn't think I'm crazy. She says that I was in a very toxic relationship, and that it how I was coping with the roller coaster of the relationship.",21Oct2020,1
171,"Hey guys, I (M 20yo) have fallen back into depression for a week now and it's weird. 

I've had a few destructive behaviors since I was a teen, but it's usually under control (I drink too much alcohol at certain periods, have way too much coffee, smoke too much during depressive episodes and I've had a bit of bad eating habits from time to time) but these are usually specific periods of time that don't last too long and only happen in certain contexts. I always recover really fast from it and go back to my pretty fulfilling and healthy lifestyle.

 Except it's all happening at the same time right now. I'm drinking at least a bottle of red wine every day (only at dinner, not during the day), I'm smoking a lot during the day, I don't leave the house (partly because I caught covid but mostly because I'm severely depressed) and most importantly I don't eat. I only eat at dinner, way less than I usually do, and kinda only eat so I can drink wine (I have dinner with my parents, we're French, to them a bottle of wine a day is pretty normal).

I'm very athletic usually but I got injured last week so I can't exercise in any way. I feel that this is getting out of hand. I don't feel like talking with anyone, the sole idea makes me tired, I can't talk to my best friends because talking to me recently ""made them sad"" (Their actual words).

172,"sorry if this is long if you don't want to read my summarised life story you can skip to the end and help me with my actual question thanks lol---&gt;

I'll start with I do have extremely bad OCD and anxiety that began when I was about 5 but got diagnosed by my doctor and a therapist at 12. I never wanted to go to school, I got bullied a lot.I've been 5'1 since I was 13 (thanks dad) and I'm a female. When I turned 13 my anxiety and OCD got even worse.I was very depressed and honestly hoped and prayed I wouldn't wake up when I went to sleep. I just ate my problems away and by the time I turned 16-17 I weighed 13 stone (82kg/182lbs) at 5""1.I decided I wanted to do something about it as I knew I was morbidly obese, but my idea was not to eat, and I ended up losing around 3 1/2 stone (22kg/49lbs) but I didnt feel any happier in fact, I felt worse, as my uncles, who actually were the ones who bought me a takeaway 3 days a week, and got mad when I didnt go with them, then made fun of me then for eating so much, started saying how better I looked, when I was starving myself( I dont talk to them anymore, my mam stopped too when she found out what they were saying). Then last year I finally decided to go back to my doctor and get prescribed medicine to help me. I weigh a bit under 9 stone at a healthy weight as of this moment and have began working out the last month and have been eating healthy for 2 years now. A takeaway maybe every 2 months and no sodas/fizzy drinks at all, just water. I can say I'm SO much happier. 7 months ago I was getting an electric guitar as I have acoustic and wanted to play electric because music has helped me at lot in my life and calms me down. The night before I was getting it, I was actually scared to go to sleep in case I didn't wake up. I cried, not at the fear of not waking up but I was happy I wanted to live. 


[QUESTION] so that brings me to my title I do feel happier now but I mainly still struggle with my weight. Some days I do eat less than I should but when I eat I feel like getting sick, Sometimes I actually start heaving and my mouth starts watering, I run and lean over the toilet but I can stop myself from actually throwing it back up.I was wondering if there is anyway I could get over this fear of eating/ I guess gaining weight? I'm getting prescribed prozac from my doctor instead of the sertraline bluefish tablets I've been taking for about a bit over a year now because I used to take the tablets in my food, now like I said I almost throw up the food expecially with the tablet in it. Will the prozac help this or is there anything else I can try? Thank you!",21Oct2020,1

178,"It has been long since we've been hearing to health advisories from superstars, doctors, friends, neighbours and family members regarding keeping calm, taking care of ourselves and not falling prey to depression and stress. We've also read multiple articles during this lockdown regarding the preventive methods we can adopt against stress and anxiety to develop positivity around us. 

But the questions that arise in the end are: **Have we been able to really conquer stress using these verbal and written advices? Have these general public health advisories been successful in rightfully impacting the instinct of humans towards their mental health?** There are a few more to follow but for sure it won't be comfortable for many of us to answer these two; given the amount of dire straits we've seen people get into in the near past or probably ever since the ramifications of the lockdown came into existence.

It's always said that **prevention is better than cure but have we ever noticed that it never meant that we shouldn't make efforts to find the cure**. The problem which the whole humanity faces today is modern and requires modern solutions. It's not easy to avoid one's mind from getting the thoughts anxiety and stress but definitely it is comparably easier to revive a disturbed mind back to normal, if aid is provided at the right moment and in the right manner.

Today, it has become a necessity for us to understand that mere advices and 'feel-good messages' won't do the job for us. We need to stand strong with the victim like family and provide him/her the commiseration he/she needs at that time. We need to sow the seed of togetherness in their barren minds of loneliness.

I'm 27F with a very average life for Western standards. My upbringing and family circumstances weren't perfect, but whose are nowadays? 

I've been living ignorantly happy lately. Due to Covid my workplace is only letting us work part-time, but where I live we are getting government aid so I'm getting by.

Anyway, I have way too much free-time now, and my boyfriend keeps encouraging me to discover new hobbies and he has been teaching me about online businesses that I could try. 
I have actually started looking into some things, but quickly gave up on all of them. And it got me thinking why.

I get extremely overwhelmed when hearing about all the things I could do and opportunities. Like I don't even know where to start. And then I start getting pessimistic: Why even bother, whatever I do there are already millions or people who are doing the same thing, with more experience, skills, better looks, whatever.

He has been challenging my life views a lot lately, for example by talking about property we could save up to buy in the future. Property? Me? Until now, I barely had enough money to pay my rent and car. I was always living in the moment, because thinking about the future was depressing me too much.

Btw I'd love to build a business with him together, I have always been more of a supporter than a leader. But he is already in the middle of building a business and out and about working 12+hours a day... makes me feel extra lazy and stupid for chilling my days away at home.

He has never been mean to me about it or anything, but he sometimes acts a little confused how I can be ""wasting"" time like that. 
I like it, because I am actually not happy with sitting on my sofa most days either. But I just cant focus and get myself to really start something...

Because I have no confidence that I could build anything at all...
How can I start believing in myself? Is changing your self-esteem even possible as an adult?

189,"Sorry if this is a bit of a ramble, but I would like to convey the major events of my life and how I’m feeling right now. It all really started in fourth grade when I got bullied by my classmates after moving to a new school. At first, I tried to counter it by acting weird on purpose which caused me to deserve more bullying, and eventually gave me permeant anxiety I still have to this day. Later on, in middle school and early years of high school I developed depression and was suicidal almost every day, but my one and only attempt was fucking pathetic and eventually I figured out that I was too much of a pussy to ever go through it. After being forced to go through therapy which didn’t help COVID happened and I utilized the time given to improve my situation and now I feel mostly nothing most of the time and am either mellow or have (surprisingly developed) extreme anger at everyone that I hold back and just let rot in the back of my head. I have since been reflecting on my life and have realized how pathetic I am. I’m insecure about my voice due to being called gay because of the way it sounds and hate how high pitch it is and that I can do nothing about it, and people either find me annoying or forget about me over the years. I have ruined most of my friendships by being weird. I can’t keep on living like this. I want to be seen as a person of high value by the people around me instead of just some skinny faggoty ugly loser, but don’t know how to. I have fleeting aspirations of being a comedian, but every time I try to crack a joke to make the people around me laugh and feel good it gets called too offensive or weird or I can’t even complete it because I have a severe stutter. I have genuine trouble understanding people and it feels like I’m different from everyone else. I’m beginning to contemplate suicide again but am fighting it off by saying in my mind that I need to accomplish things in my life, but as the day turns ‘round I feel more and more horrible about myself. My question to whoever reading this I guess is, how can I become a person of high social value? I want to be admired by people for being funny and not looked down upon, but I can never get it right.",21Oct2020,1

191,"So I've been trying to be more aware of myself and my behaviors and I noticed throughout my entire life I always have a distinct lack of empathy for people and their feelings. I myself can feel emotions so I know i'm not a psychopath but when it comes to understanding peoples emotional reactions I have absolutely no clue why people act the way they do and how to respond to others. For examples when my sister overdosed and my aunt died within 2 weeks of each other I never cried out of sadness or had fits of depression but I only cried one time in each situation because I felt like I was supposed to at the scene of the incident and at the funeral. Everyone also tells me that I speak incredibly blunt and mistake me for being aggressive because I don't sugar coat (i'm never being aggressive). I don't care about recieving attention from others, being liked, or being understood so I don't think i'm a narcissist. And I don't have any emotional instability or impulsivity like with borderline personality disorder or bipolar disorder. So besides being potentially a borderline psychopath or having empathy deficit disorder I really don't know what it could be so I want to go through the official test because it's always frustrating not being able to understand others, especially since i'm a female and women are expected to be more considerate of other peoples feelings. 
However, I mentioned taking these test to my mother and she doesn't want me to take them. She believes that i'm just trying to add an extra ""label"" to myself. I'm going to do the test anyway but how do I explain to her that I should still get an official diagnosis for whatever I may have.",21Oct2020,1
192,"Basically, around last October-March I went through a strange time. I lost friends, my friends lost friends and everything changed. I was in a new school and things were up in the air. During this time, I felt really down and had very little motivation. I couldn’t sleep, I had no appetite, and I was easily irritable. I was in a constant state for worry but I didn’t always know what that worry was. Lockdown started and that managed to give me some time to work on myself. I wasn’t bombarded with pressure to socialise, I could just improve me. I did that. Since then and up until recently, I’ve been so much better and was even telling myself how proud I was. 

Yesterday it all changed. It’s like a switch was flicked and I felt the exact same way as I did last year. It’s so unexplainable. I hate it so much, I started crying about it today because I thought this time round it would be different. My friendship group isn’t what it used to be, but I have good friends. We don’t go out and socialise very often, and socialisation suddenly became very scary for me to the point of me just giving up on it. I feel like I’m not a very good friend because of that. However, I didn’t think I would feel like this at all, I was looking forward to moving on and through new year and everything... I hate how I’m feeling so much. It’s so hard to describe but it’s like the worst feeling ever. I just want to shut my eyes and make everything go away. I’m overwhelmed and I just need some help.",21Oct2020,1

196,"Ok, so this is my first post. Sorry if I don’t do this correctly. Anyways....
I’m wondering if I’m pulling myself into too many directions. I know I’m really the only one that knows how to gauge that but I want to see if you guys/gals believe I am doing too much. 

Here’s my regular schedule:
* I have 5 college classes that I generally study 3-4 hour a week each.

* Since what I want to do after college is software development/something techy I spend 1-2hours over the weekend learning extra things outside of my classes.

* I am trying to learn Japanese because I really want a new and fresh perspective in life. Currently I’m studying Japanese for 1-2 hours on the weekend. Possibly planning to do it 1 hour every weekday. (Depending on how you guys react to my schedule)

* I workout on every other weekday for about 1-2 hours

* I really love drawing so I try to draw whenever I have time.

* I have a dog that I have to care for. (I won’t stop that)

* I clean religiously (I won’t stop that)

* I try to read when I have time (I won’t stop that)

* I really want to learn the piano

* I don’t really have a social life but I might start trying to do things with people (after this whole COVID thing of course)

* And I love video games (I might have to stop playing them so much)

*And then like every other human I have about a thousand appointments a month.

(I’m 19 about to turn 20. I do all of these things because I am constantly focused on bettering myself. I plan on constantly working all of my 20’s and I don’t really see a need for a girlfriend)

Again sorry if I did this post thing wrong.",21Oct2020,1
197,"So my ex (27M) and I (20F) broke up months ago after dating for about 2 years. He has very severe Borderline Personality Disorder and doesn’t have health insurance so he doesn’t get the help that he needs to manage his incredibly intense emotions. We have remained very close friends since he broke up with me and we still love each other very much, but he has repeatedly encouraged me to move on and find someone new—he just says that he doesn’t want to know anything about it because he knows he would be jealous. So like I said it’s been months since we broke up and I haven’t attempted to talk to other guys up until now. I’ve hung out with this guy I used to work with a couple times over the past few weeks and of course not mentioned anything to my ex. This past Saturday the guy and I had planned for him to come pick me up so we could go get takeout. About 30 mins before he’s supposed to pick me up, my ex texts me and says he’s on a walk near my house and asks if he can come say Hi to me and my roommate that he’s also friends with. He does this regularly and usually only stays for like 5 minutes. I tell him that he can stop by but that I have a friend coming to pick me up in a little bit. For some reason this time in particular, my ex stays longer than usual and he’s still there by the time the guy shows up to pick me up. I tell him that my friend is here and we’re going to pick up food. He stays inside because he’s still talking to my roommate. I go out and get in the guys car and I see my ex run up to the window to see who I’m getting in the car with. My roommate told me that he asked who it was I was getting in the car with and she told him that it was just a friend I used to work with and he left without saying anything else. So the night goes on and the guy and I are just hanging out at my house and around 8 I start getting texts from my ex that are like “WHAT THE FCK IS WRONG WITH YOU WHY WOULD YOU HAVE ME OVER WHILE YOU GOT READY FOR A FCKING DATE YOU SICK FUCK.” I respond with something like “Don’t be ridiculous I wasn’t trying to make you jealous,, you know I would do anything for you.” He continues to berate me telling me I did it on purpose to hurt him. I don’t respond. Around midnight we here this violent banging on my front door and it scares the shit out of me because I live in a kinda sketchy neighborhood so I literally grab my taser and try to discreetly peak out the blinds to see who it is. It’s my ex at the door and he sees me peaking out the window and he screams at me to open the door. I open the door and he starts screaming “WHERE IS HE? WHERE THE FUCK IS HE?”  The dude I have over comes out of my room and is like “Umm what’s going on?” and my ex starts yelling at him that he needs to leave immediately. An verbal altercation ensues for like 7 minutes and my ex goes “He has to leave right now or you will never fcking see or hear from me ever again. I swear to god.” So obviously I don’t want to never see him again but I’m not going to make the dude I have over leave because he’d probably never talk to me again and I assume my ex is just having an episode that he would come out of later. So he leaves and tells me he’ll never see me again. The guy I have over leaves soon after because the situation has obviously made him very uncomfortable. Then I get more texts from my ex that are like “I’m coming back and if he’s still there I’m going to beat the shit out of him and go to jail.” I immediately drive to my ex’s house to try to calm him down but he screams at me at the top of his lungs that he hates me and never wants to see me again, so I leave and notice shortly after that he’s blocked me on everything. Around 4am my roommate comes into my room freaking out because my ex has sent her a video of him slashing his face open with a razor. I immediately rush over to his house again and he refuses to let me in so I just sit outside his door for like 15 minutes before he finally opens it. His entire face and body is covered with blood. He’s still pissed at me and telling me he hates me but eventually he calms down enough to let me clean the blood and bandage his cuts. Both emotionally drained, we fall asleep next to each other for a few hours and when we wake up he doesn’t seem to be mad at me anymore. We talk for a little bit and he apologizes and I leave telling him that I will always love him. Then, the next day I get a text from him telling me that we need to talk. I head over to his house and he comes out and gets in my car and says “I’m just going to make this quick so it doesn’t get ugly. You have broken my heart and I never want to see you ever again.” He then proceeds to say the most hurtful things he could possibly say to me having known me so long for so well. He tells me that he knows at heart that I am a terrible person and that I am just like my dad who cheated on my mom and tore apart my family. He gets out of the car and I just sit there sobbing for several minutes before I drive to the liquor store and get a bottle of vodka. I drive to my house and chug that shit because I know the best I can do is just pass out for the night. I don’t hear from my ex until last night. He unblocked my number just to verbally assault me over text some more. He calls me a heartless bitch and a pathological liar and tells me i’m not the person he fell in love with. I try to defend myself but it just makes him more mad. He blocks me again shortly after, and here we are now. Knowing my ex and his mental illness, I should have known better than to let him come over before that boy came to pick me up. I will admit that. But I truly didn’t mean to hurt him like this. I hate knowing that I’m the source of this immense pain that he’s experiencing. He truly believes that I was out to break his heart despite the fact he broke mine when he broke up with me months ago. He and I have gotten in bad fights in the past but nothing this intense. I don’t want to lose him forever because I care and worry about him so much but I know this isn’t good for me. Any advice? Sorry for the long ass post—I didn’t want to leave too much detail out. Thanks guys",21Oct2020,1

199,"This is my post here, although I've been tempted to engage for awhile since I joined this subreddit.

Anywho...this is something that often weighs on my mind, and I have sort of this mental battle within me about forgiveness.  On one hand, sure I can forgive small things like unintentional mistakes, but where do you draw the line in forgiving someone that hurt you in some way?

Despite coming from a religious family, I believe in God but I absolutely detest all forms of Christianity, and I definitely look down on those in our Black community who still worship and are brain-washed by ""White Jesus"".  With that mentality, we as Black people, unfortunately, tend to forgive the most egregious shit (like molestation/sexual abuse and murder), but I've always been more of a believer in ""eye for an eye"".  I've always heard that with forgiveness, it's suppose to ""free"" the offended person and not necessarily as a means to reconciliation, but to me, that also holds the door open to the same offender to do the same shit again and again.  I would rather do bodily harm to you after the first time so you wouldn't think twice of doing it again...you do something that fucked-up to me, I couldn't let you get away with that action.

So...are you for forgiveness or vengeance?",21Oct2020,1
200,"I’m(M18) not super into food as a person. I’m 5’6” and 130 lbs for context, not a big guy. Some people really like food, I’m more indifferent. I eat to fuel myself. I enjoy junk food as much as anyone else, but I typically eat fruit as a snack over chips. I’ve been vegetarian for over four years now, but I still eat eggs and cheese fairly regularly. 

When I moved on campus to start college, I slowly became less hungry. I know it happens to me with stress, but never to this extent. Usually I eat because I know I need to, even if I don’t feel hungry. I started just eating one time a day in the dining hall, just to force myself to eat something, and that was it. But now I’m even more averse to food.

I get nauseous whenever I eat. It was a problem for a short amount of time that I could only eat without nausea when I smoked bud, but I’m taking a tolerance break rn(a week so far without smoking atm) bc I recognized that problem. I was forcing myself to eat for a couple of weeks, but yesterday I decided I would only eat if I felt hungry, to see if that helped the nausea. It’s been 24 hours and I’m still not hungry, I ate a normal sized meal the night before.

I’m immensely depressed and suicidal(I have a plan and will probably act on it soon) but I have no clue what to do with myself. Anxiety as well, definitely all of this contributes to the constant nausea. Maybe will make a different post about that. 

TLDR

Right now I’m just looking for advice on how to eat. Is it good for me to force myself to eat even if I’m not hungry and it gives me nausea? Is there any technique that would help with this? It’s been worse before with me throwing up pretty much every day, and I’m not there right now, but I feel hopeless. I honestly feel like it’s kind of a good thing because if this goes on long enough I’ll just starve to death and not have to take my own action to kill myself.",21Oct2020,1
201,"WARNING: MENTION OF SELF-HARM

Hi, I’m currently 16 and have been struggling for the past 6 years of constant self-hatred filled with panic attacks and breakdowns. 
I’m writing this here and only now because I just finished having a breakdown after some classmates triggered me. 

When I turned 10 I moved to another country, I was already pretty stressed about it since I had to leave my back then “friends” and my grandparents whom I really loved. 
Since day one in my new school, I got bullied for being overweight and not speaking that language. 
I was a bubbly and dumb kid tho, so I took the insults without minding them at first and tried to befriend other kids. 

When I turned 12 I was most certain that the other kids were making fun of me, and therefore I started to become more and more closed.
I thought it was because my clothes weren’t as cool as theirs, or because I didn’t had a phone to fully socialize with them. 
So I asked my parents for better clothes and a phone. I started dressing differently, but for all I could do the response was always the same shitty insults at my face and my body. 
After a while, I did get a phone.
I was so happy I told every classmate and one of them even added me in the class group. 
I was really into it, I thought they changed their mind and actually liked me. 
So I started chatting in the group, until I received a text message from a person I didn’t know nor have save in my contact list, I don’t remember the correct words, but I’m pretty sure it was something along with; 
“Are you ###### the whale from class ## ?“ 
with a picture of my back walking to school. 

Useless to say, I cried reading that. 
Have I said something bad? Did I offend someone for them to say something like this to me? 

I didn’t say anything and just blocked the number, but new numbers came everyday with new insults and pictures of me. 

I was so afraid to go to school, to leave the house, even answering the house phone made me so paranoid. 
And whenever I did leave the house, I would hide my face with my hair or with my jacket. 
I would tell my parents to stop putting pictures of me around the house and slowly I would hide every mirror.

Everybody in school forgot what I sounded like for a whole year. 

Eventually, I started to self harm. 
But no cutting, I was afraid of blood, so everytime I would take a lighter at school and burn my skin in the school’s bathrooms. 
And from that point on I started having panic attacks and fainting at school, for then praying for my teacher not to call my parents because they would just think that I want attention no matter if bad or good. 
I tried to kill myself in different ways, with my mom’s pills, the kitchen knifes, I tried jumping from my window. 
I only tried to stab myself but my mom find out and it was a shit show. 

My parents allowed me to go to the school “psychologist” (it was just a lady that helped “troubled” students) and she was the only one I could talk to most of the time. 
She noticed how sad and tired I was, and often would throw around the word “clinical depression” and “social anxiety” along side with “agoraphobia” and all that shit i still identified to this day. 

When I started going to high school, things really started going for the better. 
I stopped self harming, I started trusting a friend of mine who then became my best friend.

Then, at the age of 15 i moved back to my home country, and there the new school system fucked me up and triggered my anxiety most of the time.

Since I also started to be on the class group after years. 

They were nice, and understood my struggles. 
But everytime I would enjoy my time in that group, I would turn off my phone and stare at it. 
Waiting for a text to insult me.
To drag me down.
To tear me apart and make me go back to my dark times. 

Today, I had a discussion with my classmates and I closed the phone crying and was afraid to open it again. 

I’m so sick of feeling like this.
My parents know I’m mentally unstable, but they won’t send me to a psychologist because they are expensive and just there to fill up people with drugs. 

But isn’t that what sad and empty people want? To forget the pain for a little? Wouldn’t that be nice for at least a minute? 

I just want to know a way to forget my pain. 

I used to draw but when I do now I hate what I do. 
Art, music, rain, silence. 
The things I used to love are making me realize how sad I am and how bad I’m getting to hide those feeling when everything around me is falling apart.

204,"With these stressful times, I feel like I'm becoming hyper fixated on the health of my close ones that I live with - my grandma and my mum. Maybe it has to do with the fact that ever since I was a kid whenever I've been too willful/talkative during stressful times, they've always accused me of 'wanting to kill them by stressing them out even more'. 

So now that we're all stuck together during lockdown and we also have other stress factors, whenever I complain too much I get this numbing anxiety that me talking too much would make them have a heart attack or a stroke or something and I shud up.

This is especially bad at nighttime when we all go to sleep and I just feel stressed out if one of them will die in their sleep or something (we've all been through too much stress, not even counting this year's pandemic - new country, my mum lost her job, we were on the brink of becoming homeless, my grandma moved with us and left everything she knew at 83). And she's 83 even if she's in great health. I just worry about her. 

My cat will also have a neutering surgery next week at the age of 4 (she was on hormonal injections before that). Both me and my mum have a fear of surgeries because my granddad and my uncle died during a surgery and my mum almost died when she gave birth to me because they didn't give her the proper amount of anesthesia. So I'm extremely stressed out about my cat. 

I also just finished my studies and will be graduating this March and I'm just so stressed out about finding a job after my current internship ends and I had a major falling out with my childhood best friend, and another one of my best friends sorta did a disappearing act and I realised she didn't care so much about me. I also feel very frustrated with my love life and I think I might fancy one of my guy friends but he's so, so, SO different from everything I've ever found romantic but I just find his personality so... intoxicating and so refreshing. He's just so... lively. But a part of me still thinks I want someone I can idealise and romanticise.

205,"I feel like alot is going wrong in my life .EVen the good stuff i find it often doesnt make me happy  .For example we got wifi at our house today and my brothers were all excisted..but me not so much .I mean sure its good a thing but the past days ive been just feeling numb and like i have a huge ball of pain in my throat and chest like I am always about to cry its hard to find enough privacy to do tht since I live in an appartement with 4 brothers. I also feel like tht i have overemotional reactions to stuff . I feel like my brain is foggy all the time but when i didnt go to college for 6 mounths due to covid I started feeling more like my self .I even started reading for fun for the first time since i was a kid. alot is happening in my life atm:

* I am studying electronic engeering  (2nd year) atm but i am seriosly thinking more and more about switching to english studies .I mainly choose my current uni cause they teach in english not because of electronics or engeering I didnt even do much reaserch before choosing it I take all the responsibilty for that because i was foolish and followed wht my dad told about the uni that companies will come and take you abroad...Thats def not true it might have been like tht in the 80s but my current college has lost that position years ago and the degree is wothless now basicly.Ever since i got to college I havent been feeling like my self . I dont think I have what it takes to succed in my current uni without it having a negative impact on me mentally (I am talking about only minimal passing grades btw) . More details in my post history.Thankfully college is free were i live.
* I dont wanna live in my country especially since i have really religious old fashioned muslim parents and i dont share alot of values with them atm. my mother basicly went into rage mode and then cried because we were casually talking and I said that i might not marry a woman tht wears a veil and stuff.I might even marry a non muslim as I plan to live abroad but i didnt tell her that.
* The only good thing in my life atm is tht i met a partner tht lives close to me instead of an online partner for the first time .She actually studies english wish is right next to my engeering uni so if i switch id study there too basicly.( we havent met irl yet per say but she did see me passing through the other day.Just thinking at meeting her makes me smile even at these miserable times...
* My mother might disown me in the future if i dont meet her strict ideals as she talks about this all the time....I am not sure about my dad tho . This mean tht I wanna be indipendent asap wich is putting alot of pressure on me tbh but idk how to get enough money to leave unless I apply for a scholarship to study abroad then work there.I cant get that much high grades in EE wich is another reason I might try english.I feel like even I have a physical home I dont feel like I do have a home at least emotionally .
* I have realized this year how miserable my parents marriage is and with divorce being so taboo her especially for women as divorced women are often looked down upon in this society.
* I dont really have any dreams about normal jobs I wish i did tbh maybe i am just lazy idk.. I wanna do something creative that I actually enjoy in the future ...might writing music or films or acting maybe smth to do with nature instead idk.. 
* I feel sad sometimes for no apparent reason and I think maybe something is wrong with my brain...I also find it extremly hard to study for engeering exams and to focus maybe thats cause I find it boring to study about machines  and circuits and stuff it makes me feel down if i study and guilty if i dont ....or maybe something is wrong with my brain or maybe my mother is right and i am just lazy

My mother says that the reason I dont wanna do EE is because I am lazy and dont wanna work hard she was angy so maybe he didnt mean but maybe she did idk . I think I would have no prblm working hard if i studied smth i enjoy tbh and I have always loved english and got good grades in it without trying that hard.

 I just feel like I am gonna explode I started having some really negative and dark thoughts recently that I didnt have in a long time...I dont wanna ask my dad for therapy money because I dont wanna depend on him so much i feel guilty for just asking him money to buy new clothes hes an civil engneering but still hes not wealthy by any means.Idk what to do tbh.

He started acting out, doing what he wanted, became quick to temper, and not listening to my parents a bit over two years ago. For reference im 23 and my brother is 17. At first i was angry. I watched him fight with my mother and step father, with nothing changing for the better part of two years. He kept doing these outrageous things that we just couldn’t get why he would do these things. As of recently though, things starting to make more sense. 

He recently felt unsafe in his own home and needed to leave, as in, go to a hospital kinda safe. It was so surreal because i never thought mental health would be related to any of this. That was about a week and a half ago. During that time he got an mri to look at his brain for any damage. We all thought this might be the case, as he had played a few good years of sports and gotten a few bad concussions. However, the results were negative. His brain was fine. After a few more tests, doctors ruled him with severe bipolar disorder.

Flash forward to today as he felt refreshed and was scheduled to come home, so he was discharged. I see him and he looks good. Hes talking to me and everything is going well. However, i cant shake this feeling that all of this thats been going on for so long, was solved in a weeks trip. A few hours into the day i come downstairs and see my mom getting ready to leave with my brother. He asks me for a hug and cries onto my shoulder. I wasn’t quite sure how to react besides trying to comfort him. Heres what really got to me though. He cries pretty hard onto my shoulder, wipes his eyes then almost immediately like *snap* he is like “okay mom wheres this stuff and that stuff” almost no sadness or anything. Just complete turn of emotion. I know i shouldn’t be shocked, as this is the definition of being bipolar, however i hadn’t really come across it as this quick in emotional change. 

It really...just got to me i don’t know. He left a few minutes ago and im glad he’s going back for more help. Not really sure why i went on this whole rant because it helps nobody. I suppose i just needed an ear. 

Have a good day everyone",21Oct2020,1

Its not like I hate them for anything in particular they're just so fucking boring, listening to the same music wearing the same clothes acting the same as everyone else, I just can't bring myself to enjoy being around them, I have no school social life I have friends outside of school and friends online but not at school. I'm not going to be some wannabe wah wah I'm so depressed look at me mister fucking edge lord over here, I believe this is an issue. Not really sure what it is, I'm not shy though if someone speaks directly to me or asks me a question specifically I will speak and can speak just fine. And the fact people actually care about fitting in is strange to me. I also spend about 4 hours after I get home lying in bed role-playing a leukemia patient instead of doing something productive but I think that's normal, but I don't have a reason to be depressed so that can't be it.

211,"I'm a 25yo guy. I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for most of my life. 
Had a rough summer. I just landed the promotion I was basically dreaming about and started dating this awesome girl (19yo). That halpened in a span of a week this past August. 
That girl made me realise that one is young once, and that I have spent the majority of my 20s sat infront of a computer every day Mon till Fri until midnight.
I really started thinking...am I really spending my youth serving a corporation instead of LIVING? 
Anyway, she didn't said anything, my job was never an issue, we still found time to hang out. Those were just my thoughts, observing her enjoying her youth like I never had the chance to. 
She broke up with me, because she was not ready and had so much going on in her life and we split on good terms. But that was the last drop that made my cup spill. I've spent the last 2 weeks drinking every night while still at work, thinking how my 20s are half  out the door, how I've sold my sould and my youth to the devil so that I can support myself and help out my parents. I've been thinking of quitting my new job 3 months in. And that really induces anxiety and I've been depressed ever since. Can't sleep well. Can't behave properly...it's a true mid life crisis while still 25. 
How can I cope with this?",21Oct2020,1
212,"This post is mostly me talking about my life and how I got to this point and also because I don't have a close person I can talk seriously with. (I also apologize if my english is bad)

A few years ago I had what I would call ""Trauma"" and I think it is the main reason I have voices in my head and even changed my entire personality.

I was in the last year of middle school and I was so relieved I could leave since my classmates were bullying me, but I was also scared because I didn't want to go to a different school from my best friend.

I had to decide my future, I had to decide what I wanted to be in the future, in my country after middle school you can choose between a lot of schools that specializes in specific jobs. At first I wasn't worried and I normally continued the school year.

Then everything came at the same time.

My relatives started stressing me really bad telling me I had to decide as fast as possible the school, and adding to that stress came the stress of the final exam that I was never worried about until then.
Then the worst thing that could've happened....
My best friend told me he has been faking being my friend for all those years, and I wasn't angry, but I was sad, the only thing I thought was to understand what I did wrong to led to that.
The worst thing about all this is that I didn't have someone to talk about this, I was always kind of isolated from my parents since they never insisted in finding out if my ""I'm fine."" actually meant that.

All the stress and delusion led to the only way to solve all that... suicide.

I couldn't stand all that stress and the only thing that was supporting me disappear so suddenly.

Sometimes I could get so many sudden suicidal thoughts that just seeing a knife I could see all the ways I could've killed myself, but when those thoughts disappeared, fear came. The fear of death caused my mind to do actual crazy stuff, from watching to youtube videos all night until I collapsed to not be left alone with my suicidal thoughts... To inventing an imaginary friend thay could support me in my best friend's place.
This choice was probably influced by the fact that nobody understood me or even wanted to understand me, and so I thought: ""The only person that knows me completely is myself, and so he must be the perfect person to comfort me.""

He was named after the main protagonist of the story I was hoping to write in the future, Shirou.

He was supposed to be a really smart person that knew a lot of things and that also cared about his friends even if he wanted to be alone.

And like that I passed that hellish situation, I passed the exam, I actually choose the school I wanted, but I couldn't really move on that friendship.

So I decided to move on... drastically.

I didn't decide it, but I unconsciously started erasing all my past from my memories, for a whole year the past was nothing to me, or even worse, it didn't exist.

And the worst thing is that I actually started unconsciously talking to my imaginary friend, even if he couldn't reply anymore since there was no need, and I actually thought of him as of part of my daily life. (I kept a diary as if i was writing to him)

And just a few weeks ago I started having daily identity crisis. 
The reason is because I started being aware of strange thoughts in my head, thoughts that told me what to do, and heavily influenced my own thoughts, I knew they weren't my thoughts, they didn't ""sound"" like mine, like when in a dream you know a person is that person only because your subconscious tells you.

I was (still am) really scared, as I started being aware of it I realized how much it affected me.
I really like taking Quotev quizzes, mostly personality quizzes, and there I noticed how IT affected my thoughts, like choosing my favourite colour.

""Obviously my favourite colour is purple."" (Me)

""No it's red."" 

Those thoughts/voices have 2 ways to talk to me: 1) With a fast thought. 2) With an mental image of what they're meaning to tell.

I started investigating this voice, keeping note of everything he tells me to do or to think, and the conclusion scared me more than every horror movie I had seen.



I am a really overthinking person, I consider myself smart, as I search everything that takes my curiosity, and I also know a lot of stuff from different topics. 

This voice is really kind of arrogant and they're kind of reckless, like taking fun from doing stupid stuff that would get me into trouble.

I also sometimes unintentionally do stupid stuff but most pf the times aren't as much dangerous as the things the voices tell me to do.


The scary thing is that the voice is the same way I used to be before al that hell, I was exactly like that (and now I kinda understand why my best friend faked) and, the imaginary friend is a lot like the me of now.

After reading a lot, and I mean a lot, about what could this be, I found out D.I.D.

And the thought of being just a fake person, a person created by my past self really scares me, scares me so much that I can't think of anything else almost all day.


Another fact, I started noticing the voice as soon as I started remembering the past or at least try...

213,"Ok, so this is my first post. Sorry if I don’t do this correctly. Anyways.... I’m wondering if I’m pulling myself into too many directions. I know I’m really the only one that knows how to gauge that but I want to see if you guys/gals believe I am doing too much.

Here’s my regular schedule: * I have 5 college classes that I generally study 3-4 hour a week each.

Since what I want to do after college is software development/something techy I spend 1-2hours over the weekend learning extra things outside of my classes.

I am trying to learn Japanese because I really want a new and fresh perspective in life. Currently I’m studying Japanese for 1-2 hours on the weekend. Possibly planning to do it 1 hour every weekday. (Depending on how you guys react to my schedule)

I workout on every other weekday for about 1-2 hours

I really love drawing so I try to draw whenever I have time.

I have a dog that I have to care for. (I won’t stop that)

I clean religiously (I won’t stop that)

I try to read when I have time (I won’t stop that)

I really want to learn the piano

I don’t really have a social life but I might start trying to do things with people (after this whole COVID thing of course)

And I love video games (I might have to stop playing them so much)

*And then like every other human I have about a thousand appointments a month.

(I’m 19 about to turn 20. I do all of these things because I am constantly focused on bettering myself. I plan on constantly working all of my 20’s and I don’t really see a need for a girlfriend)

214,"I am a 21(F) and I have suffered from anxiety and depression for what seems like most of my young life at this point. I have taken meds prescribed by my dr, I have read self help books and numerous online articles, I have briefly went to counseling, and NOTHING HELPS...at least not for long. I have days when I feel “normal,” where I am genuinely happy with everyone in my life and am confident in my abilities, and then within the same week I will be unable to stop worrying about literally everything in my life, usually about things that I have no business worrying about. An example of this is is that I will think that my bf is fooling around on me behind my back or just straight up not being honest with me. As you can imagine, this causes him to think that I do not trust him and so we have pointless arguments which result in me feeling dumb and annoying for even saying anything because he just questions why I even worry and reassures me that I don’t need to worry. I KNOW I DONT NEED TO WORRY BUT I CANNOT get myself to just stop. I would like to at least learn how to catch myself having negative, overpowering thoughts and be able to consistently remind myself they are just thoughts. I know my feelings  are just because of how I am thinking, but idk how to get myself to just take step back and realize my thoughts are just thoughts. I will chain smoke cigs  and cry when things get too seem like too much, so clearly I have no working coping tools rn. It is hard for me to get myself motivated to even help myself. I have started going back to school after taking like 2 yrs off to figure out what I actually wanna do with my life, and try to get help with my mental health. I always worry that I am not going to ever finish school, or that I’m not actually smart or determined enough to get the job and career I want.

215,"Growing up I've always been the punching bag. Metaphorically and physically. My brother has always made sure he was superior to me by spreading rumors about me and letting his friends bully me. Hes been a master manipulator for as far as I can remember. I suffer from anxiety, depression and BPD. My family sees what I go through and does nothing about it. In fact, my brother gets more praise than me. 

Within this past year, my life went from 0 to 100 pretty fucking quick. I had gone down from 200lbs to 150lbs. I worked hard for that. I then noticed a sudden increase in friends. Then I got a kick ass job and was making 4 digits a week. THEN I met a girl that I fell in love with. My first girlfriend. For the first time in my life I was truly happy...then everything went to complete shit. 

3 months in I found out my ""girlfriend"" was fucking around with other guys behind my back. That was probably the worst pain I've ever felt in my life, believe it or not. Then a week later my boss calls me and says something among the lines of ""listen, you're a decent kid, but we have to let you go"". 
Yes. He actually called me a ""decent"" kid. 

So after losing my job and my first gf, I said to myself, ""I still have super supportive friends. I'm still doing better than I was 6 months ago. Things are still ok."" 

I have a bad habit of jinxing myself. Today, October 21st, 2020, my last friend stopped replying to me.

let me elaborate on this... since i live with my parents and find it quite difficult to open up to them about this whole situation, i try to find ways that will make them think “oh.. he’s having a hard time, perhaps we could ask/help him through it?” and i feel like leaving my plate and food untouched on the table will make them a little bit concerned

I got discharged from my community worker a few weeks ago. I was on a good track and now I feel lost. Every time I bring up my social anxiety issues people tell me to get over it but I feel as though these patterns are ingrained in my stupid head. I space out all the time, I feel like I don't pick up information quickly and overall just slow. My brain feels scrambled all the time. I try therapeutic techniques such as mindfulness and trying to recognize these thoughts but its hard. I've been dealing with this stuff for so long, I am just tired of being a human. Its made me realize how important child development is and having stable relationships with caregivers are. It really does pave the foundations of your future relationships with others. 

On top of all this I also have trouble forming and maintaining relationships with people. I just feel this stupid loneliness and that feels like a black hole. It doesn't help that I'm shy and have this anxiety in my gut constantly. I always get ridiculed for not talking to people at work but I just don't know how, as pathetic as that sounds. of course its good to have people call you out and tell you the way it is but sometimes I wish I could have more of an empathic ear when venting about my problems.

1000 students, including myself have CoViD at my accommodation and as a result I haven't been able to leave my room or see anyone aside from my roommates.

227,"Hello everyone,

I'm going to try and keep things as clear and concise as possible- My parents got divorced when I was 4, I'm 32 now. I grew up in an abusive relationship with my father. He was physically and verbally abusive. This lasted until I was 15.  I'm 1 of 3, my twin brother and my 2 year younger sister. Even with there being 3 of us, I was the target of the worst of everything, and just the majority of it. He was also very abusive to my mom, which I have some very vivid memories of. 

At 3 years old I became very aware of what was going on around me, and developed an extreme amount of empathy for everyone that was involved in all of this. For the next 12 years I was basically in a permanent protective mode for everyone except myself. He had visitation with us every other weekend where the 3 of us would stay over at his house. There were times when my brother or sister would break something, or would accidentally do something they weren't supposed to and I would step in and take the blame. I didn't do it every time, but I knew the reaction that was coming from him. Because I knew what was coming and had been going through it I did what I could to protect them, because there was no one around to do so. When we were around my mom I would take on a similar protector role. To her, I would randomly tell her I love her and give her a hug. But it wasn't random for me. I knew those actions were guaranteed to make her happy. I did many other things like that as well. She'd go outside in the middle of the night and stare at the stars-I always heard the front door open and I'd stay outside with her. This of course is only a very small snapshot over a 12 year period.

Because I took on that role so early, and did it for so long (and in some ways still do it) it's taken its toll.  I hate it when people do nice things for me. I hate my birthday because it's a day centered around me. I hate/feel guilty spending money on myself for things that I don't need. If it's not the basic necessities I feel guilty. 50"" TV? Feel guilty. Nice shoes? Feel guilty. Video games? Feel guilty. New phone? Feel guilty. Now add my wife into the mix-50"" TV for her? Let's go. Nice shoes for her? Where's my debit card? Same thing goes for my friends. 

I hate myself for enjoying the things that I do. I started teaching myself to DJ a couple years ago, I enjoy it yes, but I hate myself for enjoying it because of all the time, money, and energy that's been wasted on it. I feel stupid and embarrassed when I watch tutorials on YouTube about it (which are being watched using my $2000 PC which I feel like shit about for buying). I streamed my first DJ set about 2 weeks ago and while I had fun, I felt guilty and stupid the entire time. I did it at a friends house, so I interrupted their schedule, used their electricity, etc. and subsequently feel guilty about. 

All of my hobbies and things that I enjoy have always cost a stupid amount of money. My mom bought me a piano when I was 8. My dad bought me a Saxophone a couple years later, and a French Horn a few years after that. I enjoyed all of it, but I hate myself for enjoying it because of how much money it cost. 

I told my wife about some of these feelings earlier today, which I didn't want to do but I felt she should know. She then got upset because of how I feel about all of this. So now I feel stupid for telling her any of this because she started crying during her lunch break. 

I was also diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder many years ago, so I feel guilty when I have a mood swing because someone worries about me. I even see a therapist, but hate myself about it because of the money it costs.

When high school ended, I got burnt out with everybody thinking I was supposed to do it all and with such high standards they gave me I completely shut down. I never been the same since then. I feel as if all my friends noticed because I only talk to like 2 now. I never have any interactions with females or none of that. Honestly I just feel super lonely and like I’m not myself. Sometimes I even look at my family with confusion as to how we are even related. They are awesome but we are completely different. It was hard for me to talk to people before but corona made it worse. I haven’t left my room in weeks(maybe months I lost count) unless it’s for some weed so that I can not think about myself.

231,"tw// sexual assault, eating disorder

i’m a 17 year old girl, if it matters at all. my earliest memory of any of this is my uncle (age 12) exposing me (age 6) to porn in my own childhood bedroom. we lived together, he took me in there and closed all the windows, locked the door, and made me watch a video. this is the way he introduced me to everything that would happen. i don’t remember the first time he actually touched me as it probably happened for over a year. he would let me use his video games as compensation. i feel as though i was desensitized to it, i don’t think i even saw him as danger, it was routine. not sure what the turning point was but i do remember one day i was alone in the kitchen, he came in and slipped his hand down my pants, and i told him no so he stopped, i’m guessing out of fear i would tell someone if he continued. i don’t think there was another incident after that one. for years after, i continued to interact with him like i did with all the other kids in the house, i guess i kind of forgot it ever even happened. this probably was the case until i was 13, everything started coming back to me and i was immediately disgusted with his existence (still am). i completely withdrew from having any type of relationship with him. i still live with him, and even looking at him makes me so angry and disgusted. i’ve never told anyone about what happened ever, and i wonder if he even remembers, i’m still scared to wear shorts in my own house. 

the other part of this story begins in 5th grade. i was bullied pretty heavily for my weight because i was a chubby kid. i remember specifically a group of boys who couldn’t walk past me without making a comment. to add insult to injury, one of my uncles (not the one from before) would also pick on me for the same thing. i couldn’t get away from it, i developed really low self image, and i found tumblr. if you were ever on eating disorder tumblr you can only imagine what that could’ve done to my 10 year old brain. it was about 5th-6th grade when i was starving myself and exercising religiously, and i managed to keep it from anyone as i had divorced parents and they both worked very often. i also was very anxious, i was very intrigued with the idea of death and often questioned my existence, i remember believing there was genuinely no reason for me to be alive, and i was staying my alive strictly for my parents’ happiness. the mental strain also made it harder for me to eat, i was constantly nauseous or had no appetite. by 6th-7th grade i was very thin, probably the thinnest i had ever been. i remember getting compliments for the way i looked from my loved ones which i’ve always found funny because that was probably my lowest point ever. i began cutting in 7th grade, and my last relapse was only a few months ago, but i can go months at a time without it now. my urges have been really strong lately but i haven’t done it. 

so currently i find myself struggling day to day. looking for a new job because my mom wants me to but i have no idea where i’m going to college or what i want to do with my life. i have a few friends but none of them very good, i mostly keep to myself. i smoke weed often ish, not sure if it helps me cope or is making me worse. i really hate the way i look, i want to love myself it’s just so hard, my body image is definitely not it’s best right now. i feel like mentally i can’t handle things that someone my age should be able to handle.

i don’t want it to sound as if i want pity or sympathy. i’m trying to heal, i’m trying to be happy. these are things i never got an opportunity to work past and i don’t know how to do it myself. i have a good relationship with my mom but she doesn’t know i’ve ever gone through anything ever. even the thought of opening up to her with all of this is nauseating. i just feel like i’m getting bad again, i feel like i’m going to start self destructing again. i was doing so good i was so happy and suddenly everything is eating me alive. i don’t know where to go for help, i needed to put it out somewhere, so if you listened to me, thank you so much.",21Oct2020,1

236,"  

Okay guys, gonna be a long one, so please bare with me.

First of all, I guess I have to tell you how the first episode went. Back in school I was a quiet, try-harding kid, but a very lonely one as well - in Russia it's possible to study with the same ppl from elementary to high school for 11 years straight - which I did, except all my friends, which were not many to begin with, left in 9th grade. So, 2 years of being an outcast (maybe this word is too strong) took a toll on me. But whatever, I passed the exams and enrolled in university - my grades allowed me to do this for free. There I tried to make up for everything I couldn't do at school - meaning getting friends/gf while showing some good old academic performance, but, needless to say, I failed miserably in everything. That's where I snaped, dropped from the uni before the first semester has finished, and pretty much spent 2.5 years in bed, dreaming of having enough courage to end this miserable exitance. This eventually got old, so I started reading on the subject of depression and experimenting. With the help of some positive thinking and good old Bob Ross, I managed to stabilize, enrolled in the university again - now for a fee, and life's been good ever since - had an easy time talking to ppl, made some close acquaintances, been at the top of probably the entire grade with just one B in 2 academic years. Until Covid struck, that is. I lost my job and it's been almost 8 months since I've last seen my classmates. I was pretty much forced into the secluded state I was so desperately trying to avoid. And now I am starting to feel the same way I did \~5 years ago. I can’t get out of bed, my day is lying for 12 hours straight staring at my laptop an then going to sleep, I used to go to sleep at 11 pm strict, now I’m back to all-nighters, and today was the first time I didn’t do my univ. assignment – not because I couldn’t do it or had any trouble doing it, but because I couldn’t bring myself to do it. That’s also the reason I’ve decided to look for help.  
 So, where do I go from here? I am longing for social interactions, but irl stuff like gyms and bars etc. are out of the question and all the people I could potentially hang out with live like 60-70 km away from me, so I’d have to take public transport. I am not afraid of Covid itself, but getting Corona in Russia terrifies me. Internet doesn’t really do it for me as well, not the video games at the very least.  
 I am simply not allowed to fall into this pit again. My parents, who supported me through the first episode, didn’t really understand what was happening, neither did I tell them, and “their star boy” dropping out of the uni and going full shut-in mod for 2.5 years had been rly devastating for them.  I understand that the whole depression thing is just chemicals acting weird in my brain, but this doesn’t help, neither does Mr. Ross anymore.   
 So, to summaries, I am looking for pretty much any way to cope with or maybe even overthrow this scourge, any advice will be appreciated.  
 P.s. Going to psychologist isn’t really an option for me, the only time I’ve been to one, the doctor pretty much exposed the entire profession as “you bring me money, I make you feel good about yourself”, which felt rather gross at the time. Don’t think I’ll be able to trust these ppl again for some time.  
 P.p.s. Wow, now that I am looking at this summary, I can’t help but wonder what was all that bitching for… Sorry guys.",21Oct2020,1

238,"Hi! 

Is there anyone who struggles with similar experiences regarding maintaining friendships and struggling with mental health? 

Overall, half my friendships have been crappy in the sense that the friend lies, uses me, selfish, stabs me in the back kinda thing. There’s usually a defining moment where you stop being friends because they did something terrible to you...

But then the other half I’ve had good friendships in which they try to support me, want to hang out, give advice, standard friendship things. Nothing overly much but not anything below. They’re good people and if things had worked out it could’ve turned into lifetime friendships. And the reasons why these good friendships don’t work out is because of me. I’m a good friend and can be a good friend; it’s the part of maintaining it long term that is extremely difficult for me because I struggle so much with anxiety and depression.  I shut down and will go MIA. It could be months, it could be years. And just sort of disappear and don’t say anything at all to anyone. Those friends have cut me off and I have no ill will to anyone who has because essentially that what I do isn’t what a good friend does. I wish them the best hope they continue to succeed, I just cannot open up and tell them what I’m going through.

242,"Hi everyone. How are you? 

Unfortunately, many people are suffering with Mental Health. But, when did they see the early signs of it? Mental illness rarely happens “out of the blue”, it builds itself up. Learning about the development of symptoms can help greatly in the long-run. It will give you a clear vision of the early warning signs. By doing so, you’ll be able to take action, rather than not knowing about it. When you notice the warning signs sooner, you can take an early intervention and by doing so, help reduce the severity of the illness. Down below, I will name the different signs and symptoms that will occur where experiencing a Mental Health illness... 

- Mood swings/changes
- A change in sleep schedule 
- Loss of interest in the things you love 
- Failing in school/quitting your local sports team 
- Having problems thinking
- Sensitivity increased  
- Feeling on the edge or nervous 
- Feeling disconnected 
- No desire to participate in any activities
- Odd, unusual behaviour 

If you’re experiencing more and 2/3 of these symptoms, speak out about it. The sooner you speak up about it, the sooner you’ll be able to see a Mental Health profession or a physician.

So today a random thought/question popped into my head. Is it normal not to feel pain when you’re really depressed? I tried googling it but I was only finding stuff saying that depression causes pain. So now I’m really curious if it’s a common thing not to feel pain or if I was just extra fucked up. 

Here’s a little bit of my back story. About two years ago I had an extra bad season of anxiety followed up with depression. It lasted longer than any other time I felt like that. Eventually it just made me feel numb. Like I was so deep in the depression I couldn’t really feel much emotions wise. So in order to feel something I started to cut my leg. On some nights when it was really bad I wouldn’t even feel the cuts, or it wouldn’t hurt like at all. I did cut for a while but I don’t think not feeling it is due to scaring, because on those nights I’d cut extra deep to try to feel something and I still wouldn’t be able to feel it. 

I’m all good now though. I’ve found ways to keep my anxiety and depression in check. I was just wondering if other people had similar situations, so I decided to ask Reddit.",21Oct2020,1

I ask my teacher for a tissue and my body kicks into panic attack mode I'm shaking, crying etc. My teacher (He also get Panic attacks) comes up to me and asks what's wrong. I tell him bc I somehow could and he says it's okay and asks me do I know what triggered. I'm so distressed I can't really speak so he asks if it was the drill.

256,"I just want to vent. I've been home for a week and I'm still so angry at the ""care"" I received. I don't know if I'm being silly or overreacting, but this was the worst hospital stay I've ever experienced. I traveled several hours to what I was told was an excellent facility and was admitted for 7 days inpatient.



Where do I even start. **TL;DR I stayed in a behavioral health unit for 7 days and it was a wild nightmare from meds, to food, to treatment and ""care"", to discharge and I have a LOT to say about it.** Feel free to read this novel, or don't. I just want to get it out.



This is not my first rodeo. I brought with me a few pieces of clothing, a complete list of medications and providers and phone numbers, and left everything of value at home besides my ID and insurance card and my birth control. Intake at the crisis clinic went smoothly. The people I talked to were kind and helpful. It was only once was I was inside the unit that everything went to shit.




I was admitted in the late afternoon and arrived in time for dinner. Note: my doctor has asked me to cut all gluten from my diet while we await more testing to see if I have Celiac or not. I made sure this was noted, and to their credit the nurse would usually tell the server I had the gluten restriction at mealtimes. Because of covid, the cafeteria is closed and they bring a food cart around to each unit and serve meals from the cart. I discovered there were no alternative foods for people with restrictions. I assumed because it was my first day that they weren't expecting a gluten restricted patient and things would get straightened out later. Nope. If you had food allergies or dietary restrictions, you were simply given less food. Poor guy on the unit had many restrictions (chrons disease I think), and I often saw him given nothing but a banana or a bag of chips as a meal. Server knew nothing about gluten or other allergens. I was served foods I knew to contain gluten on several occasions (gravy, croutons, popcorn chicken etc), and often had to argue with the server over what I could or could not eat. (I would say ""no thank you I can't have gluten"" and she would say ""there's no gluten. If you don't want it just say that"" for example when I she put popcorn chicken on my salad and then picked it off when I protested.) Don't get me started on cross contamination either.




And then there were medication issues. I guess it was my mistake that I only brought one copy of my comprehensive medication list and gave it to the first person who requested it during intake. I did recite the list to everyone who asked subsequently though. Night meds come around on my first night and I'm handed a cup with three identical pills in it. I was expecting 1-2 pills for three different medications, so I questioned it. The nurse explains she has handed me 3x 3mg melatonin pills. Okay, I usually take 1-2x 10mg melatonin at home but I know that's a lot and they probably gave me what they could. So where are my other two prescriptions? Not in the system. She can call the doctor and ask about it. Later I'm called back to the med window and she gives me the night stomach med I was expecting, but not my nightly dose of Anafranil. Says it's ordered for the next morning (even though I tried to make it clear the difference between my day and night and ""as needed"" meds during intake). Whatever, I go to bed.



I wake up in the night with a terrible headache. I go to the nurse and request ibuprofen. Doctor has no orders for any pain meds (ibuprofen was in my list as an ""as needed"" med) so she calls to request it and send me back to my room to wait. As I'm walking back, I get nauseous. Collapse in my bathroom and puke and puke and puke. There's nothing in my stomach, just bile and then dry heaving. They call the medical doctor and eventually I'm given ginger ale and zofran. By the way, none of my belongings have been given to me yet. I was told I can't have what I brought with me by the evening staff. While vomiting, I had peed myself so I requested a change of clothes. Night staff was confused because I ""should have"" been given my belongings on arrival (all were deemed safe). Whatever at least I got my stuff.




Next morning I'm told I must not leave my room for at least 24hrs because of the vomiting and risk to other patients. Understandable. I am offered breakfast and refuse because I'm still not feeling well. An hour and a half after breakfast I am brought my morning medications. At least this time the pills are in labeled packages and not just random tablets in a cup. And they're wrong. The anafranil I needed last night is there and I refuse it because it's a night med for a reason. A similar but different morning stomach med is there and I take it because I need to keep my stomach in check even if it not my usual med. I also inform the nurse that this stomach med must be taken 30 mins prior to the first meal of the day and ask if I can be given my meds before breakfast next time. Told to discuss it with my doctor, which I do and a note is made in my chart (the next day they ""forgot"" and tried to give me food before meds again, but got it right after that). The rest of my meds are correct for that day.




I spend the rest of my day in my room. I assume I'm missing the groups (more on that later) and will catch up when I'm out of quarantine. By the way, all drinking water must be requested from the staff and they go into a locked room and bring you back a 6oz paper cup of water. You're expected to ask every time you need water (yeah because that's easy for people with severe anxiety). It took me a couple days to work up the courage to ask for it so I only had the juice that came with meals. Anyway, after dinner is served no one comes to take my tray away like they did for lunch. I start getting nervous because I'm in crisis and trying so hard to avoid self harm but now I'm alone in a room with a (plastic) knife. After two hours I gather up the courage to leave my room and request my tray be taken away because I didn't feel safe. The nurse tells me to return to my room and that the cleaning staff will be by sometime in the next two hours to remove it. I go back to my room and have an anxiety attack. Every 15 mins someone walks around and checks to make sure you're still alive the whole time I've been here. Next round, she sees me clutching a wash cloth and says ""don't you dare be tearing up the towels"" (I had no tissues and was holding the cloth to dry my eyes and nose). Eventually the tray is taken away later that night.




The next day I am allowed out of my room. That's when I discover the schedule I was given is a load of shit. On paper, it's a neatly structured day every day of the week, packed with groups and activities. My first ""normal"" day in the unit was not a single group or activity. Not the next day after that either. Most people stayed in their rooms, and those that didn't sat quietly in the common area while music blasted overhead. As I warmed up to the other patients and the unit, I found there were a few ripped up magazines, one incomplete puzzle, a box of crayons, and most of a deck of uno cards for the patients to entertain ourselves with. That's it. Supposedly there were some other art materials locked up that could be requested. There was a locked room with a TV in it that we were allowed to watch occasionally. I basically stared into the void for 7 days. On the rare chance there was a ""group"" it was a joke. I was expecting some form of group therapy at least, but over my entire stay I was given a couple worksheets and no discussions were held. Did I accidentally go to prison instead of behavioral health? 



I could also complain about the staff. Most seemed like they hated their job or would rather be doing anything else. Questions and requests were met with annoyance, even though you had to ask for everything. Some were downright mean. Another patient there seemed to be really struggling with whatever brought him to the hospital and also maybe some form of cognitive disability. The staff were so mean to him. Other patients would ask for things he needed because otherwise he would never get them. They would yell at him or ignore him. One girl I think had some kind of eating disorder (patients didn't talk to each other much) and would often be yelled at for not eating her food. Personally, I felt like I received zero care.



Eventually, I ask them to just discharge me and voice my complaints. I am told I have to stay until I finish tapering off one of my meds (a couple more days). Understandable. I sit through a couple more days of shitty meals and staring into space. Then comes discharge planning. I give them the names and phone numbers of my therapist and psychiatrist and inquire about their outpatient therapy program. I still want help, and I heard they're doing it all through zoom at the moment. I'm never given any information about the program despite asking repeatedly. 30 mins before I leave, a nurse goes over my aftercare with me. Gives me a paper with a list of appointments they made on my behalf with my therapist, psychiatrist, and the outpatient program they told me nothing about. I'm told to call each provider to confirm these appointments and later when I call I find my providers have no idea what I am talking about. They had no idea I was in the hospital and didn't know anything about these supposed appointments. Thankfully, my therapist held my weekly spot for me even though my partner canceled my appointments while I was in the hospital (reception canceled the appt but didn't tell the therapist why even though it was explained to them). I did actually get into the outpatient program, but I'm not even gonna talk about that shit show right now.

258,"When I was in high school, I met with a psychologist who told me that as a young man, I should be happier than I was. He prescribed me antidepressant pills. My mood lifted, but I was less creative and uncomfortable with the idea that people who knew me didn’t know the “real me.” I stopped taking the pills and ultimately crashed hard. Reflecting on the experience years later, I wrote this song. [Blue](https://youtu.be/MjSG9su6kBg)",21Oct2020,1
259,"I've started noticing this about myself and realized it's not normal.

Most of the time I find it hard if not impossible to feel empathy for other people, I never hang out or talk to my family because I enjoy it, but because I want them to think that I care, so if I go visit say my grandma, she will be satisfied for the next few weeks and I won't have to worry about her, but I never do it because I want to, I only do it to maintain a seemingly neutral/positive relationship because being in the negative is more stressful and takes more effort.

I very rarely do things for people out of the kindness of my heart, most of the time I manipulate the conversation to make them believe im friendly and in good terms with them, while deep down I know I'm doing it because hopefully they will ""pay"" me back in any shape or form.

If I can't profit from the person, I instantly lose interest in them.

This happens a lot with women especially; whenever I begin a friendship with a woman I'm attracted to, I only remain interested in them so long as I'm able to get something out of them; the second the sexual/romantic relationship is no longer a possibility, I immediately lose all interest in the woman and erase them from my memory, regardless of how strong our bond is/was.

This extends to therapy too:
I often find myself manipulating my words in such a way that my therapist(s) will see me in a positive light, there are things I purposely keep hidden because I fear them judging me and trying to criticize my thoughts/actions. I will frequently express my thoughts and feelings just enough for them to feel bad for me but not enough for them to be disgusted/horrified or possibly call the authorities on me.

I've often thought about hurting innocent people, it's quite soothing to me infact, when the demons and the pain are too unbearable I often imagine myself in a situation where I'm brutalizing someone who hurt me in the past or taking the lives of others.

I have many opinions about different groups of people that I can't share because they would likely get me banned from Reddit or any other social media, but let's just say that I have negative feelings towards certain people and if I didn't have any self control I would probably be around the internet wishing death upon them.

Please know that I have no intention to act upon any of these fantasies; these are purely thoughts that happen in my head and that will remain in my head.

Same with friends and family, I often times manipulate the conversation so that the other person feels pity or contempt for me, or just to get compliments and feel good about myself, not in an obvious way though.

I realized I'm just a more sophisticated attention seeker, which ironically is what I hate the most about others.

I often fluctuate from a superiority complex to an inferiority complex, depending on how I'm feeling.
During fits of rage I often like to refer to myself as a god and calling my opponents things like worms etc..

So to sum it up I'm a piece of shit, I manipulate others to make me feel good about myself while indirectly belittling them.

Are these sociopathic traits? How do you distinguish a selfish asshole from a sociopath?",21Oct2020,1
260,"I'm 18 and I always feel like I'm missing something. I'm not depressed, but there's always this void that I don't know how to get rid of.

 Growing up I used to be like 250lbs and got bullied for it.  So then I thought I'd be happy if I got skinny. Then for a couple years I worked out and dieted and lost it all, got in shape and I still wasn't happy. I just felt dull. 

Then, I never had friends so I made a few friends who I'd probably die for even to this day and even with all the company, I felt dull. 

Then, I thought it was girls. So I got good at talking to them, and started to get them but I still felt dull. 

After that, I thought it was growing up poor and being broke. So I started reselling stuff until I saved up to invest in stocks and make money online. Now I have like 40k in the bank, cool clothes, and still feel empty. 

Now, most recently, I thought it was how I hated living in my small hometown, so I moved all the way to NYC and I still feel the void.

 I'm at the point where I have no clue what it could be. I've had relationships but I've never really loved anybody. I've reconnected with my family, and even my dad who left me at a young age. I've found hobbies too and yet I'm always just voided of something and I have no clue what it is. If anybody can help, it would be very much appreciated because I'm just confused at this point.

262,"Hello.

About a year ago I decided to start therapy. My therapist thought I had bipolar disorder because I told him I would have intense mood swings and could go from suicidally depressed to euphoric, almost like I was high. The therapist recommended I seek the help of a psychiatrist.

I told the psychiatrist about the mood swings, paranoia, depression, anxiety, and drug use in the past.  But when he asked me about homicidal thoughts I lied because I wasn't sure what would happen if I said yes. 

He diagnosed me with major depression and anxiety and I went on medication for it. 

Could that thing that I left out mean the difference of a diagnosis?",21Oct2020,1
263,"Hi again. I’m sorry if i’m annoying people by posting alot on here. I use this though, as a way to get stuff off my chest and things. I’m sorry. 

I have been feeling ok for the past few days. I have been kinda happy / more happy than usual and it has been good and i have been with friends and stuff. 

I am now getting an IEP in place at my school which is good but i’m nervous / really anxious because my mum is going to speak with my teachers and things about it and it’s making me kinda scared for some reason.

Most likely, i’m gonna get called out of class, which triggers my anxiety alot when it happens.

Also, like, today, i have just been feeling down but really hyper (which is a good thing i guess) but anxious alot all of today which is..well yeah. Idk. 

I have been taking my meds and eating better and keeping hydrated now which is good. 

In lesson / class i cannot focus what so ever, resulting me getting told off in a few classes. 

I have exams in two weeks and idk what i am doing in them because i can’t even focus in lessons atm. I might be getting extra time due to the IED plan though. 

They are just making me really worried and i have literally got about 30 pcs of homework to do in 2 days. I cannot do it. I can’t even do 5 in 1 day xd. 

It’s just all becoming too much and they say the week off from school (next week) is gonna be a break from school, but we are getting lots of work to do. 


Hey, but at least the name calling and stuff has kinda stopped a bit? Apart from getting called (sorry if this triggers anyone): “An ADHD weilding retard that doesn’t know shit and can’t even answer maths questions right”. That made me feel amazing. /s


But yeah. I actually managed to write 2 whole pages in class yesterday which was kinda cool. I know it doesn’t sound like much but it was alot to me. Also i got rewarded and stuff for a piece of school work i did. 

That’s about it i think. And sorry if i’m annoying anyone by posting alot on here, i just do it to get stuff of my chest and out of my head. 


Thankyou",21Oct2020,1

266,"My mom and I were talking a couple of hours before, just about random things and then she asked me if I was alright because I was laughing a lot, and I told her that I was because nothing was bothering me at the time. She then proceeded to tell me how I've ruined my life because of my weight and because I don't know what I want to do later in my life (I'm 15). About an hour ago she came into my room, sat on a chair and talked to me for about 15 minutes and told me how she's there for me and to tell her if anything is ever bothering me. That turned into an argument (I guess she was arguing with herself because I was just looking at her and hoping that she'll get out of my room soon) about how many times she sat down and went on about the same thing over and over again. Then she asked me to talk to her about why I haven't been doing anything, why am I laying in my bed all day watching Netflix, I didn't know what to say because I was and still am tired, it's currently 2 am. When my mom finally left the room, I turned off the lights, broke down crying and laid in my bed. This is where the story and my question begins. I felt broken, lost, I felt like I was crying over nothing, as it was only a physical reaction of my body rather than an emotional reason. I wanted to hurt myself, break something, the feeling of anger and frustration was piling inside me wanting to become an action. But I don't know over what. Then I calmed down for a few seconds, started to think about when I was little, of my grandpa who was alive at the time. I broke down again, I wanted to die so badly, like I've never wanted before. Something hurt but I couldn't feel it on my body, I only felt the presence of the pain that made twitch and shake, but in a horrible way. At that moment my mom started sending me messages, like she always does after we talk about something, telling me everything she said to me before but phrasing it differently. This time I felt as awful as I did before, but the messages, they were pressuring me into answering if I wanted to change my life, I said yes, but in reality I was sobbing, being unable to think about myself a year in the future, I wanted to delete the messaging app because I really didn't know what to answer. I wanted to tell her about how I felt, about what happened to me but something was stopping me from doing so. I wanted to tell her that I felt like I was dying, in the worst way possible and that I needed help from a psychiatrist or something, because I could not help myself. Now that I've calmed down I can see a little clearer, but I'm not tired anymore. I feel drained, and it still hurts to live. Should I tell her about this, or should I just keep it to myself if I feel better later?


I'm sorry if I made any mistakes writing this, English isn't my first language, I tried my best to put the feelings that I was feeling into words.",21Oct2020,1
