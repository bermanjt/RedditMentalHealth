my close friend advised me to seek help but i don't have the resources to do so since the mental health system where i live is crappy so i'm gonna try to seek here for answers.

(i was emotionally and physically abused everyday in my childhood by my mother, my father wasn't in my life until the age of 16 which is when he as well started physically abusing me when we went into arguments, i haven't seen my mother since the age of 14 when she tried to kill me subsequently i moved to turkey from the netherlands to avoid getting in foster care, i am 19 now)

last night i started arguing with myself about something, before i knew it i was crying and yelling at my mother (in my imagination) and being in a position of power that she always had over me as a kid.

i imagined her to sit in a corner as did I and yell at her but instead of trying to abuse her and take revenge instead I started crying hysterically and just ask her why she did the things she did and basically show all the hurt I had build up throughout the years.

I realized I was not in the position of power as I had hoped to be and that is when I almost just regressed back to my childhood self. I started feeling as if she was there literally watching over me and still going through the same things as when I was a kid, as if I was still in the same environment. This used to happen when I had just moved from the netherlands to turkey as well when I sometimes felt like I was still in the same situation where I felt helpless and little and as if it would never end.

From this point I felt like I was having an out of body experience (I don't know how to call it) I got extremely distressed and started rocking back and forth in my room with my fists clenched while just crying and not feeling like ME. I started throwing myself against the wall and I wanted to just hurt someone or something. I had lost all control over myself

After this went on for i don't know how long I started sitting in a corner in a fetus position while rocking back and forth and just crying. I regained my rational way of thinking and realized what just had happened and discussed this with my close friend.

This has not been the first time of something similar to this happening, I can be aggressive sometimes when I go into arguments with my family but I do not try to hurt anyone, I go back into my room if I do feel like I am about to. Sometimes I get so angry and lose control that I just create a mess and throw glasses or throw books from a shelf. I have also yelled uncontrollably in arguments with my dad when I was younger or would just yell out of pure anger and lack of power that I felt like I had over my life. The thing we argued about were not trivial he made a lot false promises that he never kept and basically just worsened my life even more at the time by doing this.

I expressed to my friend as well that I felt ashamed of what had happened last night but my friends are great people so she assured me it was okay and helped me feel better about it.

I sometimes can have depressive episodes (like most people) and generally do not think about my past trauma's unless I come across something that is eerily similar to what I went through (in movies, documentaries ecs)

This was the first time it felt this extreme so therefore I'd just like to know your analysis on it and maybe try to help myself somehow to prevent further this escalating",30May2020,1
1,"Survivor of sexual assault here. 7 cups is a shady organization that I would NOT recommend. After I disclosed my trauma, the volunteer who matched with me talked about what sex he likes and asked me about my porn preferences. He seemed to honestly believe that he's helping. 

I was in full blown trauma, and this asshat uses that as an invitation for a graphic sexual conversation, and pretends that that will cure me. 

I tried to report him, but no there was no such function in the app. I tried to post about it in their subreddit, but it said I'm not allowed to post there. 

They are closed off to feedback from people who have been harmed by trusting their service.

They are trying to extract money by up-selling people to talk to real therapists. So it's in their interest to be shitty when you're not paying. 

Crisis text line, on the other hand, background checks their volunteers and puts them through 30 hours of mandatory training before they are allowed to talk to anyone. And it's a legitimate non-profit. I learned my lesson and will talk with someone at crisistextline in the future instead of a shady for-profit startup.",30May2020,1
2,"(Writing this on mobile so I apologize for any errors that might occur in this text) 

This is going to be a rather long one. If you do manage to read all of this and give me some advice or really any type of comment, I would really appreciate that. So anyways, here goes my rant about me, myself and I. 

First of all, judging by my skill set, behavior and personality, I’m almost certain that I am never going to enjoy my existence in the slightest, and I never have. Starting from day 1 of Preschool I have always been a social outcast and bullying victim before I even opened my mouth. Due this social status (or lack of it), I have always faced crippling anxiety (this is not an exaggeration, even today I still almost cry if I go outside) whenever I came face-to-face with any kind of social interaction. This lead to me quickly becoming an anti-social shut-in, meaning I dreaded any kind of interaction with people, especially other children, therefore I never played any sports, never took part in any social extra-curricular activities and barely developed any hobbies. I also never shared any of my hobbies because of a horrifying fear of humiliation and inadequacy. The emotions and behavior described went on for quite some time, causing me to waste my early childhood, which is an important time in which kids are supposed to develop important basic skills for the later stages of life, such as: basic physical coordination, basic social skills and a positive mindset. Obviously I had none of these. Moving forward to my developmental teenage years, things went from terrible to hellishly surreal. I entered middle school with the naive hope that my life could get better, that if I developed enough skills I would maybe be treated decently by my peers. At first, I tried my hand at sports. I failed miserably and was humiliated by opponents, teammates and teachers. My next choice was music. At this point I already played the drums for roughly 3 years, and I thought I was decent. Wrong. I had next to none of the hand-eye-coordination and musical knowledge that was expected of someone with 3 years of experience. I was, once again, completely humiliated and unmotivated. At this point, I would also like to mention that I was born on the extremely shallow end of the gene pool (by shallow I mean less than a centimeter of water). This was less of a problem earlier, but now kids were beginning to learn the ways of human society, which revolves solely around status and appearance and about dominating those with less than you. This turned hell’s thermostat up a few degrees in my case. At this age I was more intelligent than previously, and I began looking for a reason behind all this. Italien to my parents, but they weren’t a great help. When I asked them questions like: „Am I autistic?“ or „why can’t I be good at things even after years of practice?“ the reply was always something like: „Oh nooo :)))) you’re perfectly good and normal :)))“ along with smiles so fake they make you shiver. It goes on for a few more years like this: after traumatizing failures I try to withdraw as much as I can from society. I still do my hobbies such as music and creative writing, but only to the bare minimum I am forced to do. Otherwise I just sit around dreading my next time when I have to leave the house and crying over how everyone from the kids at school to my teachers and neighbors thinks I am a failure and how my parents blatantly lie to me.

3,"I just had a life coach reject continuing to work with me. In the discussion, they gave a number of reasons which kept changing. Many of them were based on incorrect assumptions about me which I clarified. 

These assumptions included but not limited to: 

\- that I wasn't focusing my personal life on just the areas we agreed to. but I was, at least majority of my time. the best i could. I told them and they insisted I was not, and that I was ""not open to seeing it"".

\- That I wasn't trying to implement the plans we discussed and making no progress, even though I was, just not perfectly. and slower than what they expected. 

\- Their claim kept boiling down to their dissatisfaction I'm not making progress as fast as I they said I should.

\- They said the weeks we spent were not beneficial for them. Originally the deal was that I work with them for free for a few weeks and after that I start paying. They said they charge their other clients, but when I offered to pay, they still said no.

\- once they asked me what method I was using to try to solve something. I told them but also did their method. they later remembered incorrectly thinking I was rejecting their method for mine. I didn't say or do that. they continuously told me I rejected almost every method of theirs when I did them all. if i expressed concern about a method, they later remembered it as a rejection-like thing. even if i did it. it got to the point where i could never let any form of discomfort/reluctance show.

other stuff too i dont think i can write everything write nowl

4,"I am currently a 16 year old male. I have nothing show for 16 years of life. I have no friends, I have never felt or even dared to dream of affection from another human, I have no achievements, I have no skills, even in the hobbies I have been working on for 8-10 years now, I am physically incapable of athletic activity, I fear other people almost as much as death itself, I have no more motivation to develop skills as I know I cannot present them due to anxiety and inevitable humiliation and I have never felt happiness for as long as I can remember. My life is a cold void. I wish to escape more than anything, I wish to become a functioning person, but the fear and futility of it all  shackles me to the bottom of this horrible pit. Even if I could fix myself, I would be permanently playing catch up with others of my age, which would only lead to more humiliation. This is hopeless. I have no foothold anywhere. I have tried therapists, but none of them could help. Please, please, please help me. I want to know why this is happening to me. I don’t know what I could have ever done to deserve this. If nobody can answer this, I don’t blame you. Just do me a favor and tell me what the best, most easily available suicide method is.

5,"Worthlessness

I tell myself today will be better
Only to find out it will never be better

As I walk this path of regret and pain
I feel as if I'll never be saved

I feel so hopeless
Yet no one can notice

I hide this fact from all but me
So no one else can ever see

When people care for my worthless self
It feel is if a spear through my chest

There is no way out I'll be like this forever
Nothing will be the same not now not ever...

Hopelessness

I have done so little but feel quite sad
I feel as if knife has gone through my heart
I hide the days where I feel sad
Yet I feel pain

I want to live a normal life
But I still no that can't happen
I try my best have better life

Yet Still I feel down

I want to be happy but everytime I try I feel more pain.
Why can't I live a normal life thats all I want nothing less nothing more
Why won't this pain just go away

I feel it all sadness and pain
I live a life where I walk in the rain...",30May2020,1
6,"As cliched as it is, but growing up as a fat kid, and constantly mocked for appearance has made me unable to make any meaningful connection with a group of people. Although I have individual friendships, I never got to enjoy the easy camaraderie of a group of friends. And to this day, I struggle in all areas personal or professional that require group interactions. 

  
I don't enjoy family events and don't have good relationships with extended family. At work, while other work mates banter, I am the silent one that seems out of place in an otherwise fun office environment.

When I try to make an effort to reach out and make friends, it comes across as cloying and trying hard. I am good at my job and don't have any anxiety around job security. So I don't want to make friends to stay in anybody's good graces, but it would be nice to be able to just have  easy going work interactions. I'm in my 30's and I feel a piece of me is missing and although I'm not unhappy, I wish I didn't have this feeling of inadequacy.

7,"as you know at the moment we are all under quarantine which means almost everything is shut and all doctors are busy, so if a family member who is struggling with mental health issues and has breakdowns from time to time has a severe mental breakdown what should I do? I don’t like calling emergency numbers as I feel I am wasting important time that could be used better especially during these times and even if I did phone they can’t do anything unless the person is ‘a harm to themselves or other people’, these breakdowns consist of shouting or talking nonsense, trying to complete tasks which are completely random and irrelevant, and overall going crazy in general",30May2020,1
8,"I feel like I need to confront my current mental state since it has affected me for far too long and made me someone I don’t like being. 

I have always been shy and seen as such by other people as well, but I feel that the cause of shyness as well as the effect are more than that. While I have still been able to make friends and participate in social settings such as parties and “going out”, I still feel like I never really show my true self. I am always very anxious around other people especially strangers and I always end up taking the backseat in a conversation, especially when there are several people involved. I also often blush heavily and stumble with my words, which I think further stops me from talking much. While these are things I am very self conscious about, I generally feel very self conscious about my choices. While this has led people to describe me as very kind and very well dressed, it has also led me to be in constant doubt wether I am nice enough to people, where my dress sense is probably the only thing about me that isn't an attempt to please others. While I like being friendly towards other people, I more often than not dwell on the times where I haven’t been kind, wether it has been accidental or not. I feel like this has also resulted in me not wanting to initiate contact to other people in fear that I end up doing it, since I often think that people have very strong opinions about me. This is despite several people in my life saying I should open more up and generally being very kind to me or in the worst case just doesn’t engage with me.

I think my restraint towards others is also connected to my constant train of thought and daydreaming. While I often think about how people perceive me, I also often get caught in my own thoughts, where I frequently engage in for example different scenarios in relation to reality. I feel like I go to my thoughts way too often and daydream about simple things such as conversations and engaging with others where I truly do what I want to do. These are often simple scenarios, where another version of me, wether it being a fantasy version of myself, both physically and mentally, or just a slightly more confident version of me engage in the situation and show who I truly am or wish I was. These thoughts don’t seem like reality to me, so when I imagine the fantasy version of myself that I wish I was, in a situation I was just in or am about to be in, I am able to distinguish them from reality, but when I was younger I was really hopeful of it becoming true. They still feel like a whole other person, who i would rather be and they take up way to much of my life. I am also scared that I use this as a form of coping for my self esteem and shyness, where I delve into this fantasy about myself in order to escape and thereby stopping me from trying to open up, since I have this much better version of myself to keep me “happy”.

While my thoughts are occupied with this, I also often get suicidal thoughts, where I imagine myself committing suicide whenever I feel sad. While i never considered carrying them out, I still think that they occur way too easily and frequently. I know this isn’t the place to get diagnosed and I am going to speak to a professional as soon as I can but I really felt the need to write it down for other people.",30May2020,1
9,"So long story short , i have severe anxiety and im am very scared of socializing.

11,"I've never asked for help from someone before. Not saying that to brag lol on the contrary, the reason for that is probably my cowardness or maybe overthinking. And I've never thought I was a suicidal person, but tonight the idea just doesn't left my mind.

I used to be a successfull student, yet I can't find any meaning in anything lately. I don't want to talk to my friends, don't want to eat anything, I don't even want to watch stupid youtube videos or listen the music I love anymore. I'm not sure if this is depression or not. All I know is that I feel bad and that I don't have any idea what to do. I used to write songs and -really bad-poems. I miss those days I felt something rather than sadness or emptiness. 

I can't ask help from my parents since they have a very different mindset. They're not bad people, nor torturing me with anything, yet I know they'll say my lack of happiness or will to live comes from not being religious.

I can't ask help from my friends because what the hell am I suppose to say? I've seriously considered to end my life tonight and I'm here for you to convince me to otherwise?

I know I should seek for professional help. But I don't have a budget for that. 

I'm 19, I do have a pretty ordinary life, nothing terrible have had happened to me. I just don't have any idea how to get out of this. I just don't want to need to convince myself 24/7 that choosing to live is probably a better option.

20,"A while ago, I'm not sure how long, maybe a couple years, I turned off all notifications for texts/apps, except calls. No one called me  much but usually when I got a call it'd be work or something somewhat important so I needed to answer. 

Anyways, doing that liberated me from the thought that no one ever reaches out to me. I was able to look at my phone and see a lack of messages not as a sign that I'm alone, but as an opportunity to take control of how I feel. It was up to me to determine how I was going to feel. I began only checking my messages when I was expecting something. Soon I forgot about checking my messages and being hung up on that, and I began to feel better.  It became the norm for me to tell people that if they need to contact me they should \*call\* me, because I wont see their text. Many people took confusion to that, but its worked for me.

Recently I met a girl. Things were going well. We began a sexual relationship, and I was \*extremely\* happy to finally (first time ever) be as close to another human (emotionally) as I was with her. However, very soon after our friendship developed into something more the pandemic hit with full force. Because of circumstances, she moved back home (from living on campus) and I was left alone. 

She was the first person within those couple of years that I actually turned on my notifications for. Seeing her on my screen made me happy. We talked all the time from morning to night. But after she left things between us died down, and she decided that the things she was going through at the time were too much for her and she couldn't continue with our relationship. So now we're just friends that don't really talk. 

I kept my notifications for her turned on for a while, and that put me into a downwards spiral. Every time I'd look at my phone I was reminded of the person I miss the most. Eventually I turned them off for her, but I still find myself checking my texts regularly, which constantly reminds me of what we had. 

The hardest thing I have yet to do is delete our conversation, which spans about 3 months. I know this is a crucial step for me to be able to move on, but I can't bring myself to do it. The thought just makes me so sad. I'm not ready to let go. 

I don't at all regret turning on notifications for her. I remember when she texted me for the first time (she asked for my number AND texted me first, wow). It was great to finally see a name I cared for popup on my screen, but that's over now. From now on, notifications stay off, for everybody, no matter what.

21,"I’m 16 year old male, I haven’t been diagnosed with anything really yet because of lockdown.

My moms always told me that there’s been a black cloud following me ever since I was young, as a child my biological father was an alcoholic who physically and verbally abuse me and my mom. I can recall my mom saying he threw me down the hallway at one point. That was when I was around 1-2 years old. 


Fast forward 4-5 years 
From nursery till secondary school I was a bully, I grew up surrounded by violence. One could almost say it was imprinted on me. I can recall hurting animals two. My biological dads cat witch I picked up by it’s tail and swung around and my grandmas dog witch I wiped with a stick. Now I know that sounds awful for sum but at that time I didn’t really know bad or good. I was neglected that bad. 


Secondary school wasn’t exciting I kept to myself mainly but i didn’t want to be lonely so I found a couple friends to help me fit in I guess.

That brings us to now. I don’t really know how to explain how I feel....because I don’t. I wouldn’t say I’m manipulative but I now how to get what I want. I don’t have emotional attachments to anything really, I think my moms the closest thing. I don’t feel connections to people but I find it easy to talk to people, but as soon as they introduce emotions into the mix I struggle, I can’t put myself in other people’s shoes it’s like there’s a invisible wall stopping me. I don’t really leave my house apart from going to collage. Work is important to me but I can’t read that well, I spent most of my time at the head masters office not in class.

H- bio father
C- support/friend/mentor

I (17f) lived with J and three other roommates from feb 9-may 7. I met J thru one of his friends (who i met on tinder) and we all got an apt with two roommates already set up. I had slept with J’s homeboy (who i was “with” in the first place, we shared a room.) J had no feelings towards me EVER. I’d started to hit it off with a boy i had classes with throughout high school (S) and after almost four years (with the exception of about 14 months because i moved to hawaii with my mom) of flirting and hanging we made it official. I literally fell in love with him, he reflected so many things about myself that i loved and it made it easier for us to mesh.

fast forward to May 7th, I had a guy who started off as a sugar daddy but ended up just sending me money because i was going thru some personal
stuff. that day he had sent me $2k via venmo and i had J pull it out (i don’t have a card). he came back and we split it. we trapped so we went to our plug upstairs so jay could get some wax and i could get some bud. we went back downstairs and rolled a blunt. in the muddle if the blunt J’s gf came downstairs (we all lived in the same building) and was screaming at him. i left my room and told her “either shut your fucking mouth or leave.” this SENT J. i didn’t yell at her, i simply let her know (firmly) that we’re in a fucking apartment building with cops and they were finna come up if she didn’t stfu.

J pushed me, i freaked the hell out and he kicked in my door completely breaking the door frame off. he starts demanding that i give him the money. i told him i already gave him his cut. he tries to grab my purse and in the attempt to stop him he body slammed me. now i’m a tiny lil bitch, i’m 5’4” and 114 lbs and J is about my size but WAY stronger. i flipped the fuck out, having a PRSD episode and in an attempt to shut me up, J punches me in the face. while i sat there crying holding my lip, J took all the money from my purse but $150 from the day prior that was in a different wallet. 

I called S and had him pick me up, we already had plans to chill at my place so he was already in the way. i told him to just get here as fast as you can and be at the door ready to book it, J wasn’t letting me leave. He tried everything, even telling me that he loved me.

i went upstairs and got two zips from our dude because i told him J robbed me. after that i went inside my apt, grabbed my duffel and sprinted out. J heard me leave and immediately started coming after me. he ripped out a good chunk of my hair because he grabbed at me in the stairwell. I finally reached the door and S was there with his truck door already open and ready to go. i didn’t even close the door, we just took off. 

fast forward to monday, S has gotten me pregnant a few weeks prior and at this point we were comfortable enough with each other and financially that we could keep it if we wanted. we talked it over for about two days and decided we were going to keep it. Monday morning at exactly 4:32 am i woke up to the worst pelvic pain i’ve ever had and i felt like i wet the bed. i lifted up the blanket and saw a dark spot, i reached for the lamp only to figure out that i had miscarried... i bled so much i needed to sit in S’ bathtub. I was hysterical because of the pain and the loss. S left for work at 6 and i cleaned the linens. he came back early (around noon) and told me flat out “I can’t do this... you can’t stay here.”

i freaked out... i stayed with some of our high school friends for two days and her mom was treating me like shit so i’m staying with a friend right now.

in the midst of all of the chaos, i lost my birth cert and my passport. I cant move back to Hawaii without those things so i’m stuck where i am.

i’m also stuck mentally. i don’t feel like i can escape... i’ve lost my kid, my friends, the the love of my life.... i’m shattered.",30May2020,1
27,"This is pretty boring but im losing my mind...

So basically a old friend told me that as soon as i get a new friend, i am obsessed with them as if they were a new toy to play with, and that i can drop them off whenever i what without feeling guilty about it....i cant get this out of my head


As i am thinking about this idea, it does kind of make sens to me, but ive always been a kind person and i want the best for everyone, i do have empathy and feel guilty if i upset someone...
 

Idk her statement just made me think that maybe i have an antisocial disorder, im starting to feel that there is more than one person inside of me


It may not seem that serios but all my life ive known something it wrong with me, did my research on mental illness and all of the disorders but never thought I would come to the conclusion that i have multiple personalities, maybe i got it all wrong?? Idk i just needed to write this out somewhere sorry",30May2020,1
28,"I go through bouts of depression, but this one has been especially bad because I just graduated college and COVID has taken away my routine/distractions. It feels like I'll never get out of it.

My entire life I haven’t really had to make any big choices, things were kind of just mapped out for me, and up until a few months ago the idea of freedom made me excited to graduate. My plan is to take the MCAT at the end of the summer, get a research job for a year or two, and then travel the world for a year before applying to med school (or wherever else life decides to take me). I’m starting to look for jobs, but I don’t even know what cities to look in. I don’t really have any ties anywhere since I’m not close with my family. Now, that freedom is scaring me because I feel directionless and emotionally unstable.

I’ve always been super independent. Never been in a relationship. I'm a straight female but getting to know a guy never even crosses my mind… If I meet someone I’m into (a very rare occasion) I just want to hook up with them. I always get super confused when a guy is actually interested in me as a person (also extremely rare, guys hardly talk to me) and I don't know to act so I make things weird (what am I missing? What’s the ulterior motive? there must be a catch). As sad as it is, I think I objectify myself more than any guy I’ve been with because I can’t wrap my head around them actually liking me for anything else. I’ve had plenty of friends but only a few I’ve stayed close with for longer than a few years. I tend to keep people at an arms length, but once I get close enough to someone I stop holding back and then I’m just way too much and people get tired of me. As I mentioned, I’ve never been close with my family. Even as a kid I never felt a sense of closeness/comfort with them (kind of the opposite), and it’s only gotten increasingly worse as I got older. My relationship with my dad will never be fixed (seriously), and although it’s not nearly as bad with my mom I doubt we’ll ever be close. They also were never close or affectionate with each other and once I left for college things got worse. They’re separated, likely to be divorced soon.

Despite all this, I feel the desperate need to make everyone like me. I bend over backwards for people I don’t even like. I’ll always assume I’m being annoying, or a burden, and I beat myself up constantly over stupid things like an unreturned text (I was weird, I offended them, etc). I anxiously second guess my every word and action until I get some sort of validation it was OK. I know it’s unhealthy, but I’m really insecure about my personality and the self-hatred runs deep. Sometimes I almost feel like I’m performing a role (not in a fake way, more like needing to be the perfect version of myself) and it’s really exhausting. I go through phases of being a people-pleasing social butterfly and being super introverted and doing the social bare-minimum (pretty easy to do since people don't reach out to me much). I must say that I'm excellent at hiding this internal shitshow, I'd be so embarrassed if anyone found out how upset I got over stupid, tiny things because I know I'm overreacting.

I love being independent, but deep down I crave connection sooooo badly it physically hurts. It tears me up inside knowing how alone I am/have always been in this world. I'm fun from a safe distance, but given my full personality I don’t think I will ever have anyone special in my life…. A partner, a best friend, whatever. Just someone who actually loves me… although I’m not even sure I’m capable of loving anyone myself. I don’t know which is scarier.

This is always at the back of my mind, but graduating and realizing none of those relationships will last outside college has been really triggering. Also realizing how many “fresh starts” I’ve had and how they’ve gone the same way every time, so it’s hard to get excited about this “fresh start”. Combined with how meaningless I feel…. It just... sucks. I have a “plan”, but I don’t really know what I \*actually\* want so it feels hollow. I don’t have any mentors or motivating influences in my life. I feel lost and alone.

I just feel like no matter what I do I’ll always be not enough, or too much. Never just right.

As much as I appreciate the good intent behind any advice to just focus on myself, I’ve done that for a while. Did a lot of cool things, like travelling by myself and picking up some creative hobbies, which did make me feel happy. But socially nothing changed besides having more friends with no real connection. It distracted me, but it didn't fix anything deeper. And yes, I know I need therapy. But I had a bad experience with an unprofessional therapist so the idea of starting again makes me want to throw up. Also logistically/financially it's not really an option right now.

I applaud anyone who actually read this entire thing. I don’t know what I’m trying to get out of posting it, I just thought it might make me feel better or maybe make someone else feel better if they’re going through anything similar. I'm really trying to fight the darkness, but I feel like my soul is getting sucked out and it's getting really hard to function.

30,"So a few things to understand is that I was abused by my brother. I was told that I was a cry baby and that what he did to me is what every brother does. I have gotten help and I’m much better but I still need help with a small thing. Am i being over dramatic?

My entire childhood was me being told I am being over dramatic. I have a problem to say sorry about almost anything. Even when people say it’s not my fault I say sorry. Some have even said it sounds like I’m afraid of getting beat again. But then sometimes I have problems I don’t know how to handle.

I had a girlfriend I’m still friends with and she mentions getting back together after quarantine(yay). But then our texts won’t dark. She would only text if she needed help with something. On non work stuff she would have small resonances with like a 30-60 min it e gap. I was getting worried and asked if she wanted to talk at all. She said to calm down and don’t sweat about it(bit exact words but the jest of it). We haven’t texted at all for almost 2 weeks. I don’t know if I’m being dramatic about this or not. 

I also have problems with my parents. When they call me to talk to me I blurt what did I do wrong? They get concerned as I always sound like I’m back where I was when my brother would beat me.

33,"  I don't ever wanna close my eyes. Every time I do, my mind goes to a seriously dark place. Even when I'm having fun or enjoying myself, it's always negative. I was out at night, riding with my mom, and i just felt kinda tired, so I closed my eyes. I saw myself getting shot in the head, in ridiculous detail. I freaked out a bit, before remembering where I was and that I was actually alright.

   It's hard to fall asleep, partially due to insomnia (getting better) but also because of this. When I do shut my eyes, I just imagine awful things, like my arm being cut off, or being stabbed to death. Sometimes, I don't even need to close my eyes for it to happen. It makes my life awful.

I just want to go back to the comfort of every night being sleepless and every day being miserable. All the psychologists in my area are booked full and not accepting any new patients. I should probably mention I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 6, if that gives any helpful context. But yeah that's a wrap on my rant I guess.",30May2020,1
36,"Recently I've been feeling very depressed and it's super hard to get up to shower, clean the apartment.. etc. 

When my partner asks if I'm okay I usually tell him the truth and say it's hard to get motivated to do the small things. He's gotten pretty frustrated and will say things like why don't you clean up your place then we can see each other. I got really upset but didn't let him know, didn't want to start a fight. 

I know he's trying to motivate me but I get annoyed that he doesn't understand. I know he's just trying to help and it's actually really sweet, I just wish he cut me some slack and let me have a messy place sometimes. 

Sometimes I do feel like he pushes his standards on me about cleanliness. I don't feel like my place is even that messy, just need to put a few things away, do some dishes then some laundry. 

How do I tell him any of this without being confrontational.. 

Also some back story, been together 3 and a half years, he's 22 and I'm 21. He has actually been diagnosed with depression, too, but he is very good at keeping his area meticulously clean. You could even go as far to say that he's a bit of a clean freak.",30May2020,1
37,"I genuinely wish I could know how it feels when your family cares about you, I mean, they love me but I very much believe they don't really care about what happens to me. You'd think that after 21 years I'd know better, I would be used to not expecting much but a part of me holds hope that maybe this time I'll be taken care of or at least they'd worried about my well-being.

I suffer from migraines and usually I have pills but I ran out of them this week and with being back to work and all I haven't had time to get more and today I'm having a very very horrible one, the first thing my dad told me when I expressed that I'm in a lot of pain was ""Why do you do this to yourself? If you know how it gets why don't you do something"", he didn't even asked if I had try, he only assumed I didn't, I asked my brother to cook something for me because I haven't eaten, he said no because he was playing. I went to bed to rest and woke up from time to time because of the pain, now I could finally stand up and it's like I wasn't even here, they didn't tried to make it easier, they ate dinner and moved on while I was crying due to pain. 

I know it may sound too silly, like ""well, life isn't easy"" or whatever, I've known, very rarely do they ever express any sort of concern for my health but you still hope that a little compassion kicks in, just wanting to help...

Ive had this building rage that i notice bleeding into my thoughts and decisions. What makes it worse is that ive begun to lose any care i had for people and society in general. I think the reason for me not caring is because i was taught how all of society is run by corporates and corrupt politicians and shown insurmountable proof of this theory. I have been aware of this lack of care and anger but what drove me to really reach out is some of the thoughts i had on the recent riots that concerned me. Now, i would like to think i would never hurt anyone but when seeing these riots i had an uncontrollable desire for chaos to ensue.

Just wrote this for an hour in note pad. I just need advice on how to cope with myself and how to figure out what’s wrong. Even one or two relies would help... sorry it’s so long, I’m just struggling. TLDRs at the end of the long paragraphs... will show this to a therapist when I find one.. thanks guys. (Yes it’s a mule account, just want to remain anonymous) 


Me Mentally

First off a lot of this happens to me when I’m stressed. I feel like writing it down may or may not help me in the long run. I want to write down everything in sections to make it easier to understand.

Paranoia

I find myself sometime getting paranoid. Not too bad or schizophrenic but just an unsettling vibe. Thoughts I don’t believe are true but do kind of put me on edge and creeped out. For example the vent in my washroom sometimes make noises and I’m scared if I look into it someone will be looking back. Or small noises which I blow out of proportion. Like when I left the shower and heard my fan I thought there may have been someone in the apartment with a chain. Not actual beliefs but it puts me on edge. The only other thing that I would consider paranoid is about bugs, cock roaches mainly as they do live in my apartment. I think I see them run under paper for example, but they won’t be there or under it, same goes for dishes etc. Also mirrors sometimes freak me out.

TLDR; I get paranoid for no reason, only small or mild, over little things.

Dissociation?

Again this may be stress related, or just random times, but I don’t really know if it is classified as dissociation. Everything becomes very fuzzy, my body for example, feels like it’s shaking and it very well might be. My girlfriend once pointed out I was shaking and I didn’t know I was, but I was slightly. It was when I started to dissociate. I got scared knowing it was happening and everything kind of became a blur. I knew what was happening around me but it all seemed fuzzy and hyper focused at the same time. Things kind of felt unreal (kind of feeling like this while writing this. Or I’ll look at something and it all blends together, like the pattern of a floor or a corner of a cupboard. It’s almost a feeling of fear. I’ve wrote a post about this and someone had pointed out depersonalization so that’s what I’ve been referring it to. Only happens sometimes but it does happen. Also I feel nauseous usually and my head can hurt.

TLDR; I feel like everything blends together, fuzzy feeling around my body. Don’t feel like myself

Mood

My mood varies from hour to hour. I can be excessively happy, or overwhelmingly sad, to angry. Girlfriend was annoying me one day, which happens sometimes, it’s natural. But I got so unnecessarily upset over it (she was sitting in my chair, and I’m protective about my stuff) I started to raise my voice a bit and begged her to move and she wouldn’t and she told me I needed to calm down first. I started to panic a bit and had a mix of frustration and anger and sadness. Eventually I calmed down a very little bit to the point she moved and me and her were both a little startled, this lasted a few minutes. 

This happens at varying intensities and different moods. Depression is a factor, but so is happiness? I can feel like the best in the world to feeling like dirt and worthless and just stuck overall. It can happen in minutes, hour, or days. All in phases. Sometimes caused, sometimes for no reason whatsoever. Motivation varies. I can never stick to goals or tasks, other times I want to set several goals for myself. I feel like I never improve however. Mood did cause me to self harm in the past but I got over it, although years later I still sometimes get the urge and the images in my head, I still am able to hold back but it can get to be stressful. These only happen when I’m very upset or stressed.

Good feelings consist of me being happier, more open, chattier and just kind of a “laugh at my jokes I’m funny aren’t I” kind of guy. I think I deserve more than I have, tons of entitlement and I value myself over everyone. 

(I go from not caring about random people, to caring about everyone randomly, I’m either a really good guy or a very selfish one depending.)

TLDR; mood swings, happy, sad, angry, random times random feelings but they can be affected by people and events.

Obsessions 

I do find I obsess over things. My games, apartment, income, work. But only sometimes. My obsessions aren’t destructive imo but they do happen randomly about random things (wanted to go to school about psychology, was in it for a week obsessing over it, the dropped it and didn’t care) my games I think about 24/7. Working out I don’t follow through with but I’ll plan for days and think about constantly. I’ve always had an issue obsessing over girls. Different intensities over different things.

History 

I grew up with separating parents in a poor family, one parent abused me, mainly mentally but sometimes physically. Always the least favourite out of the kids by one of my parents. Diagnosed with GAD and health anxiety (which comes and goes). Been on anti depressants but dropped them due to side effects. Lots of physical pain, head aches, chest pain, pain in arms and stomach. Severe depression as a teen with self harm and suicidal thoughts, very close to following through once. I can’t currently find consoling and have been looking for months but due to COVID it’s harder. 

Conclusion

I just want help, I want to know what to do and where to go. I’m broke, in debt, and I feel semi mentally unstable and trapped. It is depression, but not as bad as it was. Maybe mild to minor. Everything else is mainly new, I don’t know how to get help or what to do really. I just hope typing this out helps me.",30May2020,1
55,"As I sit here, alone with my thoughts. I wonder, why me? Then - I remind myself of all the shitty things I’ve said. Done. Been. Become, and I know that I am the reason I am alone. I realize that, to no fault of anyone else, I am destined to a life of failure. 

As I sit here, looking around my room at the beautiful plethora of wonderful creatures I’ve worked my ass off to obtain and provide for, I am reminded that soon enough, they will all be gone. Because the bed I am in right now will move, and no one likes an oddball. They don’t see the beauty that I do. They do not care, like I do. 

As I sit here, drowning out my depression and trying to ignore the weight on my chest, I write this not for you, but for myself. Because in all actuality, no ones listening anyways. Perhaps this is the universes way of telling me that the end is the answer. That, maybe I don’t wanna keep fighting this fight. Because, who wants to be me? I surely don’t. 

As I sit here, in silence. I ask myself, why am I still here? Why am I still trying? Why don’t I just, run? My brain continuously screams for escape. Why am I sitting still? I’m not sure I even want the answer. 

Sorry for being here",30May2020,1
56,"Story time. 22 year old male from Australia. Went on a holiday with my girlfriend's family to Italy and at this point in my life I had never been out of my state. First time at the airport, first time on a plane, first time out of Australia, first time in another country. Was there for 2 weeks to attend a wedding. Lost a lot of sleep, got drunk a lot and had an absolute blast. Coming home however was a different story. Tried telling my girlfriend that because I walked into a church in Italy that I now have a fresh start at life and everything I said was complete word soup. Couple of days pass and it becomes the weekend and my friend is having a gathering and invites me over so I go with my girlfriend and after a few drinks my friend offers me a joint to smoke and at this point in my life I had been a frequent weed smoker, it completely changed me I was singing at the top of my lungs and whenever I spoke people couldn't understand anything I said which was making me feel crazy. End up smoking more weed thinking it will calm me down but it has the complete opposite effect and end up sitting outside rambling to myself until I calm down and sleep it off inside. Next day my friends have been messaging my parents saying that I'm psychotic and need to go to hospital, parents think I just need a good nights rest. End up smoking myself into oblivion and didn't sleep at all, just stayed up listening to music, smoking weed and talking to myself. Next day two of my friends come over to see how I'm doing and notice that I'm completely delusional and everything I say is just incoherent nonsense. They call a psychiatric team to come and pick me up and take me back to a ward and I go only to calm everyone else down. Spend 3 weeks there, have to take anti-psychotics and basically just rest. Start seeing a psychologist and he ends up diagnosing me with bipolar as well. 6 months later I feel a lot more balanced but the feeling of being in that psychotic state made me feel euphoric for the first time in my life.

Now I’ve started to notice cycles where I would get down and sleep a lot and other weeks I’d be panicked and have lots of sleeping issues. There are other symptoms of course but are drugs my only option? Is there no way to learn to control a bit? I don’t even know where this all came from or when it started. I don’t know what to do now.

60,"I got an ESA a couple weeks ago from my local shelter and I already love him so much. Sometimes ill be crying or I go through moments where I'm very stuck in my head and he brings me back to reality. 

One incident I was crying and he came up to me purring and sat on chest while I continued to cry for about 30 minutes and he never moved. He just kept purring away. 

Every time I'm in distress he never fails to curl up on or beside me. 

I thought about how I'm going to have this cat for a long time. For 15 years or however long. For the first time in a while there was something that I looked forward to. I look forward to having him be my companion for these many many years to come. 

He's the first pet I've ever adopted and he has been there from day 1. He may not know it or realize it, but he helped me look at the bigger picture. That while there are pressing issues right now, I have 15, 20 years to look forward to and so much can and will happen. Sometimes you get lost looking so close in that you forget to take a step back and admire it all for what it is. 

I was in one of my moments not too long ago and he came up from under the bed and sat in my lap.

I've calmed down since then. He's sleeping soundly now.

62,"USA, upper-Midwest, male in his early-to-mid 30s here. Apologies in advance for an incoherent ramble, but I just need to vent because I feel like I'm at my wit's end.

School was always tough for me, but I was always told to just jump through the hoop and things will get better. 

I worked part-time and did full-time undergrad. Nearly killed me, but I graduated. Unfortunately it was during the Great Recession. Had to take whatever jobs I could get, but it was just another hoop to jump through to get to another low-paying job.

Ended up in human services, supporting individuals with disabilities. Did that for 3 years until I got burned out. During my time doing that, I kept thinking that if I did a great job that I could get promoted, I just had to jump through the hoops. It never happened. I got so frustrated and burned out that I quit.

Ended up in the finance/commercial real estate investment sector. I finally had a decent income and more importantly, stability. I wasn't thrilled with the type of work I was doing, but it was tolerable. I wanted more for myself, so I pursued a master's degree in Healthcare Administration. 

For 2.5 years, I was a full-time student AND a full-time employee. I put my nose to the grindstone and worked my ass off to jump through yet another hoop. I was so exhausted by the time I graduated in December of 2019. But I was proud of my accomplishment and starting to look to get my new career on track. I wasn't in a rush to find a new job, I just wanted to get back to a healthy work-life balance and save a bit of money while I look for a new job. 

Then in March of this year, you guessed it, COVID-19 reared its stupid ugly head and I got laid off in a restructuring move by my company.

I've been applying to healthcare-related positions at hospitals, clinics, private practices, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, dialysis facilities, etc. I CAN'T EVEN GET AN INTERVIEW.

Now I'm back doing direct support of people with disabilities, making LESS than what I did before 3 years ago when I was still doing that same job (different company though). My schedule is crazy and shitty; 8 to 12 hour shifts working into the late night (think 11:30 PM) and then having to come back in the early morning (7:00 AM). My supervisor has been utter shit at training me, the residents I support are acting out (justifiably so) because they can't leave their house and have been cooped up for over a month, and my co-workers are lazy.

I feel like complete and utter shit. I feel like a failure. I feel so incredibly livid yet defeated. I just want to not exist anymore. I'm so tired of being set-up for defeat. I'm so tired of living off of false hope.

I don't want to jump through any more hoops.",30May2020,1
63,"I really really really could use some hope. I’ve been dealing with bad anxiety since I was 12. I’m 26 now. I still don’t have meds that work.

64,"It's me, I'm people.

But seriously, I don't understand. I recognize that mental health issues can impact anyone, no matter the situation, but I just feel guilty that I'm wasting otherwise perfect life.

I'm a sixteen year old girl.

Both my parents make $100,000 each. They're getting a divorce currently, but when I was a child they were usually on good terms.

I live in an upperclass, predominantly white neighborhood in a big Canadian city. I mention white because, as a white person, I have never experienced the kind of discrimination and racism that can be traumatic for anyone else.

I am bisexual, but my family and school community is nothing but supportive of any LGBT members. I've never experienced discrimination or trauma from that. 

I always have food on the table. I rarely ask for anything that's expensive, but chances are that if I ask for anything, I will end up getting it for Christmas or my birthday.

I'm looking for a job, but I've never needed to get one. I'm planning on going to med school, and my parents have already saved up enough to cover most of it, and scholarships will take care of the rest.

So why, in the actual fuck, do I regularly cut myself snd cry myself to sleep? Why am I depressed? Why do I struggle to get out of bed in the morning, why can't I see meaning in anything? Why does it feel like my life is falling apart?

One may think that the obvious answer is that I had some sort of traumatic incident growing up. Nope. I cannot even think of something that qualifies as trauma. Both my parents loved me, I never experienced an accident, none of my loved ones had died, nothing. Zip. Nada. As far as I am aware, there is no childhood trauma.

None of this is meant to brag about my current sutuation, or make anyone feel pity for me, but how did I end up getting diagnosed with depression?

I don't disagree with the diagnosis as I certainly exhibit most symptoms, but I just don't know how it happened. I legitimately have the perfect life, and I am wasting it. 

I feel so guilty, and I just need some help figuring out how this all happened.",30May2020,1
65,"It’s been almost 3 months of no social interaction with friends since this fucking virus began in the states. I’ve only been with my parents who are nothing but unhelpful in this shitty situation.

I don’t want to go to my parents because they most likely will tell me to suck it up or try to set an appointment up with a psychologist. Who the fuck wants that?

Nothing but sitting in my house rotting away to nothing, can’t handle it anymore, several times I’ve thought of killing myself but I though what good could that do?

In the end, my brother and I talked it out downstairs but when I look back on it I don’t think he took me serious in the end of it. I tried to explain to him that I was having some major issues and have been for awhile, how my mom keeps promising therapy and I finally got so close (an appointment was made but canceled due to corona) and it was snatched away from me. I told him I’ve reached a point that I don’t think I can just talk it out and be fine, that there might need to be medication introduced in order to help me with these issues. Of course because I haven’t been able to see a therapist there is no professional diagnosis and I’d hate to self diagnosis myself so I’m going to refrain from putting any labels on exactly what I’m feeling (I do have an idea on what might be the cause though). He was on antidepressants awhile back and told me that for him it worsened things, he also told me that therapy was just talking and nothing more, basically saying that it’s really up to me to get myself to the place I want to be. I get that mind set, there’s definitely going to need to be some work from me to better myself, but I feel like he imposed his ideas of mental health on to me and it made me really question my own status. I know how I feel, and I feel like shit, I’ve had severe breakdowns and the counselor has asked my mom to get me help twice, but there’s always an obstacle. I’ve legitimately thought “I deserve this because I’m a bad person”, it’s almost like an addiction to sadness, where I’ll get into these states where I want to feel bad for the only reason of “I should”.  I guess I’m asking for how I could possibly power through this sort of stuff? I’m 100% open to answering questions as I wasn’t very specific about some things (other parts were downright excluded) because I didn’t want it to be too long.",30May2020,1

86,"I’m sorry if it’s a weird title but I’m so lost and frustrated over this. Guess to make this post understandable I’ll explain briefly the problem and then the issue (background?). No I am not diagnosed with anything at the moment so at a loss what to do. 

Problem is that it is kinda common is that my boyfriend (that I live with) and I often argue over when it is time to eat. This is because I cannot tell when I need to eat or I’m just eating for the sake of eating (I’ll explain more about my eating soon). Often it goes into an argue over me not eating or being weird. 

History: at age six/seven I was put on a diet by a doctor for being obese (from too much comfort eating due to bullying and grandparents giving too many snacks. Can’t blame them). Kinda quickly I lost the weight and was a healthy weight. From there I can remember my mother being obsessed with my weight. She would often tell me to go on diets because “no one loves a fatty” or we both need to go on diets and it’s unfair is only she is on one. By high school I was hiding food and eating one meal a day to keep suspicion down. Still, got comments on how fat I am from mother and bullies. At times I went between eating too much and not enough which did not help my weight. By end of school mother was now doing it in public with clothes/restaurants. A similar thing went on till I ran away last year due to mother and other problems she caused. 

For the last year or so I have been trying to improve my diet, I have improved a fair bit but every time I go to eat it’s a massive debate. Because I spent years not being able to feel hunger I do not understand when I am hungry. He thinks it’s crazy I cannot understand the difference. 

So yeah....sorry if it’s a weird post. Just sick of living like this as it is so draining every time I go to eat. Every meal I’m counting calories and punishing myself mentally for eating. I’m already a disgustingly fat pig and every time I eat it’s just making it worse.",30May2020,1
87,"This is tough for me to talk about but I thought this story will help inspire men. Growing up as a teenager I had a really bad pornography addiction. I used to watch it 7 days a week and it really took an impact on my social life and it really made me lose my confidence. It made my dating life and sex life horrible. I knew I was better than that, I could not believe this was taking over my life and how could I  let it get this far. So one day I was like fuck this I need to get my life together. I started to set goals and strategies by locking all porn websites and started bettering my life by going to the gym and finding new hobbies. I tried playing basketball and started doing cycling classes. It was amazing I met some great friends. I started eating healthier. I did everything I could to take my mind off it. I started to find passions and hobbies and became a personal trainer. I EVEN started dating again due to all the sex dysfunctions from watching all the pornography. It was a very tough process but I was able to power through this shit and get my life somewhat together after 6 1/2 months. So the moral of the story is do not let these addictions control you. What controls your mind controls your life! Mental toughness!

If the patient is in pain, the painkillers will help; if the patient is not in pain, then the meds will not have any effect.

Trouble is he thinks he knows everything and has no concept of how much he doss not know, and he argues about everything. With a child you could kind of just say look we're grown ups please just listen. No idea what strategies there are to deal with an adult who is frequently wrong but insists he's right. Initiates ""help"" (for example emptying your car or rubbish to dump in super market) after repeatedly asking him to put it all back). Has to point out and show you every interesting thing he sees (which is almost everything).

He's constantly picking up anything dirty he can find to bin it (or throw it in a neighbours garden as 'compost' ) and getting his hands dirty. When he washes his hands its a battle ""it's okay?"" ""yes"" ""you sure?"" ""yes please wash your hands"" ""but you have water in sink"" ""it's fine wash your hands"" etc. Literally was just telling him it was okay to rinse the soap off his hands.

91,"Hi all,

I’ve recently joined reddit and am grateful to have found forums such as this one.

I am diagnosed bipolar 2, and am managing myself far better than I used to.

When I was (occasionally am) depressed, I know what it’s like to want to die. Equally, and perhaps more so, in my recovery : I know what it’s like to want to live.

When you want to die, the idea of wanting to live is inconceivable. What’s the point, nothing matters, I suck, basically.

I remember being depressed and people telling me that it would get better, that it would pass. People telling me to go for a walk. To talk to people. Again, that all seemed inconceivable.

However-

Having been through an intense process of recovery (leaving abusive relationship/dealing with substance abuse/fun things like that), and also working in the psychiatric sector- the idea of living that once seemed so impossible is indeed possible.

I now spend my time helping young adults encouraging to live. I never thought I’d be that person. I was them.

I’m not writing this post to say how great I am (though I’m pretty cool). I’m writing it in an attempt to offer hope of my own experience.

When you are in such a depressed mindset, your mental capacity is skewed.

Humans are designed to live. We do die, but we are not designed to want to die.

Be kind to yourselves and remember that you are more than your depressed thoughts and feelings. As hard as it is. 

Thank you for reading, and I’m so happy to be a part of this forum.

Peace",30May2020,1

93,"I've been going through it for the past couple of years, since I started university. I used to feel very confident in my intelligence. I've never been good at many things but I've always been able to rely on my studying and grades and all that stuff for self validation when I felt like shit in every other way. Also helps that I could have time for both studying enough to get good grades and also for doing the things I love as hobbies. 

But since I started college I feel ridiculously dumb. I'm happier with my appearance now, and I have a lot of people in my life who are really important to me and who I value so much, but I feel pretty empty regarding everything else. I don't even feel like keeping with my hobbies anymore because I feel guilty when I do anything other than try to keep up with my uni work since I've done nothing but fail a lot and thus I've made my parents spend far more money than they should've in my education.

And the thing is, I don't even know what I can do other than this. I study videogame development, which is something I've always been interested in, and I've now lost all the passion I had for it, but I still don't know anything else I could do other than this. I feel like I've wasted about three years of my life and I don't know how to put my life back on track. I have a lot of people in my life who I love but I still just feel empty. And I also kinda feel like just a jerk, like I don't value the good things I have and like it's just that my ego was hurt. And I no longer even know if it's just that.

I can make myself cry to get what I need but I need to try very hard and it has to be in a situation that REALLY calls for it though I dont use it and if i do it's not like i feel better since its forced. 

I just feel empty and alone a lot inside but I'm not sad about it its just how it is and I want to understand it. I dont like social interactions with people i don't know but I force myself through them if need be I can make up conversation about anything people tell me I'm very laid back but charming and nice a lot say I'm a good listener. 

I feel like i have spent all my life thinking I'm selfish though i dont like to admit it. I do things because they make me feel good wholesome i dont truly ask my friend they're okay and give advice because I care I do it because it makes me feel good like I'm normal or a good person but I cant understand my friends pains a lot I care about them but I cant say their problems are mine and mean it. I know this sounds selfish but hell, this the most brutally honest I have been with myself ever, it's true. I feel guilt mainly to people I like which most people do but I do feel it.

I think I have taught myself since a young age to have emotions but they are all mostly faked so I fit in better.

I'm sorry this was long theres more details but this is too long already, I'm not saying I am this or that I hate to self diagnose things I dont understand and I dont want to be diagnosed unless by a professional,  I just wanted some peoples opinions and where I can go from here any help would be appreciated, thank you.",30May2020,1
95,"I just feel really alone, And its not just because of this whole quarantine thing. I moved to a new state due to my parents financial problems about 6 months ago and I haven't met anyone.

I would either be ignored, or given one word answers. This has really been taking a toll on me mentally.

There's been a lot of things going on in my life and I don't want to find anywhere else to vent but here because I don't know any of you and you wouldn't miss me.

Things at home aren't good. It's rare that I'm not being constantly shouted at even though I'm working hard AND getting results.. I'll keep it short.

Situation in college:

1. Teachers have not taken any classes or made any efforts to progress the syllabus since the lockdown. I'm an electronics and communication engineer.

2. We have almost no notes and our teachers don't know basic maths and are unable to teach the subject.

3. The exams have been kept at a week and a half's notice. Even though they're mid sems, they're one after the other, hence it consists of 70% of the syllabus in this semester, of which 80+% hasn't been covered.

4. We've written countless assignments, and a lot of tests. None of them are being considered for our marks and we don't know how we're being graded.

I've been having panic attacks. Today a teacher took a verilog (coding) exam, and the question which came to me and a few others was not in the syllabus, and I'm sure the teacher doesn't know how to solve that, or most other questions.

We cannot cheat in the exams as we lack notes and knowledge of the subjects, and on top of that, we've been asked to keep our webcam turned on and audio turned on, sitting 6ft in front of the camera.

I used to be a person with routine. Sleep by 11 pm, wake up at 5 am, study at specific times, meals on specific times and exercise every evening.

102,"my boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year now. at the beginning of our relationship, mental health was lightly discussed but we would always try our best to remain uplifting and supportive of one another. (we’ve both experienced depression and suicidal ideation for years). 

about 3-4 months in, he started opening up to me more about his struggles, and how he believes to have cptsd (mom kicked him out several times by 18, dad was not present, both alcoholics). He has been prescribed lamictal and prozac during our relationship, with 2 hospitalizations for close suicide attempts during the time he was on the medications. 

he was diagnosed bipolar 2 at the hospital, but i question it because he does not even seem to experience any hypomania typically. he is extremely sensitive and easily discouraged. i see this in him which is why i have tried my absolute best to empathize with him and be there and hopeful for him always. he broke up with me early march, with little to no reason why, he was going through a low and said some things that were not like him, before seriously contemplating suicide. 

i took this very harshly, but we still continued to talk every 2-3 days until we got back together early april. i began lexapro and got a xanax prescription during this time as well, because it all happened right as quarantine began and I lost my job and loving relationship, it was just too much to handle. i also wanted to be good for him and i figured it was time to at least try to start feeling better, for me and for us. 

now, i feel less anxiety and depression, like i am able to be very emotionally supportive and available to him. (although i have been dealing with other struggles, i’ll save that for another day). it is difficult because he always falls into the same loop. talk therapy does not help, he stopped doing drugs, tried microdosing mushrooms, has tried pretty much all ssris, lamictal/mood stabilizers, was prescribed lithium but decided not to take it because of how intense it is...etc. he tells me he wants to commit suicide every day because he has “woken up feeling that way for the past 5 years”.  I know he has good days but he is unable to remember that when he falls into these horrible lows. 

he does not want to be on medication, because he does not want to have to rely on any pill for his happiness. i will come up with suggestions (dbt recently, because imo this could be very beneficial to him) and he says he will try it but if in 6 months he “shakes his head” run and don’t look back. yeah-as if i could ever do that.

a big part of me thinks he could have BPD. it does stem from trauma, and just because legitimately NOTHING seems to be working or decreasing his suicidal thoughts...perhaps that would be the next step? I don’t know, I try really hard to help him, but he gets highly irritable most days. i take it with a grain of salt. 

it’s way too much history to explain in one post. if i didn’t make sense on anything, i’m happy to clarify. this is just the gist.

I'm fine when I'm in the dead middle of a physical exercise but even then I'll go off on internal tangents and start muttering to myself about how much of a piece of human garbage this or that particular person is. Once I start fantasizing about beating the people who've mocked and humiliated me in the past,  I just can't stop because once I start reliving those experiences (which consistently happens dozens of times a day) the only thing that brings me any semblance of peace is the thought of violence.

Because of this, I have been placed into a foster family by the ""Jugendamt"" , my countries cps. Though my parents are still legally responsible for me, the Jugendamt is now mostly responsible for me, specifically one person there.
Over the last couple of weeks, this person was working together with me to find me a place to live, as the foster family I am currently staying with is only a temporary solution.
A few days ago, this person lied to me for the second time about something my parents supposedly told them. It has happend once before, both times I angrily confronted my parents about it and they swear that the Jugendamt is not telling the truth. 
I already have severe trust issues and this completely shattered me. I now don't know who to trust and am getting increasingly worse panic attacks because of it. 

The situation in the foster family does not make this any better, as I do not like those people. I don't know why, I just have this wierd gut feeling when talking to them or being around them. Additionally, I now live in a town in the mountains, about 40 km away from where I go to school and all my friends live. That means I have to use public transport to get there which takes about 1 1/2 hours and have to be back at 20:30 because thats when the last bus to that town comes. I also live in a cellar room that is horribly cold, without a working heater. Two days ago, my toilet exploded which caused me to have a massive mental breakdown and cry for two hours straight. 

To sum up this wall of text, I have been put into foster care, I do not trust the people that now are supposed to care for me, one of them blatantly lied to me for the second time now. I feel like I have to leave this foster family as I feel my mental health continuously getting worse here, but also do not want to go back to my parents, as my mental health would not get any better there.

In sixth grade, same thing with the new english teacher. She was my absolute favorite, if I talked to her I would think about it for the next two weeks, I wanted to impress her so I put effort only in her subject. At the end of the year I had an A+ in English and Cs in all of the other subjects.

Then she left and another teacher came to replace her. Same thing with this one for the rest of middle school. But, I started to talk to her a lot about my family issues, I told her I used to self harm and yeah we had a very good relationship. I remember thinking that I wanted her to like me, I wanted her to remember me. I would seriously do ANYTHING to walk in front of her office, to see her etc.

Same thing with my next teachers, so I won't go into detail.

109,"This is a bit of a strange question I know, but its very interesting to me that I could somehow tell that something was wrong. For some context, half a year ago my brother attempted suicide, for about a month leading up to his attempt I felt that something was wrong, its like he was emanating an aura of negative energy, I kept thinking to myself “what if he commits suicide?”, now I’m a relatively paranoid person, so I ignored these feelings as paranoia and went on with life, but then it actually happened. My parents were very surprised, and I later told my mum that I new something was wrong and she said that she didn’t get that feeling. This wasn’t the only time I got this feeling, a month or two after he attempted, I started getting the same negative energy from one of my friends, I still hadn’t learnt my lesson and thought that the first time was a fluke, but then she came up to me and another friend and said that she was suicidal. Again, I asked my friend if she had felt the same way, but she hadn’t. So, months later I’m still confused, how come I could feel this ominous emotion that others couldn’t? The feeling is very weird, its like you know exactly whats wrong and who its coming from, its very negative and feels like impending doom... so, does anyone have any idea why I feel this thing that others don’t?",30May2020,1

I came up with a brilliant idea that, as long as I work hard, will probably develop into something life long and beautiful. 
I'm moving into a new apartment next week and I get along amazingly with my new roommate.
I have never felt more connected to myself and my creative drives. I feel inspired and energized.

And I looked up the symptoms of Mania/Hypomania this morning (after a conversation with my parents the previous night about the genetic history of mental health in my family) and it EXACTLY DESCRIBES MY EXPERIENCE OVER THE LAST WEEK.

So now I'm kind of freaked out. I cried a bit. This is still the most amazing/important week of my life and I will continue to follow this new path that I have laid out for myself. It's just a bit alarming that this whole thing happened ((possibly! I'm not trying to officially diagnose myself OR invalidate my own accomplishments)) because I got high on weed gummies and triggered a (hypo)manic episode.

But all of my friends and family that I could talk to live in different timezones all over the world and no one is answering my texts. So I'm here.

You know... it didn't matter that I got drunk and taken advantage of... 

it didn't matter that men walked away and didn't care...

It didn't matter that the women in my life had no idea how to support me because for as long as I couldn't break past the idea of ever thinking that I might have actually deserved better... than as far as they were concerned then I didn't.. and so they could have never actually cared...

It didnt matter that it was ""lame..."" I guess and maybe just a stupid thing to cry about... It didn't matter that girls hurt... girls cried... girls had feelings too...

123,"As many people, 2020 has been a big disappointment so far. Plans cancelled and delayed, life decisions altered. This is how I have managed with all the disappointments: Bought a new vehicle and got a puppy! 
In November of 2019, I came up with a 5 year plan, which the past 4 prior years I spent time too much time contemplating making big changes in my life. Was planning to talk tutoring courses for Spanish for 6 months, backpack around South America for 6 months practicing Spanish and see all the beautiful communities, nature and sites. After I finished up my trip is was going to return, work like crazy and apply for international work in Spain or SA. But the pandemic hit, and the dominos started knocking down plan after plan. 
It was tough, I finally felt that this point in my life I was ready for big changes. So I went back to the drawing board! Came up with some ideas for goals and plans that I can accomplish without moving. I focused on other passions I have and deciding to double down on ideas I wasn't expecting to want to do yet. So with the 8 months of savings for my cancelled trip, I bought a new car. Now the car I previously had was a rust bucket that was dangerous to drive. If I'm not moving, I needed a reliable vehicle ✔. I love dogs with a passion, grew up with dogs and decided this is the best time to get one, especially after deciding to not travel abroad for the next year or so ✔. The next big plan is to return to school, I've applied to a couple graduate programs and a fall back Bachelor's if I cant get into master's (need completely different experiences and knowledge from what I haven't had yet)✔. Final step is to find housing, my roommate now is moving in with his significant other so just me andy new pup Asta figuring out the next obstacle.

It’s been 3 days and my youngest brother(15) hasn’t acknowledged it really at all, my father asked him if he’d heard about about his death and my brother said something like “it was inevitable”, not offering any words of consolation or warmth. 

My youngest brother knew and saw my grandpa often enough until about the age of 15 when both my grandparents moved into a care home and then he visited extremely rarely. 

My brother takes meds for depression and is very distant and irritable, more so than you’d expect an average teenager to be.

After my attempt I was placed in state funded mental care, which doesn’t make sense because I have insurance. I have been there almost 15 times and have only seen my doctor and therapist once. The only constant I have had in the facility is the front desk receptionist, every other time I see someone new. Now I’m looking for something else that takes my insurance but right now it’s just so hard. I can’t get a job anywhere, I don’t have money, so how does anyone expect me to be able to take care of my mental and overall health? I’m stopping my treatment at the state funded place, there’s just no point when all they prescribe me is bullshit side effect meds (what I mean by that is medication that JUST SO HAPPENS to have helped with depression and anxiety. They usually give me an allergy medication for that).

My depression and body dysmorphia are taking over. My relationship is hard for me right now, I feel so unattractive to my partner. When we first met he couldn’t keep his hands off of me.

138,"Sorry for the long post, but if you actually finish reading this, thank you. I really feel alone in this. 

Today I started to think about my relationship with friendship and how uncomfortable I am around my friends, especially my girl friends, and why that is. 

When I was younger I lived abroad for half a decade and made friends with 2 girls and well I’d say that we were best friends. She even came and spent the night at my house on my last day there and cried with me at the airport. She even left me multiple letters to read on the plane. After I moved back home we skyped alot and kept in contact but at one point she started ghosting me. But one day she actually responded to me and just told me “don’t you understand that I don’t want to be friends with you anymore?” and just never spoke to me again. Now I understand that people drift apart and all but man did that hurt. I had another friend too who I was in contact for a longer time after I moved. When my dad went back for business trips he would always give her a package with goodies from me. I never expected anything back, I just wanted to show her how much I appreciated her. Well the same thing happened with us, but she never said anything to me. She just ghosted me and blocked me everywhere. 

All of that happened during my first year back at home. I felt really lonely for a while since I was young and in a country I wasn’t familiar with anymore. But then I found a new friend at my school and a great group of friends at practice, two of them became my “best friends”. I truly felt like we were best friends at the time, but I really don’t think that’s the case. We fought a lot for no reason and there were times when they both ganged up against me and ignored me for up to a month at a time. That really sucked because we saw eachother practically every day and had to interact with eachother during practice. I never felt like they actually liked me, I was mostly a “back up” friend. 

I remember this one instance when we were all together as our little team to celebrate our teammates birthday. We were all walking to the beach to do teenage girl stuff (you know, take pictures and be silly together), and they ALL just walked in front of me, took pictures and videos together, and purposefully didn’t include me. 

Anyway, after our team split up due to injuries and school getting much busier, we still kept in contact. But again, when I tried to talk to them, to meet up, to do anything together, I was either ignored or “i can’t make it, something came up”. At one point I just let it go and never really reached out to them anymore and they never tried to talk to me again. But one of the girls eventually did... just to use me. She always messaged me so that I could do her English homework, so that I could help her during tests, so that I could buy her alcohol, so that I could lend her my ID card for parties... And I did all of it (except the ID card...) I did it because I’m nice, because I care. I want the best for everyone. But at one point I finally had enough (when she wouldn’t stop bothering me about the ID card) and she never messaged me again. 

Now that that’s all behind me and I have a boyfriend, a mutual group of friends with my boyfriend and two girl friends from high school that I still talk to daily. And I’m grateful for that. But I’m now in college and making friends is awkward. I don’t know how to talk to the women in my course (there’s only a few of us) and I just feel so insecure. 

The worst thing is that I even feel like this around my friends. Every time we hang out I just don’t feel like I belong. I feel like a burden, that I’m annoying and I can never feel comfortable. I feel so awkward and gross around them, like I just want to get away from them so that I don’t bother them. 

And I’m just so jealous of people and the friends that they have. My sister has friends from middle school she still talks to and has girls night with them. She constantly facetimes them and hangs out with them. She even has a friend from abroad that still talks to her. SHE EVEN VISITED US FOR A M O N T H LAST SUMMER!!!! They travelled Europe together and just I can’t wrap my head around how it’s possible to actually be friends with people for so long. To feel like people want to be around you. I just don’t understand why I can’t have that....

He wants me at the max dose of 200 mg of Zoloft and if that doesn't work, there are 2 or 3 other meds he wants to ""try"". Now, I understand trying different meds to a point...and he isn't wrong for wanting to try a few to see which work and which don't, but I feel like a guinea pig of sorts because it isn't like OK...these meds are known to work for your specific disorder, we just gotta find the right one. No, there are NO meds that have successfully helped this disorder to any great degree and it is more like well...let's keep trying drugs until we run out of them and screw the fact that it may make you a zombie or sick or whatever.   


That isn't EXACTLY it, but I don't know...I do NOT like pills period. I don't even like taking Tylenol for a headache! Literally the only pill I don't mind taking is my Pepcid for my stomach because without it (before I'd gotten sick), I couldn't eat without getting horrible heartburn an hour afterward. I fear I may have an ulcer, also but I don't want to find out. It isn't the WORST thing in the world, but I am already in a bad place and I am afraid anymore bad news (however mild that news is) may push me back over the edge. I was so close to killing myself a few days ago. I have a plan but I am too weak (from the illness and from my anemia which has gotten worse because I haven't been eating at all) to carry it out. Also, there have been some good moments with our kids, and this makes me even more distressed because now I can't decide whether or not I want to go through with it.  


I still might...I don't know. I just can't do this anymore...  


  
So that is why I haven't been posting. I doubt many people noticed, but that is ok. I don't care.  


I am crying as I type this because the wanting to die is so strong but I just...don't have the energy to even kill myself properly. Sigh. I am going back to sleep now. The only relief I get.",30May2020,1

146,"TL; DR: experienced trauma ten years ago, thought I got over it, didn’t, have PTS. Don’t want PTS. Can’t make in-person counseling appointments in my area due to COVID and looking for video-chat options.

Personal info dump ahead - potential trigger warnings for sexual and physical assault:

Ten years ago this month I was violently sexually assaulted in my own apartment when my ex broke in. I recall very little of the actual assault but he held something sharp to my skin, resulting in several deep scars along my arm and shoulder while he raped me, and I remember yelling/screaming until he said he’d kill me if I wasn’t quiet. Once he was gone I bandaged myself up and when the sun rose I called a friend and asked her to come get me to take me to the police station. Between my apartment - which was a two-family home in an affluent suburb - and my friend’s car, a middle-aged man who lived across the street yelled for us to wait and then came over to us; I just remember thinking “thank god, maybe he heard me screaming” and I felt this overwhelming sense of gratitude - until he spoke again. He proceeded to tell me that “this is a quiet neighborhood” and “his son is a police officer” and some other vaguely threatening shit that I can’t clearly remember. After he walked away I entered this, like, catatonic state and told my friend she could leave, and then I just went back inside and pretty much stopped existing for a week. I never reported the incident. I didn’t tell anyone what happened (I only told my friend that my ex broke in, I didn’t tell her about the assault but I learned later that she absolutely knew there was something more to it) and I never sought counseling. I want to believe that my decision not to seek help was a result of more than just that idiot neighbor being a stupid cunt, but I think about him every single day and the way his voice sounded when he said “this is a quiet neighborhood” and the way my heart broke when I realized he had no concern for my well-being after I was so violently attacked. I never ever wish those feelings of worthlessness on anyone else. I think about those feelings and what he said even more than the attack itself.

Anyway. I went through an understandably low period where i spent a lot of time at friends’ houses and drank a lot and blah blah blah, but I got my shit together over 3 years - started dating the most amazing person ever, started college, got in shape - and ended up graduating college with a 4.0 and was offered a spot in a PhD program that I had been working hard for. I was HAPPY AF. Life was amazing. 

But then grad school started. Yes, grad school is stressful and can be a nightmare in itself, but I became close with one of my fellow queer lab mates. Eventually he asked about the scars on my arms, as many people have (what the actual fuck people!??) but since I had gotten to know him well I told him the truth. And then. In the year to follow. He proceeded to make JOKES about it. He’d bring it up in front of other lab mates. In front of my BOSS. And he’d always have a smirk on his face, like it was an inside joke. I started having panic attacks when I got to work. I started slipping in my lab work and feeling utterly hopeless again. I was obviously NOT as okay as I thought I was.

I did have a conversation with my lab mate about it and he apologized - he said that I told the story in such a way that made him think it was okay to joke about (I don’t get that but okay). But he was very sorry and didn’t mean to poke at an old trauma. And I do get that. People who haven’t experienced something horribly traumatic don’t understand. I don’t blame him for anything at all.

But anyway. I got my degree and I’ve since moved on, but the stress of grad school coupled with the daily reminder of the incident triggered some serious PTS, and I don’t want to live with it anymore. I have so many goddamn triggers that I have to avoid a LOT of people and places. I’m not sure if this is indicative of something being horribly wrong with me, but I’ve been quarantined with my partner since March and he is the only person I’ve physically spoken to since then, and I’m FINE. I don’t miss human contact at all and I wish I could live like this forever - and that’s pretty messed up.

So I know I need help. If anyone has any recommendations for online therapy I’d be eternally grateful.",30May2020,1

She said if I even think about it she’ll put me on a psych hold to make sure I’m okay. No father so can’t go there. I’ve tried talking with friends and all that but it just isn’t enough any more.

Sorry for the rant.",30May2020,1
152,"I found out on March 29th that a very close friend of mine had taken his own life. He was on a third-story balcony of an apartment, and fell head first. He was with his girlfriend at the time, a woman who (among his friends) we believed to be crazy, emotionally abusive, and all around bad for him. So for the past month or so, myself and many others have been telling ourselves and each other that it had to have been her. That she pushed him. That it didn't make sense that he would do that to himself. That he wouldn't go out like that. I know, it sounds awful. In retrospect, it sounds absolutely horrible. But it was how we coped. 

But I'm just now starting to come to terms with the fact that he did, in fact, most likely kill himself. The signs were there. Faint, but there. He was a one of a kind man. The king of the wooks. I'm not exaggerating when I say he was the man, the myth, and the legend. He treated strangers like friends, and he treated his friends like family. He was incredible. And to think that he took his own life, that maybe there was something I could have done, something I could have said to help. It's starting to eat me up inside.

 It's been 2 months since he passed now. And I still haven't coped. In fact, I feel like I'm just now starting to face the reality of what happened. I struggle with mental health issues myself. I've had those thoughts before. And I'm not ashamed to say that my friend has helped keep me from taking my own life several times. And he never even knew. He never knew that he saved me. And I'm wondering had he known, had I told him how much he means to all of us, how much he's helped me, maybe he wouldn't have jumped. I don't know, I guess I just needed somewhere to vent. I feel like I'm drowning lately. And I'm not sure how to cope with this.",30May2020,1

155,"For me, I feel like I’ve regressed in so many ways after making a lot of progress with therapy and medication. I struggle with social anxiety and depression, and after not seeing friends for months I’m terrified of seeing people again. I want to go outside and enjoy the beautiful weather but I don’t even know what to do. Walking makes me anxious. I’m too anxious to see my friends. They stopped inviting me to do things because I kept declining their invitations. It just sucks wanting to do things, yet all I’ve done today is lay in bed, eat a snack, and play video games (which I hate doing). I feel like I’m just wasting my life and I don’t even know how to start getting better. What sucks is I haven’t felt this way in like 5 years.

156,"I am 20 years old, 21 in January. I have had many jobs and I have quit them all. I tried going to school but I dropped out in my second semester and made sad attempts to do classes afterwards. It’s all really bad right? On top of that I live with this elderly woman who is my ex boyfriends grandmother. She wants to see me succeed, however I feel as though her patience gets weak. I just sold my car because I really needed money (I technically am employed but I don’t get hours anymore because of the virus.) 
All I have is my bike for transportation. Her family is really successful. My ex went into the National guard right after high school and her granddaughter is going to a really prestigious school. Both of them had straight A’s in school. I feel like a reject. She’s kind enough to let me stay in her home and all I do is dream about cars (I’m a car enthusiast) and sleep basically. I go to interviews but no one ever bites recently. I have arthritis and a knee injury that was never taken care of (I was put in foster care shortly after it happened and they just let me set there.) I am almost 21, so that means even if I wanted to go back to school, which is difficult because COVID, I will need to go into debt again. I became preggers last year during school, finished finals morning sickness and all. I became exhausted with it and dropped out. Lost the baby as well. Kind of felt like it was for nothing and I wasted so much time. I was also offered a position under another prestigious mechanic as an apprentice but my boyfriend said no. 
I recently have been making huge strides in my eating disorder and have been helping myself, but when my confidence tanks so do I. It’s hard to keep myself up. I have an interview next Wednesday. All these bad things happen to me, but I don’t want it to seem like that because I am not a victim and I’m more than capable of doing well as a person. I’m just kind of lost. I have a plan, but when I want reassurance and a small gift of confidence from someone going to this elderly woman feels wrong. 
Can someone give me some guidance as to where to go with this mentally and step wise? The guilt is really eating me alive. Thank you so much for reading. 

Edit: my biological mother wants me to stay with her but I promised I would never go back. It’s a mental (possibly physical if my brother got mad)  death sentence, and I would never forget the things she’s done to me. Staying with family is out of the question. 
During the quarantine I had been jumping places with my boyfriend and so I wasn’t at my home all the time. I slept in my car a couple nights so I wouldn’t get this elderly woman sick. I will never go back to my mothers.",30May2020,1

160,"Around March 11 of this year to b exact I had an overdose that completely changed my life for ever . I really wanted to die , I felt like a bad mother a bad sister a bad daughter .

I’m just at a lost I’ve never ever been away from my kid’s I went from having them 24/7 to not seeing them at all . I miss them . I don’t know whwre to even start to fix my life . I dont talk to anyone due to the social embarrassment. No one even knows the reason behind all this one person does not wake up and decides to do heroin for no reason , there’s things that lead to this mental breakdown where you feel like that is indeed your last option in life . I was even homeless with 2 kids at some point in my life but I never gave up this one time that I did I got so shamed for it . Everywhere I go I hear something horrible about me , I have not since then used any drugs I’m trying to better myself for me and my kids but everything haunts me , the future , how will my kids b when they are back , will they forget me ? Will they hold this against me ? I just don’t  know anymore , I feel like maybe I should’ve never been found .

164,"For the past two-four years my mental health has hit its lowest of the low. I feel like I'm such a piece of shit and that there's nothing I can do to help anyone around me, let alone myself. My friends or ""bestfriends"" seem to always have their lows too, and yes I am the one who reaches out to them to make sure they're okay...but I'm never okay myself. Maybe I might be okay during the time of me reaching out to them and they hit the tennis ball back at me and ask, ""what about you? Are you okay?"". Frankly no, but I'm not gonna make anyone worry about me because I just feel irrelevant. I don't want to make someone waste their mental effort of worrying about someone like me. 

Growing up my mother and I have always had such a sour relationship. She was always the one to stir up a fight with me because frankly ""everything is my fault."" If I don't answer my fathers text in time for something as small as ""can you give me a haircut"" suddenly he's angry at me because I didnt respond, not because I didnt want to..but because I never received the text. But that one missed text becomes ""my fault"". 

My best friend sees I join the discord call... and jokingly says ""ew get out"" and I act like I'm butt hurt and go with the joke. BUT then my best friend thinks I'm actually offended and gets mad at me for ""being offended"" when I'm not. I apologize and try to talk like normal now hes constantly ignoring me...""everything is my fault"". 

My mother and I got into a fight over who my ""doctor"" was. My mom yelled at me saying I disrespected her doctor who is a man, someone whom I don't feel comfortable with. When I finally decide to take action and help myself, help my own mental self by going to the doctor to get prescribed medication for 2 things-- I ask for a female doctor because I simply just don't feel comfortable expressing myself to a male. Suddenly my mother thinks IM DISRESPECTING HER, AND HER DOCTOR BECAUSE I DIDNT GO TO HER SAME MALE DOCTOR. I went back to my apartment crying that night. I was confused. Hurt from my own mother who I love even though she's caused me so much mental abuse. 
I join a discord call with my brother and friends but I mute myself because I am still crying. I blast music to vibe, and calm down.. little did I know I wasn't muted. My brother gets mad because I wouldn't talk, ""why are you even crying"". He gets mad and leaves the discord call. ""Everything is my fault"". 

I slowly want to just sleep, and never wake up. Theres so many more instances where ""its obviously my fucking fault"". Is it my fault that I just want to move on? Am I a bad person for wanting a new life? I want to sign out and get reincarnated to a dog, cause everyone treats my dogs like the queens they are. I want that life.

167,"Ever since I was about 12, (I'm 15 now.) I was odd. I knew I was....different from my peers. My peers were also like little dolls I could play with and do whatever I wanted to, and I would often use my cute, childish looks to deceive adults. I was relatively small, with soft blond hair, and adults just loved me in general, because I was playing innocent and always helping others. I did this so no one would notice me manipulating them. But the best part about this entire thing was that neither my peers nor adults knew I was playing with them! It was so fun, because my plans to manipulate without them noticing worked! I didn’t know I was a bit different until the following year when I turned 13. I saw many of my peers pitying.... others. The people they pitied were so obviously below them. I Never understood why, and I still don't. If you are weak and below others, you deserve that position. I never knew why my peers actually pitied them. I also thought of all my peers as a stepping stone for my success. That day, I searched on the web what pity is. I saw the results and instantly knew I never felt these things. I never thought I was a psychopath, because I could feel things like love, happiness, and very rarely, minuscule dots of sadness. I mostly felt happy if I was manipulating all of my peers who I had ""befriended"" *(as the adults say, I never felt any sort of companionship to those kids.)* to do my bidding. That made me happy. I also felt love, but I didn’t like the feeling of it because it often burdened me in the way of my success. I never thought I was impulsive either, because I always planned ahead of people trying to undermine me. I always were 10 steps ahead of them. I knew what they would do next. In the recent years, I also learned how to mimic pity. It's pretty easy, because all you have to do is  basically look distressed and say a bunch of sympathizing words and everyone would think you are actually ""sorry"" for them, whatever that may mean. I don't mind, I just wonder If I am a psychopath.",30May2020,1

I’m holding on to someone by an inch because I’m scared if I let go, that I will relapse and be back at square one. What I mean by “relapse” means that I will start abusing substances again.

170,"First post here, I don't often speak my mind on these things as they're reserved for the dark caverns of my subconscious, but I need somebody to give me advice who has never met me, and as such can be entirely impartial to the situation.

Here's the situation as I see it, all of the below other than my diagnosis is up for debate.

I suffer from two clinically diagnosed mental conditions, depression and anxiety, which are the root of most of my social issues. It's gotten to the point now where these issues are effecting my decisions regardless of counciling, but I really don't want to turn to medication, it's a path I'd rather not take.

In daily life at the moment, I lack the motivation to deal with even basic challenges for fear of catastrophically failing things that don't even have catastrophic possibilities, I imagine a slew of situations that would almost certainly never occur, but all the while I can't stop considering them.

What pains me is that I'm aware of a lot of this, but I can't stop it. I have a few narcissistic traits on the outside and a lot of self hate internally, it's only being made greater in lockdown as I'm left alone more with my thoughts.

Now it seems to be the case that my mental issues are putting too much strain on my partner who is already seeing strain from elsewhere. She asked me a few days ago if we could spend some time apart to collect ourselves, not a break or a split, just some personal space as she reassured me.

Usually I could be pretty level headed about something like that, the logic was all there and so was the reasoning, but my brain wouldn't put 2 and 2 together. Since the moment we stopped speaking my mental health has been in a downward spiral, I've even managed to talk myself into believing she may not even like me anymore because I'm not ""normal"". Despite the many times she will tell me that she loves me, and despite my trust for her, my brain still tries to drag me to this conclusion.

How do I deal with all of this insecurity? How do I manage a healthy relationship while also balancing the books with myself internally? I know my love for her is real, and for a long time the relationship has been going strong, with lockdown being the main contributing factor, but I don't know what I'm meant to do. The dichotomy I reach is that I have to get worse for her to get better or vice versa, I can't come to any other conclusion because at this point I'm a little too far down the rabbit hole.",30May2020,1

I am usually happy on the outside, but horably sad inside. I'm ok most of the time, but if I'm too stressed out, I break down and Cry till I fall asleep. (This usually happens every month or so). It actually happened today. I hide my feelings from everybody expect for myself. Basically, no one really knows my true personality. I think this is why I am very anxious when I have to go somewhere where people are going to see  and possibly talk to me.

I feel very f*cked up on the inside and I don't know what I am going to do with my life when I turn 18.I've had thoughts of killing myself since 11.

I need to know what is wrong with me. No I won't talk this out with my parents or go to the pshichologist. I just don't want anyone to know who I truly am on the inside.",30May2020,1
173,"Trigger warning: sexual abuse, verbal abuse, physical abuse 

I grew up being emotionally and physically abused. It wasn't severe the physical stuff wasn't too bad but it was enough to leave a lasting impression on me. I have depression and anxiety. 

When I was pregnant I told my fellow patients at the outpatient mental health clinic. All they had to say was ""well I hope you don't pass it on to your child."" And they warned me I was likely to abuse my child since I was abused.
 My parents told me I wouldn't be able to handle a child because of my mental health problems. Several other family members offered to ""step in and take over"" because they knew I couldn't handle having a child. I suffered a lot giving birth and had PTSD from it. Being sexually abused as a teen made it very had to be examined. Being strapped down to the operating table was horrific. 

I'm so afraid of failing my child. They are 2 years old. By all means my child is healthy and developing well. I'm still so scared of failing every day. I'm scared of inflicting the same pain on them. I love them so much more than I though I could ever love someone. I made a human who is so perfect in my eyes and I don't want to change that. 

I don't want to seek professional help because I did try after my child was born the treated me like I was a monster. Like I was a risk to my child, that damn near broke me. I will *never* hurt my child. It hurt so much to be treated like I was capable of harming my child.

What can I do to pass my mental health on to my child? I try so hard to teach my child that they are loved and valued every day.",30May2020,1
174,"I have a friend who shares to Facebook links about how depression medication is dangerous and should not be used. I commented about how they help some people and some people need them to survive, and depression is personal and different for everyone and there is no ""one size fits all"" type of solution. She seems to think because she's been seriously depressed and doesn't want or need medication, it is the only right way. Because she can ""speak from experience"", as if everyone's experience with depression was the same. As if people who take medication are weak or stupid or something. That really gets on my nerves, but I didn't want to continue the conversation on Facebook, because I didn't want to open up about my personal experience publicly on Facebook. She knows about my mental health, I've dealt with severe depression and have BPD, but I quite functional at the moment. Why I am posting about this is because I'm wondering if there is a point being friends with someone who ""medication shames"", or if I'd be cutting her off to easily. She also seems to think that everyone else needs to learn how to discuss different opinions, but hers is the only correct one. She can be quite aggressive in her opinions, which can make discussions hard, but she says she is only passionate and can't help it if other people perceive her behaviour. My mental health doesn't take very well people who are all about drama and disagreeing and all that, it easily weights heavy on me, and I usually try to avoid confrontation, because it gives me anxiety and I can't stop thinking about it for days. The thing is, I have very good close friends, who are easy going and who I've known for years, but none of them live in the same area as me, since life has taken us all to different sides of the world. This girl is my only friend in this town, since I find it hard to make new friends as an adult. She seems to have a lot of friends, but also seems to go through them quite quickly, but always tells why and it's never her fault and everyone else is toxic and against her. Should I cut this person out off my life, though I would have basically no friends in myt town? Or am I being too sensitive?",30May2020,1
175,"Hello, I’m a 24 year old from England and was diagnosed with anxiety and depression 3 years ago while studying at University. For the last 10 years or so I have been struggling with emotional instability issues caused from childhood trauma and it has ruined my life basically. 

I grew up on a farm in rural England and although I have admittedly been surrounded by wealth my entire life, my family has gone through a lot of problems ever since I was a child. My father was an alcoholic who never took an interest in my and or my sibling’s lives, he would have to work all day and in the evenings just resort to drinking alcohol to cope with his job. My parents would get increasingly aggressive with one another during the evenings and as a result I had witnessed a lot of domestic abuse from both my mother and my father (I remember it happening as early as me being five or six years old). I distinctly remember my dad beating my brother and I in the mornings before school as well. He’d just get very angry if we refused to go and would beat us with his fists and a belt. 

My sister sadly became a drug addict and had to be hospitalised when I was around 14 years old. To cope with the problems in my our lives; i became increasingly reclusive, anxious, depressed and emotionally unstable. 

Because money was never really an issue in our household and by growing up on farm worth a few million pounds, people seem to think that I’ve had a good and stable life. From my perspective that’s very far from the truth. I’ve had friends comment on where I live and how lucky I am but I wish people would understand that wealth can’t fix every problem.",30May2020,1

177,"
I’ve been struggling with anxiety and questioning my gender identity for some time, which my family is aware of. I usually don’t talk about it because I feel uncomfortable talking about it or just don’t feel like talking about it.

When I was younger I used to talk with my mom a lot about things, but after my parents got divorced and she got a new boyfriend I was kind of down prioritized(?), and I don’t really trust her that much because of several things that have happened.

She usually doesn’t listen when I tell her things, or seems completely uninterested. But when she asks things (often the exact same questions) she must have an answer, and keeps on asking. Before she asked me questions by the dinner table and had to literally silence the whole table and wait for me to answer...

Often when I’m in my room she comes in a sits down and kind of demands to talk to me, even though I’m clearly occupied with something or not in the mood for talking. Then she just sits there until I say something or begins asking me questions. Even though I’ve told her several times that I don’t like it she still continues.

Today I was just sitting in my room and she came in and sat down and began asking me about my mental health and how it’d been at my therapist’s. I didn’t really answer well, because I don’t want to talk about it with her. Then she demands to know about my gender identity, asks if I’m feeling depressed etc. arguing that she needs to know because she is my mother (repeatedly using this as an argument). And straight up saying “I need to know if you’re going to take your life tomorrow”, which I told her was an extremely inappropriate way of asking (and I also have been feeling pretty good these last months, and not suicidal at all, and don’t have a record of like being suicidal either, so it was very unprovoked). To be completely honest she and her boyfriend have often been a reason to why I’ve been feeling bad (he have been using mental/psychological violence towards her). She is also a bit of a reason why I have a bit of trust issues. 

She also used the fact that she talked about her mental health with me as an argument as to why I should tell her. I think this is a bit of a bs argument, as she didn’t even want me to search up what her mental illness meant, nor am I allowed to talk about the fact that she and her boyfriend have bipolar, and therefore I feel like can’t tell my friends a lot about how it is at my mom’s etc. In addition, when I was in elementary school I pretty much cried myself to sleep every night, and had very strong signs of OCD, but neither her nor my dad took me to a therapist even though they’ve both struggled with mental healthy issues. I didn’t really know what a therapist was/did back then so I didn’t have a chance to get help either.


Is it okay to not talk about my mental health with my mother, or would it be better to let her know/answer even though I don’t want to?",30May2020,1
178,"I hate to whine but this sub says I can vent. I also want to say that my experience and what I’m going through is not as bad as it could be. I have always been the initiator of conversations and checking up on people. I am constantly thinking about how everyone I know is doing. However, I am constantly under this dark cloud of feeling like nobody cares or thinks about me. I have never been one for suicidal thoughts but they have been getting worse and worse. I know I don’t want to because I do enjoy life, but the pain of feeling unwanted and not cared about has a huge negative impact on me. My mental health is shit but I have no one I can talk to about it. Whenever I talk to my family or friends they just marginalize my feelings and depression and it feels like no one believes me. It feels like no one out there is rooting for me even though I know it’s not true.",30May2020,1

My irl friends are in a different state cuz I moved. I have gone months without talking to people and then when I message someone it feels like they care for a little bit. Then I never hear from them again because I can’t bring myself to force a new conversation. It feels like people are just faking it. I have that cliche feeling that if I just killed myself a few people would be slightly affected. My parents and sisters would be crushed but they would eventually get over it. It wouldn’t matter that much. Fighting it is the hardest fucking part. Just a complete feeling of loneliness.

186,"Okay so as the title say basically whenever I have a confrontational experience the events always replay really vividly in my mind and I always seem to find it hard to let go of the confrontation and just go about my day.

For example tonight I was walking my two dogs on my own and a dog much larger than mine got away from it owners and raced towards us with the owner shouting to me in quite a scared tone for me to grab my dogs so I assumed the dog was vicious, as it reached one of my dogs as the events where all too fast for me to reach it looked like it grabbed her so I instinctively kicked it to protect my dogs, but it looked like it was going to come back for more so I kicked it again to make sure it stayed away, the owner said she would have done the same thing but explained that the dog just wants to play but always plays too rough as it doesnt understand and when i saw it after they got it under control once more it looked like a really nice dog just miss understood, and being vegan I'm now Terribly conflicted with the whole situation as I just feel so terrible even though the dog wasnt hurt and the owners weren't mad with me, but I cant shake the event from my mind and it keep bringing waves of sadness as I feel ashamed that I didnt deal with the situation better. By maybe reacting quicker and picking my dogs up out of reach of the dog.

But this obsessing over the event afterwards is a common theme I have noticed when having confrontational/potentially traumatic experiences. 

I try to practice daily meditation but I still massively over obsess over these confrontational experiences especially when in hindsight they turn out to be not as serious as first perceived but the events replaying in my mind sometimes comes with adrenaline rushes.",30May2020,1

189,"I struggle coping with my bipolar one. I am writing this post because I've been feeling nothing but pain lately. I've felt intense emotions all throughout my last relationship, especially toward the end. Worst of all, I feel even more now. I ended an over three year relationship for what I think was the wrong reason. I was getting worse over time, to the point where I had to be hospitalized due to my mania. While in the hospital, I decided to break up with my girlfriend of over three years who I was living with at the time of my episode. This feels so wrong, as she didn't have much say in the matter. My reasoning was that if I ended things, she wouldn't have to suffer along side me and my illness. I felt that she did not deserve to be subjected to my dark side. I feel so guilty that I didn't give her more of a say in the decision. She was willing to work things out and I was too concerned I might have another episode that she didn't deserve to see. I made the choice for her and I fear she resents me for it. I wish she truly understood why I did what I did. I loved her more than I loved myself. This still might be true.

190,"I don't hang out with friends too often, maybe once every 2 weeks, due to extracurricular activities, and just not wanting to more often.

Today, I hung out with 2 of my friends, and at the start, I was full of energy, bubbly, and could have long conversations with both of them. Make them laugh.

But I noticed 2 hours in my mood suddenly changed. I felt drained. I didn't want to be there anymore. I didn't know what to talk about and was silent. But since there were 2 of them, I seemed to convince myself it's their fault, that they weren't including me. But today, after noticing this same thing happens repeatedly, every time I hang out with any friends, *I realized that I am the problem*. 

I can't expect them to talk to me if I'm not talking back. But at this point, it feels like I can't form words anymore. My brain doesn't know how to respond like there's a big gray cloud above me. 

This happens not only when I hang out with friends, but anytime I'm in a good mood. I wake up one day, singing and smiling, and then after 2 hours I feel, once again, drained. It's like my happiness keeps running out. It's like my happiness is in a big jar that slowly spilling out. It confuses everyone around me, including myself. Why am I like this?

 Sometimes it's better to just wake up in a neutral mood; not sad, not happy because I know that I won't be playing ""mind games"" with anyone, and confusing them with my emotions. 

I also have misophonia, and one of the doctors said I need to get out more with friends and just have fun to relieve stress. But I *can't*. As I said, I go out in a good mood, then something changes, and I feel numb again. Why?",30May2020,1

194,"Throughout my childhood, i was a happy child, full of emotions and feelings. Accomplishing goals and overcoming obstacles without any difficulties.
I used to see every obstacle as a challenge, ngl, used to wonder why people cannot do the same things as me? We are humans after all(I was young and silly). I used to feel bad for all my friends and class mates. 
As time passed by, life began to show it’s true self to me.
I lost a very close friend to me at the age of 15.
And then started loosing friends, because of the things i stood up for. People that used to feed on hate and prey on others that weren’t like them.
I tried finding love, but failed, but i still grew.

I remember my first Panic Attack haha, MOMM I AM GETTING A HEART-ATTACK!! My close friends made fun of my panic attacks. After my friend’s death I couldn’t cry, to this day i find it very difficult to cry, to just let tears flow.

The end days of My high school life became more and more tough as days passed, I couldn’t focus on studies and just wanted to please people more and find friends who could just ask me how i was doing.

I still managed to Ace my exams and get into a University far from Home and With nicer people. Coming to Canada felt like a dream come true and that i was finally with people that would accept me for who and what i am.

And they did, but then came the real problem.
I could no longer keep track of my emotions, feelings and what i was saying to people!
Holding conversations was the hardest thing for me, 
Specially remembering instructions felt like being hit by a moon like Iron man did.
I couldn’t understand what i was going through, tried alcohol, weed, most of the drugs to get rid of the anxiety and the stress!
But nothing worked.. i even decided to call it all off.

Little did i realize, everything that happened to me back in high-school was repeating again but with far worse effects.

In my culture, talking to Counsellors or Visiting Psychologists is looked at as weakness or that you you are insane. 

It took me months to gather all the strength to reach out to a same-day counsellor, i was lucky enough to find someone who kept on emailing me and tried to get me to have sessions every other week amidst a pandemic.

Trust me when i say this, My Counsellor made me realize what being mindful is like and that i was not alone facing all this.

My point for writing all this is, At times we feel like giving up, Not reaching out to anyone for help and just staying isolated from everyone.

Try gathering strength by believing and hoping for best.
I used to go out, on a walk, everyday, feeling miserable just to hear bird chirp. Walking everyday used to give me hope and believe that i have a purpose in this world.

I still have a long way to go, still have lots to learn, by i am optimistic and MINDFUL.

195,"All in all, I've had a decent life. A family that loves and values me, a few decent friends, and a good paying job, though a bit of a boring one. But sometimes, I think about everything bad in the world, politically and environmentally, and I get to asking what the point is. It feels like things get worse all the time. And once I start going down that road, I can't seem to stop. I direct all the wrongness of the world onto me; how I'm some useless fat virgin whose every breath takes more of the earth's dwindling resources. Most of the time, I'm more or less okay, but every so often, I have nights where the only thing that helps me sleep is the thought of a knife in my chest.

Obviously, this is not a healthy frame of mind, so I made a decision around New Year that seeing a therapist was a pretty good idea. And it was. I talked with this guy, and it felt like I was finally making sense of this storm in my head. I honestly believed that I was on the road to recovery. Then Big Rona happened. Then my country became the worst-affected in my continent, then I realised that my job could have been done by a trained gibbon, then I realised that even with all the free time in the world, that meant shit if I didn't actually do anything productive with it. At times like these, with nothing to distract me, I've never felt more worthless.

I don't want to deal with any of this anymore. The world doesn't want me, and I don't want the world. I feel like it would be better to die now than deal with similar shit to this for the next 40-50 years. Anyone who tells me that ""ThInGs WiLl GeT BeTtEr"" can fuck right off, becaUSE THINGS ONLY EVER GET WORSE. I just wish people would stop bullshitting and just straight up tell us there's no hope. 

Whatever you want to say to all that, I'm all ears. For now, I'm just going to keep chatting with my family. Maybe then, I'll live something resembling a full life before society collapses.

My parents used to fight a lot when I was a child. Loud, father used to throw objects around the room, hold my mother very tight on her arm. My mother was different, but pretty violent too. She would shout and cry very loud.

200,"I have been having suicidal thoughts for a bit less than a year. Between the murder of George Floyd, pridefall, and the protests turned riots, I've been very suicidal.  I promised myself and my significant other that if the ideation got any worse I would tell my parents. But I'm really scared. Last year I went to a school where I felt very out of place. Many kids there were racist. It was a private school, so I had a lot less money than most of them. I didn't have any friends at all, social situations were a lot harder for me at school there than it was before. I also competetively dance. My closest friend at dance left the team so it was really just me. The teacher there is incredibly ablest, homophobic, and transphobic. She would make jokes about suicide that triggered me very often. I was scared to talk to the other people in my class about it, cause none of them took any problem to the jokes our teacher would make. Even after I came out to them, they didn't see anything wrong with what she was saying. Now I am having panic attacks almost daily. George Floyd's murder has been very hard on me and my dad. (My dad's friend was killed by a police man and never got justice) Not to mention, everyone is calling protesters thugs, and ""typical black people"". I have been sent a death threat on tiktok for being gay, they called me a faggot, and told me to go die. These have both have made me very anxious. Not to mention, I'm scared of being seen with my girlfriend in public, I'm scared of being shot. I want to take a stand, but I don't know what to do. This entire situation has felt incredibly hopeless. It feels like no matter what I'll just be another thug, another faggot. But I know me killing myself is exactly what they want. I don't know what to do, or how to tell my parents. If I tell my parents about the death threats then I'll have to come out to them and I'm not ready. If any of you have some sort of advice, I'm open.  At this point I just want help.",30May2020,1
201,"Hey this is my first post in this sub Reddit so let me know if this post isn’t acceptable or breaks the rules. I am sophomore in high school and I find my self becoming increasingly violent and angry for no reason, with no reason or trigger I will have violent urges and want to smash my head though walls or really anything. It’s not a self harm thing just like a burst of adrenaline and rage. I don’t know what causes this but I recently put my head though dry wall and it caused me to really evaluate my self. So if anyone has any idea what this could be or how to help fight these urges it would be helpful.",30May2020,1
202,"Am I in denial? Is there something wrong with me

Being self aware... trying to come to conclusion if I’m a sociopath. Or if it’s my ocd. And yes I have been diagnosed by a doctor for ocd. And am seeing a psychiatrist to talk about the ocd. But now I feel as if I should talk to them about being a sociopath?  I don’t know what’s going on , or if anyone has this feeling too. 

I’ve been for the past week, looking back at all the shitty things I did as a child and teenager and young adult (but not as much). Things you could see as someone who had conduct disorder as a teen. I was aggressive, angry, and broke things. Sometimes I would feel bad for it ( I think, but at this point, I don’t even know or remember) And some things I intend on telling people
the wrongs I have done. It’s almost like I have to. I don’t know why I got this urge. Like today I indent I’m telling my mom about me breaking her computer. I blamed it on the rain, but it was me dumping water on it. On purpose. It was a silly reason to do it too. And now I’m ready to just tell her today. 

Before I start I am diagnosed with ocd, I guess it doesn’t matter. And I’m debating saying it as I’m worried that means I’m trying to manipulate you guys into telling me I’m not a sociopath, But ever since all this shit going down I’m even debating if I have ocd. 

I’d like to think it sort of started after watching a movie about a murderer who was keeping it secret for years from his family even, and it made me uncomfortable. I thought am I like this guy? Am I crazy like him? It brought back old past things I did mostly as a teen. 
And then I watched a documentary about Jeff Dahmer, which again ramped up my thoughts. I can’t even tell if thats even the truth though.

I can’t tell if I’m just in denial or if I’m worried? I can’t tell anymore.


I keep analyzing everything I do now as well now. If I feel like I wasn’t honest enough I’ll back track and be more honest.
I also started to realize I’d occasionally lie about things in my stories or situations some for no reason at all. To make myself cooler or whatever. And so I’ve tried to back track and almost correct the lies with the truth. 

I also keep back tracking and to see if I’ve had moments of empathy. 

I keep taking online tests, watching videos, consistently reading forums for answers. This has consumed my whole life for about a week. I keep coming home and laying in bed and doing research. I can’t even focus at work or in my personal life. I sort of have urges to just numb my brain for a bit just so I can’t think anymore.

I keep having thoughts and almost fears that I could be like Jeff Dahmer or Ted Bundy and it makes me “nervous”

I write “nervous” because I don’t know if it’s even true emotions anymore. Maybe before all this I would claim I was nervous but now I don’t know. 

I keep having thoughts if I’m a sociopath and I keep trying to think of the best outcome for myself now. And even others in a sense. I keep getting worried about what people will think of me if I am one. 

I tell myself that if I have this condition that I will leave my girlfriend because it’s not right to her. What would be the point if I cannot have feelings for her. And I keep trying to think of the outcomes, I don’t want to just break it off randomly to make her to feel bad or worried but I also don’t know if could tell them. Is it to save face or is it just not make her feel like I wasted their time? I can mentally picture her being hurt which makes me avoid saying anything. I’ve been so obsessive with this idea I am one I have to keep all this research, and posting a secret as I don’t know what to do
Is that a normal thought for a sociopath?

I also started telling people really close to me in my family some of the stuff I did mostly as a teenager as that’s when I was the most reckless and awful. It’s like I have this urge to confess everything. Or at least most of it, as I don’t know how much I can say without losing the trust of my family. 

I wanna just spill the beans on everything badly, I wanna tell my girlfriend but I know it will scare her. I know that she won’t know what to do.

I keep having suicidal thoughts as well, that I’ll be better of dead. To protect myself from others. And I say that maybe I can do something good for someone like my girlfriend before I bite the bullet. But why am I thinking like this? 

I feel like I wore a mask somewhat to fit in, but now all of a sudden I’m trying really hard to just open up. Be honest about shitty things I’ve done, like being racist or just scummy. I use to just not say anything in fear of being hated or ousted. And instead I’d be nice to people and show that I’m not a pos anymore. 

My head feels so numb now, my head hurts and I’m exhausted. 

I’m not sure if posting on here is a good idea, it might make things worse but I just don’t know what I’m going through. 

I’m in a very confused state of mind, and I feel like I’m barley holding on to reality. I don’t know what’s honest of me and what isn’t. I can’t tell anymore what any of my intentions are. 

Lastly, I did recently weigh myself in front of my girlfriend.. I knew she had been insecure recently and shouldn’t of done it. But I wanted to know what her weight was. I keep analyzing that situation and I don’t know if my intentions were to make myself feel better.. I do feel like I feel wrong about it but because of all these thoughts I’m so fucking confused about what my intentions were. 

Everything is just eating me alive and I can’t function.

Where do I go from here? Any advice? Any similar stories?",30May2020,1
203,"I've been severely depressed for the past couple of days, bed ridden but I've been forcing myself to get out of bed. My GF was having doubts about our relationship and wanted me to reassure her and everything she said I guess made me feel worthless and like I wasn't enough and I wasn't trying enough to be better then she tried to undo everything she said and then I took what she said as her wanting to leave me and then I blocked her and then I unblocked and she tried to explain everything again and I've been talking to her but I feel okay now for no reason and I keep getting blanks on everything I think about and keep forgetting everything I keep typing to her I don't know what's wrong with me I'm confused over all of this  
Sorry if reading this comes off stupidly I was writing it while looking at her explanation of what happened

204,"He's been an atheist almost his whole entire life. Now suddenly almost a year ago he started going to church, and then converted to Orthodox Christianity. His whole house is covered with crucifixes, religious icons, etc. A couple days ago he claims that he saw God in a dream and that God wants him to quit his job and build some sort of temple or cathedral? I honestly don't remember what he said exactly. He tried burning his damn tattoo off because he thinks it's a sin. We keep trying to get him to see a psychiatrist.

205,"Hey guys, so uhm, does anyone wanna be mental health buddies?  I don’t have many friends and I have no one that can keep me accountable with my self harm.  I would really love to have someone to relate to and I’m sure a lot of you could use someone to support you too.  I’m 18F, live in Az, I’ve been struggling with mental health since I was 11, I’m Christian but very nonjudgmental (Idc about differences in religion, opinions, race, sexual orientation, I really don’t care 🤷🏼‍♀️ if you respect me I respect you).

207,"I don’t think I have a mental illness, but I have a problem where I can’t be bothered to do anything but go in my phone. I understand that it’s normal short term, but I literally have no desire to do anything except laze around for the rest of my life. Menial takes make me feel so overwhelmed and mentally drained. The only productive thing I do is shower and get changed, and I congratulate myself even for doing that. The fact is, I know I’m lazy and pathetic but I don’t care. 

Every time I try to sort my life out, (eg. eat healthier, tidy, apply for a job, study) I give up almost instantly. I have no mental willpower to convince myself to be productive. 

 I know that I need to get my shit together, but sometimes I feel like it would be easier to live in a mindless haze, or be dead then ever have to work or try hard. I can’t fathom how people work every day of their life, it makes me sick and tired just thinking about it.
