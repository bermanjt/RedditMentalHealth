0,"I'm mildly infuriated by the sudden surge in discussion about mental health, not because I don't think people should talk about it more, but because it feels like it's only now become socially acceptable due to numbers, and not due to empathy. 

The population has effectively been subjected to an experiment which, in a way, emulates the entrapment of mental illness. The things people love, their networks of support, their access to things like recreation, routine, to life in general, have been cut off, and while the physical ability to do those things remains, people cannot simply just 'do' them anymore. 

For years people have told me 'just do it'. For years, it's been near impossible to get them to appreciate that it's not a case of will or won't, or that I don't want to, it's that I CAN'T. 

I CAN'T because my depression has shut me in, away from my life. I CAN'T because my anxiety has enforced the confinement as a desperate condition of my own safety. I CAN'T because my ADHD has torn up my schedule and scattered my hours for work and recreation and sleep beyond the acceptable 9 to 5. I CAN'T because my PTSD has locked me out of my time and place, of space, of me, and how can I do anything when I CAN'T THINK beyond that disassociation? That separation from me? 

My mental illness is cognitive isolation and it predates this pandemic. 

I have been locked in my mind for lost days and counting. There is no perceivable end. I am waiting for a cure that may or may not one day be provided to me. I am uncertain. I am alone. 

This is not a sentence I have chosen. It is enforced by the chemicals governing my brain. I WANT but I cannot DO things. Do they understand now, the rest of them? They cannot go outside their houses and it hurts, doesn't it? And here we are, having watched and wanted the outdoors for so much longer, isolated all our lives. We have never been able to go outside our minds.

It shouldn't take a pandemic to force empathy. I wish I could say the increased discussion is going to change the stigma the mentally ill experience in everyday discourse, but I don't believe the popular memory will hold on to something like empathy. 'Just do it', 'get some fresh air', 'look what a beautiful day it is!'. Read the damn headlines. We WANT but we CAN'T. 

One day, governments will proclaim the outside accessable again. People will open their doors and they'll leave their houses. 

There is no door out of our heads. We can survive like this, sure, but if we didn't have to, why would we? Do you not think we would 'just do' things if only we could?",06May2020,2
1,"My friend needs some advice and I thought that reaching out to reddit could possibly help me be able to help her.

I received a text today:

‚ÄúIts like I don't know how to just be happy at where I'm at. I always focus on the things that I don't have instead of appreciating how far I got in life. I'm not struggling financially anymore, my relationship with my Mom and sisters is fine, I have a boyfriend who loves me despite my flaws, and as far as I know I'm healthy.

So, you'd think that I'll be just fine and dandy, but I'm not. I nit pick everything wrong with me. Idk, even before this coronavirus pandemic started, I was like this so I can't blame it on that alone. I was never really comfortable in my own skin, so it's a harder habit to break because its literally all that I know. I feel like I'm falling behind of getting my self confidence together. And I know that you're trying your best to help me grow and develop into a better version of myself, but it's so hard. Knowing one way of something your whole life and then realising that the way that you were going isn't great and then having to change it is hard (if that makes sense.) And I know that this isn't an over night thing to process and change myself, but the real problem is that I don't know how to make that first step.‚Äù

What would you guys incline as a good first step to boosting your self confidence and self worth?

3,"I have buckets of trauma and issues but I am asking for someone else for once. 

My baby cousin (she is an adult and in grad school so baby here is relative) came to me to talk about some issues. We had some shared opinions on a different family members Facebook posts and got talking. Or rather, she started talking. 

She believes she needs therapy but has trauma around it. She was molested as a child and forced into therapy. Now the idea of engaging in therapy sends her into a panic. 

I was also forced into therapy and can somewhat understand the trauma but I was an adult and I am still coming to terms with my own CSA.

I worry I‚Äôm going to get too old without finding the right person, so I won‚Äôt be able to have children. 2 years ago, I fractured my spinal cord in a drunken attempt to end my life.

8,"First some background - I'm 19M, I've had 3 girlfriends. 

The first one I dated for about 4 months in 11th grade. As it was my first relationship, I was pretty clueless, but she seemed at the time to be absolutely amazing. She had just moved to my school district from nearby, and I totally fell in love with her. She was my cello stand partner, she was quiet and shy but always smiled at me in the hallway and liked my band shirts. She was gorgeous, and I was just head over heels. We started dating and for the first two months, it was great. But then she sort of started getting distant. She would have these periods of like a few days at a time where she wouldn't really talk to me or hang out with me. She'd cancel plans and go hang out with friends from her old school. I felt left out, but I was always good about things because I wanted to be understanding and I knew moving was hard on her. I was kind of your stereotypical sweet quiet music nerd. I loved her and she told me that she loved me, so I figured there was nothing to worry about. A few weeks later she asked me out of the blue what drugs I had tried. I kind of thought she was joking, as she seemed ridiculously straightedge. I told her none and asked why. She revealed that she and her old friends did smoked cigarettes, a lot of weed, and their favorite was oxy. They did lots of oxy. This weirded me out as it was totally out of left field. But I was still nice and didn't say anything except that I didn't think it was for me. A week later we were watching something on her phone when a text popped up from a Daniel saying ""Hey cutie are you still down to get oxy and hook up tn?""? It was revealed through the subsequent conversation that she had a string of guy friends from her old school that she would frequently get high with and have casual sex with. When I asked her why she said ""you're a nice guy but do you really think you could ever satisfy me? You're like a little puppy. You're fun to play with but I have needs."" I was absolutely crushed and I was depressed for months afterward.

Needless to say, I was extremely cautious with relationships from then on. But about a year later a new love interest entered my life. This one was completely different from the last I'll call her J. My school district had one middle school and two high schools, so many people at my hs had friends at our sister high school. I didn't keep in close touch with anyone at the other school, but a lot of my closest friends that I made in high school did. They started inviting me to some parties that were roughly half our school half the other school, and I was reunited with tons of friends that I'd lost touch with. It was great. One of them was a girl I always had a little crush on in middle school, but nothing ever came of it. We started flirting at one of these parties and one thing led to the next and we were dating. I was hesitant to trust ofc, so I talked to some of my friends about it. They all said some variation ""I've known her since preschool she would never do that in a million years. She's like the nicest and most loyal person I know."" And getting to know her, it seemed that they were right. She was awesome. I opened up to her about the past cheating, and she was such a sweetheart. She was extremely supportive and told me that she thought that cheating was basically the worst thing anyone could do to another person shy of abuse. She was always very understanding of trust and trust issues. She was extremely reassuring and loving and made me feel that I had nothing to worry about. I bet you can predict where this is going based on the title of my post. She cheated on me. Ahhhhhh so fun. We had been dating for about a year total. She had this one guy friend from her school that she always seemed a little too comfortable with, I'll call him M. Around M she just acted.... different. I asked her about it and she said that it was just easy to be around him, he almost seemed like ""one of the girls."" And she had a point, M was a super nice and friendly guy. M and some of her other guy friends invited me to hang out with them a few times. It was a really nice gesture and M and I got pretty close. J and I had been fighting recently about pretty mundane shit. M asked about it, and I opened up. Unfortunately, he used this info to get close with her and eventually start sleeping with her, as I would later find out from M's twin brother, who was also friends with me and was horrified when he found out. Needless to say, J and I broke up. But this time, I don't know why, but I made her walk me through all the lies she told to get opportunities to see him. Her extra jazz band rehearsals on thursday nights? Those were made up so they could hang out and hook up. When I went with my family to Disney World? She spent the whole week with him. That time she didn't answer my texts for hours on a day when we were supposed to hang out? She was with him. It was the most painful thing I have ever felt.

I was single for a year and a half after that, and I vowed to put what happened behind me. When I went to college, I tried to become a different person. I wanted to re-invent myself. I was more social, left my room more often, I was just an all-around happier person. That was when I met my most recent girlfriend, L. We started dating, and things were going great. I thought my trust issues were behind me, but alas. After dating for 2 months I found out that L had been seeing this guy H casually for about a year total before her and I started dating. They had hooked up as recently as a week and a half before L and I started dating. I tried to be chill, but all my trust issues started popping up again. I got so anxious and had a hard time trusting her. Every time she didn't text me when I knew she didn't have class, I wondered if she was with H. Not because I actually thought she was. But I thought ""well, you never know right."" I hated that feeling more than anything. I was finally with someone amazing. I was a new, reinvented version of myself. Why couldn't I just trust her? We recently broke up, mostly for unrelated reasons. But I have been left wanting to fix my trust issues once and for all. Any advice?

Tl;dr - my first two girlfriends cheated on me, now I have a hard time trusting anyone. Help!",06May2020,1
9,"Today was a win for me. 
After 10 years of battle with suicidal and ‚Äúdark‚Äù intrusive thoughts, I think I found a proper weapon to battle with. (I‚Äôm sorry for the medieval imagery) 
Yesterday was my breaking point. The thoughts came from all angles, battering me with hopelessness. 
Today I told myself if you really want to end your time here then you should run that hill (large grassy hill used to damn a lake near my house) with a 30lb weighted vest on. So I ran the hill till I puked water. Laying in the grass actually thinking I was going to die, I smiled and was able to focus on my breath without dark intrusion for the first time in a long ass time. 
45 min later I had another deep feeling of wanting to die... so once again I stood up and said ‚Äúif you really want to die then you should do push-ups till you pass out‚Äù... I didn‚Äôt pass out but I did see spots. Once again I had a clear mind! Amazing. Really... my mind races constantly. This was revolutionary for me. Maybe 2 hours later, laying in complete exhaustion- another thought arrives. This time deeper and geared towards past trauma... So i calmly said ‚ÄúI love you but I can‚Äôt do this any more... go and lift weights until you fall to the floor shaking.‚Äù So i did. It was pure torturous bliss. I‚Äôm hoping I will sleep tonight. If I don‚Äôt. I will run until I do. I‚Äôm sick of wallowing in the dark energy that is my intrusive thoughts. I want to be free but I want to be free here. I‚Äôll post again if it becomes a affective method for intrusive thinking. 

Quick back story- I have experience in training and have used similar techniques for panic attacks. Traditionally I just lay in my depression until it‚Äôs bad enough that I turn on the tv until it turns into mush. I‚Äôm sorry if I misspelled something or my sentences are not coherent. I just wanted to get this out and hope it helps someone but I‚Äôm not going back to read it or I‚Äôll become self conscious and delete it...?",06May2020,1

12,"I got on Pristiq for depression 2 years ago. Started cognitive behavioral therapy, exercising everyday, eating right etc. 

Well with my doctors supervision we started tapering off 3 months ago. I just got off the last 3-5% of my last dose. And woooosh severe, severe anxiety/anxious/jittery/heart racing feelings constantly.  Have had minor anxiety in my life but nothing like this. I had anxiety tapering down, but as I got lower and lower it's just gotten worse and worse. 

But now that I'm finally off completely (5 days now) , it is like BAD BAD. I called my psychiatrist and he said ""I can call in some klonopin to get you through"" but I said I was afraid to go down the benzo route and I'll see if I can tough it out. 

Was just hoping to see if anyone else had a familiar experience with getting off their antidepressant and what it was like etc... and how am I suppose to know if this is withdrawal or rebound anxiety (or are they the same thing)?",06May2020,1
13,"Well...I fucked up. 

Before I was sent home from college due to COVID I was really on top of my schoolwork. I sat in the front row of my classes, payed attention and asked questions. I had straight As for the first time in my life while taking a difficult course load. 

Since I‚Äôve been home, I‚Äôve taken on many more responsibilities including taking care of my little sister and helping her with her schoolwork. This is highly time consuming, but my parents are essential workers so this isn‚Äôt a choice. I also live in New York so I‚Äôm basically stuck inside 24/7. I‚Äôm diagnosed with bipolar 2, so I‚Äôm not a stranger to depressive episodes, but being isolated has made it 10000x worse. 

Now, we were assigned a programming HW and I was pretty behind on the material. I managed to catch up and was making progress, but later that day I was going for a run and smelled something in the hallway of my apartment building. I alerted the super and they figured out it was coming from my neighbors apartment. The super called the police and they found his body. Apparently he died of COVID several days prior. For the next few days I was really out of it and was having trouble concentrating on anything. I did my best and failed the HW. 

For the next assignment, I asked a friend who took the class last year if they could help me and they sent me their assignment. I kind of changed things up and rewrote certain parts. 

Then last week the professor reached out to see if everything was ok because I hadn‚Äôt been going to class. I responded saying thanks for checking in and that everything is fine, I‚Äôm just very busy with family responsibilities etc. I didn‚Äôt really want to explain anything and he‚Äôs a nice guy and I didn‚Äôt want him worrying about anything. 

We got back the second HW and the TA left a note: Please talk to the professor this has been flagged for plagiarism. 

I know I‚Äôm in the wrong and want to apologize, but I don‚Äôt know what to say. I‚Äôm genuinely sorry and I didn‚Äôt use my judgement at all. I don‚Äôt want to give excuses, but at the same time I do want the professor to be aware that I was out of it and that this was a huge mistake. I deserve a 0, but I‚Äôm afraid that now I‚Äôm going to fail the class or get a mark on my transcript which will ruin my future. 

How can I apologize and should I explain myself? I‚Äôm freaking out right now because this was literally the last HW and now I might have to retake the class and I‚Äôve possibly ruined my chances of going to graduate school. I‚Äôve never done anything like this before and need all the advice I can get. 

Thanks for reading this.",06May2020,1

So I wanted to make this post in several subreddits to get feedback from different audiences of people. I want to hear how everyone is affected from all spectrums here on reddit so if you have seen this before that is why. Also all rants are welcomed, I don‚Äôt discriminate &lt;3

##To go more in depth with the titles question, what have you conquered/ or are struggling with anything during this time of staying home more than usual? And for some extra questions:

1. What goals do you have/ or are working at to get accomplished?

2. Has it affected your work/social/personal life?

3. And what about the negative side of it all?


#Long rant ahead answering the questions 
***For me*** family life has gotten worse, we have snippet of days/ nights where things are positive but for the most part everyone has been taking this time to be extra bitchy but they won't admit that :) ! 

Fought with my sisters more now, before it would be every other day now it is EVERYday without fail. Won't get into it but just know I wish I could leave. For conquering I have multiple projects I started either working on again, or just made new ones too keep myself busy. ***Also Conquered loosing 9 pounds, have been studying for my EMT stuff and love it because now I understand a LOT more day by day and i just fall in love each and every time. I write, read, draw, basically what I did before but MORE now because it's better than having to deal with everyone else. I still had to deal with them before but now that quarantine is a thing, everyone doesn‚Äôt spend time so they go off and do their own things, as do i. Communication/ open minded people has NEVER been in my family so it is pointless to even start tRyInG tO kEeP tHe PeAcE ya know? 

###I keep the peace by making sure there is no conflict with me involved. Actually when it doesn‚Äôt involve me I‚Äôm always hopping in it because my family lovessss to single people out and make them feel like garbage. *My little sister with autism is always getting heat so every single time i step up for her now I‚Äôm getting beat or in trouble.* It‚Äôs what doesnt come with being the oldest of 2 younger ones, but what comes with being an awesome human being who doesn‚Äôt like abuse. And you know what? If i have to get beat by someone who doesn‚Äôt see what she does wrong than f my mom üíÄ She likes to do what everyone else does and explode on her kids when she‚Äôs not doing okay herself. So you want to beat me for what is right? Make it count cause I have always been taking the beatings for everyone else, just because we are in quarantine doesn‚Äôt mean I won‚Äôt expect them any less. 

I fight my mom back each time because I don‚Äôt know why she thinks i WONT defend myself. Honest to god she tells us not to be with ANYONE who puts there hands on any of hEr KiDs, but will ‚Äúplay fight‚Äù hit us real hard, or even when we deserve it and tell us to take it. And not put our hands up or shield, nada. The youngest could even care less if shes getting in trouble, more less LOVESSS to rat her out for a n y   l i t t l e    t h i n g!!!
I mean *anything*. She does it without fail to the both of us but it‚Äôs okay. Dysfunctional and toxic? That‚Äôs putting the family name lightly but I don‚Äôt hold account of injury, one day they‚Äôll learn hopefully. Until than i protect my sister at all costs. 

And If your wondering why the littlest doesn‚Äôt get mentioned of my protection is because she don‚Äôt need it, my moms always defending her and taking her side. Even when she does ‚Äúget in trouble‚Äù it‚Äôs not the beatings i get lol! She gets a lecture and possibly the silent treatment for a half an hour or so, than their back to their go bestie go bestie relationship. Again I don‚Äôt hold no grudges but I don‚Äôt have a relationship with them that is close so that‚Äôs the entire reason why. 

Anyways

**My goals have been weight loss along with other things but that is d- OH I have been doing women push ups!!!!!** (The one where your on your knees) And so far I can do 2-3 without fail, and each day they get easier. I wanted to build my upper body strength while also getting good at push ups period which i never could do in gym at school XD so that is super fun

I don't work, and I don't have real life friends so my work/social life hasn't changed at all, but my online relationships is a different story, it's whatever. Family life as i said before is torture but honestly there is something new that has been bothering me non stop. I know i could put my problems in the ‚Äúright"" subs but I am asking this question to each sub too see how everyone is, now I am just answering them for everyone else because why not. I won‚Äôt go into detail on this post but it‚Äôs just past demons I can‚Äôt get over that are having me and my mental/ and emotional state like a rollercoaster. It‚Äôs not like i could tell my mom either or get a therapist. It‚Äôs as if I‚Äôm stuck which isn‚Äôt a nice feeling.

Generally, I'm very happy. (I also live with the love of my life and own my own business (and business is going well right now)).  

However, the news (especially about the president and Biden) is seriously getting to me. I'm finding myself almost **obsessed about the election.** Also, I'm the **black sheep politically** of the family (and the state I grew up in). I've been chewed out on Facebook. I shared non-biased news articles. The person who attacked avoiding asking the questions I asked her. (She's a family member.) I'm sure she didn't even read the article. It just triggered her and she launched into her spew of comments. Fun times. 

**What are you doing to stay healthy mentally?** To stay productive? What guiding thoughts or truths help you? To not hold grudges against family members and friends? 

Part of me thinks: 

1. Ok, read minimal news. Don't post on Facebook. 
2. And then the other thought comes to mind, ""This is the time everyone needs to speak up, to explore"". Ugh.

**Request**: Let's **not** get into who we're voting for, or sides. I'm on the side of myself and other staying healthy. That's the ""side"" I want to win. :)",06May2020,1

I look at it like it's my brain trying to fuck me with but I don't know. my whole family is very loving and has never abused me or anything, so I don't understand why my brain is like this, and I want it to stop, I don't wanna picture this stuff anymore. someone please help me.",06May2020,1
29,"So I know my boyfriend has some sort of mental illness, but I'm not sure what it is. He went to a psychiatrist a year ago per my request, but he doesnt remember what they said he had. All he remembers is they mentioned social anxiety and ptsd, and they wanted him to take antipsychotics (which he didn't end up doing because he stopped going)

We are in a 2 year committed LDR currently, but we video call at least once at day. When we call, we will normally either watch a movie, play a game, look at memes, or sometimes just talk about life. We're extremely close and know every little detail about each other, and have been together in person many times.

 But sometimes something will just change in him. He goes from his normal; being happy, making jokes, smiling, etc. To a completely different person. He just stops talking and smiling, and he seems to look really upset. Tells me to shut up, go away, tells me I'm annoying and he doesn't want to even see my face. So naturally, I would think something is wrong and ask if there is something bothering him but when I do he always says nothing is wrong, even if I make him promise he's telling the truth, and we almost never lie to each other about how we feel, if we do, we confess it later. But he never does. There is clearly something different that makes him seem like something made him mad. 

If I leave him alone to kinda let it pass on its own it doesn't go away, no matter how long I leave him alone. If I try to talk to him and distract him he gets mad and tells me he wants to be alone. I don't like to leave him alone once he gets upset because like I said before it does nothing, and I get very anxious because I don't like being alone for so long when he's upset because I care about him and want him happy, and he used to cut himself so I don't want him to do that.

The only way he will get out of this mindset is if we have a huge argument which gets very bad, sometimes with me feeling suicidal, to which he says things that seem like he doesn't care if i did it. He eventually snaps out of it when it hits him how hurt I am. (But when he is normal he will do anything to make me feel better)

I don't want these huge toxic arguments to be the only way out of this, because 1. I don't want to end up committing suicide 2. Its not healthy and 3. Because we should be able to handle it in a calm way. 

Also, he doesn't realize he is acting different until after he calms down. When he's in that state he thinks what he is doing is ok, then ends up feeling disgusted with himself for thinking that.

Is there either any ideas on what could cause him to change like this, like any kind of disorder in mind? Or maybe a way to help these arguments be less intense or stop them entirely? A way to fix his change in personality without such an emotionally draining fight?

 Help, advice, even opinions are welcome. I just feel so lost and alone, I need some support in this. Let me know if you want more information, thanks everyone. :)",06May2020,1
30,"I'm really worried about my younger sister's mental health. She's having to go to school from home (a BIG change for a 12 year old who used to get almost one-on-one help in her small private school), and her grades are slipping. Even during school, she wasn't always the best student. My parents are very strict on her, and they're blaming her bad grades on her ""laziness"". 

I'm her older sister, and she always tells me how worthless and sad she feels. She struggles with not being able to focus on her school work, and she's very easily distracted and anxious. She also tells me that she only listens to our parents because she's scared that they'll yell at her or physically hurt her. My parents are mentally abusive, and act as if being financially supportive is enough. They can be nice, but once you step out of line, they are very verbally abusive and can be physically abusive as well. They  act as if this is alright because this is how they were raised in the Philippines. 

Last year, she was diagnosed with ADD by her physician, but my mother refuses to take that into consideration. I feel like I can't do anything to help her, and I am very concerned about her. 

I myself have anxiety, depression, and and pure-OCD, and even though I feel suicidal at times, I worry about what would happen to her if I was gone. I want to help her so much, but I feel powerless. I don't want her to end up like me. 

If anyone has any advice about how I can help my younger sister, please help.",06May2020,1
31,"Hello all,

Every once in a while I go down this dark hole. I feel bad for myself even though I shouldn't. I feel sad but I don't know why. This happens every 2-3 weeks I guess. I feel like a loser because no one texts me asking if they want to do something, I always ask. Recently my Step Mom was rude to me saying I never go outside and I stay at home all day. In my area, it's safe to travel outside and play golf. At the beginning I spent most of my days at my local mountain skiing for at least 5 hours, now that the season is over I spend around 3 hours every day or every other day golfing, and then later I will ride my bike or walk my 2 dogs for 30 min-1hour. I usually am after that doing homework or watching a show, or helping around the house. I have been waiting to hear back on a job, but I won't hear back from now till the 16th due to COVID 19. She wants me to go out more, which I feel like I have been. I really think I just need to rant. I don't tell anyone about these dark holes because I don't want to bother my friends. 

Thanks guys",06May2020,1
32,"  What is the mind? How do we know we are real? Well first, we have to take a deep look at ourselves and think of an answer for this question:

**What are we**

  No we aren‚Äôt talking physically, we are talking emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. ‚ÄúI think, therefor I am‚Äù is a quote that makes you think about what you are interpersonally. This quote is by Ren√© Descartes and you can find him [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren√©_Descartes). ‚ÄúI think, therefore I am‚Äù means that even if you think you are nothing, you are still something. So don‚Äôt worry friend, you literally *are* something. Another question we have to ask is:

**Why are we**

  Now this is a *very* broad question. So lets focus on two sub-varieties of this question. ‚ÄúWhy are the way you are‚Äù, and ‚ÄúWhy am I here‚Äù. 
You are the way you are because your mind makes up all parts of you personality, perspective, etc.. Your mind builds off of experience and knowledge. You are an intellectual mind. Your mind is you. Why is your mind you? Because without it what would you be? You can‚Äôt think, therefore you aren‚Äôt. You will be *literally* absolutely nothing. 

**The Big Two (Part 1)**

  ‚ÄúWhat is the meaning of life?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat is life‚Äù are two of the biggest questions anyone can ask. 
   This first two answers to the questions are based off my opinions, and will be likely just me rambling. Feel free to skip to the second, more factual answer. Keep in mind there is not definite answer to these questions, and that my opinions are biased. Now, here we go.

  The definition of life (to me) is the fact that you are existing. Existing means thinking, a/o feeling, a/o doing. The meaning of life (according to yours truly) is to focus on the ‚Äúnow‚Äù



**The Big Two (Part 2)**

  From the Oxford Dictionary, the word life means ‚Äúthe existence of an individual human being or animal‚Äù. In a solipsistic (metaphysical anti-realists) POV, the definition of life would be anything that ‚Äúexists‚Äù beyond the mind 1)doesn‚Äôt actually exist, or 2)that we don‚Äôt have access to a mind independent reality. And for the meaning of life? No one really knows anything about it. Each person has a different meaning for their life, if they even exist at all. 

**Final Statement**

  This won‚Äôt be the last post I make about these types of things. In the next Im doing simulated reality, and might do more after that. Keep a close eye for my next discussions. Remember, in the great words of u/southsamurai, ‚Äú...reality is real enough‚Äù

36,"I also posted this in r/advice since that was the first place I thought to go, but I figured it would also be a good idea to put here.

So my boyfriend has been having some serious suicidal thoughts for the past few months and has almost acted on them twice (to my knowledge). These thoughts are giving him a lot of trouble sleeping and he'll have up/down days and weeks. I've been as supportive as I can, but I'm still really worried about him, as this is also affecting his physical health.

He's also not in the best family situation - he's stuck at home with his parents who seem to care but they definitely don't have the right idea of how to handle it. They think that just kind of putting it off and talking about God will help him (and I'm religious, but sis that's not gonna help).

I know that his parents are willing to take him to therapy if he agrees to go, but he really doesn't want to because he's uncomfortable with the whole idea of it. This is a problem though, since his family isn't really helping at all and he can't see any friends right now due to quarantine. I know that he needs some form of intervention right now, because he's not in a good situation. He also needs somebody with authority to tell his parents that they need to take him more seriously (and I know can't do that without them blowing me off and getting mad).

To those who have gone to therapy and maybe didn't want to in the first place, is there anything that I can say or suggest to help him decide to go? Or is there some sort of alternative that you know of that he might be more comfortable with? He just needs something to happen, and soon. 

I live in the USA if that helps with any services or suggestions.",06May2020,1

It is incredibly frustrating for me. For instance sleep: I've always slept just fine until I was in my late teens. Now I'm regularly awake till 5 in the morning looking on my phone. I know I should not do this and for the last four days I was in bed and asleep at midnight. I stood up the next day at 9 ish. That to me is huge. This evening I did everything exactly the same switcht everything off lied in bed started reading and after 5 pages went nah not tonight. It is almost 5 am and once again I'm awake scrolling on my phone. It's not that I don't want a good sleep schedule.

41,"The post is kind of exactly how the title sounds. Background first. I‚Äôm turning 18 in a month and I‚Äôve just finished my first year of college. I‚Äôve been struggling with my mental health (depression, anxiety, eating disorders, self harm, suicide attempts, trauma from a toxic home life, etc.) since middle school but my parents have this idea that since I‚Äôve always been a straight-A student, I‚Äôm too smart for therapy and can handle my problems myself. I was punished and ridiculed for having symptoms (yelled at and grounded when they saw cuts, laughed at and called dramatic while having a panic attack, etc.) and not allowed to seek help. If I had talked to a guidance counselor in high school I would‚Äôve been punished severely and they would not have allowed me to get or stay in treatment. I went away to college last fall and that helped a lot, but wasn‚Äôt a magic cure. I had a bad eating disorder relapse and scared the hell out of my friends and boyfriend, who encouraged me to go to the university counseling center. They were very nice and my assigned therapist did her best, but since I was a minor they couldn‚Äôt do anything for me without parental consent. I finally talked with my mom about it and her response at the time was ‚ÄúI think therapy is useless and you should deal with it yourself but if you want to go, sure‚Äù. Upon seeing the consent form she changed her mind because A.) the campus counseling center legally has to release therapy records without notifying me if they‚Äôre subpoenaed by a federal investigative body like the FBI and B.) they‚Äôll release my records if requested to some national accreditation bodies in some career fields (e.g. ASHA, the group I‚Äôll have to get my speech pathology license from when I finish school). She went into a tizzy about how I‚Äôd never get a job or I could be arrested by the FBI for a crime I didn‚Äôt commit on account of being crazy. (There‚Äôs no sense trying to change her mind here.) She said I consent to what I wanted when I turn 18 but she wouldn‚Äôt support it. My mom is the more logical of my two parents on the situation so I‚Äôd get an even worse response out of my dad. 

I‚Äôm about to turn 18 and I desperately want and need to start therapy. Probably a lot of it considering how much there is to unpack and learn to deal with. The problem is, I have no way to afford it. My parents have this thing about requiring their kids to go through school, and they financially support us through it but in exchange for that we have to live life on their terms until we graduate (for example, I cut and dyed my hair, I got about 4 hours of lecturing about how I was a terrible daughter with a faulty moral compass, and they told me if I ever tried to do something like that again I had to move back home and they‚Äôd kick me out when I become a legal adult). After graduation we can do whatever we want. Part of the rules mean I‚Äôm on their health insurance and I‚Äôm not allowed to work or otherwise earn an income. I have a debit card which they put money on if I tell them I need something, but they can see all my purchases and take the card away at will. I own $300 cash but they‚Äôre ‚Äúholding onto it for you‚Äù in their safe in their bedroom closet so I can‚Äôt access it without telling them what it‚Äôs for and they must approve its use. I‚Äôm still looking into whether it‚Äôs worth it to just cut all ties on my 18th birthday and try to make my own way or suck it up for a few more years so I can at least avoid student debt before breaking away, but either way I‚Äôm in need of mental health treatment now. How do I go about doing this? Technically doing something through their insurance is possible (I‚Äôll catch a bunch of shit about it but they won‚Äôt refuse to let the insurance cover me) but I don‚Äôt know how to figure out who or what it‚Äôll cover. If there‚Äôs any sort of copay I‚Äôll have no way of paying it. I‚Äôve looked into online platforms like 7cups etc. but those have subscription fees which I have no way to pay. Essentially, I need a way to start and stay in therapy for free. Does anybody have any advice or resources for this?

Tbh its hard to imagine me in a position where I'll eventually kill myself, but like who expects to end up in that position?

So one of the things that seems to be causing my problems is friends and education, so I don't really have any personal relationships, and I don't have a ton of formal education cause I dropped out when I was like 13(17 now) cause of domestic issues at home. I'm not even sure I can develop a proper meaningful relationship atm, like I simultaneously really want relationships while also not understanding the point of it. I kinda lost most of my  friends after dropping cause I isolated myself a lot, I have like one friend who I've had for years, apart from him, not really, there are people who I text, but like idk, not sure how real they are. last time I met with someone was before September I think, like a friend, tbh I probably only met up like less then a dozen times last year, idk, lol, such is life.

So yeah, I've been depressed for a few years, at times I was doing ok, at other times less so, I used to self harm a few years ago, was able to stop that though. I've also tried getting help, when I originally hurt myself I was 14 or so and was able to get a referral, but at the time I wasn't too into I guess and stopped after a few weeks. I tried to get another referral last year, although apparently the waiting list is a few years, which ya know isn't great, although I wonder, i'm not sure how serious I am about this, but its a thought that popped up, I wonder if I could intentionally harm myself for the purpose of getting some help, they might take me more seriously if my actions were more serious is the idea. Idk, just ideas, although I don't know if I can do this on my own and it kinda tears me apart sometimes, I feel pretty alone and have for a long time, I wonder if its my situation or if my brain is messing with me. I'm not too sure, but hey, those are my thoughts.

49,"My father (60M, resident of Georgia, USA lives alone) has been in a severe bipolar depression for the past 18 months. As a consequence of his illness, he's unable to complete tasks like cooking, showering, buying groceries, cleaning the house, refilling prescriptions, paying bills, using a computer, or answering the phone. He can do these things if he is absolutely ordered to, or if there is someone there to closely help him, but otherwise he lays in bed throughout the day. Prior to his depression, he was completely independent and could complete all the above tasks. Fortunately, there's been no evidence that he's considering hurting himself. However, his depression is causing him to lack the motivation necessary for daily tasks of independent living.

We (his two adult children) live 8+ hours away, and for months 0-11 we made monthly trips home to help him pay bills, take him to monthly psychiatrist appointments, restock his food, and so on. He strongly resisted the idea of leaving his home to live with us. We also hired someone to cook him daily meals in home. However, the conditions in his home eventually became appalling (dirty, bug infested), he did not regularly take his medication, and he lost 20% of his body weight due to not eating enough. For this reason, we more or less forced him to move in with us, and for months 12-18, he has lived with us. This helped in some ways. He regained his weight, took medication regularly (without reminders from us), and would do some tasks around the house if asked to (cooking simple meals, putting dishes in dishwasher). This seemed promising. His mood improved slightly, but he still laid in bed for 98% of the day. We are obviously not trained mental health caregivers, but we gave it our best to help him become more independent.

This week, we attempted for him to live independently in his home. It failed. Over the past 6 days, he skipped his medicine, did not shower or change clothes once, and didn't make an attempt to get groceries or refill prescriptions. He didn't call us for help.

We are a good support system for him, but we aren't trained to handle this, and caring for our father in a hands-on way for the past 18 months has worn us down and come at a huge cost to our work and our own relationships‚Äîwith only partial, temporary progress to show for it. He has been on 3+ new medications for depression, and none seemed to make a substantial difference. Clearly, our efforts to help him live alone have not worked, and we need to try something more drastic.

One idea is for him to live in an assisted-living facility until he recovers. The priorities would be 1) trained staff looking after him, encouraging him to shower, dispensing meds, helping with daily tasks and 2) socializing him with other people. One challenge for this is the cost; he is on a somewhat decent healthcare exchange plan, which potentially could help with it? Another challenge is his almost certain unwillingness to participate in it voluntarily. Throughout his depression, he's resisted seeing doctors, talking to therapists, moving in with us, etc, and we expect this would be no different. We aren't sure how to handle this, but we're ready to go nuclear, such as obtaining legal guardianship, if that would help. Obviously, this is extreme, but he is in desperate need of serious help, and make no mistake, this depression is ruining his life. Doing nothing and leaving him at home is the other extreme, and we 100% think he would literally starve to death.

We're at our wits end and in need of advice.",06May2020,1
50,"My (25F) mother (43) has been having some wild symptoms starting back in October. She has been an on and off drug abuser for a large part of my life, with her choice drug being prescription pain pills. She has suffered a lot of trauma in her life time, and minus some narcissism issues and some kleptomania, she is a fairly good person. A mother, a wife, a friend, a grandmother. After going on months of adderall binges and abuse, she had an experience frighten her where she was *possibly* caught by a co-worker selling adderall to another co-worker. This is a big no-no, especially as she is a healthcare worker. This experience, started a downhill spiral of psychosis. She left my father, who has been beside himself with having no idea what to do. He‚Äôs a wreck right now and has been for months. She believes that cops all over my state are stalking her and monitoring her every move. She believes that she is living her version of The Truman Show and that everyone wears contact lenses with cameras in them. She believes that she has a whole bunch of fans that communicate to her through YouTube video suggestions, and sits in her car for hours doing a weird dance and singing (quite horribly I might add) at the top of her lungs, in which she calls ‚Äòperforming for her fans.‚Äô 

She believes we are all out to get her. That we are enemies. She hides knives all over the house. She comes home with bruises on her arms from ‚Äòswinging on swings‚Äô.‚Äô I could seriously go on. My dad and I are at the point where we are fearing for her life and ours, as she is so unpredictable at this point. As of right now, she is in a hospital with a 72 hour hold, which I am praying to god will lead her to being institutionalized so she can get the help she needs. We are seriously afraid for our lives and hers. We have no idea where to go from here. I have no idea how to process any of this. To process the mother who I‚Äôve pretty much deemed as gone since her mental health hit bottom at the end of October. To process the grandmother that literally abandoned her grand daughter to play this game in her head. To process my father being the weakest and most broken and beaten down I have ever seen him. I know this is something she may not have chosen for herself, and mental illness is a bitch, but this is all so outrageous I don‚Äôt know how to feel. 

Tl;dr my mom has been placed on a crisis hold and I‚Äôm hoping she gets institutionalized to help dig her out of a 7 month long bit of psychosis. I don‚Äôt know how to feel about the absolutely insane behavior she‚Äôs displayed over this time.",06May2020,1
51,"I've never posted to reddit and I have no idea if this will help at all, or really how I should say this, but I need some input or advice, any and all is appreciated. I was originally going to post this in a subreddit for asking doctors questions, but I didn't think it would fit because this is not a traditional medical question.
I've recently realized that something I've been doing for years that I thought was normal is not so normal. I've always been worried about the possibility of someone watching me, and I always keep cameras facing away from me and look up into air vents to see if there is a camera hidden in them. I never definitively know if there is a camera in a vent, there never is, obviously, but I always have a feeling there might be, and I instinctively look, usually in the vents in my house. I am 19 years old and I've done this for years, I do not know exactly how to put it into words, but my reasoning was something like ""oh I'm just self conscious and don't like the idea of people seeing me naked in the bathroom"" and ""I do not want people looking at me if I accidentally forgot to end a video call or they hacked into my device and are watching me"" and stuff along those lines. I do have a general dislike of being watched on things like store security camera's, but I get over it. I've never thought much of it until recently, but now that I think about it, it's making me feel very uneasy that I even think someone is watching me. I know I shouldn't, and I have no reason to believe someone is watching me, and the idea of a camera in my air vents is crazy, but I have the feeling and thought of it anyway. 
The thing that really got me to realize that this shouldn't be benign is the fact that I have been seeing things that are not there for the past two years, and it's been getting more frequent recently. It's always very small things, like bugs flying around me or near me in my peripheral vision, or reflections. In my room, my TV is facing my bed and door, and when it is off, I frequently see someone dart past my door through the hallway in the corner of my eye, but I know that nobody is there because either I didn't hear any footsteps, or nobody else is upstairs to begin with. I always attributed this to bad sleeping habits (I tend to have horrible nightmares that make me not want to sleep when I fall into pits of depression or extreme stress), but it's been continuing even when I'm feeling fine, though I am still stressed out a lot of the time. And yesterday I was keeping my windows open to let the breeze flow through the house, and in the corner of my eye, through my window, I kept seeing my neighbors curtain close, as if they were looking at me through their window, but I know for a fact that they were never open in the first place.  I thought I saw this happen three times yesterday. I also swear I saw a bug flying next to my face, in my peripheral vision, but when I looked it wasn't there. 
I do not know how I never thought any of this was weird or abnormal until now. 
I do have a history of poor mental health, including depression, self harm, suicidal thoughts and two suicide attempts. If it is relevant, I was exposed to multiple illicit substances when I was in my biological mother's womb, and my biological mother, if I recall correctly, has schizophrenia, or has put herself into periods of drug induced psychosis. I try not to ask too many questions because I do not like to talk to her or about her, so I do not know the full extent of her mental illnesses, but I do know that she has thought people were hiding camera's in her walls, she was hearing voices, and she once barged into my house after claiming she was invited here by us because her dead ex husband and his friend stole her car, phone, and keys, and was trying to hurt her. Her car was found in the parking lot of a diner and was full of drug paraphernalia, her phone was found in a park, and she was high on multiple drugs, including meth and cocaine. My point is, her mental illnesses may be caused by drugs, so it may have no relation, but I do not know how drugs work, as the only drugs I have ever taken was ADHD medication, which I have not taken in 7 or 8 years, and antidepressants that I took for a short time. 
I have no history of drug abuse, and I do not know if mental illness can be caused by drugs in utero, or passed down through genetics. I still want to attribute it to simple stress, sleep problems, and general paranoia involving my self conscious nature, but I think I should still talk to my doctor about it. 
I live with my adoptive mother still, and I do not know how I should approach her about the topic, because she is one of the causes of my depression and stress, and in the past she has told me I do not have depression and that I have nothing to be sad about, despite being diagnosed by a psychiatrist and a doctor, and being prescribed antidepressants. (I didn't take them very often, because I felt they didn't help and I didn't want to pump myself full of a drug that doesn't help). I do not know how to approach her on the topic, or if I should do so *before* talking to my doctor about my concerns because I am worried she will react negatively. Again, I really think this is probably just a mixture of stress, poor sleep habits (poor sleep habits don't happen very often, though), and general self consciousness and insecurities and a fear of being watched, and I understand that thinking there could be a camera in an air vent is absurd, to say the least, but the idea and feeling floats in my mind regardless.
Any input or advice is appreciated. 

I keep wanting to just close out of this tab, not hit submit, and just pretend that all this never happened, just shove it all down and pretend that everything is normal, like I always do with my problems. But that is probably not the best idea, because if it is stress, I need to develop better coping mechanisms, and if it's something more serious, I need to consult *someone*, at least. I probably shouldn't be nervous to post this, but I've been looking at the submit button for a while now, so I am going to hit submit.",06May2020,1
52,"TW: mentions of self harm &amp; suicide

hi all, as the title states, i want and need help badly. however, my parents (specifically my mom) do not ‚Äòbelieve‚Äô in mental illnesses and they feel like those who seek help are weak. they also do not believe i have any reason to have a mental illness or even need help. for context, i am a 16 year old female with fairly decent grades and a decent home life (these are important to them so imagine i should include that) so in their eyes i am okay, and i have absolutely no reason to need help. but if i was to be able to get help, i could not receive it without their aid. i know that there is something wrong with myself but i am not going to claim i have something without the proper diagnosis. 

i have struggled with suicidal thoughts and self harm for what feels like forever but i believe it started when i was around 9-10. as i have gotten older, those thoughts/feelings have snowballed and became something that hinders my day to day life. there is not a day that goes by where i am not having the urge to self harm (i am currently 2 ish weeks clean though). i know this probably sounds like everyone else but i am struggling, and i need help. all of my friends who i have reached out to about my issues all think i should seek help, and they have every right to think that. i never thought i was going to make it to my 16th birthday and sometimes i feel as if i will definitely not make it to my 18th birthday if i do not receive the help i need. i want to get better not only for myself first and foremost but for all of my friends and my boyfriend. i know they all care about me and want to see me get better. i have pushed them away when things would get bad but i assume they knew i never did it with malicious intent, i was simply doing it to protect them from my destructive behaviors. 

with everything that is going on in the world currently and school being over for the year, being isolated with them and my own thoughts is becoming extremely destructive. i know i am spiraling out of my own control. i‚Äôm suffering more than ever, and i do not want to burden my friends with my issues. i know that getting help in the current state of the healthcare system would be difficult as my mother recently had emergency surgery and it was difficult for her even though what she needed was necessary. i just want to be able to receive help as soon as i possibly can. 

an event that really sent me over the deep end happened recently. i had not eaten for a little over 4ish days nor had i left my room. my mom called me out for dinner and i told her i wasn‚Äôt hungry (as i wasn‚Äôt and i didn‚Äôt want to waste food) and that set her off. she came back a little later and forced me out of my room, making me stand at the dinner table while she told me things. ‚Äòyou haven‚Äôt eaten, you‚Äôre not getting out of bed, you haven‚Äôt left your room, you don‚Äôt want to do anything anymore. what‚Äôs your god damn problem? it‚Äôs not my fucking fault you can‚Äôt see your friends right now, so don‚Äôt blame me!‚Äô i didn‚Äôt know how to react so i just broke down in front of her and started crying. i wanted to tell her i don‚Äôt feel like me anymore and that things are getting harder and harder every single day but i didn‚Äôt.

the only thing i want is help. i don‚Äôt want pity or anything of the sorts, just help. yet i have no idea how i should even begin to approach her about this. my apologies if this doesn‚Äôt make sense or seems very ‚Äòrambly‚Äô, i tried to make it informative but also to the point. thank you for taking time to read this and all advice will be greatly appreciated and taken into consideration.",06May2020,1

54,"I just...really need to know that this will end. I‚Äôve written about it here before but basically, my ex partner had a psychosis episode after we broke up, and after that part of her delusions became about me, me planting cameras in her home, doxxing her, just me generally being part of the Bad Guys. She was really aggressive and cruel towards me when I left. I have to admit that that did hurt but I know it‚Äôs just the illness telling her these things and my feelings aren‚Äôt the priority here.

But today she sent me an...intimate video we took together when we were still dating. No warning. No context. I asked her why, and that I thought she had deleted them. She just said ‚Äúlol‚Äù and after some pressing told me to stop doing what I was doing, that what I did was worse than what‚Äôs she‚Äôs doing to me now, to stop bothering her (I haven‚Äôt contacted her at all since she sent me some aggressive texts last week) and that she‚Äôs holding onto them ‚Äújust in case‚Äù.

This whole thing gave me an awful panic attack and I‚Äôm just. So tired. I talked to her family about it and they offered to intervene but she‚Äôs also back with an abusive ex who‚Äôs taking advantage of her mental state, so I don‚Äôt want to cause conflict that will alienate her from her only remaining support system or push her further into that abuser‚Äôs arms. 

But also...I didn‚Äôt do anything to deserve this. I haven‚Äôt contacted her, and the delusions about me are still persisting and she‚Äôs honestly just acting cruelly at this point and it really hurts and distresses me. I know it‚Äôs not her fault, in her normal state of mind she would never do this. But in her current state of mind, she doesn‚Äôt believe anything is wrong and she doesn‚Äôt want treatment, and I‚Äôm the crazy one and am conspiring against her.

Will this end with time? Will she get better without treatment? It‚Äôs been almost 3 weeks now. I‚Äôm working with her family to try and help her but she‚Äôs an adult so they can‚Äôt force her to get help. I just want this to end so badly, I want it to end for her AND for me. The way she‚Äôs treating me is just...awful, and so unlike her. I‚Äôm losing hours at work, my throat and head hurt from crying and chain smoking, my stomach hurts all the time now, my anxiety is through the roof...It wasn‚Äôt my business even when I was just trying to help her family find treatment for her (language barriers) but now it‚Äôs directly affecting me and I just need to know it will end.

Xxx XXX - Spiritually castrated lost boy

Hey there. My name is Xxx XXX. I am a less younger but roughly similar version of myself at 22. Having just had a spiritual awakening abroad I came back home to share my new self and was somehow destroyed. I don‚Äôt think I have felt deeply happy or content since then. I am unsure if I have done anything to perpetuate my struggle or am in a genuinely difficult position that I haven‚Äôt received the help I need for. I am sure I could have been someone much better and more positive, more peaceful inside and healthy, at this age.

As you can see from my work history I have done a good job in recent years of avoiding a stable position and financial responsibility. This is because I feel deep dread and despair when I look into the future in general. All I see is my same disempowered, disheartened self a little more old and broken down, in a shitty world. To get around this pain I naturally avoid endeavours that mean anything to me except for those that offer a chance to runaway or have the miragic quality of maybe (unlikely) being a magic bullet to my emotional and mental problems.

I have notably low self-esteem, so much so that it is very rare for me to feel empowered in a relationship and even more rare for me to respect a partner I have. I pretend to, to myself and to them that I do respect them and value the connection, but really I extend the same harshness I apply to myself to those that feel intimate. Often I will make deep sacrifices in an attempt to be validated by someone else. This never works, and I never learn

Another effect of this low esteem and self-belief (particularly in my ability to take action and improve my situation, to live a meaningful, happy life) is that when I am part of a project or team I extend this outlook to that which I am party to and generally drag things down in subtle, invisible ways. I just cannot envision success for things that I am part of.

You should hire me because I need help to get out of my situation. I have a lot to offer under my stunted masculinity and weakness. I am kind some of the time. I have lots of potential if only someone would help me see it and guide me through my pain.

People in my life comment how strange it is that I am letting my youth, talent and general privilege dissolve when I have so much going for me. They cannot see what is holding me back.

When I am in deep stress I get by by reminding myself that I can always kill myself. I know where to find a gun and/or a car and as long as these are available I can get myself out if the suffering gets too intense or I become too ashamed/sad/lonely/decrepit. Sometimes this is how I can get to sleep at night when I am crying alone thinking about my situation.

The trickiest thing about this is thinking about how that would affect my family and friends, *what if I left my body with no face? Would that make it harder?* And also thinking about how much I would be giving up, maybe in my years of distress I have stumbled very close to the answer I needed, what if I held out just a bit longer. But I don‚Äôt want to hold out just to live a half life, like my uncle, and then kill myself anyway later. I would rather finish it early",06May2020,1
56,"I feel like every time I start a friendship/relationship I eventually lose interest in the person ( to the point of finding them annoying ) and start being cold and reply less and less until they get tired and annoyed of it , and then I go back to talking to them again normally ( and genuinely want to maintain the relationship ) and it goes on and on until eventually they leave and I‚Äôm just left there feeling stupid and wondering why I didn‚Äôt put more effort if I was going to feel this shitty and guilty when they finally snap at me .

59,"Hi there, I've never posted here before but hope this is ok. 
I am currently staying with my parents during the lockdown and my 25 year old brother with bipolar disorder lives here. It's a lot. He is pretty manic most of the time, and he is very loud and communicates in a way that's almost always argumentative. For example, he will bring something up and if I have anything to say that isn't 100% in agreement with what he says, it's a full blown argument and I'm the one making it that way. And you can't get a word in, either, even in casual conversation. He'll ask a question, and someone will go to respond and he immediately interrupts, and the cycle continues. Today my dad had to walk away because he couldn't get a word in, and my brother thought my dad overreacted and I casually said ""well you interrupted him every time he tried answering your question."" He stormed away and said I was always picking a fight.
I have on many accounts tried to calmly describe to him how I like to be communicated with, and he just isn't receptive and blows up and storms away. 

What I'm getting at is I don't know how to be around him. Do I just let him say these things and not ever really say what I think so I can avoid his intense reactions? That makes me really sad and like I will always have a surface level relationship. I also really worry about his ability to find success in the workplace if he just can't have a conversation. 

It also doesn't help that he self medicates, but right now that doesn't seem to be too destructive. 

TLDR; my brother is bipolar and I need help with how I should patiently respond to his behavior",06May2020,1

I can't look at my body when I shower. I get angry so easily, makes me wanna rip some ones hair out. I'm scared of bugs and my dad throws dead ones at me, it makes me feel weak because im scared. I can't get out of bed most days. If I'm hungry and want a small snack I can't get one because my dads girlfriend might see and start going off about how if I'm hungry I should eat food thats good for me. She's the main reson I feel so fat, when I wanted to see how much I weigh she came and said that I was a ""big girl"" I smiled when she said that because I didn't know what she ment she look and and said not to smile being that isn't good'.

I don't have much to live for some of the reasons I'm still alive are my family I don't want them to be sad and my pets I love my pets I don't wanna leave my friends, I'm to scared to, and I wanna see what will happen in the future. When I'm olded I want a wife(yes I'm lesbian) and wanna be and tatto artist or I wanna own a book shop. But I don't know if I'll make it I'm not very smart and I'm not pretty.

61,"I'm exhausted, mind my poor grammar and general lack of direction. I no longer feel the same, and I need someone's help. I feel no hate, no pain, no love or happiness.

Lately, I'm felt as if I have two different thoughts and opinions on things.
I may be scared of something, but another part of me isnt and actively enjoys whatever it is..

I hate my father who abused me, but I also love him so much, I wish he would disappear but I wish he would also stay by my side... even with people who I dont like at all, everything I feel fades away.

Someone could make fun of me and humiliate me, and I may feel at first indescribable hate, with intent to hurt them... but then it fades and I feel nothing, I don't feel like retaliation is something that would solve my issues.

When I was younger, I used to bully my classmates and enjoyed hurting others for fun, seeing them hurt was enjoyable knowing that they were weaker, I felt superior knowing they were beneath me...

I switched schools multiple times because of my father's work, and I developed a shy personality, everything I felt before was gone... I used to like talking and causing trouble and problems, or hurting people... but then after moving so much, I felt so detached that all I did was read and be by myself for grade 8..

I would always hear ""why are you so quiet"" ""he's so weird he never talks to anyone"" and though, I did talk to peolple, but I never was outgoing, I played with 2-3 kids but I always felt as if it wasn't worth it... it didn't feel entertaining to do so, and I just wanted to pass the time and finish recess/lunch and continue on doing work...


During grade 9, it got worse, my opinion on myself shifted and I began to loath who I was, I hated my father for the choices he made and what he did to me growing up, but I also hated everyone else for having a life I could never have, I was jealous they grew up in a loving environment.

I started reading and studying alot more, my grades began raising very high and though I should have felt proud of myself, I only ever thought about revenge against my father and other people, I never talked to anyone because I was different than them.. small talk to me was useless, tell me what you want straight. I didn't like hanging around with people, because I felt as if I could see straight through them and it made me feel gross..

It changed during grade 10 when I met a few kids who practically forced me to hangout and be friends with them, they weren't the popular kids, but they knew everyone of them and they knew him as well. I felt so alone and weird, everyone else could talk so well and I didnt know what to say or talk about, you can pretty much tell I never had a girlfriend  because of this, and I REALLY wanted someone then...

Overtime, I felt more and more open and started talking, I smiled more and became friends with mutual friends, of course I was still weird, just not as bad as before. I still felt the hate towards my dad, every single minute even if I was laughing with friends it was always there..

Sometime during the end of semester 2, some personal family issues happened, which led me to cut everyone off, I was left alone by choice, I turned off my phone and enjoyed my summer break by myself... I sat in my dark room with only my thoughts and regrets of what I did, I made myself believe I was worthless and that(we will call him jim) Jim wasnt my friend, that he felt pity towards me, maybe he did at that time, but he could have hung out with ANYONE yet he chose me time and time again.. I would cancel or just not show up, and he'd get mad at me, but then I'd apologize after sometime and we'd chill again, he was popular knew everyone, had alot of girls that liked him yet he didnt care at all..

He confused me so much but I was glad he was my friend, I had other friends but he stuck by me, no matter what, I was bullied by this one kid, but theh both knew eachother and Jim would always step in and ignore him whenever he was with me, and force the other guy to leave since there wasn't much of a conversation.. I appreciated that so much, I wasnt much for confrontations to be fair, I was afraid of having someone angry at me, but I didnt like someone insulting me either..

During the end of the summer, I snapped... my mental health dropped, I felt psycho, I wanted to actively hurt people, my head was filled with murder and wanting to inflict pain, I enjoyed sadistic thoughts that whenever they came up I'd laugh from joy and ecstasy...
Overtime, from crying so much, I started laughing whenever I felt pain, I laughed and overtime it went away, but instead of feeling pain I felt pure anger. I wanted to hurt people who were innocent, who did absolutely nothing to me, just because I was hurt myself I wanted to ruin other people and my father as well...

I became obsessed with myself, my confidence rose to the top, I changed my style haircut, personality I wore a mask at all times. I felt as if this was the only way I could do it, the sensitive version of myself only got hurt and used, I never felt good, so I pretended.. 
And it worked.... I made people who didnt even know me laugh, and I laughed with them whenever.. I didn't truly laugh, we both had different humor, I laughed to fit in, I would always pay extra attention to what people liked doing, hobbies, things they talk about..

I acted different towards different people to get close, I felt like I needed to do that to earn their trust and protection.. I surrounded myself with people who laughed at me in grade 9, and at that time I felt very egotistical and felt happy, knowing that no one else knew I was faking all of it..

I felt nothing then, before I was hurt so much, I blamed my issues on past problems, cried felt so much anger and blame on my father...yet now, I felt as if nothing bothered me, insults that rarely happened didnt affect me, I wasnt shy, I said what I wanted whenever, I wasn't afraid of my dad and in fact, I wanted to see me how I was, just to see his reaction....

But he wasn't the same either.. he was an addict, but he was trying to better himself now, he apologized to me for everything that happened in the last, and he knows that he screwed up but he wants me to know that he will ALWAYS ""love"" me no matter what I do or where I go. I wasnt expecting that, I wanted him to leave for days on end, or to verbally tear me apart or backhand me, I wanted it... but it didn't happen, I felt angry, so fucking much, I thought to myself that why did it happen now, now that I didnt care about anyone but myself, that he decides to change himself.. why didnt he do it when I was younger, when I NEEDED someone to show me the proper way, to tell me I was needed, to say I was loved and didnt have to act out for attention.

Of course I forgave him, he would often give me money, and in order to get more, I would need to be friends/good terms with him, so I smiled and cried and admitted that I was so proud of him and hugged him, we sat there for about a minute thinking back now.
After we laughed and joked about being overly sensitive, he said he had to go to meet his girlfriend, but that he'd be home for dinner, and I said sure.. I went to my room and laughed to myself, kept laughing, I didnt know if I was hurt or if I thought I was so cunning and smart, I really didnt know what I felt and it scared me for the first time.

I read about psychology a bit, and sociopaths and psychopaths, I didnt think I was one, and I didnt want to be one to be honest. I still felt emotions, but I could numb them and use them whenever I needed to. Tears and sadness are good if you hurt someone and you need an excuse to say it hurt you too, so I would cry and act weak whenever something I didnt want happened...

I started hanging out daily with new people and even girls started messaging me, and I'd be able to talk to whoever I wanted to now, I'd face time girls all the time at night and grow closer to them. They loved having my attention, and I loved having their trust. My sex drive was gone though, I had a high one in grade 9 and 10, but now I didnt care at all.. I could still maintain an erection and commit to it, but I didnt have any lust towards them, I felt nothing, but I knew they could be used sometime in the future for a favour so I kept talking to them.

I lost my virginity to a girl that was innocent and sweet, she was everything I was, and someone I wanted to be when I was a kid. I didnt exactly feel bad about lying to her constantly, but I didn't feel good either. I didnt know whether or not good or bad even existed, to me those terms were just made up to justify actions other people made.

I would end up dating that girl and cheating on her skth several other girls, at the start I believed I didnt care for attention but.. I needed it so much to survive, if I didnt have it my head would fill with psychotic thoughts and anger, so I had to dull that out with girls who spoke to me, distracted me from everything, I couldn't be angry and maintain a front at the same time so I knew that was my only choice. I couldnt used a doctor because I knew he may prescribe serious meds, and put a warning on me as a potential danger to myself and others so I didnt tell anyone. I trusted no one, not even my good friend Jim who stuck by me since day 1, I couldnt ever fathom trusting an unknown person.

(Its 6 am as I'm writing this, so sorry for bits preceding pieces being apart and poor grammar, it's hard remembering how I was)

I always had drama stuck to my name from something I did, but it never mattered because I had so many friends that would back me up, they trusted me, and those girls did too.
The first girl I dated (we'll call her sam) found out I cheated on her, and told her friend that I did, and she put out some rumours that I forced myself on her, and I took advantage of her sweet personality for my own gain. And while I didn't really care much for her, I didnt care at all for anything, I gained nothing, I did it as an experiment, I wanted to feel if I could enjoy sex and that connection I so desired in grade 9. There wasnt anything, she obviously liked it, but to me it was boring, I was thinking about homework the entire time and how I forgot to hand in that extra credit work.

The lies caused some doubt about me, so I had to shame Sam to cover my reputation, even though I did nothing wrong, it was still extremely bad to have that said about you, since it does happen to unfortunate people. I had to work so hard to cover myself, that I ended up taking it too far and bullying Sam without caring, I started enjoying it again, I felt angry that she would even dare think she could take everything I worked so hard to achieve and maintain. Her friend was also shamed as well by my group of friends, and the girls who liked me, everyone knew they lied. I always screenshot conversations so I have proof, I dont trust anyone so I thought that this could happen, low chance but never zero.

Sam wasnt a bad girl, she truly wasn't, even though she lied about that, she was hurt that I was sleeping with other girls and that she thought she meant nothing to me. She meant alot to me, I never loved her though, I felt nothing, but I still liked how she trusted me and would always entertain me. I thought of it as a pet, feed her a bone every once In awhile.... thinking back I was terrible, I'd guilt her and twist her words to make her doubt herself, break her confidence and made her rely on me. I knew if she ever became more open, she might leave me for someone better, and she wasnt ugly, so I was afraid, I was intensely angry, I was very possessive over people and things I spent time working towards. I could never EVER fathom another guy with her, even if I felt nothing I couldnt let a guy feel a connection with her. I didnt do anything psychotic like kidnap, I did ruin her highschool year and her friends while I enjoyed mine.

I ignored drugs and alcohol, I believed that they would make me slip up, or say something I didnt mean, or even lose my control over my anger. I couldnt do that, I would be offered quite a fair share of drugs are parties, and though I did want to experiment, I wasnt a slave to any addiction and I wasn't able to feel any happiness anyways so drugs shouldn't have had any worthwhile effects on me.

I didnt understand why I was like that, but then I honestly didnt care, my life was perfect, my thoughts were so precise, I always thought a few steps ahead, I had many friends and girls who would do anything for me. My family was doing great, I lived with my grandparents who were Christian, and they noticed I was very different compared to before, and I told them that I opened up, and it was thanks to them, but moreso towards god that me praying allowed him to help me help myself... I didnt mean any of that truthfully, I dont believe in any god except my self at that time, but I couldnt have my family worry over my and take up my time.

I had everything now, a life I thought two years ago I could never have, plenty of girls who weren't the BEST but were still good enough to have alot of guys admire. People who are hard to get were often good entertainment to play with, but at that point I was bored with life... I didnt feel anything, whenever I felt anger it would fade away sometime after... I would try to make myself sadistically before and laugh but I just couldnt do it.

I dated another girl and broke her heart to see if I'd feel anything and nothing happened, I blackmailed her to go back with me, and eventually gained her trust back by telling her I truly didnt do anything. I didnt feel like repeating what happened like last time, and I believe that she shouldnt have even cried over me, she was good looking, smart, popular why would she cry over me?
Nothing made sense to me, I was very good at studying other people, but I couldnt study myself, I wasnt like them, when they cried I couldnt understand why, or if they felt anger I was confused. I tried remembering back to my childhood with my dad, but I couldnt feel any anger or sadness, just acceptance that what happened happened, I forgot to mention but at this time my father relapsed and got into drug use again.

Skipping ahead, I didnt change much, I dropped a few people and gained a bit more girls to talk to. It was late at night, but we had quarentine so I had nothing to do, I had an xbox where I'd play games with friends to grow closer, but I didn't think it was fun, sitting and doing nothing on a virtual game, wasnt appealing to me. I was more into living the moment, doing things in real life and hanging out with actual people, I enjoyed hearing people talk about their life, things that happened. I especially enjoyed hearing people talk about how much rage they felt toward something they were hurt by when they were younger, I liked knowing they felt anger enough to feel the urges I felt.

They were so enjoyable, I became obsessed with helping them solve their problems, and grew more egotistical the more I helped, and the more I helped the more I learned about how people cope and handle themselves. I didnt help them because I wanted them to be good, It was a game to me and i wanted to see if I was good enough to help others fix their problems, but I couldnt fix mine. Ironic isnt it.

My father came home, he was high and was with a female friend whom I didnt like, I never liked druggies, I couldnt understand how they had to use drugs to feel happiness or enjoyed it. I told my dad that grandma was inside looking for him, so he fixed himself and went away so I was left with his friend Christina, she was definitely an addict, but she didnt appear like she was one for long. She looked like early 20,s and someone who started using drugs, I was disgusted by her but also fascinated, I wanted get closer to her and manipulate her to do whatever I wanted. But, I couldnt, my head flared up, it felt as if I was disgusted by her, she was revolting, but my sex drive amped up, something about someone who was disgusting and looked down upon by me turned me on. I ended up taking control of myself and told her to fuck off, and that if she ever showed her face around her she wouldn't be alive anymore, of course I didnt say those exact words, but I wanted her gone. I believed that guys wasted too much time on women, that they should just focus on something else, they weren't special and neither was sex. I gave her a 20 dollar bill and another 50 that I had gotten from a friend for doing a favor awhile back, I wanted her to feel like she was worth something.
She could use that money for drugs and forget a out my dad, and I knew the only reason she was with him was because he had dope, I was thoroughly disappointed in my father, he was a good looking and well mannered person to everyone, he may have been abusive to me, but I no longer cared, I didnt agree with his appearance. He couldnt be tied to me, so if anyone asked, I was never his child and if I was from him, I'd be better off dead, or so I thought.
I believe deep down, I appreciated how he came home, I may not agree with him, or like the things he does, but he's still my father he's my blood, so I cant abandon him  just as how he didnt kick me out. We talked a bit in my grandparents shed, and I asked what drugs felt like, and he pulled out a few large bags and asked if I wanted to find out myself.
I told him that I didnt care, but would prefer if he told me, since I was planning on visiting a girl tomorrow.
He told me how he had heroin, meth, a few bags of coke, 1 shroom for whatever reason, and 3 Molly's he was saving.

I told him that I didnt understand what he told me about the feelings and I asked him how to use it, so he showed me first hand. I didnt stop him, I didnt have the right to, he is his own person with his own ideals and consequences just as I do.

He started on the heroin and overtime slowly dosed off which I thought was annoying and disappointing, so I took it upon myself to try it.

I wasnt going to do the heroin since I didnt want to lose my alertness and become like that, so I decided I'd try meth, I remembered that coke was pretty expensive so I left that to him as a sign of pity or low respect.

I didnt feel anything taking a line, so I took another, and another, until the third kicked in, it was a strange feeling, I never felt that feeling before but it wasnt strong enough so I took another two. Then it hit me, a flash of euphoria something that surprised me, it wasn't overwhelming but it was still something, it made me laugh of excitement, my father may have been passed out in front of me but I felt it, I felt something that I never felt for so long. I took a few large Crystal's with me to try again, he didnt notice since the bags were quite large and I also took his bags of dope inside, he was very drowsy but I wasnt worried, he had overdosed 9 times in my life, so he was fine I believed and left him in the garage as I went inside.

I went inside and admired this feeling, it was short lasted but I grew tired of it, I wanted to feel something stronger, it wasnt strong enough for me to do it again so I took a bit more and decided I was done since I was going to a girls house. I couldn't fall asleep, I tried but I was awake, my heartrate was extremely fast, so I forced myself to drink water and to sit still and relax.

I put on some binaural beats and sat down and stared at my ceiling, I was disappointed, immensely it wasn't good enough.
Everyone always said it felt good to do it, and it was addicting that I'd be hooked but I didnt think so.

Fast forward, I couldn't sleep the entire night nor the next 6 days, I could feel my skin excrete a toxin that I had to continously wash off, I had no appetite but I forced myself to eat, and to drink 3 liters of water daily.
It wasnt too bad, nothing bothered me too much, the thing that made me somewhat annoyed was that my genital was very small and shrunken, I was expecting to do it with my friend today, but I had to give up and say I wasn't in the mood. I couldnt sleep at all, It would be a cool study drug if I had trouble with school, but I had everything perfect.

The withdrawl effects were something else, originally they shocked me, but overtime I realized that I enjoyed it, it was a sense of relief knowing it was my body harming itself and I didnt have any chance of dying from it. The one thing that I didnt particularly enjoy was the crank bugs, or meth mites that occasionally occured to me. It felt like fire ants crawling over my body and biting me, my body wanted to scratch and dig under my body, but I knew better not to, I laughed to combat it.

I used my thoughts as a way to make myself enjoy the feeling, I felt pure anger again, to combat it, I took a high dose so the feeling was strong, and it lasted pretty long as well.

I never got into any fights or gotten hurt before except from my father, but this was a weird feeling. I couldnt do anything about it, so I sat there and waited until it went away, then I showered.

I still seldomly feel the effects from withdrawl, but it isnt anything crazy that makes me feel threatened or worried. I had no desire to take more, the only thing I wanted was to feel normal, I felt as if I was forever going to be this way.

After taking Meth, I didnt respond to my friends or any girls for awhile, and when I did I didnt care enough to put any effort, I felt hopeless.
I could've tried another drug, but I took quite alot of meth thinking it would help me feel different but it didnt, before I finally quit it as I'm writing now, I took more of it and more..

Whenever I was angry, I would take it to see if I would feel continously angry, but again... I fucked up and it didnt work, but this time I could sleep and still operate, I had no appetite but it's not like I eat based on that.



If you read this far, I'm truly lost, I have no guidance, I feel nothing anymore. Drugs arent working for me, i researched meth and DESPERATELY obsessed with trying to get addicted, but I ran out of it and didnt feel like associating my name with the crackheads I knew,and my dad was off somewhere so I just chilled again.

I honestly am speechless, I'm tired as I'm writing this, and my fingers are worn as well. If anyone has any thoughts on what happened to me, and why I don't have any desire for sex, or love, even to my family. I have no fear or regrets nothing, I live life how it is now, I dont think of myself any different, nor does anyone know I did meth.

People say addiction isnt a choice, but I believe it is.. If it was then I would definitely make myself addicted, I want something to desire in life, even if it meant taking drugs with lowlifes, I would enjoy it more than I am now.

I dont have a job during this isolation, I complete my school work quickly, and then I'm lost again. I had experienced everything I wanted to, I tried everything I thought was cool as a child. I never was able to hurt or take my anger out on my father or anyone else for that matter, but today as of wednesday May 6th, I have no hate for anyone in this world at all.

Taking meth has made me realize that those who get addicted like my father, are weak willed. They cave for that feeling of synthetic happiness. I dont understand it, but I'll try more drugs, hopefully there is an addicting one, I'll do everything except needles. My body is mine, but I still need to appear healthy for friends, last thing I want is people thinking I'm depressed or an addict, If only they knew.



Anyways reddit, if you read through my sleep deprived post, please help me, anything. I need help desperately and I'll do anything. I cant live my days feeling like a rock, even faking my mask is getting hard for me to do.
It was my pride that I could do it, but if that's going away, and I'm left with nothing, I'll be worthless more so than I am. If I could suggest anything to people who haven't tried drugs, dont try it, you wonder what it's like, but the only thing you need to know, is that you WILL give in. You are weak, just like me, I cant survive without attention and control over others, and addicts get addicted, I'm addicted to lying and everything about me is fake. Though, my father is a person you dont want to be like, dont create another me, he was the reason I grew up the way I did. Stick to weed and I suppose LSD, if you want to know what it feels like firsthand go ahead, but just know that you're only seen as a source of income, I would wish if I was I dealer that you would start, I don't care about others, I could easily tempt as many people as I want into it, and make quite a sale. Though, that's easy, what's not easy is getting people to believe in themselves, so much doubt and depression in people, especially girls, beautiful smart talented individuals you'd never think would struggle, but they do and it's a damn shame I think, I used to obsess over these girls and wish I was as confident/happy as them, and the one thing that you are all at risk for, is doubt. Have pure confidence in everything you do, thoughts and opinions of others do not matter, you are the god of your story, whether you believe you're a worthless side character and treat yourself like that, is up to you. I am the god of mine, my effort and hardwork pays off, never give up and never hurt yourself, having to sit on facetime with a girl who has issues, to prevent herself from slicing her wrists and thighs is tiring, If you want to end it do it, dont best around the bush and drag others down, keep everything to yourself and fight your own demons as I did, only then will you realize that the true demons, are in fact, ourselves.





People with depression who do drugs to cope, why? Your family is hurting so much over it, my father was a great guy before he did that, and then he took everything out on me. Yet I still loved him, because that's family, you all hurt everyone close to you, push everyone away and believe you're alone.
I used to want to kill and erase all drug users, I was obsessive over that, like I said it was the only thing I could think of, and I enjoyed it alot.
Logically thinking, I would probably still think that if I could, now that I know my father could've fought against that drug with willpower if he cared, if he ever considered his love for his parents or me more, he would've.

He was weak, just like all addicts are, I will never sympathize with you, and you will never sympathize with me, we are different. You were the reason I suffered growing up, that I was hurt all those years ago. My pain, was the cause of ignorant people such as yourselves, to think I tried the same drugs as crackheads and to say I tried it, is downright disgusting. We are not the same, everything I do is calculated, even on drugs, you all have no excuse but lack of willpower, self respect, and love. I will try every drug that is addicting so that I can fully understand, and confirm my opinion and beliefs that addiction is a choice, and those who fall prey to addiction are terribly weak souls who are meant to be used by others. In this case, addicts run the underground world, they are the buyers and in result, cause so much drug trade wealth.

I have to pretend to like you, despite how much all of you disgust me, and loathe, my father is an addict and some friends are addicted, they still have family and friend who care about them, but to me you are worthless, those who steal and hurt their family dont deserve the right to life.
Those who deal drugs shouldnt be to blame either, they supply the drug and tempt others, those who give in to their selfish desires deserve it. If I could, I would take it upon myself to remove you, be grateful that I'm too disinterested and smart to waste my life and talents on scum like you. You'll all die in the next 10-30 years, and if not, you'll probably have kids and those kids will repeat what you did, seen it firsthand. The only sympathy I have for anything in this world, is children.
They are innocent, you can mold them however you like, they are defenseless, some abuse them and some raise them to be good people. Whatever you decide, always remember that they are just like you, but they're sensitive, they may always love you, but hate you, I never let go despite my conflicting ideals and what I say. I'm truly confused that I confuse my thoughts and I no longer have clear thoughts on anything anymore, I know I hate my father but yet... another feeling is, that I love him and forgive him, even though I dont.
Mental health is important, never neglect children, those who feel nothing are risky, they may do things that are risky in order to feel the rush, or they may have delusions on the lives of others, I know I have a unhealthy delusion that addicts should be all shot, but I know that it's my upbringing that creates hate.
The cycle will never stop, and I don't think I'll ever change, I learned how to handle the pain I went through, and now I deal with the consequence of feeling nothing, at the expense of being protected from every feeling, even the warm embrace of love.

I do feel some slivers of guilt, so I know my humanity is still there, I'm not erased just yet, my grandmother is one of the most important people to me, without her, I have no idea what I would have done, same with my grandfather and sister. Though my grandfather was also abusive towards me, he was strict, I deserved everything that was given to me because he truly wanted my to learn and be better. It's no ones fault, children are abused and neglected, sexual assault is rampant, I feel sad for those who dont adapt, who are forever broken and scarred. If only you had the strength to fight back, but you were powerless just as I was. I wish someone would save me, my sister was lucky, she was able to get out and move in 2 years before I did with our grandma. I'm glad, I was the one that it happened to, my sister may not respect me for my choices of like me, but I care for her in my way, she will turn into a great doctor, she studied for a nurse and finished that and wanted more, so shes going to med school, would've been had this quarentine never happened.

My life wasnt a mistake, what happened in my childhood was unfortunate yes, did it break me, yeah it did, it destroyed my early years and left unfixable damage in my head, but, it made me stronger. I dont have desires, but I know... I know I will find something, there will be something and I believe in myself that as long as I dont give in, that I continue living this life even if I despise it, that even if I dont like this life. That there are still people who rely on me, who need me, who want me alive to help them, to be there, people trust and admire me, they love my confidence that I put on, the mask helps others to believe in themselves. They will never know that I dont care at all, that they're just entertainment for my cruel life, they weren't there for me in grade 9 when I was alone, yet now they are?
It's fun to think about that there are people just like me out there in the world, that I'm not alone yet I am.

I know good and bad, I don't care at all, I have no filter, if it benefits me I'll do it, anything in order to get my goals just like my sister does, humans have no excuse for being poor or welfare. Determination, and WILLPOWER, feel pain and adapt, subject yourself to psychological torture, take a drug just for withdrawl effects and get used to it, suffer and enjoy it, you'll accept the pain and become a better person, fighting it is useless you only tire yourself out and you give in.

Mental torture is a fascination I've discovered, I've never studied psychology or anything, I'm still in highschool grade 11, surprisingly I know quite alot of maggots who are in their 30s, to think that if I had this drugs, they'd do anything for a quick fix. Amusing to think truly how pathetic they are, they've never suffered growing up so they never learned how to deal with pain, looking at how kids deal with it now, they slice themselves up, indulge in alcohol distraction themselves from reality, and they like it... they like living in delusions and a fake world being happy, while I learned to accept and realize that I'm the product of my father. And I hope my children turn out just as I did, I'd have to emotionally break them and destroy everything, then make them trust me and then do it again, you see. Children and even grown people, when they truly love someone, they'll accept whatever happens to them no matter if they're abused by the one they love, they remember better times and hope they change.
Those who are teenagers or even adults who are victim to that cannot change, they may be able to adapt but they'll never truly be immune to it, I remember overhearing a classmate explain how childhood trauma affects people, and most often serial killers are abused and they grow up with thoughts just like I had. I'm not sure how I didnt murder anyone, maybe because it's no more fun when they die, everyone gets scared and you need to act the part, no more parties. Though as long as they leave the people who constantly show me entertainment and the girls I prefer are safe, it doesnt care to me what happens to less fortunate people, I would always protect everyone who admires and looks up to me, because without them I'm nothing.

I wanted to end this message earlier, and yet here I am, distracted. I cannot talk to anyone my age in a serious manner, each and everyone of them are childish, they see things through a single lens.

""Everyone who does drugs are addicted"" ""If you steal you'll do anything"" ""I'm leaving if my boyfriend ever does drugs""
These sentences are blatantly wrong.
Everyone who does drugs are not addicted, not everyone in this world is born with a weak will. Some are very strong, they don't cave to small cravings, they continue doing their beliefs and they hold true to their word.

If you steal, you arent a bad person, everyone has something they desire so bad that they steal for, I know I wanted a girl so bad I made her cheat on her boyfriend, and I was there to see her lie to him on text ""oh I'm just heading to bed, I'll talk to you later in the morning love you"" see, I didnt do anything bad. She chose to sleep with me, and I accepted, in a sense I stole that poor guys girlfriend, and he didnt even know, he still doesnt because we agreed to not tell him, we also agreed that whenever we felt like it, we could do it again. Think of yourself first, than others. If you always think of yourself then you'll always be in pain, protect your right.

I'm done, I have to sleep. Help me please, and I'll pay you back by doing whatever you want.",06May2020,1
62,"I do things solely because I see other people doing them. I follow rules and belief systems (outwardly) because that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm taught to do. There is no other reason for me to do it than obviously being ostracized by my peers, and alienated for being different. Which by the way, I believe that is the most ridiculous thing ever. I‚Äôve only recently realized this and have begun to self reflect on it out of curiosity. Before I learned this, I would just do things impulsively or say things that made people uncomfortable. I still do at times since my beliefs are seemingly outlandish to others but to me, they make perfect sense so I end up unintentionally making others uncomfortable. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a sociopath by any means, even though that term is so dramatized and socially constructed that it diagnostically means absolutely nothing at this point. I know I have antisocial traits, but I also heavily deal with social anxiety/being around people in general which led to me being diagnosed with an anxiety disorder in my early teen years. I don‚Äôt feel bad about anything that I do because I feel that everyone is instinctually self-interested, but too unaware of themselves to admit it. I‚Äôm even having a hard time finding the motivation to pretend to be like everyone else, as there is literally no point to anything really other than temporary fulfillment. It gets redundant after awhile. Is this normal? To an extent at least? I promise this isn‚Äôt me just trying to be edgy. I just would like to know if this thought process is abnormal or not. I used to cry fairly often over things that triggered a nerve from my childhood (trauma related) like to the point where I was having panic attacks and could hardly breathe, but now I‚Äôm just glazed over and even smirk at things that once would have deeply upset me. Hyper fixating on violence is also something that I‚Äôve begun to do within the past year or so. It‚Äôs oddly cathartic. Could this be some kind of internalized coping mechanism caused by trauma?",06May2020,1

Maybe it‚Äôs because so much is happening at once but still Jesus why do I get panic attacks so much. it‚Äôs all about my own physical health too. Dumbest shit ever, I hate it so much. I‚Äôm so angry because of this shit it‚Äôs been going on for a year or two and I‚Äôve been shoving it to the side trying to work it out myself but I‚Äôm so broken now it‚Äôs so hard it breaks my heart.",06May2020,1
64,"It might not seem super mental health related but all these things are not only milestones in my life but also my mental health. You need to recover enough to believe in your self to some degree when escaping homelessness. It can be a vicious cycle I was lucky that I was only in that place a few months.

Then there's moving to the city, I needed to control my panic attacks and be able to get on a bus without valium. In December 2017 I took my maximum medication dose and still couldn't get on a train. Now I take trains everywhere, I love taking the train. So many things I thought I hated or couldn't do because of my anxiety. I now love these activities because I don't hate myself anymore. Do I love myself? I'm working on it but I don't hate myself, I don't try to hurt myself and I make mistakes without beating myself up.

65,"Do you ever want to go back to being depressed. (Hereditary Depression + OCD)

a few weeks ago or whenever it was I went through a  mental breakdown, can i even say that?  I was ready, crying my eyes out repeating the words I want to die. Feeling like I was drowning in pain, my emotional pain turned into a physical one where i got a migraine. I keep having these explosive moments too often, it builds up and then i breakdown and tell myself i can't do it anymore. well this past week or so, I didn't feel actively suicidal in fact i didn't have any urges to kill myself. I woke up fine, I wasn't happy or motivated but i was just fine. I went about a week like that i'm still currently in that state, I don't know if it had anything to do with the crazy amount of ginger tea and water i've been drinking or spending time at the trail soaking up the sun for a few hours. to be honest i didn't like it, the state of being fine. Am I crazy? Just about 2 weeks ago i was in so much emotional pain contemplating suicide for no reason, and now that i'm out of that state, why do i miss being depressed? 

&amp;#x200B;

I realized that being in a depressed state was weirdly my comfort zone. When i was ""fine"" I Felt out of place like what am i supposed to do now that i'm not suicidal. So many things are contingent on me being suicidal. For example how am I suppose to finish school, make plans to travel, or other big plans when I don't even know if I'm going to be alive next year, or in a few months, weeks ect???.  Now that I am more aware of my hereditary mental illness I know that without medical intervention I will never be able to complete a goal. So guess what until I can get that help I don't attempt to enroll myself into classes or make big plans with people bc at some point i will hit a wall where I am a hair strand away from killing myself. So when I feel ""FINE"" what does that mean for me, it changes everything I start to feel all these things that I want to start doing now! but I remember i can't cause i'll have an episode and end up dropping out or canceling ect. Also being alone with my negative thoughts and emotions feels like this dark toxic blanket where I can close my eyes and forget about all my worries and dream of a place where I will soon feel nothing.",06May2020,1

69,"Hey guys, I'm new here but thought maybe I could find some solid advice. Basically I've got a history of depression and anxiety, I'd say its milder than others and it comes and goes. 
After a heavy psychedelic experience 3 years ago I've had quite bad existential anxiety from time to time. (I still question whether what I experienced was real or not).
It's made me realise that I must look after my body and mind better. 

These days I'm much more aware of what I'm putting in my body and so I drink much less than I used to, I try to not take drugs and slowly trying to reduce to no drink or drugs eventually but find it difficult. 

I have a girlfriend and live in The Netherlands, from London originally. I try to exercise a lot; running 5km to 10km almost everyday or every other day. I started a meditation practise around 2 years ago and try to meditate most days for 10 minutes or more. I try to engage mostly in healthy behaviours such as being creative (I make music), not watching too much tv, but don't always have tons of energy.

I feel as though I'm doing so much but it never gets too much better. I still have a low opinion of myself and have anxiety which takes various different forms such as; worrying about the size of the universe (which is a weird one haha), wondering what reality is, feeling like I don't have a ton of friends, feeling as though I've achieved nothing and wishing I could go back to school and change my trajectory.

I constantly read about self improvement and do try, I've read various books and what not. Any advice on how others deal with their difficulties would be nice. Or if anyone can relate. 

Have a nice day and thankyou in advance.",06May2020,1
70,"I'm exhausted, mind my poor grammar and general lack of direction. I no longer feel the same, and I need someone's help. I feel no hate, no pain, no love or happiness.
I used to struggle with psychotic thoughts, however that desire has faded.
And before you ask, no I never did drugs, until the end.

Lately, I'm felt as if I have two different thoughts and opinions on things.
I may be scared of something, but another part of me isnt and actively enjoys whatever it is..

I hate my father who abused me, but I also love him so much, I wish he would disappear but I wish he would also stay by my side... even with people who I dont like at all, everything I feel fades away.

Someone could make fun of me and humiliate me, and I may feel at first indescribable hate, with intent to hurt them... but then it fades and I feel nothing, I don't feel like retaliation is something that would solve my issues.

When I was younger, I used to bully my classmates and enjoyed hurting others for fun, seeing them hurt was enjoyable knowing that they were weaker, I felt superior knowing they were beneath me...

I switched schools multiple times because of my father's work, and I developed a shy personality, everything I felt before was gone... I used to like talking and causing trouble and problems, or hurting people... but then after moving so much, I felt so detached that all I did was read and be by myself for grade 8..

I would always hear ""why are you so quiet"" ""he's so weird he never talks to anyone"" and though, I did talk to peolple, but I never was outgoing, I played with 2-3 kids but I always felt as if it wasn't worth it... it didn't feel entertaining to do so, and I just wanted to pass the time and finish recess/lunch and continue on doing work...


During grade 9, it got worse, my opinion on myself shifted and I began to loath who I was, I hated my father for the choices he made and what he did to me growing up, but I also hated everyone else for having a life I could never have, I was jealous they grew up in a loving environment.

I started reading and studying alot more, my grades began raising very high and though I should have felt proud of myself, I only ever thought about revenge against my father and other people, I never talked to anyone because I was different than them.. small talk to me was useless, tell me what you want straight. I didn't like hanging around with people, because I felt as if I could see straight through them and it made me feel gross..

It changed during grade 10 when I met a few kids who practically forced me to hangout and be friends with them, they weren't the popular kids, but they knew everyone of them and they knew him as well. I felt so alone and weird, everyone else could talk so well and I didnt know what to say or talk about, you can pretty much tell I never had a girlfriend  because of this, and I REALLY wanted someone then...

Overtime, I felt more and more open and started talking, I smiled more and became friends with mutual friends, of course I was still weird, just not as bad as before. I still felt the hate towards my dad, every single minute even if I was laughing with friends it was always there..

Sometime during the end of semester 2, some personal family issues happened, which led me to cut everyone off, I was left alone by choice, I turned off my phone and enjoyed my summer break by myself... I sat in my dark room with only my thoughts and regrets of what I did, I made myself believe I was worthless and that(we will call him jim) Jim wasnt my friend, that he felt pity towards me, maybe he did at that time, but he could have hung out with ANYONE yet he chose me time and time again.. I would cancel or just not show up, and he'd get mad at me, but then I'd apologize after sometime and we'd chill again, he was popular knew everyone, had alot of girls that liked him yet he didnt care at all..

He confused me so much but I was glad he was my friend, I had other friends but he stuck by me, no matter what, I was bullied by this one kid, but theh both knew eachother and Jim would always step in and ignore him whenever he was with me, and force the other guy to leave since there wasn't much of a conversation.. I appreciated that so much, I wasnt much for confrontations to be fair, I was afraid of having someone angry at me, but I didnt like someone insulting me either..

During the end of the summer, I snapped... my mental health dropped, I felt psycho, I wanted to actively hurt people, my head was filled with murder and wanting to inflict pain, I enjoyed sadistic thoughts that whenever they came up I'd laugh from joy and ecstasy...
Overtime, from crying so much, I started laughing whenever I felt pain, I laughed and overtime it went away, but instead of feeling pain I felt pure anger. I wanted to hurt people who were innocent, who did absolutely nothing to me, just because I was hurt myself I wanted to ruin other people and my father as well...

I became obsessed with myself, my confidence rose to the top, I changed my style haircut, personality I wore a mask at all times. I felt as if this was the only way I could do it, the sensitive version of myself only got hurt and used, I never felt good, so I pretended.. 
And it worked.... I made people who didnt even know me laugh, and I laughed with them whenever.. I didn't truly laugh, we both had different humor, I laughed to fit in, I would always pay extra attention to what people liked doing, hobbies, things they talk about..

I acted different towards different people to get close, I felt like I needed to do that to earn their trust and protection.. I surrounded myself with people who laughed at me in grade 9, and at that time I felt very egotistical and felt happy, knowing that no one else knew I was faking all of it..

I felt nothing then, before I was hurt so much, I blamed my issues on past problems, cried felt so much anger and blame on my father...yet now, I felt as if nothing bothered me, insults that rarely happened didnt affect me, I wasnt shy, I said what I wanted whenever, I wasn't afraid of my dad and in fact, I wanted to see me how I was, just to see his reaction....

But he wasn't the same either.. he was an addict, but he was trying to better himself now, he apologized to me for everything that happened in the last, and he knows that he screwed up but he wants me to know that he will ALWAYS ""love"" me no matter what I do or where I go. I wasnt expecting that, I wanted him to leave for days on end, or to verbally tear me apart or backhand me, I wanted it... but it didn't happen, I felt angry, so fucking much, I thought to myself that why did it happen now, now that I didnt care about anyone but myself, that he decides to change himself.. why didnt he do it when I was younger, when I NEEDED someone to show me the proper way, to tell me I was needed, to say I was loved and didnt have to act out for attention.

Of course I forgave him, he would often give me money, and in order to get more, I would need to be friends/good terms with him, so I smiled and cried and admitted that I was so proud of him and hugged him, we sat there for about a minute thinking back now.
After we laughed and joked about being overly sensitive, he said he had to go to meet his girlfriend, but that he'd be home for dinner, and I said sure.. I went to my room and laughed to myself, kept laughing, I didnt know if I was hurt or if I thought I was so cunning and smart, I really didnt know what I felt and it scared me for the first time.

I read about psychology a bit, and sociopaths and psychopaths, I didnt think I was one, and I didnt want to be one to be honest. I still felt emotions, but I could numb them and use them whenever I needed to. Tears and sadness are good if you hurt someone and you need an excuse to say it hurt you too, so I would cry and act weak whenever something I didnt want happened...

I started hanging out daily with new people and even girls started messaging me, and I'd be able to talk to whoever I wanted to now, I'd face time girls all the time at night and grow closer to them. They loved having my attention, and I loved having their trust. My sex drive was gone though, I had a high one in grade 9 and 10, but now I didnt care at all.. I could still maintain an erection and commit to it, but I didnt have any lust towards them, I felt nothing, but I knew they could be used sometime in the future for a favour so I kept talking to them.

I lost my virginity to a girl that was innocent and sweet, she was everything I was, and someone I wanted to be when I was a kid. I didnt exactly feel bad about lying to her constantly, but I didn't feel good either. I didnt know whether or not good or bad even existed, to me those terms were just made up to justify actions other people made.

I would end up dating that girl and cheating on her skth several other girls, at the start I believed I didnt care for attention but.. I needed it so much to survive, if I didnt have it my head would fill with psychotic thoughts and anger, so I had to dull that out with girls who spoke to me, distracted me from everything, I couldn't be angry and maintain a front at the same time so I knew that was my only choice. I couldnt used a doctor because I knew he may prescribe serious meds, and put a warning on me as a potential danger to myself and others so I didnt tell anyone. I trusted no one, not even my good friend Jim who stuck by me since day 1, I couldnt ever fathom trusting an unknown person.

(Its 6 am as I'm writing this, so sorry for bits preceding pieces being apart and poor grammar, it's hard remembering how I was)

I always had drama stuck to my name from something I did, but it never mattered because I had so many friends that would back me up, they trusted me, and those girls did too.
The first girl I dated (we'll call her sam) found out I cheated on her, and told her friend that I did, and she put out some rumours that I forced myself on her, and I took advantage of her sweet personality for my own gain. And while I didn't really care much for her, I didnt care at all for anything, I gained nothing, I did it as an experiment, I wanted to feel if I could enjoy sex and that connection I so desired in grade 9. There wasnt anything, she obviously liked it, but to me it was boring, I was thinking about homework the entire time and how I forgot to hand in that extra credit work.

The lies caused some doubt about me, so I had to shame Sam to cover my reputation, even though I did nothing wrong, it was still extremely bad to have that said about you, since it does happen to unfortunate people. I had to work so hard to cover myself, that I ended up taking it too far and bullying Sam without caring, I started enjoying it again, I felt angry that she would even dare think she could take everything I worked so hard to achieve and maintain. Her friend was also shamed as well by my group of friends, and the girls who liked me, everyone knew they lied. I always screenshot conversations so I have proof, I dont trust anyone so I thought that this could happen, low chance but never zero.

Sam wasnt a bad girl, she truly wasn't, even though she lied about that, she was hurt that I was sleeping with other girls and that she thought she meant nothing to me. She meant alot to me, I never loved her though, I felt nothing, but I still liked how she trusted me and would always entertain me. I thought of it as a pet, feed her a bone every once In awhile.... thinking back I was terrible, I'd guilt her and twist her words to make her doubt herself, break her confidence and made her rely on me. I knew if she ever became more open, she might leave me for someone better, and she wasnt ugly, so I was afraid, I was intensely angry, I was very possessive over people and things I spent time working towards. I could never EVER fathom another guy with her, even if I felt nothing I couldnt let a guy feel a connection with her. I didnt do anything psychotic like kidnap, I did ruin her highschool year and her friends while I enjoyed mine.

I ignored drugs and alcohol, I believed that they would make me slip up, or say something I didnt mean, or even lose my control over my anger. I couldnt do that, I would be offered quite a fair share of drugs are parties, and though I did want to experiment, I wasnt a slave to any addiction and I wasn't able to feel any happiness anyways so drugs shouldn't have had any worthwhile effects on me.

I didnt understand why I was like that, but then I honestly didnt care, my life was perfect, my thoughts were so precise, I always thought a few steps ahead, I had many friends and girls who would do anything for me. My family was doing great, I lived with my grandparents who were Christian, and they noticed I was very different compared to before, and I told them that I opened up, and it was thanks to them, but moreso towards god that me praying allowed him to help me help myself... I didnt mean any of that truthfully, I dont believe in any god except my self at that time, but I couldnt have my family worry over my and take up my time.

I had everything now, a life I thought two years ago I could never have, plenty of girls who weren't the BEST but were still good enough to have alot of guys admire. People who are hard to get were often good entertainment to play with, but at that point I was bored with life... I didnt feel anything, whenever I felt anger it would fade away sometime after... I would try to make myself sadistically before and laugh but I just couldnt do it.

I dated another girl and broke her heart to see if I'd feel anything and nothing happened, I blackmailed her to go back with me, and eventually gained her trust back by telling her I truly didnt do anything. I didnt feel like repeating what happened like last time, and I believe that she shouldnt have even cried over me, she was good looking, smart, popular why would she cry over me?
Nothing made sense to me, I was very good at studying other people, but I couldnt study myself, I wasnt like them, when they cried I couldnt understand why, or if they felt anger I was confused. I tried remembering back to my childhood with my dad, but I couldnt feel any anger or sadness, just acceptance that what happened happened, I forgot to mention but at this time my father relapsed and got into drug use again.

Skipping ahead, I didnt change much, I dropped a few people and gained a bit more girls to talk to. It was late at night, but we had quarentine so I had nothing to do, I had an xbox where I'd play games with friends to grow closer, but I didn't think it was fun, sitting and doing nothing on a virtual game, wasnt appealing to me. I was more into living the moment, doing things in real life and hanging out with actual people, I enjoyed hearing people talk about their life, things that happened. I especially enjoyed hearing people talk about how much rage they felt toward something they were hurt by when they were younger, I liked knowing they felt anger enough to feel the urges I felt.

They were so enjoyable, I became obsessed with helping them solve their problems, and grew more egotistical the more I helped, and the more I helped the more I learned about how people cope and handle themselves. I didnt help them because I wanted them to be good, It was a game to me and i wanted to see if I was good enough to help others fix their problems, but I couldnt fix mine. Ironic isnt it.

My father came home, he was high and was with a female friend whom I didnt like, I never liked druggies, I couldnt understand how they had to use drugs to feel happiness or enjoyed it. I told my dad that grandma was inside looking for him, so he fixed himself and went away so I was left with his friend Christina, she was definitely an addict, but she didnt appear like she was one for long. She looked like early 20,s and someone who started using drugs, I was disgusted by her but also fascinated, I wanted get closer to her and manipulate her to do whatever I wanted. But, I couldnt, my head flared up, it felt as if I was disgusted by her, she was revolting, but my sex drive amped up, something about someone who was disgusting and looked down upon by me turned me on. I ended up taking control of myself and told her to fuck off, and that if she ever showed her face around her she wouldn't be alive anymore, of course I didnt say those exact words, but I wanted her gone. I believed that guys wasted too much time on women, that they should just focus on something else, they weren't special and neither was sex. I gave her a 20 dollar bill and another 50 that I had gotten from a friend for doing a favor awhile back, I wanted her to feel like she was worth something.
She could use that money for drugs and forget a out my dad, and I knew the only reason she was with him was because he had dope, I was thoroughly disappointed in my father, he was a good looking and well mannered person to everyone, he may have been abusive to me, but I no longer cared, I didnt agree with his appearance. He couldnt be tied to me, so if anyone asked, I was never his child and if I was from him, I'd be better off dead, or so I thought.
I believe deep down, I appreciated how he came home, I may not agree with him, or like the things he does, but he's still my father he's my blood, so I cant abandon him  just as how he didnt kick me out. We talked a bit in my grandparents shed, and I asked what drugs felt like, and he pulled out a few large bags and asked if I wanted to find out myself.
I told him that I didnt care, but would prefer if he told me, since I was planning on visiting a girl tomorrow.
He told me how he had heroin, meth, a few bags of coke, 1 shroom for whatever reason, and 3 Molly's he was saving.

I told him that I didnt understand what he told me about the feelings and I asked him how to use it, so he showed me first hand. I didnt stop him, I didnt have the right to, he is his own person with his own ideals and consequences just as I do.

He started on the heroin and overtime slowly dosed off which I thought was annoying and disappointing, so I took it upon myself to try it.

I wasnt going to do the heroin since I didnt want to lose my alertness and become like that, so I decided I'd try meth, I remembered that coke was pretty expensive so I left that to him as a sign of pity or low respect.

I didnt feel anything taking a line, so I took another, and another, until the third kicked in, it was a strange feeling, I never felt that feeling before but it wasnt strong enough so I took another two. Then it hit me, a flash of euphoria something that surprised me, it wasn't overwhelming but it was still something, it made me laugh of excitement, my father may have been passed out in front of me but I felt it, I felt something that I never felt for so long. I took a few large Crystal's with me to try again, he didnt notice since the bags were quite large and I also took his bags of dope inside, he was very drowsy but I wasnt worried, he had overdosed 9 times in my life, so he was fine I believed and left him in the garage as I went inside.

I went inside and admired this feeling, it was short lasted but I grew tired of it, I wanted to feel something stronger, it wasnt strong enough for me to do it again so I took a bit more and decided I was done since I was going to a girls house. I couldn't fall asleep, I tried but I was awake, my heartrate was extremely fast, so I forced myself to drink water and to sit still and relax.

I put on some binaural beats and sat down and stared at my ceiling, I was disappointed, immensely it wasn't good enough.
Everyone always said it felt good to do it, and it was addicting that I'd be hooked but I didnt think so.

Fast forward, I couldn't sleep the entire night nor the next 6 days, I could feel my skin excrete a toxin that I had to continously wash off, I had no appetite but I forced myself to eat, and to drink 3 liters of water daily.
It wasnt too bad, nothing bothered me too much, the thing that made me somewhat annoyed was that my genital was very small and shrunken, I was expecting to do it with my friend today, but I had to give up and say I wasn't in the mood. I couldnt sleep at all, It would be a cool study drug if I had trouble with school, but I had everything perfect.

The withdrawl effects were something else, originally they shocked me, but overtime I realized that I enjoyed it, it was a sense of relief knowing it was my body harming itself and I didnt have any chance of dying from it. The one thing that I didnt particularly enjoy was the crank bugs, or meth mites that occasionally occured to me. It felt like fire ants crawling over my body and biting me, my body wanted to scratch and dig under my body, but I knew better not to, I laughed to combat it.

I used my thoughts as a way to make myself enjoy the feeling, I felt pure anger again, to combat it, I took a high dose so the feeling was strong, and it lasted pretty long as well.

I never got into any fights or gotten hurt before except from my father, but this was a weird feeling. I couldnt do anything about it, so I sat there and waited until it went away, then I showered.

I still seldomly feel the effects from withdrawl, but it isnt anything crazy that makes me feel threatened or worried. I had no desire to take more, the only thing I wanted was to feel normal, I felt as if I was forever going to be this way.

After taking Meth, I didnt respond to my friends or any girls for awhile, and when I did I didnt care enough to put any effort, I felt hopeless.
I could've tried another drug, but I took quite alot of meth thinking it would help me feel different but it didnt, before I finally quit it as I'm writing now, I took more of it and more..

Whenever I was angry, I would take it to see if I would feel continously angry, but again... I fucked up and it didnt work, but this time I could sleep and still operate, I had no appetite but it's not like I eat based on that.



If you read this far, I'm truly lost, I have no guidance, I feel nothing anymore. Drugs arent working for me, i researched meth and DESPERATELY obsessed with trying to get addicted, but I ran out of it and didnt feel like associating my name with the crackheads I knew,and my dad was off somewhere so I just chilled again.

I honestly am speechless, I'm tired as I'm writing this, and my fingers are worn as well. If anyone has any thoughts on what happened to me, and why I don't have any desire for sex, or love, even to my family. I have no fear or regrets nothing, I live life how it is now, I dont think of myself any different, nor does anyone know I did meth.

People say addiction isnt a choice, but I believe it is.. If it was then I would definitely make myself addicted, I want something to desire in life, even if it meant taking drugs with lowlifes, I would enjoy it more than I am now.

I dont have a job during this isolation, I complete my school work quickly, and then I'm lost again. I had experienced everything I wanted to, I tried everything I thought was cool as a child. I never was able to hurt or take my anger out on my father or anyone else for that matter, but today as of wednesday May 6th, I have no hate for anyone in this world at all.

Taking meth has made me realize that those who get addicted like my father, are weak willed. They cave for that feeling of synthetic happiness. I dont understand it, but I'll try more drugs, hopefully there is an addicting one, I'll do everything except needles. My body is mine, but I still need to appear healthy for friends, last thing I want is people thinking I'm depressed or an addict, If only they knew.



Anyways reddit, if you read through my sleep deprived post, please help me, anything. I need help desperately and I'll do anything. I cant live my days feeling like a rock, even faking my mask is getting hard for me to do.
It was my pride that I could do it, but if that's going away, and I'm left with nothing, I'll be worthless more so than I am. If I could suggest anything to people who haven't tried drugs, dont try it, you wonder what it's like, but the only thing you need to know, is that you WILL give in. You are weak, just like me, I cant survive without attention and control over others, and addicts get addicted, I'm addicted to lying and everything about me is fake. Though, my father is a person you dont want to be like, dont create another me, he was the reason I grew up the way I did. Stick to weed and I suppose LSD, if you want to know what it feels like firsthand go ahead, but just know that you're only seen as a source of income, I would wish if I was I dealer that you would start, I don't care about others, I could easily tempt as many people as I want into it, and make quite a sale. Though, that's easy, what's not easy is getting people to believe in themselves, so much doubt and depression in people, especially girls, beautiful smart talented individuals you'd never think would struggle, but they do and it's a damn shame I think, I used to obsess over these girls and wish I was as confident/happy as them, and the one thing that you are all at risk for, is doubt. Have pure confidence in everything you do, thoughts and opinions of others do not matter, you are the god of your story, whether you believe you're a worthless side character and treat yourself like that, is up to you. I am the god of mine, my effort and hardwork pays off, never give up and never hurt yourself, having to sit on facetime with a girl who has issues, to prevent herself from slicing her wrists and thighs is tiring, If you want to end it do it, dont best around the bush and drag others down, keep everything to yourself and fight your own demons as I did, only then will you realize that the true demons, are in fact, ourselves.





People with depression who do drugs to cope, why? Your family is hurting so much over it, my father was a great guy before he did that, and then he took everything out on me. Yet I still loved him, because that's family, you all hurt everyone close to you, push everyone away and believe you're alone.
I used to want to kill and erase all drug users, I was obsessive over that, like I said it was the only thing I could think of, and I enjoyed it alot.
Logically thinking, I would probably still think that if I could, now that I know my father could've fought against that drug with willpower if he cared, if he ever considered his love for his parents or me more, he would've.

He was weak, just like all addicts are, I will never sympathize with you, and you will never sympathize with me, we are different. You were the reason I suffered growing up, that I was hurt all those years ago. My pain, was the cause of ignorant people such as yourselves, to think I tried the same drugs as crackheads and to say I tried it, is downright disgusting. We are not the same, everything I do is calculated, even on drugs, you all have no excuse but lack of willpower, self respect, and love. I will try every drug that is addicting so that I can fully understand, and confirm my opinion and beliefs that addiction is a choice, and those who fall prey to addiction are terribly weak souls who are meant to be used by others. In this case, addicts run the underground world, they are the buyers and in result, cause so much drug trade wealth.

I have to pretend to like you, despite how much all of you disgust me, and loathe, my father is an addict and some friends are addicted, they still have family and friend who care about them, but to me you are worthless, those who steal and hurt their family dont deserve the right to life.
Those who deal drugs shouldnt be to blame either, they supply the drug and tempt others, those who give in to their selfish desires deserve it. If I could, I would take it upon myself to remove you, be grateful that I'm too disinterested and smart to waste my life and talents on scum like you. You'll all die in the next 10-30 years, and if not, you'll probably have kids and those kids will repeat what you did, seen it firsthand. The only sympathy I have for anything in this world, is children.
They are innocent, you can mold them however you like, they are defenseless, some abuse them and some raise them to be good people. Whatever you decide, always remember that they are just like you, but they're sensitive, they may always love you, but hate you, I never let go despite my conflicting ideals and what I say. I'm truly confused that I confuse my thoughts and I no longer have clear thoughts on anything anymore, I know I hate my father but yet... another feeling is, that I love him and forgive him, even though I dont.
Mental health is important, never neglect children, those who feel nothing are risky, they may do things that are risky in order to feel the rush, or they may have delusions on the lives of others, I know I have a unhealthy delusion that addicts should be all shot, but I know that it's my upbringing that creates hate.
The cycle will never stop, and I don't think I'll ever change, I learned how to handle the pain I went through, and now I deal with the consequence of feeling nothing, at the expense of being protected from every feeling, even the warm embrace of love.

I do feel some slivers of guilt, so I know my humanity is still there, I'm not erased just yet, my grandmother is one of the most important people to me, without her, I have no idea what I would have done, same with my grandfather and sister. Though my grandfather was also abusive towards me, he was strict, I deserved everything that was given to me because he truly wanted my to learn and be better. It's no ones fault, children are abused and neglected, sexual assault is rampant, I feel sad for those who dont adapt, who are forever broken and scarred. If only you had the strength to fight back, but you were powerless just as I was. I wish someone would save me, my sister was lucky, she was able to get out and move in 2 years before I did with our grandma. I'm glad, I was the one that it happened to, my sister may not respect me for my choices of like me, but I care for her in my way, she will turn into a great doctor, she studied for a nurse and finished that and wanted more, so shes going to med school, would've been had this quarentine never happened.

My life wasnt a mistake, what happened in my childhood was unfortunate yes, did it break me, yeah it did, it destroyed my early years and left unfixable damage in my head, but, it made me stronger. I dont have desires, but I know... I know I will find something, there will be something and I believe in myself that as long as I dont give in, that I continue living this life even if I despise it, that even if I dont like this life. That there are still people who rely on me, who need me, who want me alive to help them, to be there, people trust and admire me, they love my confidence that I put on, the mask helps others to believe in themselves. They will never know that I dont care at all, that they're just entertainment for my cruel life, they weren't there for me in grade 9 when I was alone, yet now they are?
It's fun to think about that there are people just like me out there in the world, that I'm not alone yet I am.

I know good and bad, I don't care at all, I have no filter, if it benefits me I'll do it, anything in order to get my goals just like my sister does, humans have no excuse for being poor or welfare. Determination, and WILLPOWER, feel pain and adapt, subject yourself to psychological torture, take a drug just for withdrawl effects and get used to it, suffer and enjoy it, you'll accept the pain and become a better person, fighting it is useless you only tire yourself out and you give in.

Mental torture is a fascination I've discovered, I've never studied psychology or anything, I'm still in highschool grade 11, surprisingly I know quite alot of maggots who are in their 30s, to think that if I had this drugs, they'd do anything for a quick fix. Amusing to think truly how pathetic they are, they've never suffered growing up so they never learned how to deal with pain, looking at how kids deal with it now, they slice themselves up, indulge in alcohol distraction themselves from reality, and they like it... they like living in delusions and a fake world being happy, while I learned to accept and realize that I'm the product of my father. And I hope my children turn out just as I did, I'd have to emotionally break them and destroy everything, then make them trust me and then do it again, you see. Children and even grown people, when they truly love someone, they'll accept whatever happens to them no matter if they're abused by the one they love, they remember better times and hope they change.
Those who are teenagers or even adults who are victim to that cannot change, they may be able to adapt but they'll never truly be immune to it, I remember overhearing a classmate explain how childhood trauma affects people, and most often serial killers are abused and they grow up with thoughts just like I had. I'm not sure how I didnt murder anyone, maybe because it's no more fun when they die, everyone gets scared and you need to act the part, no more parties. Though as long as they leave the people who constantly show me entertainment and the girls I prefer are safe, it doesnt care to me what happens to less fortunate people, I would always protect everyone who admires and looks up to me, because without them I'm nothing.

I wanted to end this message earlier, and yet here I am, distracted. I cannot talk to anyone my age in a serious manner, each and everyone of them are childish, they see things through a single lens.

""Everyone who does drugs are addicted"" ""If you steal you'll do anything"" ""I'm leaving if my boyfriend ever does drugs""
These sentences are blatantly wrong.
Everyone who does drugs are not addicted, not everyone in this world is born with a weak will. Some are very strong, they don't cave to small cravings, they continue doing their beliefs and they hold true to their word.

If you steal, you arent a bad person, everyone has something they desire so bad that they steal for, I know I wanted a girl so bad I made her cheat on her boyfriend, and I was there to see her lie to him on text ""oh I'm just heading to bed, I'll talk to you later in the morning love you"" see, I didnt do anything bad. She chose to sleep with me, and I accepted, in a sense I stole that poor guys girlfriend, and he didnt even know, he still doesnt because we agreed to not tell him, we also agreed that whenever we felt like it, we could do it again. Think of yourself first, than others. If you always think of yourself then you'll always be in pain, protect your right.

I'm done, I have to sleep. Help me please, and I'll pay you back by doing whatever you want.",06May2020,1
71,My girlfriend has been staying with my family and I since November/December and and her mental illness has been on a decline because of my mother constantly blaming her for things that have nothing to do with us and my brother having anger outbursts because anger issues and storming around the house screaming triggering her anxiety.

72,"A friend of mine tried to drown themselves. 

He texted right before he tried to kill himself and asked, even begged a little, for me to not call the ambulance. He had 3 attempts in the past and ended up in the hospital and lots of therapy every week. Since we went to different schools, I would text him to see if he's doing alright. 

For some reason though, I didn't feel any sadness or emotion when he told me he was going to commit suicide. Or the hours after it. I didn't feel a thing.

Is it normal to not feel anything when someone tries to kill themselves? And if it isn't, what is wrong with me?

My sh has if only gotten worse my dog died me and my nana got into two separate arguments for the first time in my life I lost a friend because I can‚Äôt express my boundaries and I think I‚Äôm about to loose another because I‚Äôm just that annoying I‚Äôm starting to hate everything about myself and about two or three nights ago I had an anxiety attack of some sort and have cried to some degree every night since

90,"Hi. I just had a panic attack and I don't really know where else to turn to so...reddit.

I had some food-based anxieties when I was a teenager, where I couldn't go to restaurants because I would throw up if I had to eat.  This caused a lot of trauma--I had fights with my parents, ""embarrassed"" my extended family, cried in the car alone, vomited in many restaurant bathrooms, and I still can't smell saffron rice to this day without shaking. I was diagnosed with general anxiety as a teen but only given GERD medication to stop me from having stomach issues.

This mostly cleared up when I went to college.  I just avoided mayo (which I still hate) because it always seems unsafe to me. Then, when I was a sophomore, I got it in my head that I was allergic to peanuts. I have no idea where or why I got that idea, because up until that point I *loved* peanuts and would eat peanut butter almost every day. This lasted for about a year, and then I got over it. Later, I was convinced I was allergic to oysters and avoided them, until I was pressured into eating fried oysters at a party. Surprise--I really liked them! Same thing for clams.

But now here I am, crying in a room at my in-law's because I have to keep justifying my ""allergies.""

About a year ago, the thought that I was allergic to nuts crept back into my mind. I started feeling cold and shaky after eating peanut butter--so I just stopped, and avoided all nuts. Then it started again with shellfish, like oysters and clams, and expanded to shrimp, octopus and squid. I now live in an East Asian country where these are all very common.  Lately it has also been fruits like mangoes (my little sister is allergic, although I have never displayed symptoms myself) that I avoid. 

When I flew back to this country last month I felt panicky after eating the in-flight service food--when I asked to see the ingredients list the flight attendants told me they didn't have one, just the plating guides (which they kindly showed me). This didn't help me relax, because now I was unsure if what I had eaten actually contained shellfish or nuts or something, which sent me spiraling even more, until I was shaking violently in my seat from anxiety.  I keep packets of benedryl in my purse, my backpack, and and extra tablet inside my wallet, just in case. If I even think I've come in contact with something, I'll take a pill, which knocks me out. 

My symptoms are: feeling suddenly very cold, shaking, feeling ""off,"" and then I often go to a mirror to check myself--am I getting hives? Has my tongue always looked that way? Am I breathing funny, or am I just overreacting?? Usually it just ends with me becoming extremely quiet (I'm super fun at dinner parties, obviously), excusing myself, taking a benedryl, and crying. 

When I'm alone/cooking for just my husband and myself, I can easily avoid these ingredients. When we go to restaurants, I'm careful to not order anything with nuts or shellfish, or something I'm not 100% sure of. But because of COVID, I had to return to my husband's country and we are living with my in-laws. They won't allow me to go out shopping (to ""protect"" me) so I have very very little control over the food they buy for us. They also question my ""allergies"" every single day. It's humiliating, and frustrating, and I can't even explain to them without getting upset and flustered. 

""It's not like I swell up...or I don't think so...but I just...get shaky and cold and I...just...don't want to eat it!""

Every single day we have a conversation about it. They've tried to be careful to not to buy pre-made food with my ""allergies,"" but they've made mistakes, and then I have to tell them I can't eat this because of my made-up aversion to some ingredient....

We will thankfully be moving out of here in about 2 weeks and then I can go back to cooking for myself. I can't wait. But until then it's a nightmare. My husband returned to our country yesterday--a month after me--so we are separated physically until we can move out of here and find our own apartment. So I can't even have his comfort or have him help explain to his parents. I can't talk to my own parents about it because I know I'll just get the same mix of frustration and pity and ""get over it, you are FINE!"" I don't know what to do and I feel like I'm losing control. 

Sorry for this vent. I just needed to write it all out. Seeing it written down, I know how crazy it looks, but I can't help it. I really don't know what to do, other than continue to avoid these foods.

I could skip school if my parents complete an application(more of my schoolmates will) but they just don't care. I've told them a million times that I don't want to go and that I would do every assignment our teachers assigns us in online classes but they don't listen. I've even begged them, promising them I will never bother them again but they don't give a fuck and tell me to stop being lazy.

I don't want to go to school. I would prefer to die. It makes me feel like a complete failure, a useless piece of shit. I don't want to self diagnose but I think I may have social anxiety to some extent. Whenever I am with other people I have intrusive thoughts I cant stop, that cause an insane amount of stress. I start sweating, my heart beats very fast, I get light-headed and I have to occupy my hands with something, like pinching myself or else I go completely crazy. In addition to all of this, due to my not existing self-confidence I always compare my looks and abilities to others which makes me feel even shittier about myself. Lastly, I don't have any friends. There's a girl I sometimes sit next to but it's because a teacher told her to hang out with me and because she pitties me.

I'm not saying covid 19 is a good thing, as a lot of people are suffering and losing loved ones, but quarantine is the best thing that has happened to me this year.

I now have this demon who has possessed my right eustachian tube. It causes my ear to pop and pop in sessions. It can pop as fast to 15-20 pops per second at time. It's very rapid! This happens in bursts and can last several hours at worse! It's like something is stripping air bubbles out of my ear tube like you would strip some peas.

Anyways, I always feel like im the reincarnation of my dad. i hardly even know myself. when i look in the mirror I think about how much I look like my dad. when i had sex for the first time I felt so dirty because I felt like my dad having sex and it grossed me out.

105,"Over the last year, I've said many times ""I wish a piano would just fall upon me from above, hit me on my head and make me stupid"". 
Sometimes I'm really tired of thinking. Over thinking. Thinking my side, their side. A third viewer's side. My subjective opinion on something. Someone's objective opinion on something. My behaviour, my thoughts: what form these, what past events. Which memories have significantly contributed to what I am now? How many things that I can't recall right now could have been vital for my current self? What do I miss? Why did I say that or why did I act this way? Could this mean that X past event has influenced me in a way that I ended up behaving like this? How should I act? Humans are not flawless. I have flaws. Should I act based on what I feel doing, or should I act based on the objective, hypothetic third viewer's point of view of what should be done?

Do I feel what I feel or should I recognise that what I feel is because of a trauma, and force myself to feel the ""correct"" feeling one should have? Ok this last sentence doesn't sound good. But I've thought of that. 

Sometimes I feel like everything is like an experiment. Do this and observe if it will work, what kind of effect it will have. What answers can I get from the results? About me? 

I'm trying to find who I am I think.. 

I think that I have the ability of viewing something from many point of views. But that makes me so tired sometimes. 

I just wish I was ""normal"". Not think too much, not care about things that I do. 

Sometimes I wonder, am I crazy? Am I schizophrenic? Am I depressed? Am I normal? Am I too clever for my own good? Do I need meaningful aims in my life to pour into my energy instead of overthinking my own creation?

I read somewhere that when the mind wonders aimlessly, it becomes its own trap. Sometimes I feel like this.

106,"A few days ago, there was a massive controversy surrounding rape threats on instagram in my country. This piece of media had left me quite unsettled and was on my mind for a really long time. 

Then, a few fragments of a memory started resurfacing in my mind surrounding a stranger showing me his private parts. In this memory, I am very young and seem to be unaffected by what was happening to me. Perhaps because i was unaware of what was happening at the time. Thankfully, it didn't lead to direct sexual contact but i remember this small memory with a lot of detail(I even remember what clothes that i was wearing). The more that i thought about it,I realised that this was not an isolated incident and I have been sexually harassed a few times after that as well(not by the same person). But for some reason, this is the first time that such a thought has even crossed my mind. Yet, i remember this happening to me so very clearly now.

I started looking into repressed memories and there is no definitive scientific proof that such a concept is even real. But on further research, I found out that i had previously displayed behaviour that is often connected to childhood trauma like disordered eating, being emotionally distant, being uncomfortable with touch, just to name a few. Have any of you experienced similar things?

Sorry for the long post.

108,"# Anger

Anger, also known as wrath or rage, is an intense emotional state involving a strong uncomfortable and hostile response to a perceived provocation, hurt or threat.

**Tip: Sublimation**

Sublimation is a mature defence mechanism, which involves transforming unwanted impulses into something more productive and less harmful. A good example would be to take up running, a sport, or martial arts as a way to express frustration or anger in a more healthy way.

Just about any form of physical activity, sport, or creative expression could be classed as sublimation, and it‚Äôs highly recommend that you have at least of of these outlets, particular if you frequently experience anger problems.

Here‚Äôs a few ideas: running, cycling, boxing, marital arts, football, basketball, rugby, weight lifting, painting, writing music, etc.

**Quotes**

&gt;‚ÄúDon‚Äôt waste your time in anger, regrets, worries, and grudges. Life is too short to be unhappy."" \~ Roy T. Bennett  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúHolding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die"" \~ Unknown

# Anxiety

Anxiety is a common mental health problem, which is prevalent throughout the world and can be really serious in some cases. Studies show that more than 1 in 10 people will develop a disabling anxiety disorder at some stage in their life.

**Tip: Breathing**

Square breathing is a simple technique which involves taking slow, deep breaths. It is good for stress reduction, and can increase performance and concentration.

To start, visualise a square, then follow the instructions going clockwise:

1) Breathe in for 4 seconds picturing one side of the square.

2) Hold your breath for 4 seconds visualising the second side of the square.

3) Breathe out over 4 seconds visualising the third side of the square.

4) Hold your breath for 4 seconds visualising the fourth side of the square.

This exercise should be completed as many times as required for the breathing to become calm and regular.

**Quotes**

&gt;‚ÄúThe root of all suffering is attachment."" \~ Buddha  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúFear is excitement without the breath."" \~ Fritz Perls

# Depression

Depression is a common mental health problem, which can be really serious, and is prevalent throughout the world. Globally, more than 300 million people of all ages suffer from depression. Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease.

**Tip: Exercise**

Regular exercise has been shown to help lower the effects of depression. This is due to several reasons including:

1. Taking our mind off worries - Rather than ruminating about problems, being proactive can help to distract us from negative cycles of thinking.

2. Releasing endorphins - feel good chemicals in the brain which can enhance our sense of well-being.

3. Confidence - you are actively trying to improve yourself, and becoming fitter at the same time, so you are naturally going to feel better about yourself.

4. Social interaction - joining the gym, going for a run in the park, or joining a sports team may introduce you to other like minded people.

# Loneliness

Loneliness is the reaction to physical isolation, or perceived isolation and alienation in the presence of other people. It can cause a variety of unpleasant emotional responses, and can increase the risk of a number of health problems.

**Tip 1: Prioritise Intimacy**

A sense of loneliness doesn‚Äôt just come from not being around people physically, but from a lack of true connection and intimacy.

**Tip 2: Embrace authenticity**

Perhaps you feel lonely because you have become a stranger to yourself by denying your true authenticity. Risk being more real with yourself and to others.

**Tip 3: Real conversations**

Talk more about things that are real, important, and meaningful to you, rather than shallow and generic small talk.

**Quotes**

&gt;‚ÄúRisk being seen in all your glory."" \~ Jim Carrey  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúTo find real peace you have to let the armour go. Your need for acceptance can make you invisible in this world."" \~ Jim Carrey  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúLoneliness expresses the pain of being alone and solitude expresses the glory of being alone."" \~ Paul Tillich

# Self-esteem

Self-esteem is defined as ""confidence in one's own worth or abilities; self-respect"". In Psychology, it is usually described as ""a person's overall sense of self-worth or personal value; how much you appreciate and like yourself.""

**Tip 1: The Practice Of Living Consciously**

Living consciously means being aware of the reasons behind our actions; being aware of the consequences of our actions; to analyse our goals and our values in order to be sure that are actually ours and not goals and values imposed to us by external influences such as our family.

**Tip 2: The Practice Of Self-Acceptance**

Self-Acceptance means accepting one‚Äôs body, thoughts, emotions and actions, and it is more than simply approve, it is living fully one‚Äôs own choices.

**Quotes**

&gt;‚ÄúYou yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection."" \~ Sharon Salzberg  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúWanting to be someone else is a waste of the person you are."" \~ Marilyn Monroe

# Self-harm

Self-harm, or self-injury, is the intentional, direct injuring of your body. It is also sometimes calling self-mutilation or cutting. It is usually done as a way of dealing with painful feelings and memories, or difficult and overwhelming situations.

**Tip: Emotional Literacy**

Being able to feel your emotions, accurately describe them, understand them, and communicate them to others is an invaluable life skill, and those who self-harm would greatly benefit from developing emotional literacy.

According to Claude Steiner, ""to be emotionally literate is to be able to handle emotions in a way that improves your personal power and improves the quality of life around you.""

The following three steps should allow you to begin to develop your emotional literacy:

1) Define - What feeling or emotion am I experiencing right now? Say this out loud or write it down. (You can use this feelings wheel as a guide http://feelingswheel.com)

2) Expand - Begin to develop a more nuanced and detailed description of what you are currently feeling. Is it just sadness or is there fear as well? Is the anger mingled with fear? What is underneath the anxiety?

3) Action - Write down a series of steps that may help you to avoid whatever caused you to feel this way, and begin to think about more healthy and mature ways to deal with, and express these feelings.

**Quotes**

&gt;""Don‚Äôt make a permanent decision for your temporary emotion."" \~ Unknown  
&gt;  
&gt;""Unspeakable feelings need to find expression in words. However... verbalization of very intense feelings may be a difficult task."" \~ James A. Chu  
&gt;  
&gt;""Self-destructiveness may be a primary form of communication for those who do not yet have ways to tame their excruciating inner conflicts and feelings and who cannot yet turn to others for support."" \~ James A. Chu

# Suicidal Feelings

Suicide is the intentional taking of your own life, which invariably is preceded by suicidal thoughts and feelings. This post aims to address and shed some light on this difficult but important health problem.

**Tip: Safety Plan**

If you have experienced suicidal feelings before, or perhaps have made previous attempts, it is strongly recommended that you make a safety plan. A safety plan is a personalised plan to support you step-by-step at times when you may be thinking about suicide.

\- List of warning signs

\- Coping strategies (what have you tried in the past which helped)

\- Contact details of loved ones

\- Contact details of support services

\- List of favourite things (memories, music, people, places etc.)

\- List of future goals and possibilities

\- Steps to make the environment safe, or the details of another safe place you could visit

(Write out this plan when you are feeling well and are able to think clearly. You could discuss this plan with a therapist of trusted friend if you feel that would help)

**Quotes**

&gt;""Don't wish it was easier, wish you were better."" \~ Jim Rohn  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúEven the darkest night will end and the sun will rise."" \~ Victor Hugo  
&gt;

112,"Mental Health affects lots of people it doesn't matter how old you are, it will affect anyone. Meantal Health starts from people getting bullied in primary school, high school and collegue, people talking about your body size, what you look like and the race you are, your sexually and traumatic events can cause this as well to anything really. The more this happens the more you will start to get depression, anxiety, bipolar, dementia, attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, obessive complusive disorder (OCD), autism and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

I haven't personal experience any of these mental health that I mention but I have/had friends who are going through and had these experience I have mention, knowing and having a friend who have been/going through this, it's just really hard to see because you don't know how much you are helping them. All of those mental health I have mention before can lead to suicide thoughts for most people, if they are constantly getting bullied about what they look like, their weight, race and sexually this will make start to make them feel so unwanted and that they aren't good enough for anyone so this will lead to them having suicide thoughts telling themselves that they aren't good enough, that they don't belong to be here, things would be so much better if I wasn't here.

Suicide/ self harm are a very close topics to my heart because 800,000 people died every year from suicide, suicide will start from any of the mental health I have previous mention, when someone is bullying you about your weight, race and sexually you will start to feel so worthless, tell yourself that you aren't good enough and the world would be so much better if I wasn't in it, self harm will start when someone tells you that you don't look good enough about what you are wearing or what your body looks like. People shouldn't discrimanate about what others look like most people bully each other to make themselves feel better or to show off to their friends.

Girls would get bullied about what they wear, if their make up looks good or not, if there fake tan is good or not, about their weight and sexually most girls would self harm because they are feeling so worthless because what other girls are saying about them and what other girls are saying about their backs. Suicide and self harm are very serious I would stay up the whole night to talk someone in ending their life they just have so much to live for. When you have self care some cuts can be deep and you go into hospital for them and you know that those cuts will be there with you forever  traumatic events can cause you to have suicide thoughts and start to harm yourslef.

Guys would get bullied because they aren't tough enough, have abs, muscles like other guys, they would get bullied at school because they don't fit in and they so self concious that they never wanna take off their shirts because they know other guys will start to put them down because you have like no abs or muscle. This can effect most guys so much because this will just start to bring down their self-esteem and they never wanna be around other guys because he would get judged or bullied because he isn't big like the other guys.

I had a really good mate who had depression because he got bullied so much in high school, the kids who were bullying him they would follow him home, bash him at school he told me that one time he was walking home from school a couple of boys jumped at him and stabbed him. He would always say Heidi I'm in so much pain and I just want all of this pain to go away and I ask him are you thinking about sucide thoughts and he said yes and I asked him why? he said Heidi I just want all these pains to go away. So pretty much the next day when I was at school I saw on his instagram that he tried to jump off a cliff, but he broke his leg and broke his neck he was in hospital for weeks I didn't hear from him so I started to get worried I didn't know if he was Okay or not then he message me saying Heidi I'm Okay, I just didn't have my phone with me.

Then 3weeks later he got realised out of hospital I kept checking up on him seeing if he was Okay, I said if you need anyone to talk to I'm here for you, every night I would stay up trying to convince him that he was worthy to be alive and that his family would miss him if he was gone.
The next day I went to school I messaged him before I left to go catch the bus for school, the whole time I was at school I was worried about what he could be doing, if he was Okay, when I got home I messaged him straight away seeing if he was Okay but I got no respond for about 4hrs I started to get more worried then I got a message from a friend saying that he didn't go to school, that he jumped in front of a moving train, at that point when I got that message he knew he was gone forever and that he would never have to go through this pain anymore.
It's Okay to not be Okay and you should NEVER be ashamed to talk to anyone about what your struggling with, I know it's hard to open up to a stranger about what you're struggling with but leaving in fear and not being able to talk to anyone about it, just make's it so much harder to talk about it.

 Men who struggle with mental health they can   struggle a lot more with it because people think men are brave and they can't be vulnerable because if they show weakness or fear they aren't a real man anymore, every man out there deserves to be heard, they struggle as much as we all do.

Having/ knowing people out there that are going through mental health by themselves it just hurt's me so much because no one is like checking up on them and feel are just feel so alone because they have no one. 
It's Okay to NEVER be Okay and NEVER be ashamed to rant or cry about what you are going through at all, menatl health is a very close topic to my heart because I've already lost lost 2 very amazing guy friends in my life, you should NEVER give up on someone who is struggling even if they say they are Okay just keep letting them know that you are going to be there for them, you just can't give up on them because if you do, you feel like a failure and that you didn't do much to help them sometimes it's just to late.

ALWAYS  check up on your friends, even the ones that smile and make other people smile when they walk into a room, behind every smile and close door those people can be going through something very tough, always reach out to them and check up on them if they are Ok, even the ones that say they are fine, they really aren't fine, NEVER leave it until it's to late check up on them because you could have done something to STOP IT.

 I have lost another beauitful friend to suicide, NEVER leave it to late. Suicide is a hard topic to talk about with some people but it's really good to aslo talk about it look out for your mates, one day they can be gone just like that keep them close, keep checking up on them even when they tell you are they are fine, they just might find it really hard to tell you what is happening with them so they will tell you they are fine people who struggle with mental health find it very hard to reach out and ask for help you just need to give them a push and be there for them.

Suicide is a big topic, it's Okay not to be Okay always reaching out for help is a good start, but opening up it's really tough, I want to prevent other people from getting to the point where they just can't do it anymore. Young teenagers usually struggle a lot more with suicide but they tell everyone that are they fine and everyone just leaves themsleves because they don't keep pushing asking if they are really Okay.

If anyone needs to talk about anything I have talked about and opened up about I will be here menatal health is a very close topic to my heart because I've already lost 2 beautiful amazing friends to this, NEVER STOP checking up on your mates or even people you don't know, even by just talking to them and telling them they are beautiful, amazing and that they shouldn't take their lives that makes them feel so much comfortable, NEVER GIVE UP ON CHECKING ON SOMEONE OR PUSHING TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE IN GOOD HANDS &amp; THAT THEY ARE SAFE.",06May2020,1

I have been having a really tough time lately staying motivated and positive. I'm only in my late 20's and I already feel like I've lived a life time. Alcoholic parents, sexually abusive brother, bullying at school and losing a child are just some of the many many things I've had to deal with. I've had my heart broken countless times and I feel lonely 24/7. I used to find a lot of solace in being alone and doing things I enjoy but even that is meaningless these days. Most of my days since the lockdown started involve sleeping or staring aimlessly out the window. I feel like alot of the time my brains on autopilot and completely disconnected from the rest of me. 

I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to who understands my pain and that in itself is perpetuating the impending feeling of hopelessness. How do I turn it around? My entire life has been a complete battle and I don't have the will to fight anymore. How does a person carry on in life having experienced all this? It seems unlikely I'll ever get to live a normal life. I feel extremely unlucky or like I'm being punished and I just don't know why.",06May2020,1

121," I used to live with my older sister for few years who had severe anorexia. 

She would down a box of laxatives everyday and do nothing but diarrhea 24/7. 

That explosive farting sound, the splattering of brown fecal liquid , her jumping up and running to the bathroom ... it was horrific. I literally felt like my life was a pile of shit. We were living in this shit storm hurricane. 

Of course she never cleaned up the splattered shit liquid . It was either me ,mom or dad. 

I used to clean the toilet 4-5 times a day/.  I'd lift up the toilet seat to see if there is any splattered shit.  I just wanted to make the sight and sound of SHIT just to stop. 

We lived like this for 4-5 years . 

Now I live alone.  Yet every time I see anything that reminds me of diarrhea - I can;t stop the urge to clean it .

Ex. 1 :  A tenant's dog accidentally peed in the elevator and nobody cleaned it up. I literally felt like someone pissed on me and my life. I take photos and text my super.  

Ex. 2 : I wiped the hallway with bleach yesterday because someone leaked while taking out their trash. There was pungent liquid on the floor and it smelled like rotten fish, urine and even vagina. 

The odor was so strong . I felt like I pay a high rent I should not have to live in a stinky place.  I called my super and he said the cleaning person will be here on Sunday. So I sprayed bleach on the fishy liquid.

I think we need to change the name of anxiety and also depression so that they sound as serious as they are. So many people just completely brush off these serious mental health issues because they are so common. Thinking that ‚Äòfeeling depressed‚Äô or a bit ‚Äòanxious‚Äô is the same as a full blown mental illness. Telling someone you have depression or anxiety feels like it has the same impact, as telling someone you have a cold. 
It needs to be talked about in a more serious manner so that people suffering from these sometimes life ruining mental illnesses don‚Äôt have to be ashamed. 
Pretty much every person i have spoke to who has or did have clinal depression (including myself) say that they often feel guilty, they have thoughts similar too ‚Äúother people have it so much worse than me‚Äù or ‚Äúim just over exaggerating.‚Äù This is not how things should be. People shouldn‚Äôt have to feel bad for being in pain. Think about it this way, you dont see a guy with a broken leg feeling guilty about having broke his leg. No, he goes to the doctors, gets help, lets it heal and will likely receive get well soon letters from family or friends. Why does the same not happen with a broken mind?
If everyone in a community can realise how serious anxiety and depression actually is, then they can empathise with those who suffer, helping MILLIONS of people who‚Äôs lives are a constant struggle, to at least feel a little bit more understood, accepted by their peers and less guilty. That to me, would be a massive step in the right direction ‚ù§Ô∏è


PS. Mental health in general needs to be spoken about a lot more. I just talked about anxiety and depression in this because i feel they are considered less serious than other mental illnesses by many. Thank you for reading!",06May2020,1
123,"Long story short, I was thrown in juvie, put into a psych ward, and put on a six month probation for a crime I was framed for when I was 17.

It ruined a couple years of my life. I wasnt allowed on school property, so I had to go to an alternative school. That place was full of the worst kids id ever seen. Kids who deserved to be there.

Then there was the psych ward, which was honestly the worst couple weeks of my life.

Now, I'm scared around police, I can't trust anyone with any kind of authority, and to top it all off, I missed out on my senior year of highschool.

I didn't realize how bad it hurt until I was watching deadman Wonderland (A series in which the main character was framed for murder), and I just saw similarities in how things went down, and I couldn't help but cry.

I don't know if I should look into going to a psychologist. The last time I was in a mental facility it was genuinely mental hell.

124,"Hi all, I've been struggling with my mental health for a few months now, I'm incredibly hard on myself and don't really give myself any self love or compassion. I went through a breakup and my initial response was to go emotionless, to hide away from my feelings basically, and the relationship itself was pretty toxic because of my low self esteem. 

I went to a therapist to help me out with all of this and in one of our early sessions I mentioned I'm terrified I'm a narcissist with no redeeming qualities. He sort of smiled an empathetic smile and explained for around 1-2 minutes why he was confident I wasn't one. I haven't been able to go to any sessions recently because of covid and it's just building up in me. What if he's wrong? I really don't want to live a life characterised by manipulation and a lack of connection. I just play this narrative over and over in my head and I feel it's holding me back from making progress towards a healthier lifestyle. 

I don't really know why I'm sharing this I guess I just wanted to get it off my chest.

128,"Therapy changed my life over a decade ago when I was reeling, depressed, and anxious from a breakup. I have a fundamental belief that it can change anyone else's, even if they don't think they need it.

At the same time, I think most people don't understand therapy, and don't understand the value they can get from it. And even though it's becoming more accessible, it's still inaccessible to most whether it's for monetary or social reasons.

Since I'm a video producer, I decided to make a video series making mental health advice clear, actionable, and entertaining. The idea is that we have therapists and coaches provide me and my friend with one ""challenge"" to improve our mental health, that can be done without supervision. Then we film ourselves trying that out for a week and document the results. 

I'm curious what y'all think about some of them. I'll share one and drop the rest in a comment.

131,"Hi, this is my first time posting here. I need help with something, but I feel like I have to explain the situation a bit more so that it makes sense.  

I'm 21 now and was physically and emotionally hurt as a child and teenager by my parents. I'm very emotional and cry easily especially when I'm under stress. I never understood why. I never talked to a mental health professional about it either.

Today my parents had an argument about something minor (me not wanting to open the door to a stranger and it turns out it was some company guy of my father's.)  and when I tried to explain my mother had none of it. My mother has a ""furious screaming"" type of anger. Her anger can be calmed when I bring up truths like it was 7 am, I was alone, in my pajamas and I didn't know this man standing at the doorstep.

None of that works with my father. He is silent, but stares me down the entire time. As soon as I tell them my side, he raises his voice and shuts me up instantly. My mother watches on. In tense moments I get very scared and get a lump in my throat. The entire time he's speaking I'm holding back tears and have this gut wrenching fear that any second now he's going to stand up and hit me I just know it. Like if I move away or look him in the eyes too long this will trigger him exploding at me. I can't describe how fearful I am in situations like this. There are images in my head flashing in front of me of how he'll  stand up and slap, kick or hurt me. It's just violent imagery of all the ways he can hurt me. I can't make it stop. 

This entire situation felt ridiculous and I let out a sigh and not saying anything and he interpreted it as me thinking this was funny and I almost started weeping right there, but just let him talk and avoided eye contact. At one point he was done and I quietly went to my room. Basically what had happened is that I inconvenienced my father by not opening that door and not telling that guy that my father wasn't there, so my father had to make a call to this other man. That's it. All this because of a phone call. 

Neither of them hurt me this day. I chalked it up to my father thankfully getting older and not being as agile he was when he was younger. Yet I felt just as threatened today as when I was a kid and didn't know better when to shut up. When I was little I made many mistakes and I didn't know how to diffuse situations and got hit easily, because I was dumb and didn't see it coming.

The images in my head worry me. This is the reason I still don't have my licence, because my father is always my co-driver and has to instruct me to drive, but whenever something small happens like the engine dies, he blows up at me and how badly of a driver I am and I just start to weep uncontrollably and can't stop anymore, while I have images in my head of how he'll just grab my hair and smash my head against the steering wheel. I'm crying writing this and I just can't handle thinking about it I'm just so scared of him when he's angry or annoyed. I don't understand it!! He didn't hurt me for a long time but neither the crying nor the images in my head stop. 

Is there any way I can make them stop? I don't want this to happen anymore. I love my father and he isn't mad all the time, but when he is my fear takes over in moments like these. I want to be able to talk to him when he's mad and not immediately crumble. I don't want to be scared of him anymore.",06May2020,2

It will be focused on creating a good study habit and be mindful about it, also on mental health support regarding study anxiety. The plan is to be held accountable by other members, and to have a safe space where we just hop in and mind our business (you should shoot your textbooks and nothing else), and in case share knowledge, tips, links etc. I am posting it here because I do think it helps to share during isolation.

We will have sessions planned each day, and you **have to partecipate everyday**, 5 mins or 5 hours? Both are ok. Other than that you will share your goals and we'll help to plan, and we could support each others, if we are on a slump, a panic attack, a depressive episode or just feeling unmotivated.I am from EU, and in uni, but everyone is welcome!

I've got down to 75mg and regained 5 lbs, but having difficulties to regain more mass. Also the heightened restlessness and agitation kills me.

155,"I'm an Asian American male (east asian) approaching 30.

Growing up was pretty good, until I got to the age where I realised how asian men were perceived in terms of dating and love life. Throughout high school I was mocked by women - I grew up realising that even women from our own race threw us under the bus happily. I basically withdrew and became pretty much a loner. From the desperation brought on by the realisation of how society looks at us, I got into my first serious relationship which turned out to be abusive, and that ended up setting off a whole chain of events. Ended up having to leave the US as the only conceivable way out, and had to work my way through alot of anger at what happened.

Almost a decade later, I've worked my way to the top of society in a completely foreign European country - degree from their top university, job at one of the most prestigious multinationals, own property, the works. But whilst things on that front couldn't be any better, it's almost as if my mental state has taken a few steps back. I've more than caught up from my past - From being mocked by women for being an Asian man, the tables have turned considerably. However, the anger and resentment has grown - towards Asian and White women in particular. I've had my fair share of sleeping around, I've probably outdone by leaps and bounds the guys I was jealous of in high school and university. The quality of the women I've slept with and dated too since my abusive relationship have been amazing. I've even found myself in a long-term, stable polyamorous arrangement with 2 white women - something that I as an Asian man never thought was possible. Its shitty because I've come to realise that most of my choices in terms of my love and dating life have been to prove something to the world rather than choices I make for myself. Would I have found them attractive if I wasn't told that they being white women were out of my reach? Its shitty because I have come to realise that these 2 women genuinely love me for who I am and accept me for who I am - not as an Asian man, but simply as a man - but yet, while I do love them, I can't see them as individuals; as people - I project my views of women and white people onto them unfairly, and this has become even more intense in light of everything going on with the Coronavirus. I find myself questioning my attraction to them - in what I am doing being with them, am I no better than the Asian women who actively pursue white men? I feel like am a horrible person and I cannot avoid the reality that they are in effect, trophies in my conquests.  This is so, so bad because these two women do not deserve that at all, with everything they have done and given me.

Now that I am settling down in this country, with these women potentially becoming an important, permanent/long-term fixture in my life, I do find myself at a crossroads with these issues.  


There's just so much to unpack here but I am beginning to realise that I will never be happy or satisfied until I get this mental clusterfuck undone. To the professionals and the more experienced members here... where would someone in my shoes even begin? It's one thing getting to the office, sitting down in that chair, but with so much... I'm just really concerned that I start off on the right foot since there really is so much to unpack.",06May2020,1

I haven't went through his phone lately because I'm worried that if I find something I will have a mental breakdown and it will hurt me worse than him. hes been displaying all the classic signs of cheating; treating me differently, being overly and underly affectionate at times, changing his attitude and acting weird towards me. I have no proof of him cheating and I keep thinking my gut is giving me the feeling that he is. but it may be my anxiety taking over and giving me false paranoia. idk what to do ive tried to talk to him about it but its not an easy subject to bring up without a fight insuing. i just need some advice on what to do üòî",06May2020,1

For a month+ I‚Äôve been getting worrisome symptoms : bumps all over my skin as in face, arms, chest,  (not pimples) ,raised red skin lesions/lines, On and off dizziness and lightheadedness, nausea, flashing lights in vision . My parents completely ignore my symptoms and rather blame it on the fact ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt sleep‚Äù while I sleep 8 hours every day although it being in the later times like 6 AM , just how every teen is currently no school. I‚Äôve sobbed in front of my parents in extreme fear of my health begging to go to a doctor and they just ignore me, tell me go away, continuing talking on the phone completely ignoring their son sobbing for help. I tried taking matters in my own hands as a plan to seek attention so I can go to a doctor . I slammed and broke my mothers phone her, yeah the same one she continuously ignores her son on , calling family members saying I‚Äôm crazy on ( I am nowhere near crazy and very intelligent) When she seen it she said she was going to tell my older brother and causing a big scene , then I started yelling LISTEN TO YOUR SON HES PLEADING FOR HELP AND YOU VALUE YOUR PHONE MORE THAN HIS LIFE. this action resulted in me being whipped with a belt out of my sleep (around 2pm) by my sibling leaving dark lines and scars I still have today. My skin was so puffed up with belt marks after that beating and for what? Because I was seeking attention from a neglectful family. They also took away my PlayStation 4, the only thing that keeps my anxious and suicidal thoughts away (these past 2 weeks without it has been hell, I no longer can get away from my panic attacks about my health , depression and plain loneliness from quarantine.

This punch and hell caused me and my 350lb brother  putting me in a lock and pushing his bodyweight against me  shouting loudly, I put my arm up in defense after he let go assuming he was gonna attack again , and he said put my fucking arm down..

159,"dear readers. 

i don't know what to do. recently i feel again so useless. i can't work thanks to my muscle disease. i can work but not do heavy work or stressful work as it cause my muscles to cramp up and then i start to feel pain and go into hyperventilation what shuts down my muscles for some seconds. doctors will help me live with it and learn to move around, do things proper way. 
my family don't understand this and think always i fake it or don't have it but i live daily in stress,  no idea where it even come from but i live in lots and lots of stress each day. also lots of fears.  fear of nothing, fear of dogs, fear of going out and i can name alot more. i am introvert as a person and that makes it even harder for me as i am scared to talk to strangers as that stress me out alot. 

next what makes me useless and feel like i am worthless is the fact that i want to lay down alot. i feel at  night so heavy in my head that i just want to lay down. the reason for that is also unknown to me. it can maybe be cause of my girlfriend who is working in Kuwait and i hear her not so much as during Ramadan, it is so much work for her there and i worry alot about her. she knows it but she have to work also and so i let her do also. i want to help her and be there for her but i can't cause i am far from her and i am not allowed to get there also. 

i want to do so much but all i do or try fails. i love things and i try alot to work it out, find ways to become good at it but i still can't.  or i get pain in my muscles or after months of practice, i notice i can't get better and i fail. or anything else. there is always a reason why i can't make it work.

i am a perfectionist but also don't have patience enough to get it. or i can do it or i can't.  i am willing to learn and get better but i want to see progress and need someone to pull me up always, someone who is there telling me what i can do better and do good also. some positive vibes cause negativity is allready around me. i blame myself and put myself always so low. i need some positivity but it's hard to find. 

sometimes i wish that i was dead as then i don't give my family such problems as they aren't happy with me. all they do is look down on me, talk bad about me and don't respect me and my issues.  they are even against my girlfriend and my cousin even tried to take her away from me. i have to stay strong and fight for her cause she is there for me, even we are far and she support me but i am sometimes completely exhausted and broken.  i been in depression before and i still have them from time to time. my girlfriend know i have it as she also have depressions sometimes but i didn't tell her what i feel now. i don't want her to know as she have it hard enough allready and i don't want to hurt her. i want to make her happy and have good days during her hard times. i don't want to be the one who will push her into a big depression. i care alot about her and i love her to much to see her suffer. 

i make this post cause i want to write down my feelings. i want everyone to know how useless i am as a human being.  how bad i am and worthless even. how nobody can really respect me as i am a nobody. a bad and weak man. if you can even call me a man. 
i even lose my eye sight sometimes but get it back also.  i get dizzy sometimes but i always get better.  
that's me in a nutshell

Thanks in advance for reading through this and wish you all a good life ahead. may God bless you all

160,"Hi, 

I've been struggling a lot for the past years and it's hard to come to terms with anything really that has happened to me and not blame myself as much as I try not to. Long story short I went from one abusive/toxic relationship to another, and the latest one really took a toll on me. I thought he was the one I would spend the rest of my life with. We were together for three years our families got along well but he hid his true self from me. He cheated, had an affair, spent his money on drugs ( cocaine, molly... etc )  and started putting all  his anger and frustrations on me. It took me a year but I was finally able to say enough is enough and for that I am proud.

It's been almost 6 months since I put an end to it, but it still haunts me. I have nightmares of the fights, screams and trauma he put me thru. I cant help but feel that I deserved it and should've stayed and just realized that my life was meant to be that way but I'm trying. 

I tried putting myself out there, thinking maybe if i met someone my mind would just leave him behind, however I realized that as soon as someone shows me any emotion I become attached and obsessive thinking that it  could possibly turn into something when in reality I might just be scared that I will live the rest of my life alone. I have heard this from my parent's; since I am divorced do not have a college degree and have lived with men I will never be taken serious. It's been years since my parents told me that but every time I was or am mistreated by someone I care about i relate back to what they said and start to believe it's true. 

Life has been getting a hold on me lately and it's been making it harder and harder to deal with anything.  I cant shower daily, I had to force myself to shower after going days without one, I'm having a hard time sleeping and waking up, I get nauseous just thinking about food,  I'm constantly angry at the world and myself ,living alone hasn't been easy on me either and the drinking started again which isn't helpful since I am on anti depressants and birth control. 

 I constantly crave love and attention while believing I dont deserve either and don't love myself or even care for being alive. 

Tbh if I didn't have my pets to give me somewhat of a purpose I would be dead by now. 

I'm just honestly tired of feeling this way and needed to vent.

I'm currently diagnosed with OCD, PTSD, and depression. My parents are older (67 and 71) so I never really knew about any kind of mental health issues in my family, so something else could be going on, but no one's talking about it (generational stuff, y'know?).

I've been diagnosed with a lot of things in the past including bipolar disorder (types 1 and 2), GAD, and MDD. There could be others, but there's a chance I don't remember. I've been put on several medications in the past (I went through I think 10 in the span of about 3 years? That's an estimate though) and I'm currently on 80mg Prozac (fluoxetine) a day, 300 mg Trileptal (oxcarbazepine) a day, and 1mg clonazepam as needed. This combo is definitely working well for me.  

I think the sheer amount of medication changes I went through messed with my brain in some way, but what I'm thinking about started in high school before I was on any meds at all. When I was about 16, I think, people were staring me down and whispering about me as I passed by. It was like everyone fell silent when I passed them because they hated me so much and didn't want me to hear the things they were saying about me. There was hate in their faces from what I can remember and I remember being scared and anxious as I walked to classes. I didn't know what I did to make them hate me so much. I just remember feeling intense feelings of being hated by my classmates. I figured I must have done something really wrong. Obviously, this had an impact on me and I started absolutely hating myself for reasons I couldn't understand. I just knew I was bad somehow. These feelings generally didn't last, though, and when I came out of this ""state"" I felt like I woke up from a dream or something. But I had been at school the whole time, going about my day. No one ever said I was acting weird so I kept this to myself. My boyfriend (25M) who I went to the same high school with (we reconnected after a few years) told me recently that no one ever had any feelings of hatred toward me, ever. He hung out with a lot of people, and he doesn't recall anyone saying they even that they didn't like me. Apparently, everyone just assumed I was shy and quiet, but no one ever hated me in the way I thought they did. 

Fast forward to college. At this point, I was positive that I was invisible and no one could see me, and no one would notice if I was gone (obviously, because I was apparently invisible). I ended up skipping a lot of class because I was convinced of this. I was always surprised when someone mentioned that they had missed me in class the other day, or when I saw my attendance grades were shitty. Again, these ""states"" don't last forever, and when I do come out of them, it's like coming out of a dream. I should mention that I was sexually assaulted during my first year of college, and these states got much more intense after that. I know this is a symptom of PTSD, but that doesn't explain why I've been getting these since high school. I had no prior trauma that I can remember. 

I'm now finishing up graduate school and thankfully these ""episodes"" or ""states"" or whatever are much fewer and far between. At the beginning of grad school, though, I was still convinced that no one would notice if I skipped a seminar - even though there were only five people total that would be in the room. There are other times that I've believed some things that turned out to be false, but I don't want to get into them right now because this post is already long, and they're actually really hard and scary to talk about. 

But my question is - was I delusional, severely depressed, or both? I can say with absolute confidence there were periods in which I thought I didn't exist, or that I existed outside others' reality. It was like, I could see them but they couldn't see me? Like, I was looking in from a two-way mirror? It's hard to explain but I hope there's someone on here that has either experienced something similar or has some insight as to what my head was doing at the time. 

Currently, as I said, I'm finishing up my Master's. I'm doing better than ever! I'm very lucky to have an outstanding psychiatrist, access to therapy/medication, and a solid support system. This post is mainly just me being curious. 

And if anyone's going through something similar, I'm proof that it does get better. Stay strong.",06May2020,1

She remembers all the bad thing i did but none the good thing i‚Äôve done. She blames her fault on others but not my bro and don‚Äôt want to be corrected, always sensitive and act like she‚Äôs fragile and cries when everything doesn‚Äôt go as she want. I grew up steered by her and having told about what to do next and what to say in almost everything i‚Äôm not really sure about anything. She wanted me to be a doctor to fulfill her ego, but i failed the tests and when i said i can‚Äôt do it, she cried and said it‚Äôs okay but she‚Äôs clearly disappointed in me.

I always try to look ahead for the future but lately i can‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt want to die yet but at the same time i‚Äôm feeling broken, and tired of this.

He is paranoid and obsessed with me secretly trying to make my brothers hate him, my mum is ""happy and safe"" despite the multiple times when he's screaming and mocking her crying and she has said he scares her. If I try bring it up she insults me and makes me the issue, once they both randomly left the house and my brothers were worried, she got home and blamed their relationship issues on me, despite me still trying to get along with him at the time. 
The last time he spoke to me he was screaming about how he was indeed racist and homophobic (I'm bi), and how it's Adam and Eve. My mum always pushes the issues onto me and if I ever try to confide in her about my feelings she is tired and I'm being selfish, and yet she always pushes her issues onto me.

It's the only thing keeping me going, knowing it's almost over, I've been waiting nearly 3 years for this. I wish covid had never come because it means I'm stuck home more often, not that I have friends who want to hang out in person much anyway (text) or a best friend or anything like that, I just feel so stuck.

Wanting to be sexual at 8. Is this normal for a child? I tried committing suicide at 8 according to my mother, again at 17, my childhood and teenage years I had no friends whatsoever and couldnt attend school due to my crippling depression, I was essentially a hermit.
I have been trying to look back and unlock those memories and have realized a few things. I was and still am scared of men. Friends fathers, male teachers, any adult males. I was heading to sleep just now and got the image of these big male arms coming to grab me and I jumped, i cant sleep now because i feel a massive weight in my heart. I dont remember being abused but I do wonder if I was. I've talked to my mother about it and she said she always wondered if I was abused. Was this the reason I lost my spirit and ended up like this?

206,"I'm 18 in my senior year of high school, and all I can say is that I feel like very little has changed for me over the past 8 years of my life since I started middle school. (Also, sorry this post is going to be long and all over the place). Also trigger warning?? I mention hurting myself, suicide, etc. 

I struggle to stay motivated in general, but recently it has gotten worse since I have been home. I know every family is a little dysfunctional, but my relationship with my family isn't the most stable. I often fight with my mother, my father never wants to be a parent, and my brother struggles with his own emotional health as well. I am not biologically related to any of them. 

We are not poor and live comfortably, but the house has a lot of issues. We have to turn off the water to the entire house when we are not using it because there is a leak in our basement that we don't have enough money to repair. There are constantly bugs everywhere (especially now that the warmer weather is coming), and food in our fridge is often left to the point that it becomes expired and rots. We also just have too much stuff it overwhelms every room. It was only this year that I came to realize why I never was able to finish cleaning out my entire room - there's just so much everywhere it's overwhelming to even know or figure out where to begin or what to do with all of it. I get stuck eventually and lose motivation. My room is definitely the ""cleanest"" out of any other room in the house, but that's not saying much. Bags of trash, dirty dishes and dirty laundry are practically everywhere. That's not just my room either. 

My house has been like this for almost as long as I have lived here. I know this might just sound like I'm lazy, and technically I have cleaned my room entirely before but it's been a while. I just figured the environment probably also contributes to my mindset. 

Throughout my entire childhood, I have also struggled to maintain or develop close friendships, and I've never understood why. During middle school, however, I was close with a lot of kids who were struggling with their mental health. I had three close friends tell me they wanted to hurt themselves over the four years of middle school. I have never considered myself suicidal because I never actively went out of my way with the intention of dying. I have definitely thought about it though. Nowadays, these thoughts mostly manifest themselves in the idea of disappearing or wishing I never existed. 

High school was okay. My freshman year was good until winter term. I had become really close friends with this one girl who always put other people down. I didn't realize it until winter term, and because it felt unhealthy, I started to distance myself from her. Then I realized, I never made any other friends. Whenever I try to tell someone I don't really have a lot of friends, they will point to the comments on my social media pages. There are a lot of people I am friendly with because we shared classes together or had mutual friends, but they aren't the kind of people who would be checking up on me. I don't hold that against them at all, I just mean to say we just didn't have that kind of friendship. As a senior, I would say I really only had four close friends - one of which left my high school and spiraled into substance abuse. We are no longer close because she cut me off the last month of our junior year for a guy. 

\*\***At this point I'm not even sure if this explanation would be helpful but the TLDR of it all is this**: 

I feel like I struggle to stay motivated. I'm not happy unless something good happens. I don't always have bad days, but last summer was probably one of the lowest points of my life. I lost interest in a lot of things that I used to like. I had zero sex drive, I never wanted to eat, and I always wanted to sleep. I didn't do anything except go to work, sleep, and eat. I constantly feel guilty for not doing enough, but can never seem to maintain the motivation to do more with my life. I have spent so much time in quarantine playing a video game that I'm pretty sure I only like because it provides me with an outlet to ""escape"". I don't want to sound dramatic, because I do have good days where I don't feel sad or bad about myself, and there are days where I feel social and I want to talk to people. I can still smile and laugh at memes on the internet and I still am able to have fun if I call my friends. But the majority of the time lately, I just see myself withdrawing from everything around me. I feel trapped in my own head. **So my question is, what does struggling with mental illness look like, versus just struggling with emotional stability? Is it the same thing?** My mother has always downplayed and dismissed my efforts to explain how I feel and has told me I just make a big deal out of nothing. I used to idolize her opinion that my perspective is so skewed I don't know myself anymore because I used to believe she knew me better than I knew myself. I also feel like the way I have always understood mental illness was that it was crippling like depression keeps people bedridden for days. I don't experience that, mostly because I'm afraid of hat my mother would say to me. 

I should also say that my sleep is pretty irregular. During middle school, I would constantly stay up past 12 as late as 2-3 am on many nights. I can't do that anymore because I get so exhausted but I used to stay up late watching youtube or procrastinating my work because I never wanted to fall asleep feeling sad.

207,"My ex has accused me of cheating on him and has taken the initiative of discussing that with my mother and sister; now they associate me with being like my father and I‚Äôm beginning to wonder when she will realize that I‚Äôm just like her. My mother is also accusing me of being physically abusive with my ex, like my father, as well. 

Let‚Äôs get this all straight: I never cheated on him; I moved all the way to Germany and missed out on a lot of my life to be with him and apparently a threesome was all it took for him to have a problem (something I thought would fulfill something we lacked in our sex-lives). He had been looking for reasons to divorce me so that he wouldn‚Äôt have to come back to America. How do I know this? Because he attempted to break up with me several times after we discussed that I was no longer happy in Germany and he kept pushing his plans into affect... he was finishing his master‚Äôs and knew he didn‚Äôt want to leave Germany. 

Now I‚Äôve left, seeing someone new and trying to figure my shit out and now, he was to play confessions, knowing how my family can be.

Pertaining to the physical violence... he and I got into a physical altercation YEARS ago. It was one of those situations where I tried to keep him restrained and he hit me, which lead to me hitting back. My intentions were to never put my hands on him at all; I saw my father put my hands on my mother and I told myself that, that wasn‚Äôt love. But my mother will never understand that I‚Äôm not my father so I won‚Äôt even bother getting into that. 

Looking back at it, the love me and my ex had was nothing but a codependency of two grown men with internalized ‚Äúdaddy issues‚Äù... almost a year later, I‚Äôm going to therapy in the morning and I‚Äôm hoping to solidify that true love, starts within myself. I also hope to convert that resentment into something positive or learn to move forward from it. I don‚Äôt want to be angry.  

I try to take on accountability for everything in my life but I‚Äôm learning how to handle the resentment and anger... I‚Äôm disappointed that I basically had to start my life over a few months ago... Deep inside, I feel like my life isn‚Äôt going anywhere and I‚Äôm scared and I feel alone... but I have goals that I‚Äôd like to attempt and it‚Äôs something I can work towards, in therapy.",06May2020,1
208,"I do not know if this is the right place to write this so tell me if I am wrong.

I wanted to find out if you guys could tell me why I dislike cowardice so much. Growing up I would always go out of my way to help people like that since I felt everything needs a helping hand, but it seemed to never stop. They would just do it over and over.

The other day I had a friend tell me he was afraid to drive his Audi because what if someone tried to steal his car (this is like the 3 time he mentioned it)... I was really annoyed hearing this. Why did he buy a car if he I so afraid to even drive it. Also why would people car to even steal his car.  its like really??

I think another reason I dislike cowardice is because I've never seen a dad that wasn't cowardly. Like even my own dad when he spoke to me couldn't look me in eye or hold a conversation. I had to guide him through the conversation when I was 7. 

I also have to lead conversations, and deal with people who can't look me in the eye all the time as well.

210,"I‚Äôll try to write this as short as possible. Basically, my little brother started having weird problems from when he was around 8. For example: He was very uncomfortable when anyone from my family crossed their arms. Then he started actually forcing me and my fam memberd to stop crossing them. It was very weird. It stopped in a few months with my parents but he is still agressive when he sees me doing it until these days. I literally cannot do it infront of him. You can say: what, he is a little kid. But like he will punch me or do literally anything from stopping me. It‚Äôs very unhealthy and my parents tried everything. Another thing is, that he REPEATS my coughing or sneezing. It was kinda funny at the beginning but he is doing it for 2 years now and it‚Äôs freaking annoying. He has problems mostly with me, another things are: when I play guitar, he shouts at me and he literally broked my door once bc of it. It‚Äôs really scary. He also has tendency to ‚Äúreturn‚Äù every touch I accidentaly give him.

He also has ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù problems with my parents, like he hates when my mum has nailpolish on and he is kinda agressive but not like when I do it. He also throwed a book at her when she said no to something.

I‚Äôm really sad he treats me this way. It‚Äôs true, that when we were young (I was about 10 and he like 4) I didn‚Äôt want to han out w him that much, you know, I had my friends over and he was like: i wanna play w u guys. It‚Äôs possible that something like this cause this. I‚Äôm also very afraid that he may be like this or even worse in the future. Now, it‚Äôs something like OCD and not a proper reaction to things but mostly in my family. it can actually turn into something bigger and I‚Äôm very scared he‚Äôll do something horrible in the future.

He has problems with controlling himself. He won‚Äôt do anything, that‚Äôs uncomfortable for him. Like he can‚Äôt work out bc it‚Äôs ‚Äúhard‚Äù and he cannot push himself. My mum always tried to keep him busy and to develop his character, but he is just too lazy.

The question I want to ask is: do you think this will get better w/o getting a therapist? Does anyone have same experience? What shall we do? I personally don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs normal. We tried talking to him 1000000 times and sometimes he refused to admit he is doing wrong things, sometimes he is genuiely sorry. He likes programmating and lego hehe. So he doesn‚Äôt really play any violent games. He is actually very handsome and cute boy, I‚Äôm just really sad he ‚Äúhates me‚Äù this much and that it‚Äôll get worser.

Also, we tried to get him into therapy, but all therapist in my city wants to take children 15+, it‚Äôs really impossible to find one, who would take care of him.",06May2020,1

I think I may have a few mental health issues, I also have asperges syndrome and type one diabetes (idk if these are relevant) I'll start with the most recent issues I've been having, over the last 5 years alot has happened to my mental state and alot of it I don't really know the reasons but I've been getting more and more anxious and parinoid about little things, like the way someone says something to me or even the way they are when im in the room can cause me to spiral into thoughts about what I've done wrong to upset them or make them angry even though there is no reason for me to think these things I still do. Almost every time walk somewhere I'm looking behind my back to see if people are behind me, there never are but I still have this feeling that I'm being followed. Another thing that is more recent is my fear of the dark has gotten so bad to the point where I always keep a light on in my room and force my self to stay awake until I physically can't anymore, I don't know why but I just get and overwhelming sense of dread that something or someone may be there. Another thing is that I have become very self aware of my existence and its driving me mental, I have to comstanly push thoughts out of my head. Sometimes I have thoughts of things that I can't explain but they just won't go away, not bad things but people or things.

214,"Ever since my last breakup I found it extremely hard to listen to any song on the topic of love (wich is like 80% of all music and 2 thirds of all my playlists). Faster pace or abstract songs are ok but slower ones, or that show love more explicitly (actually says what they did as lovers) I simply cannot stand. Even though the song is beautiful or shows hope I just can't breathe or start crying. I really hate this because I used to like many of these songs and now I can't listen to them without having a breakdown.

215,"So this is a long story being cut way down. I first typed out the whole story and it was nothing but long rambling history of me.

Basically I was born with a skin deformity, and as I grew up it it got worse and obviously made me look like an an abomination. Like clear as day, cut and dry, black and white. It's not invisible, I'm deformed. I have been my whole life. 

Yeah it's an issue, it was less of an issue when I was a teenager for relationships. because it was all quick and wasn't supposed to be anything more than some fun. Now I'm older and people my age don't want someone who looks like me. I've been told *so many* times that it's just too much. And I agree, it's horrible, I couldn't imagine waking up and seeing my partner looking like a horrible burn-victim every single morning. 

So I'm starting to get bitter about everything and go seek a counsellor. Imagine my surprise when actual Medical Treatment consists of ""Positive Thinking"". Telling me that: ""It's not that bad"", ""others have it worse than you"" or what got me the most ""Well they're just lying"". Seriously. I have an actual horrible deformed body that's been noted for my literal entire life, but no, clearly the different women I've dated were all *LIARS* about not liking a horribly deformed monster. 

What the hell? Honestly? With all the big fuss about mental health over the years I'd thought it would have gotten at least a little bit better since they sat me down and explained the horribled future I'd have when I was a 10 year old.

I go with a genuine problem - my demformity is causing me problems. I'm dressed from neck-to-toe any time I leave the house or meet someone or anything that doesn't involve me being 100% completely alone. There are no mirrors in my home, my windows are covered up, my laptop doesn't have a camera and the camera on my phone is taped off. 

I have a problem: I'm miserable because I'm deformed. I'm also lonely, which is because people can't look at my deformity. 

But when I got to see about my mental health, their solution is platitudes? What the fuck. How does meaningless garbage help me? 

They keep dragging me into a room with 2 nurses and get me to open up and talk about it and my past relationships and yet try and counter it all with stuff like ""they're just lying"" or ""just being mean"". Like, no, no they weren't. They clearly weren't. You're the one lying right now and trying to tell me to lie to myself constantly. 

They keep telling me that I'm not ""deformed"" or ""Scarred"", I'm just ""different"". I'm nearly 30 years old, get the fuck out of here with your bullshit. 

How on Earth can anyone say this nonsense is a Medical Treatment? All this CBT stuff is all the rage right now, everyone getting their heads checked out, claiming it's helping them overcome anxiety. But all they're telling me is to lie to myself and call everyone who doesn't gush over an abomition a Liar. 

How is that supposed to help anyone? I'm clearly a bitter and lonely person, trying to brainwash me into thinking I'm this beautiful person is a horrible charade. 

How is this even a remotely acceptable form of Treatment?

This is an actual trained Medical Professional.",06May2020,1

217,"Background: been with my wife 15 years, 2 kids. She knows how many people I slept with before her, but I purposely told her not to tell me about her past as I have experienced jealousy in past relationships. I knew about 3-4, including one random hookup of hers, but it never bothered me and I never thought about it. Recently, I found out about a guy she slept with 5 years before I met her, a one night stand. Ever since, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. I can‚Äôt sleep, my stomach hurts, mind racing. Her phone is linked to our shared computer, so I can see her texts and social media. I actually found out about the guy when I was using the computer and a chat with her friends about how she recently ran into the guy at Tim Horton‚Äôs, and how awkward it was. Ever since, I‚Äôve been stalking her social media, scouring her old posts, analyzing every little comment. In my head, I have her sleeping with 100s of guys, even though I logically think it‚Äôs less than 10, and fewer than my number. I need help. Anyone have any good coping techniques to stop obsessing? I don‚Äôt think I can bring it up to her because of the way I found out. Any suggestions on inoccuous conversation starters I can use to guide the subject there?

219,"im (23f) just so miserable right now. and people who i try to talk to about it assume its to do with covid19. its not. im always like this, ive just only now reached breaking point that i feel i have to bring it up to people. 

i iwsh  i could formulate what i want to say here into a nice neat reddit friendly post that isnt just an incoherent rant that people will scroll past but i honestly dont know if im capable of that. 

(im so sorry how long this turned out, i just feel really bad right now and i feel like i might burst if i dont get this out of my system somewhere.)

i find it really hard to elaborate on my problems (took me years to even acknowledge i had problems) because im not TOO anything. im maybe not the most depressed of my friends. my social anxiety isnt the worst. my grades, at school at least, were good. i had troubled sleep but i didnt want to complain to friends and family who were insomniacs. im a little lonely but probably not as much as i should be. everything SHOULD be ok. im unemployed but my parents are supporting me so i shouldnt complain there. ive even had a friend say to me after the worst year of my life where i was suicidal, 'you know, youre the only person i know who's always ok'. i even am lucky enough right now to be receiving therapy on a reduced rate, but i hardly know what to say in sessions. i almost wish someone who actually made the most of the opportunities i have had them instead of me. 

its also hard to me to explain whats wrong because everything in my mind seems so nonsensical and contradictiory. its so hard to put into words. somethings just **wrong.**

i have been told i seem like i could have aspergers or adhd but its ONLY just come up in the past year or so. the idea that i might be able to find some community, or label, or treatment, or resource, that would help me understand and tidy up my head makes me want to weep with joy. but i have no diagnosis so i may well not be. even if i am, the waiting list to see a specialist is god knows how long. and HEY even if i do see someone, and get the magical diagnosis that i seek, obviously that wont make my problems go away. there is no relief in sight, just continued exhaustion and confusion no matter what happens. 

even short term solutions like talking to friends and family, or trying to find solutions and community in other places (such as reddit) dont seem to ever work out, a fact which makes me feel even more confused and disconnect from reality than ever. i try to explain to someone how i feel and they just dont get it, or i clearly dont articulate it well and they misunderstand, or they make it about them, or they just ignore me. that is, if i ever actually manage to voice my thoughts. more often i just sit there with my mouth slightly open, trying to formulate words that accurately convey what i mean, until the other person gets bored or frustrated and i get too self conscious to keep trying. its miserable. i just cant stop thinking about all different ideas and possibilities in my head, what to say, the repurcussions of what i could say. 

pretty much every time i try to decide on anything, my mind starts trying to draw up a decision tree and follow it all the way back, desperately trying to reduce uncertainty and figure out 'the best approach'. but pretty quickly i get overwhelmed and my mind just goes blank (to put in programming parlance, it very much reminds me of a 'maximum recursion depth' error. my brain is doing too many operations and i run out of memory and so freeze completely). one of the only things that helps me at all at the moment is writing down every thought or concern in my head just to get them out and stop them buzzing around like a bunch of nasty cooped up wasps.  but even doing that is difficult. say im sat on my bed. i feel overwhelmed. i need to write down my thoughts. i get up. should i write on my phone, laptop, or a notebook? phone is the hardest to type with and flows least well, and i dont know which app to pick. for my laptop ill need to seek out the appropriate document format to write into, and my laptop is slow. or i could write in a notebook. but what if someone finds it? do i need to be self conscious of what i write? great now im worried about that. should i use a pen or a pencil? where should i start? is what i am writing down making sense? does it matter? does my spelling matter? etc. 

i know thats weird but i cant help it. my mind just spirals out of control. i give the impression generally of someone who is reasonably functional, i do chores, i cook, i went to university, i even had a job once. these were and are really difficult for me, as i am almost always exhausted and overwhelmed, but i just try to suck it up and get better because as far as i can tell, theres no place for me in the world if i dont. i want to be a nice person but the exhaustion that comes from potentially confusing social exchanges can make me irritable, so i withdraw. i want to be smart and independant, but often i just want to coddle myself, and sit about watching childrens cartoons or something, because the anxiety that comes with challenging myself, and worrying about potential failure, and just generally finding focusing AT ALL extremely tiring (i havent mentioned the attention span so much as the anxiety thing but god, i cannot get myself to focus on studies and i have tried. so. hard.) is too much to bear and makes me feel literally ill or close to panic attacks quite often. so yeah. i do the bare minimum. the house is always messy enough to bother me but its not DISGUSTING. my grades are bad but i havent COMPLETELY failed. although ive been close, and have failed university modules multiple times. i honestly think itd be cruel of me to elaborate more on that, because i have written far too much already. but people in my life still assume im smart and doing well, because for some reason i cant tell them (or cant convincingly tell them) otherwise. they just think im being modest. 

i dont see a positive future ahead of me despite on paper to others looking like im doing fine. ive never been a particularly happy person (i realised recently ive pretty much always had a low mood, i just thought it was normal, and that happy people were lying or exaggerating or something). everything is so difficult and there seems to be no reward, break or respite, even for someone like me who really cant point to any external sources for my problems. i feel so strongly that ive almost managed to convince myself im objectively right, that life is not good and never will be. im not gonna do anything about that. im not suicidal. im just resigned, and tired. ive been struggling with these issues for a while now, talking to a doctor, getting anti depressants, getting therapy, and i am still the same me with the same problems. my self esteem if anything is crashing lower and lower with each moment, and the doubts i have about the possibility of me succeeding, getting a job, gaining indepedence,  just seem rational. my mindset is informed by the general trend of my life. yes i have had some successes. ive even been told i could be very successful before, back when i was capable of functioning in school and i was supposedly intelligent. but life has proven to me that that particular academic intelligence i may have had counts for nothing when you cant focus or motivate yourself to save your life.  its weird because last week i was actually in a decent mood, i was studying, exercising, reading, quite successfully. but i cant keep it up. forcing myself to be that person just makes me crash worse (like now). actually right before writing this post i was just trying to study but felt sick and couldnt focus AT ALL so, here i am. 

if you read this, or frankly even scrolled down to the bottom of, or hell even clicked on this post. thanks. you deserve a medal. and if you have anything positive to say i would appreciate it very much. theres still so much in my head that i need to get out but im running out of steam and this is so long im already tempted to just delete it all. ultimately, i feel crazy, and it seems like nothing and no one can help.",06May2020,1

222,"I think I have a unique situation here and I need help. I dated a guarded girl for 9 months (guarded as in, super hard to open up, never needs anyone in her life, scared of being hurt type of girl). We broke up last September and yes I do miss her a lot still, but that doesn‚Äôt really matter right now. Now, I wouldn‚Äôt call her mentally ill because she‚Äôs a healthy and normal girl in high school that does her schoolwork and sports. But in the inside she has trouble expressing her feelings and has never opened up about her inner emotions to her family or friends. She has a wall where she shows a different personality on the outside to people, where in the inside she is insecure and has trouble expressing herself, she keeps all her problems to herself and never lets anyone know of her struggles.

Anyways, from past experiences, I‚Äôm worried about her. She has done harm to herself before, and I (her ex) is the only person who knows this. Her family has no idea of her problems, and her friends do not either. Ever since this quarantine started, her friends have told me that she has not been talking much to anyone, just staying in her house and doing schoolwork. 

I want to ask her how she is doing and if she‚Äôs in a good state of mind, but being her ex, every time I send her a snap or text, it‚Äôs either a short response (obviously annoyed) or no reply. Does anyone have any thought on what I can do? I understand that talking to an ex is usually a bad idea, but I do not think this is an ordinary situation. I have no intentions of getting back with her, all I want is for her to be happy and safe. I care about her deeply and feel the responsibility of letting her know that I‚Äôm there for her.

223,"I can‚Äôt remember when this started, but I think that as I got older and met more people who has been sent places and takes medication, it reminds me of my very first suicide attempt, and how no one ever reacted.

The reason to why I dislike being with them is because if I know that they take medication or has been sent somewhere, it‚Äôs the only thing that is going to go through my mind, it‚Äôs the only thing I‚Äôll think about when I‚Äôm with said person.

I think it has something to do with jealousy. As someone with a lot of mental health problems, 2 suicide failed attempts and 5 years of screaming for help without any reactions from anyone, it hurt to see people who are actually getting help.

I‚Äôve never had a therapist, I‚Äôve never had medication, I‚Äôve never been sent anywhere, the only thing that has ever happened is that I got a simple meeting with a psychiatrist, maybe my problems aren‚Äôt valid? Maybe that‚Äôs why no one has ever reacted.

Why is everyone else getting help and being sent places to be protected, what have I done wrong? Are my problems really valid?

Can someone please please please tell me how to get rid of this jealousy, I want to be able to be with people without having these thoughts..

224,"So my friends mom or now ex friends Ig her mom was very rude to me and a few of our other friends. (My friend had BPD btw) anyway I her mom forced me away. She‚Äôs tried multiple times but I tried my hardest to stay because I didn‚Äôt wanna leave and deal with the stress of hurting my friend, being hated by so many people, having rumours spread and losing multiple other friends. One night me and 2 others from our group were talking. And her mom started freaking out at me and obviously the others knew because they could see my face and I‚Äôm a very sensitive person so it‚Äôs very very obvious when I‚Äôm upset. And anyway my friends mom knew we were talking. So she started freaking out at the other one. She was calling me names and making stuff up as usual. Then the one of my friends her mom wasn‚Äôt freaking out asked her if she could stop then she got mad at all of us and told us to leave. She made stuff up about me to the others in our group and piper. Which hurt. And I sent paragraphs apologizing to everyone. One day me and her daughter were talking and then all of a sudden she lashed out and just left. So I was like ok maybe I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong it‚Äôs ok since she always randomly lashes out because it‚Äôs apart of BPD mood swings. So I didn‚Äôt take it personally. Only when her basically sister came on and was blaming things on me. I tried not to beat myself up to much over that. Past few nights she‚Äôs been freaking out at me every single night saying stuff like it‚Äôs my fault, telling me the rumours her mom made up, saying things that me and my sister said that we never even would say and saying I‚Äôm as bad as her abusers. Which really hurts and obviously I took that. Yesterday she also sent multiple cutting pictures, she cut my initials into her body and dropped by my house and left a jar of her blood. You kinda can‚Äôt not feel upset and bad after that. I‚Äôm trying to not hurt myself over this. But when she‚Äôs freaking out at me it‚Äôs hard not to. And I‚Äôm very impulsive so if I get a thought sometimes I don‚Äôt even think before I do it at all. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a good or bad idea it‚Äôs like ok I‚Äôll do it. And she encourages me too which doesn‚Äôt help. Ik this is just because she‚Äôs upset but it hurts and I hate that I hurt her. It isn‚Äôt my fault that any of this happened and Ik that but her blaming me makes me feel so bad. I wish I could just make her happy but she won‚Äôt even talk to me normally. I asked if she‚Äôs ok earlier because yesterday she kept telling me she‚Äôs khs. She replied ‚Äúfuck you I hate you‚Äù ‚Äúwhy would you ask that‚Äù ‚Äúyk that I‚Äôll never be ok from what you did to me‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy are you even alive‚Äù and Ik she genuinely feels like that and hates me. She said before she even wants me to kms when she‚Äôs in a good mood. She was in a good mood before she texted me and still replied with that. So it isn‚Äôt only because she‚Äôs upset.

225,"I have noticed in myself that I like to be neutral about many things and not have strong opinions, at least publicly. That's  because of several reasons. 
1.I believe the more extremist/strong views you have, the more irrational you are. 
2.I am also scared of having different views than someone close to me because from my experience people are oversensitive and react strongly to differences in opinion. They may even start hating you if you even slightly oppose their worldview. And I don't like social rejection. 
3.It makes me sad when I sit with people and they express their often irrational, hateful and often uninformed views. I would rather sit quietly than argue with them. Many people have accused me of being too moderate and without any personal views and that's far from the case. I just don't like conflict. 
4.I feel like in today's world people are very divided and blindly support ideologies/religions/art/music/people/idols/books/authors/ without assessing things rationally and knowing where to draw the line. On the Internet especially, but in real life too. 
5. Everytime I go out anywhere, people start talking about politics and ideologies and maybe that's just my culture but I am sick of it. Yes, people should talk about it but in this day and age people get overly sensitive about that kind of stuff and can't even have a good time. They forget that they are people and are obsessed. with their ideological identities. Liberal, conservative, feminist, mgtow, traditional, progressive whatever. I don't remember a single day where I wasn't thinking about a certain ideology or why people think the way they do. Maybe I should get off the Internet for a while lol. 

Is this just my perception, am I maybe the oversensitive one? Am I overly politically correct because of fear or is the world really more conflicted today when it comes to ideologies? I feel like everyone strongly identifies with something and we all hate each other secretly. 


TL;DR how do I become more free in expressing my views in a world where everyone is so different and sensitive and there are so many ideologies?",06May2020,1
226,"pardon my English, but l have to get this off my chest. l'm 26 now and l can't forget the bullying l had 10 years ago. l got bullied in middle school and high school l got sexual harassment as a guy and always got hit on my face l was coward and never took a stand for myself my self-esteem is 0% because of this and that effected my grades at school l wasn't able to graduate from high school because of bullying and l bet that the ones who used to bully me having a decent job and forgot completely about me and l'm the one who got shitty job (will get fired soon due covid19) and keep remembering their doing to me. l keep asking myself why l didn't stand against them why l didn't fight back why my academic life ruined because of them? l'm just keep crying inside. l keep trying to be a warrior but those negative thoughts always find ways into my brain.

227,"a few weeks ago or whenever it was I went through a  mental breakdown, can i even say that?  I was ready, crying my eyes out repeating the words I want to die. Feeling like I was drowning in pain, my emotional pain turned into a physical one where i got a migraine. I keep having these explosive moments too often, it builds up and then i breakdown and tell myself i can't do it anymore. well this past week or so, I didn't feel actively suicidal in fact i didn't have any urges to kill myself. I woke up fine, I wasn't happy or motivated but i was just fine. I went about a week like that i'm still currently in that state, I don't know if it had anything to do with the crazy amount of ginger tea and water i've been drinking or spending time at the trail soaking up the sun for a few hours. to be honest i didn't like it, the state of being fine. Am I crazy? Just about 2 weeks ago i was in so much emotional pain contemplating suicide for no reason, and now that i'm out of that state, why do i miss being depressed? 

&amp;#x200B;

I realized that being in a depressed state was weirdly my comfort zone. When i was ""fine"" I Felt out of place like what am i supposed to do now that i'm not suicidal. So many things are contingent on me being suicidal. For example how am I suppose to finish school, make plans to travel, or other big plans when I don't even know if I'm going to be alive next year, or in a few months, weeks ect???.  Now that I am more aware of my hereditary mental illness I know that without medical intervention I will never be able to complete a goal. So guess what until I can get that help I don't attempt to enroll myself into classes or make big plans with people bc at some point i will hit a wall where I am a hair strand away from killing myself. So when I feel ""FINE"" what does that mean for me, it changes everything I start to feel all these things that I want to start doing now! but I remember i can't cause i'll have an episode and end up dropping out or canceling ect. Also being alone with my negative thoughts and emotions feels like this dark toxic blanket where I can close my eyes and forget about all my worries and dream of a place where I will soon feel nothing.",06May2020,1

229,"So I really don't know how to talk about mental health issues as i've always kept everything to myself and I don't know if this even is the right place for this. But here goes nothing.

So let me make this clear, nothing is medically diagnosed and I hate to self diagnose myself but for the sake of driving this forward i'll just come out and open up about my thoughts on what I have. I most likely have depression. 

I've heard the same ""diagnosis"" from my mom, sister, girlfriend, multiple friends, classmates have talked about how down I am all the time, my teachers have tried talking with me and at a recent health check up earlier this year a doctor told me I wouldn't be fit to join the army because of my mental health. Keep in my mind that was just a health check up and he got that from talking with me for 30min to 1h.

Basically everyone I just listed has told me to get some help to talk and open up. The thing is I don't want to talk. I honestly feel like that there are people more in need of that kind of help than I am. Like I have bottled everything up until now so why change that? But recently I have gotten just so much more exhausted and unmotivated to do anything. I just want to be as happy as my friends seem to.

Some background info:
I haven't had anything tragic happen in my life which makes it weird to think I would have mental health issues.
In grade 5 I got caught trying to choke myself with a rope which caused me to spend couple months in a place that haused other troubled kids (I don't know what it is called in English)
Grade 7 I got caught cutting myself, after that haven't done anything.
I have alot of sleep problems, as a matter of fact I am writing this at 2am.
I used to have a ton of friends but after grade 7 I just lost the will to keep people around me anymore and keeping in contact became really difficult and exhausting.",06May2020,1
230,"It's become quite aware to me lately that I struggle immensely to describe my emotions to others and even myself. I don't know what I feel, or if I'm even feeling anything (if that makes sense). I don't discuss my feelings with any of my close friends, and very little with my SO. When my SO asks what's wrong, I feel like I lose the ability to even talk. I've recently been thinking that my inability to express my emotions is due to emotional neglect (or maybe even emotional abuse) from my parents. I really want to get better at talking about and feeling my emotions because I fear that I'm distancing myself from my SO and I don't want to screw things up. I don't feel ready for therapy, especially due to coronavirus and insurance issues.",06May2020,1

234,"I'm taking 8 different medications at this moment and I feel like they aren't doing a damn thing. I still am feeling cripling depression and fear/anxiety that is barely bearable. I've carried many diagnosis over the year that include: GAD, HPPD ( which stop doing drugs and time healed it ), panic disorder, bipolar disorder. And I don't even know which are true this day anymore. The current meds are:
Lithium (1200mg)
Propanolol (40 mg)
Buspirone (90 mg )
Mirtazapine (15 mg)
Trifluoperazine (10 mg)
Pregabalin (450 mg) 
Alprazolam (0,625 mg) 
Bromazepam ( 30 drops )
And I will schedule another psychiatrist at the first opportunity. All I wanna know if there's any physical danger on going off all of this, because I wanna feel who I really am.
I'll keep the alprazolam because I know it's dangerous going off of it. And trifluoperazine because I feel it's the only one that truly helps.",06May2020,1

236,"hi

i did something im terribly ashamed of: its nothing bad or that caused anyone harm, really. long story short, a few months back i guess out of boredom i downloading a dating app and well, sxted with a (considerably much much older) stranger. after the thing i felt repulsed and made sure to delete everything.

everything was ok then, a few days back: honestly, out of nowhere, i talked to this person again with the same intent, and it happened again. i felt repulsed again but

 i feel like i dont have any power of will. im incredibly anxious now, i feel ashamed, dissapointed w myself, paranoid about being discovered, or having pics shared online that someone can recognize, or that it will haunt me in the future. i feel gross, depressed and can't seem to do anything without it reminding me of what i did.  
i don't (and won't ever) talk about it to someone i know out of fear of repulsion or dissapointment. i can't look at my family or friends in the eyes. i feel like i have jeopardized my future and crushed my dreams out of something so stupid.

how can i forget about this, move on, and feel like this will never matter, when i all feel is paranoid, and completely doomed?  


i cant deal with this

237,"Hi, so I know a lot of us are struggling at the moment. I guess I'm just writing this because I don't think anyone in my house will understand.

So I posted a little about this before, but I was supposed to start CBT just before the pandemic hit in around March / April. I was going to be treated for OCD, intrusive and negative thoughts and behavioural stuff. As of right now I just feel like I'm going to burst any day now. I've already been called irrational, silly, emotional, etc. And the self loathing is just getting worse everyday, I guess I just really need some advice from people going through similar things?

Thank you, I hope you're doing better than me.",06May2020,1
238,"So a year ago, I went through an experience that ultimately mentally and emotionally hurt me. I was in a public setting when this happened. After that said experience, whenever I passed by the place I would begin to experience extreme anxiety &amp; panic. I‚Äôm talking shortness of breath, increase in heart rate, nausea &amp; physical hand trembling. I would have to mentally prepare myself or stop to recollect myself if I were to pass by or visit this place. It physically, mentally &amp; emotionally would hurt me to have to go here. 

Whenever I talked to my friends about it they would say it was PTSD. But when I think of this I think of people who have gone through much more traumatic experiences. 

Is this just my anxiety acting up? 

Now a year later, I will have to visit this place often once again. &amp; I am scared I‚Äôm not mentally and emotionally strong enough to revisit the place. Even thinking about it triggers my anxiety. I‚Äôve never experience anything like this before. Please, any comments or suggestions is greatly appreciated.",06May2020,1

240,"I FINALLY GOT MY BACHELORS DEGREE! I am 22 years old and just graduated from IU. But let me tell the backstory.. when I was 17 and in high school I was in a very abusive relationship. He was very controlling and abusive and pressured me into sex when I didn‚Äôt want to and wanted to wait for marriage. He ended up getting me pregnant and decided to keep the baby. We have not been together for almost three years. He is not really in my sons life and is a deadbeat. High school was TERRIBLE. It was the worst experience of my life, being pregnant in high school and the whole town knowing. Fast forward, I go to IU a year after community college when my son was one year old. I also suffered from PPD and was taking care of my son without his fathers help. While at IU, I got sexually assaulted three times, was in a very emotionally abusive/toxic relationship, my grandparents died in a house fire on my birthday, had undiagnosed ADHD (didn‚Äôt get diagnosed until a month ago at the end of my senior year), and took care of my son at the same time. The last five years of my life have been HELL. I just took my last final and texted my family in a group message and told my family I just took my last final at IU and the only response I got out of six people was ‚Äúgood‚Äù from one person. This was terribly upsetting to me. I have been going sooo hard for so long and the only thing I get is a ‚Äúgood‚Äù? I was upset and mentioned this to my family and they started yelling at me and my dad said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just stressed out.‚Äù And I‚Äôm like no I am not, I am just upset because I expected more than that. My mom, being the one that replied, started yelling at me as well saying I was taking it deeper than what it was. My dad then starts yelling at me even more and kept saying ‚Äúwhy would I give you a compliment when you‚Äôre just asking for it.‚Äù Like WTF. All I was expecting was an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so proud of you!!‚Äù Or something like that but instead I am being yelled at. I feel like complete shit. I have never been so disappointed in my life. My family has messed me up so badly in the head right now. Is it wrong to be this upset? I haven‚Äôt stopped crying for the past hour and I haven‚Äôt spoken to them since",06May2020,1
