0,"I am just gonna keep things short...

1. I've always experienced many episodes of depression throughout my whole life, and the cycle repeats itself every few years. I would heal, get depressed, heal again, get depressed more, and on and on. The current one is getting unbearable.
2. I had a few dates and they all went pretty well. I've been seeing this guy for about 3 months now and after he told me that we were moving too fast, it seems as though he is no longer interested in me anymore. (I am still closeted so nobody else knows that I'm gay.) What can I say, jokes on me... I am deeply hurt. We are still in contact because I love him so much, but I don't think he knows. 
3. I no longer have any friends after graduating from college. I wasn't the the typical ""nerd"" who had no friends to begin with; in fact, I had friends, and I had everything I needed to have in a typical normalcy, but I guess everything just fell apart when I began to develop self-destructive behaviors to cut off everybody. (I don't know why and how, I believe it's due to my inherent insecurities.) I am just tired of pretending to act social. 
4. I've lost my interest in just about everything. Playing video games, playing music, working out, singing... are no longer fun to do. nOW I just lay in my bed all day contemplating about what I had done wrong as a human being and why couldn't I fix myself to get back on my feet.
5. My family and I are distant, both emotionally and physically. They're all the way back in New York and I am here in Los Angeles. Don't get me wrong, I love them to death, but because of childhood experiences, I've never told them any of my personal matters as I believe that to  falling back on them is to ask for severe reprimands. I feel trapped.
6. The only thing that keeps me at bay and busy as of now is my job. I am a software engineer at a well known corporate but I'm starting to lack motivation in  working as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how can anybody live like this honestly. 

I am lonely and sad. I have the money but none of those things make life interesting to live. I am literally boring myself to death.

1,"Quick tw for some people I'm going to be talking about depression and anxiety (also ADHD if that applies I'm not sure)

Also, disclaimer I've never used Reddit before so I am very, VERY new to this.

Since I've gotten back from college I feel like my mental health has taken a big blow and I don't really know how to handle it. I've always had trouble with mental health/disabilities but I can't remember a time when it has been this bad. 

Second semester started amazing and then everything went off the rails over spring break. March 7th I took off with my softball team to go and play in Florida and I thought everything was going to be so perfect. A few days in we started hearing word of schools near ours going remote for the remainder of the spring semester as a precaution. I did not think much of it. We soon found out that our school would be going remote as well but that the spring sports would continue with no spectators allowed. That changed within probably 2 days when our coaches gathered us at their rental house to break the news that spring season would not continue after we got back from Florida. Naturally, we all broke down crying and I really haven't been the same since that moment. I took it really hard. My first ever college softball season is being taken away from me and I'm devastated. 

Since I've been home I've just been getting worse and worse but I just chalked it up to just being my lazy self. I've been home for a few weeks now and very rarely do I leave my bed, if I do its to see if we have food. I went on TikTok a lot and saw a lot of TikToks about other college kids doing the same thing so I again thought it was normal. Because of my ADHD I've always had trouble doing assignments but recently I just can't seem to do anything. Not just assignments but video games, TV shows, youtube videos nothing is fun anymore. I can't find anything to occupy my time with that I actually enjoy.

I didn't notice how big my shift in behavior really was until my mom started to ask me if I was ok. I assumed it was her usual polite inquiry but whenever I'd answer good she'd ask are you sure. That had me thinking why she asked and that's when I started to notice my actions more. They've just gotten progressively worse as the days go on. Today was by far the worst because I actually got up a few times to go do something (which is a big deal) and every time I tried something to make me happier it just wouldn't work. I actually took a shower for the first time in a few days (gross but I feel its relevant). I also did some research and took a few self-assessments online and they all pointed to serious depression. I didn't think I was actually that bad until it asked me those questions. Anxiety has been keeping me awake every night until 2-3 am. 

I would also like to say that the only thing I've actually been diagnosed with that I mentioned in this post is ADHD.  (there's your token disclaimer folks)

The bottom line is I don't know how to get better. I obviously don't want to go make a doctor's appointment right now and I need tips on how to handle it. Advice is very much welcome and thank you in advance if you reply.",06Apr2020,2
2,"So I’ve been digging through my memories to find out why I am so mentally damaged and ruined to this day, and what happened.

3,"I missed another deadline for a job I wanted. Been unemployed for over a year. Have been looking after someone straight after graduating and now I feel like I'm too far behind. I didn't get just any job. It's not that I felt they were below me. I felt like I was running on empty. Ive been working since I was a teenager. Mostly earning half the minimum wage even in 20s. I have no savings. It was either taken from me or expected that I cover debts when my parents lost all they're money. 

I spent almost a year doing nothing and barely seeing friends since 2018. I'm broke so I couldn't go anywhere. It's my fault. I took on responsibilities I felt my family was neglecting. Im not even sure if I did the right thing.

My friends are really nice. They pity me, I can tell. I have nothing to contribute to relationships. They're all moving on with they're lives and they trying to help me move forward. But I just feel like a weight on them. The more they try the worse I feel.

I've forgotten how to hold a conversation. I haven't been in a relationship in over 10 years. Ive woken  every morning for over year wanting to end it all. I won't, because there are certain people who won't understand. I know that sounds like a cop out. I tried once as a teen, but I won't again because I don't want to pass these feelings on to someone  else.

I wish I could feel like I was living for me. I'm stuck.",06Apr2020,1

5,"Posting this on a throwaway account because the people involved with my main one might see it otherwise.  


I'm a 22 year old Male and over the past 6-7 years, I have developed an awful system that traps me in an unhealthy cycle that I have no idea how to break. I do not currently have access to professional help and all the support groups I tried didn't end up doing anything for me.   


In a normal, everyday state I feel almost nothing but apathy about myself. I feel for myself as much as I feel about a random stranger on the street. If I see them struggle, I go ""shame"" but keep moving. And I treat myself the same way. I had a lot of issues at home as a kid but was never able to voice them anywhere for a few reasons. And over the course of time, I really did not want to voice them anymore because I stopped caring about myself in that way.  


The only reason I still keep my body relatively healthy and my mind quick is because I care about others so much. Especially my friends and family and my amazing girlfriend. But that is also where the problem is. I only really live for them and not for myself because I just can't feel anything about myself. No like or dislike, just apathy.   


Recently, my girlfriend tried to coax me to speak more about my past or any problem I encouner during the day really but that is where the second part of my system snaps in place. Whenever this general state of apathy about myself gets disturbed, either by accident or on purpose, I instantly dissociate right then and there and feel absolutely nothing anymore. No physical touch, no pain, no stress but also all the affection for my family, friends and even my girlfriend is gone. I become absolutely hollow and numb for around 1-8 hours.   


Right now, I just came out of one of these cycles and I can see how frustrated and hurt my girlfriend is. I really just need anyone to give me some opinions about what I can do. If I don't care about myself and let the apathy reign, my body starts to suffer and sustain injuries and if no one is around to please, I cease to do anything until there is someone again. But if I do care about myself (or try to), my body forcibily shuts down all emotions and feelings and leaves me as a numb shell.   


Doesn't matter if it is advise, help or just opinions but I know something has to change so i'm ready for anything",06Apr2020,1

7,"Yes, I know it may sound harsh, but some of you may relate to this without even knowing it.
I still remember my parents LITERALLY pulling me from both my hands(my mom pulling one of my hands towards her and my the other way around) fighting over who I belong to which may have been my first trauma (at 4 years old), I remember my mom’s mental breakdowns, she went to the store, bought a packet of cigarettes, bought one beer and sat at the balcony crying and then coming inside the house and yelling at me and my brother for not doing some chore (this used to happen when I was 7-10 approximately). I tried to kill myself in class because I yelled at my teacher (I was a stupid kid) and I knew she would call my mom which would lead to her screaming at me and telling me she’s gonna send me to live with my father (she basically threatened me and still does every time I do something, even for the smallest thing) so I guess I thought the smart move would be to kms before it happens. From 7th grade-11th grade (now) my mom moved to a different technique. Every time we get into an argument and I speak up and say something (that’s most likely correct) she becomes the victim, she presents herself as a poor 50 year old lady whose life was way too hard (and they were, she had cancer, my father used to beat her and etc.) and that I torment her and that I hate her, basically she thinks everything revolves around her. The way she scarred me and my brother for life is so sad to me. My brother developed anger issues and is dealing with them now (he’s 22), he too, tried to kill himself when he served in the army (my mom kicked him out of the house). I developed anxiety from years and years of mental abuse. Every time I get near my Mom I get anxious, when we argue I get anxiety attacks and than my depression kicks in, every time I feel depressed, my mom notices it and says I can control it. I’m honestly fed up.
But the point of this post is to show our generation how crucial parenting is for your children’s mental health. Don’t bring kids into this world if you’re not ready for them mentally.",06Apr2020,1

I believe these things because of how I feel physically throwing up everyday and feeling generally horrific. But my mind also plays a massive part. For years I’ve suffered with anxiety, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and hypochondria. Maybe it’s my mind playing tricks or maybe it aint. More recently I had an experience where out of no where just at random, something came over my throat like a sensation would but it was uncomfortable very uncomfortable, it’s left me over the last few days believing that somehow, a part of my skull I’ve been prodding at and felt like a crushed crisp has made its way to the back of my throat and is lodged there. Crazy right? That’s what I’m convinced of I’m convinced I’m going to die because of my head, I’m convinced part of my skull is stuck in my throat. This is how my head works. Do I need a psychiatrist?

Including some serious introspection. I have always lived in my head, but recently, it's really, in my opinion, better than dealing with people. I use to feel so much empathy for others, going out on limbs all over the place. ""You need a car? Here, use mine."" ""You need money? I have some extra saved up, pay me back whenever."" ""You need xyz? Here, I'll help in any way I can."" And, without fail, each and every one of these people really just screwed me over, in some of the worst possible ways. And recently, after a coworker did the same right before quarantine, I thought: fuck it. fuck them. fuck literally everyone. Need help? Do it your goddamn self. Need someone to use their AAA miles to tow your car? Good luck, sis. 

I'm now perfectly happy saying less that 50 words a day. Seeing no one. Talking to no one. Dealing with no one. Knowing that there is no one that has any power over me. And I'm done. 

Humans are social creatures. So, it kind of dawned on me, is this normal behavior? Is it symptomatic of an antisocial disorder? (would it help if I threw in working in customer service for years?)

16,"Hey,

so about 3 months ago I went to my family doc to check out my blood values because I feel like having no energy since being a kid. I was always told that it is because I hit puberty and that it will go away someday (children's doc then). So now, many years later, I still feel like doing nothing. The blood values were all fine so the doc told me that mental health problems may be the cause. I would tend to say that I am relatively ok right now, even when some things happened in the past. For example there was an accident in 2012 which costed my little brother's (he was 5) and nearly my mom's life (coma, now well recovered). My dad was since I can remember an alcoholic (non-abusive) and stopped drinking 2-3 years ago. Also we lived in poverty my whole life (even besides all these things I get really well with my parents). All of this things don't seem to bother me (I only get sensitive if my brother is being brought up). And there are things that may seem silly in comparison but those things bother me really bad. Like my receding hairline, my acne or the fact that I don't have any close friends.

I don't what I should do. I don't feel like going to a psychologist and I probably never will. This post even may be a rant. Idk.",06Apr2020,1
17,"So my girlfriend has struggled with depression her whole life. This has been coupled with drug addiction as for a long time that has been the only thing she thinks makes her happy. Shes recently come to the realisation that this isnt making her truly happy and shes finding it really hard to find any sort of meaning or fulfulment in life. She started councilling a few weeks before the corona outbreak and it went AMAZING. She finds it really hard to open up to anybody and for the session she asked me to go in with her because she felt she wouldn't be able to open up. I expected it to be me speaking for the whole session giving the councillor everything I know about her situation but boy was I wrong. She instantly opened up to this woman straight away and I was over the moon with excitement about it. It seemed so perfect she even said herself she could'nt believe how open she was being. Then this corona thing happened and it's got a bit shit again. We spent the first part of the lockdown (we're in the uk) together at her house and it was great. The thought of being locked inside didn't matter because we had each other. Now im at my parents house the thought of spending months apart is horrible for the both of us. We've decided to ignore the government guidlines slightly (and the views of our parents lol) for the benefit of our mental health and meet in Bristol where we both attend university to spend the rest of the lockdown together. I wish we could start councilling again with this woman however I don't think that's going to be a possibility. We have asked her to do a video councilling session however I'm not sure if that will be as good for my girlfriend but it's worth a try. I'm so fucking extremely worried about her I just want her to get better, it sucks so much that she started to make great strides in getting better and this shitty virus has fucked it all up.

The main point of this post however is because she has just sent me a message and asked for my advice and I wanted to ask the people of reddit for their advice too. I have told her the advice that I can give which is basically take an hour once a day to chillout. Use part of that time to meditate with the headspace app but mainly focus on taking a break from these thoughts and emotions to try and take a step back from it all.

Here's what she sent me anyway, If you guys have any advice that can kind of work in the moment to help feel okay while all this is going on in her head that would be great. and apologies if i don't reply instantly. Thanks in advance

I’ve visited a doctor, they didn’t have much to say other than “I might have anxiety”. I’m pretty young so I’m just really confused what it might be, I was wondering if anyone has heard something like this?

19," 

For starters what exactly is depression? What EXACTLY makes it depression. Everyone gets sad at points in their life and for a good reason. If theres no reason to being sad is it depression? If there is a reason does it not? I have never really understood exactly what depression is and how to know if you have it.

2nd question. Whenever i get angry i cannot calm down unless i feel pain. Anywhere in my body hands, feet, legs or head. I have to give myself pain for anger to stop. I normally just hit myself in the legs a few times and its over. If i dont i will be angry until I do it. Why do I do this? and what can i do to not do it? I have done it since i was a child and i used to run into doors head 1st because i was too weak to cause any other pain when i was angry. Now i have grown up and got stronger I can hurt other areas of my body that will not cause as much damage.

3rd question. Randomly out of nowhere a few times a week i get the urge to just hit myself for no reason. Nothing brings it on i could be watching tv, playing games and all of a sudden i get this urge to hit/slap myself. I can stop myself but sometimes the urge is too great. This has only started happening recently which made me come here and ask all of this because im just like wtf. I know theres a reason for everything else but theres no reasoning behind this.

Few notes for context:

I am not suicidal, I am insanely scared of dieing to the point i got myself into a month of not being able to sleep well as i kept thinking about dieing and not being anymore. I could never take my own life. That shit be too valuable to me.

I have never cut or harmed myself in a way that could possible cause death because reason above.

I am a man, 18 from the UK.

When i was a sophomore i did the same thing, and now i have severe body confidence issues and i dont want her to permanently ruin her relationship with her body and food like i did.

Ive been telling her to eat and serving her normal portions of food, but as soon as i turn my back she scoops the food back. Shes just so stubborn and defensive. Theres a history of BPD in our family and although shes undiagnosed we're all pretty sure she has it too. She lashes out whenever we mention anything about how little shes eating.

The things is, all I want to do now is to learn art, music, dance, read, sing and enjoy all these things that I always dreamed of doing but that I never had time or support to do. I don't want to get a job (I would like to build my own business, but I don't want a normal 9-5 job), and I just want to learn new things and take a sort of gap year enjoying my hard earned peace of mind - am I being lazy?

I understand this post might be a little confusing and all over the place, I guess what I am trying to say is: can I take a gap year just learning arts and building a business?

31,"Sorry if this isn’t the place for this sort of question, but someone close to me was recently involuntarily admitted. They called me on Friday to let me know they were admitted and said they’d be calling while they were in there but I haven’t heard from them since. I know it’s only been two days, but I’m kind of anxious and apprehensive about texting them because someone else has their phone if they’re still in the hospital. When in the the hospital, is there a limit to your phone calls and when you can make them? I’m just a little bit worried

Also, what is the process for being involuntarily admitted? I know there’s a 72 hour thing I’m not super clear on, but I’ve been reading it could take longer. Thanks",06Apr2020,1

33,"Hi guys. 

Basically i live with my abusive parents (they punch and treat me like trash for the smallest mistake ever)

im 25 yo. (yes im old) and i have 2 other siblings (both are treated better). im a boy yet feminine hence why i assume they treat me like that. 

i want to live on my own but i have some problems.

1. expensive to live alone (i work minimum wage)
2. i dont like that my other siblings lives will be much more easier. basically all money and properties my parents have will go to them.

HELP.

i want to proceed to medicine to get a higher salary after that i could finally leave. but i need to get scholarship first in order to do that.

now if i dont get any scholarships, i kinda want to start a business but im not sure if i like that idea for the following reasons.

1. in business you need reliable people, hence a family but that wont happen with me.

also you might be thinking if why not just start a family. i have the following reasons.

1. expensive.
2. im feminine and i think im asexual.

I don’t really know where to begin. Im turning 30 this year, parents pay for everything and nothing is getting any better only worse. I havent met anyone apart from drive through cashiers for over a month now. Mainly due to the covid stuff, but all i did before was stay home until someone forced me to go to the pub, where i would get blind drunk. The next day i wake up with bad anxiety and want to kms. The one time i actually went down to the psych emergency they locked me up and brought in a security guard to escort me. Finished therapy for social phobia but it doesnt feel like it did much. All my friends are doing drugs to a certain degree, which has caused me to distance myself from them as much as possible. I dont have much self control and the only thing keeping me from completely fucking my life up is that i am too scared to ask people for drugs. I used to smoke alot of weed before but now not so much. Max 2 times per month, and i never keep any at home. Quit because it was fucking up my psyche even more. Started becoming extremely paranoid, not knowing if flies i saw were real, flashes of lighting midday. 
I have also been having periods of time where i obsess over my sexuality and think im gay when im not. Its exhausting. Fucking neighbour wakes me up every day with their piano smashing which makes my already shitty sleep worse.
Nowadays i have suicidal thoughts around 3 days a week at least, i also got my urge to hurt myself back. I overeat to the point of nausea. The psych ward does or did do checkup calls on me but i quit answering the phone. I dont see the point anymore wasting both my time and theirs. 
All my friends have full time jobs that are well payed, and i cant even hold a job for more than 2 months before i break down. Applied to over 30 jobs in january, 0 replies.

39,"Maybe I’m naive, stupid, gullible, but up until last night I never once doubted I could trust my younger sister. We both high and someone the conversation led to common sense, which my sister said I had none of. She then told me this whammy:
“You’re constantly being deceived”
So now my entire perception of my life has changed and I’m doubting that I can trust any of my family members. Again, maybe I’m incredibly stupid I’ve never thought in my 22 years of life I should be wary of my own family and that they may not be telling the truth. Of course people lie, but being *constantly deceived* I just feel like an idiot. 

Is the only option to move out? I’m really not in a good place right now, I don’t know what to do. The only other person I’d feel comfortable confiding in is my therapist and now I’m not even sure I feel comfortable with that.",06Apr2020,1
40,"Hi I'm a 17yr old f high school senior who currently lives with her father, his wife and my half sister. I recently moved in a month ago and that's when everything was going down to shit. 

Previously I have moved out without looking back and mentally was a wreak. My father's partner used scream at me and call me pathetic about the simplest things in a horrible matter. Such as I was told to take out the rubbish by my father so I did and then I got told off by her for not replacing the bag when I was told to straight away to do dishes that were never mine btw. I used to get told off by my father that I never washed my dishes but when I told him they weren't mine he would complain about work and tell me off for not washing his dishes. There was a time period right as my baby sister was born and right before that everytime I entered the kitchen for food I'd get stared at and critised. So at one point I decided to stop eating properly and basically went on a milk diet to not disturb them. Cause I was disturbing my dad's partner. At one point I tried to start making food at odd times because I thought it would be a better way to avoid them except I got told off about making sound. Because there was seemingly to be financial issues at one point and I avoided contact with them. I asked for an allowance every week which I lived on as I didn't go grocery shopping with them. It was $50 which I would live on for about 1 to sometimes 2 weeks. Essentially when his partner had an issue with me she would complain to my father and get him to tell me off or critise me directly. When I went to see my cousins with my mother I realised my situation wasn't normal causing me to crumble into pieces infront of my other sister's. My mother would give me living allowances for food and basically told me to immediately move with her when I could. So I did that. As soon as the term of school came to an end on a Thursday I packed up everything and moved everything. Cleaned the place and didn't look back.

I was happy and had people I live and trust surround me. If i made mistakes or made noise it was okay. I was treated with kindness. Then as I was allowed to go on an outing for one of the first times alone I decided to go out to an anime convention with a large allowance to simply have fun. The next weekend happens and then I learn that my dad's partner has been crying because she lost her wedding ring. And I was getting basically blamed for it essentially. On the phone he was like ""I'll put up a reward to whoever finds it"" as well as asking me questions. Apparently she hid it in the bathroom in her own fking section under the bathroom sink closets hair spray can or something like that. With a tissue on top of it according to her. And she happens  to realise she lost it when I move out . It was to the point that my oldest sister had to vouch to my dad that I didn't steal it. And he would still bring up that the ring had something so if it was to every be 'sold he'll find out who did it. Going to each one of my friends asking if they seen it that had entered the house. My friends have anxiety issues and wanted to confront them. I let him confront two but one since she was still taking anti depressants and therapy. I didn't want her to stress out. He would complain about this for a while. We basically didn't stay in contact unless special events happened and he called to see if I was going. So about 3 times a year for nearly three years. 

My mother is not the most reliable financially however she is the most sweetest and kindest person alive. Treating me as her baby she always put my priorities on a stand . Bought me food because she thought I wasn't eating properly. Made sure I was alright and simply was there for me when I needed it. We had financial problems because she didn't want to take on a proper job anymore because of bad influences from previous partners. Anyways we moved acouple times so we were closer to my grandmother since she lived my little brother alot. Finding ways to complain that he should live with her instead we gave up and ended up living in my uncle's flat right next to my grandmother's. Without realising we learn that my mother hasn't paid the rent in 3months and tried to get money quickly. We were kicked out basically(monday). Telling us to immediately move everyone started packing. Originally the plan was my middle sister moves into a place near by with me and her bf. I'll pay rent whenever I can. However they had to find a place in 3 days which was basically impossible. So then my other plan was for me was to move in my other side grandparents since they raised me up I called them. However they didn't let me move there. So the only place I could go was my dad's. I skipped acouple days of school (Tuesday and wednesday) and moved out. At the same time I still did the work that school assigned that I wasn't class for and basically got into a mutual break up. We had relationship problems and I tried to break up the week before but then we decided to continue trying. For a week whilst I was trying to move we barely talked. He told me it was because he was sick. I was an emotional wreak and was lonely. Crying basically everyday for a week. He broke up with me early Sunday to only call me back midnight Sunday that he regretted breaking up and wanted me back. Telling me that really during that week we barely talked he told me that he was sick however he was spending that whole time in touch with his ex. Going to her place or she was taking care of him. During that Sunday after the break up he kissed her and realised he didn't have feelings for her and left to go tell me that he wanted me back and it felt like he was with the wrong person. Keep in mind during the last time I tried to break up he told me he couldn't trust me anymore which I understood and wanted some space. So I gave it to him. And we were in a long distance relationship. I didn't know he was with his ex at all during the time and he didn't want to tell him cause he felt like I'd break up with him at any point and time so he simply just didn't tell me. I told him i needed a break from all this so i told him i mjght talk to him in a couple weeks. During the day in between this I was building ikea furniture and tripped on a piece whilst holding another heavy one. Causing alot of bruising around my left knee. I'm the kind of person who likes to bottle everything up so I ended up tearing up alittle and then on the following week I decided to go to the doctors (as per usual by myself) and get a scan. And was prescribed some painkillers. 

As the time went by I studied 5 days a week and worked about 3 times a week. I decided to focus on myself and buy essentials that I've been needing for a while. However as soon as I got in contact with him my anxiety went through the roof and then I became self destructive. And told him I didn't want to have contact with him anymore and that I'm sorry because I need to learn to love myself first before putting someone else first in my life again. Blocked him. Tried to move on. I ended up taking a break from school since I got sick. Apparently I had laryngitis according to my doctor. During school I felt dizzy leading me to being sent home. After my break the school skeleton system was implanted in NSW Australia. So I was emailed by the deputy principle that everyone was to stay home unless their parents worked in something like health or essential workers and wanted their children to be supervised. As a child my parents weren't there for notes and shit so naturally I took this information and informed my dad and stayed home. Listening to the deputy and started doing school work at home. Then I got called out by my dad's wife stating I don't know what im talking about. As a student who's in the education system I know what's happening goddamn well cause I have to stay updated since I'm in my largest and it's affecting me one of the most. I told her that they implemented the skeleton system currently and that we were all told to stay home unless our circumstances state otherwise. I've always been home alone whilst they went out even when they were said to have financial issues they would go buy food outside. She told me off stating there was no skeleton school system (I'm pretty sure she didn't understand what it meant) and then asked for my evidence. I brought out the email that was sent to me and pointed out that even if I went there we would only be supervised. As said so in the email. We would all be assigned work online. She asked my subjects and I answered ancient history,music,drama,standard english and biology. To only get laughed at and she told my dad to just keep me home as if I was a joke. Skipping to now all I ve ever been doing to accommodating to others during this quarantine and I want to be away from them. Critised for not doing work when I am or having to much fun. I willingly took care of my baby sister until I had a work shift which I told them before hand. This whilst juggling my assignments and other assigned school work.

 I've been mentally struggling recently and attempting to cope. I haven't seen my mother since the move and I miss her alot but I can't go see her. I'm just really tired from everything. Thank you for reading this far and dealing with my horrible English. 

Tdlr: Within a week I moved,broke up with bf and still went to school and work. I'm an emotional wreak. I live with my father and his wife and i don't think I'm getting any better since I have a bad relationship with his wife and trust issues with my dad.",06Apr2020,1
41,"It was November of 2018 after a panic attack at 3 am that I got sent to the ER and subsequently admitted into a mental health program in the hospital. Two weeks go by and I've learned much about myself and self therapy. I get sent home and everything is good and I'm really happy.

A few months go by and my situation starts declining again. The amount of pills I have to take increases as well as the dosages. I feel like I'm going insane and some things in life hit me really hard from losing friends to barely finishing high school. I was a mess. 

In the past year I had been told that I have anxiety, depression, body dysmorphic disorder, potentially bipolar, etc.

I got sick and tired of the amount of medication I would take daily on top of other medical issues I have. 

Come February of this year I move states to live with my brother and his family. Everything is going fine and dandy when I get a panic attack after talking to my mom. My brother and my sister and law stay with me through it and I calm down, but everything just feels ruined by then...

Ruined in a sense that I thought I could escape my life back in my old state... it feels impossible now.

A few days later, my brother... he tells me a lot of things that we feel and the things that happen to us are greatly impacted by the way we think. In addition, a lot of things that we think are true about us are only true because others tell us it is. An example: I got diagnosed with mental health issues, so therefore ""I am depressed and anxious"". Often times he tells me it's not true. I feel like I don't know what to believe. I feel like no has ever asked HOW I FEEL.

I've been through therapy, countless psychiatrist appointments, and even therapy groups. I don't feel particularly wrong, but it just feels empty. I feel like my therapist would be the only one to listen to me. 

I'm really frustrated. I feel empty, alone, and unheard. I feel as though no one I'm supposed to be close with validates my feelings. 

Anxiety is often correlated with paranoia right? I constantly feel this way. I'm always afraid of the worst possible outcome to any situation and I feel as though I'm just a disaster waiting to explode. I feel useless and tired. 

What can I do? I want to be happy and feel validated. I don't want to be stuck in an endless cycle of feeling nothing at all.",06Apr2020,1

Like I wasn’t the most popular girl in high school and I was pretty smart but I wasn’t very smart either. Like I can see what they’re saying that if anyone doesn’t like me it’s just because they’re jealous, but I don’t like to think that because I’m not really a self-absorbed person and I just assume that the reason people don’t like me is because there’s something wrong with me. 

i’ve also just been really stressed out with all this online work and it just never ends like I never get a break, and everything is just piling up and i think about how everyone’s just out to get me sometimes. i wish i could not care and usually i dont but sometimes i just wonder where i went wrong and what im doing wrong for so many ppl to hate me. 

i have such bad trust issues too from ex friends that sometimes i dont even want to put myself out there bc im afraid of being treated like shit again.

44,"I’m a senior in high school, and I’ve yet to get diagnosed with anything because finding a doctor is so difficult. I’m pretty sure I have at least depression, but that’s going off topic. Anyway, since freshman year I’ve been doing this really odd thing. I spend at least an hour or more every day kind of running/skipping around my house. About 90% of the time I do this listening to music that triggers vivid daydreams about imagined trailers for shows, edits, stage play choreography, fantasy lives and scenarios, compositions for art pieces, etc. Yeah, I’m an artist. These can even cause me to show emotions, mouth out phrases of make facial expressions that I imagine in the daydreams. The other few times, I might be watching something for an interest I’m very passionate about at the time and it makes me excited enough to get the urge to run and jump around. If I can’t find time to do this, or if I’m in a place where it’s inappropriate to, it does make me feel uncomfortable and antsy, but it’s not debilitating either. Sometimes I will be doing something at home (like drawing) and a song will come on that triggers that urge, so I put down what I’m doing to satisfy it. My brother does it too, though not as often, and the rest of my family makes fun of us for it. I’ve only heard of a few other people who do this online.

50,"A little backstory; (Or just skip to the issue at hand below)

My dad wasn't the nicest of people and he mentally hurt me a lot to the point where I would be a stupid attention-seeking teenager (because I guess I just wanted, and I really still do want, attention from literally anybody) by slicing up my arms and posting it on social media or keeping it to myself or what have you, and I never stopped wearing hoodies blah blah blah, and my mental health got worse and worse until my dad decided that he'd take me to the hospital and get me sent to a mental hospital, which happened multiple times until finally I was put into DCFS care and put into a 6 month long in-patient hospital in Atlanta, GA, which really changed my perspective on things and when I got out I was sent to live with my grandmother (who I still live with) and started to get better and better, but I don't feel like I really got better because I've always been the fat, ugly, and anti-social kid in school and I really just still am, but I want to work better on myself, which here comes the issue at hand;

I need advice for this;

I don't shower often, and when I do it's only at nights before school or when I go to see my girlfriend, and I haven't showered in about 2 or 3 weeks due to the COVID-19 outbreak because of schools being force closed and I can't see my girlfriend because of the mandatory social distancing, and I'm 15 and only have my learner's permit. I don't brush my teeth and I work out with 100 jumping jacks, 30 pushups, and 30 situps every night because I don't want to be fat anymore, and I'm doing hella good and I've lost hella weight which has motivated me a bit, and I want to become a law enforcement officer later down the road, and I want to work on my social anxiety and I want to stop being the person that people don't want to be friends with because I'm weird, don't know when to shut up, and say stupid shit all the time and I never know how to act. I just don't have any motivation to do anything, and I know this, and I want to help myself get better but I just can't, I tried to start showering and working out more and brushing my teeth more but I just don't like getting up and doing things, I'm sad all the time and my depression has gotten better and I've stopped taking medication but it's only just sadness about my situation in life because I'm always secluded, there's no neighbors to hang out with, I live in the middle of no where so I can't walk or ride a bike anywhere, because I don't even have a bike, and my computer that I loved with all my heart got seized by police because I'm a fucking idiot, and sometimes I have thoughts about how much I want to just fucking end my life and I've thought of a sure-fire way to do so, but I don't want to do it because I don't want to leave my girlfriend because I love her so much and I know she loves me so much, that's my only motivation to live, but what if she leaves me? What the fuck do I do? I'll never find a girl like her again and if I fuck it up then that's it, I'm ending it. I just want to be normal and do things that normal people do, like take showers and brush my teeth n shit like that but I don't fucking want to, and I can't go back to therapy until this COVID-19 shit goes away, which won't be for a fucking while, and I don't know if I can handle it much longer. I only have 2 friends, one being my girlfriend, and one being a german guy who I talk to a lot about my feelings and he doesn't really help that much besides make me feel better in that moment and my girlfriend doesn't know how to deal with my sadness besides just asking if I'm okay or saying ""awh :/""

I've only seen it once with my own eyes and I never want to again the state of fear and panic I was in when I looked into the void I was left motionless all I could do was cry, the nurses had to calm me down for hours and move me into a different room. I believe it's that keeping me alive, I think it brought me back to life when I died when I took that overdose I should of never of woken up but I did. It speaks to me but I don't know what it says its all too quiet and hard to make out, I have moments where I zone out and draw pictures of him and what he tells me but I have no memory of doing them. I believe his plan will end with me hanging from the branch of a oak tree It's not like I get distressed over this all the time. I can live with it. I just have accepted I am going to die of my own hands one day. If anything I'm happy it's at least me dealing the final blow and not anyone else. I want to be put down but camhs won't let me.

56,"I was wondering if anyone on this subreddit could give me a diagnosis on what is happening. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got mad because of something that my parents had done and decided to go lay on the couch. I then repeated the word ""why"" over and over to myself. It felt like only a a couple of minutes had passed but I was later informed by my mom that I had been laying there for over 30 minutes. This of course scarred me because I was unaware of that much time passing so fast. She had informed me that my sister and her had come to me multiple times to try to talk to me. She told me I gave them no reaction and also didn't respond to being touched. Afterwards I went to my room and began to hyperventilate to the point of almost passing out. The only reason I stopped is because I broke out into tears before calming down because of fatigue.

I don’t have anyone to talk to hence why I’m reaching out to strangers on the internet. 

I have diagnosed Anxiety and Depression. And I live with a house full of snakes. Bad combo right? 
I usually can control my anxiety and depression, but I’m unfortunately on no medications and no longer seeing my therapist. I want to blame my family’s pressure for the absence of both but I know it’s partly my fault. 

Long story short. I am scared of myself. I have no motivation for anything. Anything at all. And the way I think of myself lately is just scary. 

I am the sad girl.

This isn't ok for an freshman in high school to think about a shooting. And how funny it is that I could die and others will die also. I want to be happy, productive, and know what I want to do with my life. Not upset, a large procrastinator, and have no idea what I even like anymore.

63,"For context, my parents got divorced when i was barely 3 years old so to my knowledge, i've always had a very dysfunctional family. My Father started dating this woman i can't stand when i was 5. She was racist, homophobic, uncultured, etc. On top of that she was pretty abusive towards me. she would gaslight me, degrade me, she even punched me in a supermarket where i fell and cried while she laughed.

My dad wasn't very present in my life, he became less and less there for me when he started dating \[C\], because he tends to become the person he is with. His whole identity was formed by his family when he was young and therefore doesn't know any better. Under all the layers of the personalities people have formed around him, i know deep down is a wonderful man, which makes this situation more awful than it already is.

Around the 5th grade, i started to get extremely depressed. I had been seeing a therapist for two years but it was mostly on how to deal with my adhd until then. I was diagnosed with severe depression and was advised to get anti depressants ASAP.  Our healthcare system required that i see a pedo-psychiatrist before. There was a two year waiting list. That's when i started cutting.

6th grade arrived and it was time for me to chose where i wanted to go to high school. My father and i were progressively getting on worse terms. He would act impulsively like a bratty child, i felt like i was the parent at 11. I wanted to go to a private school and my father categorically refused. He threw a whole fit about it. His reasoning was that if he hated the private school he went to, i would too. I still took admission tests and got accepted with some of the highest scores they had received. I was so proud, he shut me down quickly. He and his wife started calling me a sneaky lil' whore because i took the tests for a school i was very passionate about. That was the last christmas i saw him, back in 2015. he and my mom got into a serious argument about child support that he was barely paying, we desperately needed that money at the time. So without even telling me or asking my opinion he decided he could only see me on ½ the weekends because he would need to work more (but specifically on the days i was with him), mind you he worked on the weekend. He used me as a token in their childish fights. So id see him a total of less than 20 days per year. I took the decision to cut him off, he was toxic.

&amp;#x200B;

later that year i had my first attempt.

&amp;#x200B;

i started to have health issues 2 ½ years ago. Chronic migraines. I'm in unbearable pain 24/7

&amp;#x200B;

i had my second attempt after 6 months of pure physical torture, i was hoping to receive a diagnosis of cancer or something that had a cure but it never came.

&amp;#x200B;

in those past couple of years, i cant got in details, i was abused by a partner. I'll let you connect the dots so i dont have to.

&amp;#x200B;

i suffer mild PTSD from my childhood and relationships, i tend to dissociate from situations when they get too dark. But this time, i couldn't. In january, my brother(on my dads side)  got in a serious accident at work, broke both of his legs, open fracture and all that jazz. he woke up from surgery the next morning the first question he asked was is \[me\] alright? i hadnt talked to him in years and i missed him so much, i felt like a dick for indirectly cutting him off. i contacted him on facebook, which took a LOT of courage and gave me panic attacks just thinking about it. i got extremely depressed. i had spiraling thought where id scream at myself in my head even outloud at times «im going to kill myself» over and over. i couldnt think, i stopped going to school,

&amp;#x200B;

And here comes the shitshow. i see his name in my inbox. I started at the subject line for two days before opening it. it was full of triggers for me and him explaining why he did that dick move 4 years ago, He still doesnt see where he messed up.

For the past 2-3 months I went through a serious eating disorder where I lost 20 pounds, and I would constantly feel unaware, confused, dazed, you name it, but I loved it. Everyday when I woke up I felt happy, like I was doing the right thing. I finally started to feel like I was acceptable in the eyes of others because I looked significantly better.

69,"I know that a lot of people have been raised since a young age or birth in abusive households. In my case, I was introduced to one last year, at 16. You know the effect of having higher economic standards? Like how economic ruin affects the mental health of people in a wealthier country in a different way than those of people raised in say, 3rd world countries. Like the Great Depression caused many suicides, whereas there are poor people living in slums and they're not having depression to the same widespread extent as those did in the GD, because that is how they were raised, how their parents were, and their grandparents, and how they know their children will be because of the economy.

I know children raised in chronic abuse for years develop PTSD. But is it possible for someone who has never been abused before to have it after a few instances of assault? Because I find myself getting triggered. I have so much hurt and anger, and do several things to cope with it: I bottle it up, I let it all out rarely, I am passive aggressive about it, casually almost, and I vent about it to people I'm close with. But often when I am alone with my thoughts I have flashbacks, and get this emotion turn into a physical sensation in my chest and then involuntarily let it out in this physical jerk, almost like I was boiling for a few seconds and then it pops out from my chest to my mouth, but I don't vocalize it, it's gasp and then I take in air because I didn't have any in my lungs for a minute, like I'm being decompressed. It's a really, really strong feeling and I don't want to hurt anyone, but it's the flashbacks that cause a mental image of me fighting back, and it just makes me have these short, awful bursts. I just feel so violated, like something was taken way from me. And I want to try and get it back by force in those moments, when really, I just wish it would all go away, I just want to leave her, or have her leave, and live a peaceful life away from the possibility of being around anyone hurting anyone. 

And then I get nightmares, too. It's like being trapped, whatever my dream came up with that she'll do next, each time worse than the last. I don't tell my family about this because I don't want them thinking I am having any ""after effects"" other than obviously being hurt about it in general, because I don't want them to worry more than they do already. But now in concern for myself, I wonder if this is a thing? Like will I have these flashbacks forever? Will I get triggered in my adult life?

72,"For starters, I don’t like this kind of thing infact I hate this kinda thing. I don’t like confronting my problems and I definitely don’t like reflection. But I think it’s time. I believe that nobody is perfect including myself. I also know that there is different levels of abuse. So abuse means a lot of different things to different people but I’d like to point out my definition. Abuse is treating someone in a negative/harmful way over and over again. This can either be mentally, psychically, or both. So quick backstory, growing up my dad really wasn’t there but It didn’t matter because my amazing mother did her best and had amazing support behind her. But because my mom always was juggling all this stuff she didn’t really have time for me or herself. Her mental health and our relationship suffered from that. But she needed to pay the bills so I understand now that I’m older. During that time both my parents weren’t really around, so I spent a lot of times with my moms family. They really are the ones who watched me grow up and raised me, while my mom was doing the hard stuff like bills. So as a young kid I normally became attached to them. Now it feels as though my aunt is my sister and my grandparents are my parents. Since we live across the street from my grandparents I usually spend a good amount at both houses. But I prefer my grandparents because it’s as if it’s become my childhood home. One person that I am especially close to is my grandfather. When I was little he was the life of the party. He always had a story to tell and a thing to do.  We’d go on his boat and he’d tell me about the time he traveled to Korea for his music career or the time he sung opening for prince at Madison square garden. He’s the type of man you want to be and the type of one you admire. But during the past few years his sickness and age has taken a toll on him. His illness is genetic so he can’t fix it. But because he’s ill he doesn’t always know what he’s saying or doing. He goes from a 1 to 10 real quick and can sometimes just wake up being a 10. He insults everyone now and then but he takes it out on me the most. I guess it because I’m always around him. He calls me names and curses at me all the time. He often says remarks that make me feel like I failed him and that he’d be better off without me. Now remind you I’m still a teen so I’m very energetic and can be annoying sometimes I get it. I also understand that he didn’t ask to raise another kid. But sometimes he takes things to the next level a little game of tap becomes a full blown fist fight and a small argument about politics and I’ll get kicked out for “disrespect”.  Tonight was the last straw though. I told him goodnight after I “followed him into the kitchen to annoy him” and he threatened to “punch me and fuck me up” I was just so struck in the moment when he got in my face I could do or say nothing except a calm stop. It was like I’d been hypothesized like I couldn’t move. He continued to terrorize me till my grandmother (who breaks up these “fights”) calmed him down. She’s copes by agreeing with him to get him to shut up though so it isn’t much help. But that’s usually. What really got me upset is that i think I’m emotionally damage I’m not afraid anymore or sad or angry I can’t feel anything but nothing if I get pushed down I don’t feel it I just stay calm and forget about it.  I feel broken like I should feel anything but nothing. I believe the constant abuse and mental fitness of my family is affecting my sense of emotions?  On one hand I understand that he’s physically and mentally ill so I brush it off but on the other hand I can’t live the rest of my life with this being my reaction to dangerous people. I can’t go to therapy because I don’t have time. And I hate to complain because I really do have a great family but it’s just everyone family looks perfect from the outside.

So, I have extreme anxiety and mild (mostly seasonal) depression. I am not on medication as a personal choice, not because I don't believe in it, I just know that I am young (19) and still developing chemically upstairs. I do take CBD oil and it has helped me a lot! (Not here to preach this is just what works for me) The main cause of my anxiety has always been Time and Schedules. It doesn't matter what it is or how early I have to get up I am an hour early or I feel my whole world crumble. I have been managing this a lot better with the help of my absolutely wonderful boyfriend (bless his heart), however it's schedules that really have a grip on me. I am obsessed with having a set and regular schedule. If something happens to through it off for any reason at all I spiral into full blown panic attacks. It feels like there are angry bees buzzing in my head, I start uncontrollably crying, and I find it very hard to recollect myself. This can effect me for a while 12 hours if I can't find some way to occupy my mind (usually with an art project or puzzle works best). I should mention I have a really bad habit of working so hard and such long hours that it keeps my brain from wandering enough that I stop taking my CBD for months at a time. I recognize this is a really bad thing to do, especially since my episodes seem to get exponentially worse each time I am off it. I could really use some reassurance that I'm not just losing my mind, and a few tips would be great my appreciated if you've even managed to read this far.

78,"My friend has had issues involving perfectionism and overthinking a lot of things. He's never been to therapy or talked to his family about it because he has never seen it as that serious. Honestly, I don't know his mind so it might not actually be a serious thing. However, the way that he talks about it makes it seem like it has had a big effect on his life. He has seemingly had a fair bit of social issues from it involving him being nervous about what to say in a lot of situations. I've asked him if he considered therapy or has talked to his parents about it, the answer to both of those is no. He said he doesn't feel comfortable talking to his parents about that stuff. Idk if he has a bad relationship with them or if he is just nervous about that like he is with a lot of other social things. From what context I can gather, he seems to have a fine relationship with his parents and i think the main hurtle for him not talking to them is just his nervousness regarding in-person conversation regarding serious issues like that. I could be completely wrong about that though.

My main point is that I want to help him out, but I feel like I can't. He has said that just venting to me helps him out a lot, so I'm definitely gonna keep doing that. I still feel like even if i help clear his thoughts and express himself, I'm not helping to actually make his issue better, I feel like I don't have the expertise to help him.

87,"Hi! I have no idea if this is the correct subreddit for this, but I wanna attempt to find out a little more about my broken brain. This is going to be incredibly hard to explain, but I’m going to try to do so without it turning into a novel.  If you have questions, please ask! I will not be offended. I know it sounds insane and creepy. 

Little background info: I (20f) am a pretty normal person in real life. When I was about 12 was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, OCD, and trichotillomania.  I am not currently depressed or on any medications. I have friends and family who love me. I’m in a happy relationship and have been in many before this one. I have no recollection of being abused. I was not neglected. I don’t actually see them and they don’t tell me to do bad things or hurt anyone. No one knows about this, they all assume I’m normal which is hilarious.

Ok here we go. So for as I can remember, I have had “imaginary friends”. The farthest I can remember them back to is around 5th grade. I made up a world in my mind, and there I am nothing like i am in real life. The real me doesn’t exist there. The “me”(let’s call her Sam) in my head is gorgeous, has a great body and incredible boyfriend named Ryan. I have created every single detail of their lives. Sam and Ryan were 15 and 17 when i met them, they’re now in their mid 20s. Ryan is 1 year and 4 months older than Sam. They have twin boys who are 1 and a half. They live in an apartment in Brooklyn.  They have friends, family. I sometimes find myself acting out their conversations or smiling about something they did. I have noticed that they tend to go away when I’m extremely happy or busy. They come back if I’m feeling lonely or just sad. It happens subconsciously. Over the years, they have grown and evolved with me, which is what makes them feel so real. 


I really hope that made some kind of sense. This is the first time I’ve EVER talked about it because I have been so scared to seek help. So is there anyone who can relate/ tell me some psychological disorders that may describe what I’m going through? I’m not looking for a diagnosis, I just want to do a little research on what’s going on in my head. Thanks in advance :)",06Apr2020,1
88,"Trigger warning, loss, bpd, and depression mentioned.

I don’t even know where to start.
About two years ago I had a mental breakdown, became an inpatient, got properly diagnosed, and put on new meds. I never really went back to normal after and I don’t know why. I didn’t handle things the same anymore, I didn’t have the same capacity. I never found my match with the right meds because I have bpd. They tried a lot of combinations. 
A year after the breakdown my fiancé and I moved out our toxic environment and bought a house. I really thought that would be the saving grace. Right after we got our house his mom got evicted from her apartment and hadn’t told anyone, and she left her dog in the apartment. The landlord called us and we went to get her dog. She told us she would call shelters, and friends to try to find her a home because her dog and my oldest dog didn’t get along. A couple months pass and her dog had gotten out with mine and while trying to round her up they got in a fight, I broke it up and got bit by her dog. I know That’s what happens when you get between dogs, can’t be mad. We told her what happened, and found out she hadn’t been calling anyone and was just hoping we’d keep her dog. When we started calling shelters all of them in our area were full, and no one was able to take her. So we were just trying to hang in there until we found somewhere. Fast forward to a couple days ago, I was home alone letting my dogs out and her dog slipped out with them. I ran out to get her, she attacked my oldest dog again. My neighbor was trying to spray them with the hose. I had to get in between them. Her dog bit up my face, arm, and leg, but I finally got them apart. My dog almost didn’t make it. I asked animal control to take his moms dog, they said they couldn’t and she’d have to stay with us because the shelter was full. I couldn’t really do much for the dogs the day after. I couldn’t really walk or use my arm. I felt pretty worthless. I couldn’t even protect my dog. His mom had tried to contact me but I don’t want to talk to her. She always tries to spin the story and say my dog instigates, and that she’s “trying” to find a home for hers. As life is, it doesn’t stop there. 
Unfortunately a day ago my dad passed away. It was really sudden. He just got out of the hospital and was doing better. None of us could go see him at home though because of the corona virus. Suddenly he declined. We all had to watch him go over a video conference call because none of us could be in the room. I feel like it only gets worse. What’s the point anymore? I feel really broken, and being in quarantine is so hard, I can’t even be with my family. I don’t even know how to process any of the feelings I have right now.",06Apr2020,1

I touch a surface - BOOM - got COVID-19. I wash my hands and wash them and wash them and wash them. Sanitize, disinfect. I touch my face when I'm lying in bed. I am touching my face for the majority of the time I'm in my bed. Which, I'm in my bed all day and night unless I'm working. I've been as careful as possible, but I think I have the virus. If I am hospitalized, I will refuse a ventilator and I will sign a DNR upon admission. I'm not suicidal, but I cannot live like this any longer. There is no end in sight. I have constant anxiety and I obsess all day and night. If I contract this virus, I will not survive. I don't wanna leave my family, but I'm ready to go.",06Apr2020,1
90,"This post might be triggering for those with similar experiences so please at your own risk.

Ever since I was little (read 4 or 5 years old) I remeber making up stories about all sorts of things. It started with colorful shapes dancing on the ceiling in kindergarten, continued to fairytale-like stories about princesses and ended up in full fledged fantasy series some of which I am trying to make into real book series.

I was always using these stories to escape reality, where I was constantly bullied by my peers (all the way to the age of 15, then it stopped). I also wanted to escape my abusive mother, who regularly made me feel as an ungratefull, completely useless piece of garbage that only exists to make her miserable. 

I was also escaping difficult relationship with my father, who didn't live with us but we were in regular contact. He had a problem with alcohol and even when sober would emotionaly blackmail me as in: ""You don't do 'insert an activity', you don't love me anymore?"" Usually it was about spending the weekend with him but could be about anything. He has died a few years ago and I think we all felt relieved that we won't have to deal with his alcoholic episodes ever again.

Those stories had a lot of things in common, mainly main female character suffering all kinds of abuses from the world around her usually mimicking what I was going through at the time. I think I was trying to relieve the pain and stress that way.

As part of my theraphy I have decided to log as many of those stories as I can remember and analyse them in hopes of understanding my past a little better and to make it easier to accept. Most memories from my childhood are clouded and fuzzy but I have a few vivid ones and a general knowledge of what was happening at school and at home. I was able to match themes from my stories to what was happening to me.

Only one theme remains a mystery to me and that is being raped and getting pregnant, followed by being shunned by family and/or friends and ending up alone. I cannot pinpoint the exact time when this theme emmerged for the first time, but I am relatively sure it was before I was 11, which is what bothers me. I would also like to add that this theme is present in almost all of the stories I can remember like 90% of them so it is more like a pattern than random idea.

Sometimes I'd have dreams about being sexually assaulted to various extents - from inappropriate touching to full blown rape. I used to ignore such dreams and write them off as immersing too much in my stories with similar themes.

Last year I have started theraphy to resolve the issues I have around what was happening when I was a child and it has been progressing very well from my point of view. My sleep has gotten better and I started dreaming more often. At first it was only fantasy stuff like learning how to cast spells or raising dragons. Then I started having dreams about being socially excluded from various groups (bullying reference), getting into car accidents (I totalled a car about 3 years ago) and getting sexually exploited, abused or assaulted.

I always wake up in almost a panicked state and sometimes have trouble falling asleep again. The anxiety usually sticks with me for most of the next day and sometimes I am afraid to even go to sleep again which leaves me awake into late night and totally exhausted the next day.

I wanted to write those dreams off as my brain being messed up anyway, but the more dreams I have the more I have to ask myself if there might be something that happened to me when I was a child that I don't remember at all. On the other hand I wouldn't want to instill this thought into my brain, as it could create an event that did not happen and I'd have no tools to identify it. (Sometimes I have ""memories"" of things that did not happen and have to consciously work with them to uncover all inconsistencies to dig out what really happened.)

I have yet to discuss this with my theraphist as I was concentrating on different problems during theraphy and to be honest I was also afraid of his judgement. But the dreams are becoming more and more frequent, which makes me believe it is time to take them to light. The only catch is that my next session is planned for May so for the next month and a half I am on my own regarding this matter.

That is why I have decided to try this community to see if anyone has any insights on the matter or has maybe dealt with similar problem and might be willing to share strategies in how to get over it in order to lessen the impact these dreams and subsequent feelings and thoughts have on daily life. 

I am not looking for an answer or a solution to the problem. I am well aware of the fact, that this is something only I can solve since it revolves around my past and my experiences. I am also not looking for any sort of replacement theraphy, since it would be impossible to properly explain the depth of my circumstances. 

As I wrote, I am looking for insights, thoughts and possible coping strategies from people who have experienced something similar, themselves or with someone they know. Anything will be appreaciated.

It sounds like a small thing, but I remember how badly that set me back. 

Now, I’m 24 years old and struggle tremendously with making effort with friends. Sometimes I doubt if my connections with friends is even real, because I act different with all of them.

Hello,

I am an 18 year old male that is doing pretty well in life. I am heading off to a great college soon and worked my ass off in school, played a lot of sports, and created some hobbies (music, programming).

However, I have been struggling recently with voyeuristic disorder. I've always been surrounded by ass and girls in provoking clothes at my high school, and combined with a chronic use of porn and masturbation, I soon turned to masturbating to changing room vids and upskirts. I felt very sick at myself for jerking off to this kinda stuff but the urge was incontrollable. This escalated, and I soon used my phone as a spy camera, taking creep videos of ass and even tempted to do some upskirts. I would masturbate to these videos but then I would delete them right after, feeling sick at myself. The problem is, I want to free myself of these voyeuristic urges, since after doing some research, I found that voyeurism can escalate very quickly into far more sinister things (the worst being rape). Is there any way to treat this? Support groups/therapy is not an option right now, so I was thinking of going porn/masturbation free, but the urge to just wank it to some upskirts or pictures of people I know at school are just too incontrollable. Please help me, I realize I can have a beautiful life ahead of me but I feel like my voyeuristic disorder might shatter everything. Should I jerk off without porn instead? Will masturbating to regular porn (not voyeur porn) help me rid my voyeuristic urges? I feel like I get a different ""rush"" from watching/commiting voyeur than just watching regular porn..

anyway I am having a lot of trouble lately worrying and obsessing over my past. A lot of it has to do with sex and choices made around that. All of this is from @ 20 years ago give or take. I have 2 wonderful kids (from different fathers) that I love dearly. One father is involved - the other is not. This is part of my constant guilt. I am now engaged to a man that I can honestly say is the only man I’ve ever loved.

108,"TL/DR at bottom

If I have to read one more fucking Facebook post about looking at the blessings in this situation, I swear I'm about to go off on a bitch. 

No one is talking about mental health and what effects Covid, self isolation, lockdowns and social distancing will have on us. Are we going to come out ok on the other end or will this be added on to the pile of shit we carry around with us now? 

I'm bipolar with panic and anxiety disorder. Every night I'm playing ""is it a panic attack or Covid?"" My meds don't seem to be helping. 

I'm a hairstylist that had to close the doors to my shop. I lost my identifier and the one thing that keeps me grounded. 

I want to scream at these people who post continually about what a blessing this is, such a wake-up call..blah blah. Bitch, I can't see my daughter who lives 10 minutes away. I can't see my mom who lives 5 minutes away. It hurts. That is not a blessing. 

I don't know where else to go except to you guys. Please tell me I can't be the only one who's panicking every damn day, who's trying to hold it together but doing a shitty job at it.

I’m 21, uni student in my final year.
Early February: I broke up with my first girlfriend (about a year, broke up a few times beforehand, very toxic, but I did love her)

After that I started going gym which was great, mentally. I was also going out a lot more as well, trying to get the most out of single life, n it was fun. But every night, that’s when my brain would decide to have deep thoughts about me and my ex etc (I miss the good parts, I miss the love but I don’t wanna get back with her, we was toxic and she was aggressive)

Even now in quarantine, 2 odd months after everything, my brain still has deep thoughts about it, especially at night.  I don’t know if it’s love or the affection I miss. I understand it was my first love so that’s always gonna hit harder.

At the moment life just feels pretty empty, I work out at home (though feels lacklustre due to no equipment) and I call my friends and family (as I’m still at uni house). But besides that I don’t really know what to do, I just wanna get my head on probably and stop thinking negatively, and deeply about the past, but I’m struggling to. 

Anyone ever felt this or have any advice?

118,"I'm a little emotional right now so this isn't going to be very to-the-point, but I'd appreciate if you read it

So, I was on the nosleep subreddit and I read this story where the main character accidentally snapped his neighbour's neck without realising (it makes sense in the context of the story). Since I was little I've always been scared of accidentally killing people/things because when I was very young we had a pet duck and one night it was quacking so I thought it was cold and I brought it to my bed and crushed it in my sleep. Since then I've always been really cautious about stuff like that. Whenever I have any animals on my bed like kittens, I always put them on some raised blankets or pillows so I wouldn't be able to roll onto them and crush them.

So I'd been reading stuff all day and after reading that I started to feel a little odd. Like the whole bit disconnected from reality thing. I was really wrapped up in my thoughts and not really focusing on anything. Like, staring into the distance as I was walking around and doing stuff. I decided to have a shower and I kept having thoughts like I could die so easily if I just slipped over, my parents just cleaned it and what if that reacts with the body wash and creates a toxic gas and a whole bunch of stuff like that.

My thoughts were kinda distressing me so I went over and talked to my parents about them but I noticed my thinking was really disorganised and I was stuttering and struggling to use words to convey my point, something I never struggle with.

So then I went to my room and started thinking about it more and I started crying and shaking and hyperventilating and I felt cold but I didn't want to do anything about it because I didn't really see the point in it and my head was feeling really heavy and my neck ached but I couldn't lie down because I was so afraid it'd snap my neck and my body started to feel numb and I curled up in a ball and started rocking back and forth and my perception of everything like time and the space around me and my own body seemed all fucked up and I started getting terrified of myself and thought I might accidentally gouge my eyes out because my face went numb and I was so amazed by the feeling of my face being numb that I ended up shoving my hands into my mouth and making myself throw up, which only made me feel worse.

And after probably only minutes of this is finally clicked that I was having a panic attack. And I calmed my breathing almost instantly and as soon as my breathing was back to normal, I felt completely fine. The panic stopped. I still feel a little paranoid I might accidentally kill myself/someone/something and that I might hurt myself, but I'm honestly really confused about all of this. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before and it really slowly came on after thinking about it for a while and it stopped almost instantly once I realised what was happening. It makes me feel like I was faking it because it feels like I forced it onto myself by thinking about everything then I was able to stop it on command. But it also felt so real",06Apr2020,1
119,"Let me start off with ive suffered from issues with mental health for as long as I can remember. I could remember when I was younger and I was always the one in my class who was playing up and experiencing stuff like extreme low mood and voices and no one else really did in my classes and it made me feel not normal and a outcast and a freak and all sort of self negative views bht as I got older I was able to know about stuff Into detail and realised I was not one jn a million and a lot of people suffer from stuff like this quite commonly and it made me feel some what normal and better. Both of my parents suffered from severe scizophrenia and killed my dad at a young age due to heavy smoking and drug usage to try and self medicate but my mum has some what recovered from all her demons and is living relatively normal life with symptoms cropping up when she’s experiencing intense stressful situation I think she is in remission with it though. Anyway let’s get too me the past say about 5 months I’ve been experiencing extremely messed up thoughts and visions which aren’t mine and occasionally they are repeat and distract me from doing anything else I’ve also been experiencing my name being called from another room when no one is in also increase paranoia about people like for example I’ll be on a public bus and a random whitr guy will come with a backpack and I will instantly get extremely paranoid to the point where I’ll get off the bus because I think he was going to blow us all up I also experience Akathisia regularly to the pint where I’m pacing early into the morning of days I also find I used smoke cannabis heavily but now when I try it I have to keep moving my hand and body because I feel really uncomfortable. This all started 5 months ago when I od on md and ketamine my heart was struggling and I felt like I had a massive elastic band around my chest but when I was in hospital it was like I was in hell I felt like the nurses were taking about me and I was sent here to die and I csn remember briefly I’m the ambulance that these thoughts they were going to take me to kill me were getting wuite strong but due to the dosage I took I couldn’t even move and was in severe pain. I guess what I’m trying to ask is when do all these symptoms go after starting aripiprazole and will my memory and stuff like that slowly come back ?

I finally started doing chemistry research, nano-composites, and it brings me a lot of pride.

I feel neutral about self esteem for the most part. I used to be needy, but I don't have that need to vent to friends or anything anymore. I keep a healthy distance from people. Not because I can't get close to them, but because I genuinely don't need or want close friends nowadays.

I'm playing violin again, a hobby I abandoned for a while. So I'm not sitting around depressed and watching a wall like the past.

Over all I feel pretty good. However, I avoid old close friends because I want to completely remove my old immature phases. I actually have fantasies about poisoning these people I ""opened up to"", even though none of them responded negatively to it.

Ofc such fantasies are are casual, not serious at all. the only intense one is suicide.

Looking back at myself all I want to tell that tween is ""stop throwing your problems at people and just get to therapy dumbass"". I've heard the self acceptance speech a million times, and it never helped me in the past and I don't think it'll help me now.

127,"My parents have been seperated since I was 16, but they have resented each other for as long as I have been aware. Some of my earliest memories are of them arguing. Why would they marry? More importantly, why did they have children? Both are still in jobs they hate and pay poorly. My dad works a physically demanding job, I wonder how much longer he can continue. As far as I know he has no pension. My mother works in teaching. She dislikes her job too. Why do they remain working where they are. If they had no plans for betterment, they should not have had two children. I was most likely a new year's accident though, maybe there was no plan at all.

My mother is depressed, she would hate any job. I am unfortunately like her. I will never achieve anything because I sink into depressiom with any exertion. This is what happens when a person with significant mental illness has a child. Genetics and upbringing, it is almost inevitable. If you have clinical depression: do not have children. If you have any significant mental illness: do not have children. You do not deserve children. You are naturally lazy and unfit to have children. No one should have to carry your genetics. No one should have to be bought up by you. They will resent you. Remember this.

I do not love my mother. I think I am incapable now, I have forgiven and hated so many times, she does not change. I feel she displays some narcisistic traits and she projects those onto my father. Since my father left she has fed me and my brother ready meals almost exclusively, she does not allow either of us to use the kitchen. She complains I am not feeding myself properly at university. Do you see the insanity? She is stuck like this and will never change. It is always my fathers fault. If the blame can not be shifted to him, it is my fault.

138,"Taking a look at this subreddit it feels like I might actually be heard. Really just venting so it's a little all over the place. 

Withdrawal from these psych meds is no joke. It's caused more problems than what I went on them for, and sunk me into the deepest hole of my life. 5 years after seeing a psychiatrist it's prob one of my biggest regrets...don't really think I needed one.

Really struggling with Zoloft taper right now, I've cultivated and fortified many organic coping mechanisms I wish I took seriously before going on meds (like working out, cardio, meditation, yoga)- These reasons + the numbness the meds caused, I decided to begin a taper. However that was now a whole year ago which blows my mind. Each dose drop has been a mini-withdrawal of it's own, stabilizing after about 4 weeks or so. I'm finally down to 25mg but I think the organic depression, and the anxiety that was there previously is dragging me down again. 

Getting off klonopin knocked me into social isolation for 6 months (before it was cool); that was a hell in it's own. 

My career prospects are probably what's depressing me the most nowadays, I am at an IT job that I'm not  a huge fan of. I don't want to go into IT. I studied marketing and information systems and then got my MBA. Financially illiterate parents (and by chain rule I was financially illiterate at the time) decided to go to a super expensive private catholic university...so now I have 100k worth of debt to pay off and an immensely deteriorated psyche. 

Started a business out of school with the help of the meds (Zoloft, dexedrine and klonopin), I did have a lot of social progress mostly induced by the meds, networked, got out of my comfort zone, made a little money but emphasis on a little- it all went back into the business. 2 years into the business a psych took me off the klonopin and adhd med and the business fell apart, I couldn't even leave the house, answer emails phone or text. This alone was enough to cause a deep depression. 

Now a year and a half off klonopin I'm struggling getting off this last med and anxiety is back through the roof. 

I'm trying to get a new job in NYC (where I live outside of) and I'm too hesitant to reach out to alumni network or people I know who can help in this situation. I don't know how stable I'm going to be from one day to the next to be honest still. The meds alone have caused a lot of cognitive dysfunction and I'm often more confused than thinking clearly. I really want to move into a field that I know I want to grow in (which isn't IT), something I can be somewhat proud of, and know that I'll be able to pay off my loans eventually. 

However with all this aspiration, my motivation seems to have gone out the window to learn, it feels almost like I can't even learn if I try. Brain is still full of sludge, and despite being on amphetimine most days I still can't seem to break the habit of procrastination...I apply and apply to jobs but haven't gotten one positive response yet. Know I need to change but can't seem to push myself to make changes, or else I'll just fall back into old patterns and hate myself more.

140,"Drifting

Here I find myself hesitating on which story to illustrate. Which path I want to elaborate on. I see all the 
different avenues that my pen can take me, and yet I choose none. Slowly drifting from dream to dream, I 
close my eyes, then open them once more. I see no difference. 

Living under the stars is something many long for; living among them is something you cannot choose to 
do. To see the glowing patterns of light all around me, inside and out, to feel the position of the planets as 
they orbit the sun, to see the constellations as they drift above my head- this, is the story I wish to tell. No 
words can describe it, and no artist can depict it. My life among the stars cannot be translated; it can only 
be felt. One life at a time. This is the story I wish to tell. 

I look down. What was once a pen clutched tightly in my left hand, is now a map I have seen many times 
before- a guide to the cosmos where I now find myself. It has no pictures, no markings or text. How I 
long for someone to find me, for someone else to hold what I am holding. These are the moments where I 
look to the stars, for guidance, perhaps. I look up and ask what they are doing here. Surely, they too have 
a purpose. 

I know that somewhere, might turns to day and day turns to night. Somewhere, eons away, seasons 
change. Beauty lives in smiling faces, it howls through the wind and spreads from being to being. Planets 
rotate, somewhere, around one common sun- a sun that everyone I have ever known has shared. I can no 
longer see it, but i feel its light gently raise me up, farther, higher, further away. Up, up, up I go, past 
entirely new suns and countless specs orbiting in perfect unison. Although every star I pass is one farther 
away from home, I know I will return. 

Suddenly, I see. I see exactly what I want to write about. I see the story I want to tell.

Gently, elegantly, I drift down, following the same path to which I ascended. Down, down, down I go, 
saying hello to old friends and remembering all the places I have been. A small speck of light emits 
against the endless curtain of black. I see it grow, little
by little. I close my eyes, and open them once more. The light remains. As I pass familiar solar systems 
and drift past burning stars, I remember what it’s like to stay up there forever; I remember what it’s like to
have no star to return to, no origin from which I came. I remember what it’s like to be a very small part of
something so large that I simply could not understand it. But that is not me. Not anymore. For I now have 
a way back home. wherever I go; no matter the distance, no matter how long a journey, I can now return. 

My sun welcomes me back, and does not ask where I have been. I find my pale blue dot, and point my 
finger. “There. That is where I want to go.”
I am met with a light gravitational pull. How I longed to feel the weight of something, anything, holding 
me in place once again. I shut my eyes one last time. As I pass through clouds, and feel the wind upon my
face, I smile. I am here. Finally, I am home. 
I awake. sitting in my desk, I look around to see what has changed. Some things are new; a book now 
rests upon my nightstand. The ink of my pen has changed from blue to black. A small rocket ship is 
etched in pencil in the corner of my page. I smile. 
Thanking the stars for allowing my visit, and promising to someday return, I pick up my pen and begin to 
write.",06Apr2020,1
141,"Hello, sorry if I make any grammar/spelling mistakes, English isn't my first language. Also, I apologize if this doesn't fit in this sub.

I'm 16 years old, I live with my parents and I have a pretty good life, I don't have any kind of issues with my family nor my school. However, I've been feeling really weird lately, and I don't understand why. 

It all started about 2 months ago, I was just sad but I didn't worry about it. 1 week later, I started having mental breakdowns every single night, with no reason at all. Another day my mom asked me if everything was okay, and I instantly cried. I still don't know why. I tried really hard to stop but I couldn't. And this happened two times. 

But now that we're all in quarantine, it's just getting worse, and I try to understand what's going on in my mind but I can't. At first I was just bored like pretty much everyone here, but I still did my homework (even though I procastinated a lot) and talked to my family. But then it got worse. As I'm writting this, I just stay on my bed all the gosh darn day, I don't do any of my homework and I don't want to eat anything. And I know that I can get out of bed and get my life together, but I just don't want. I'm too lazy. I can't. I also feel really down and I don't talk to anyone, I blocked all of my friends and I deleted their phone numbers. When I feel like I'm starting to feel better, I feel guilty and I do everything to feel bad again (for example, I think about all the productive things that I could have done when I was in my bed so I feel like sh*t, or I think about cringy stuff that I did in the past and tell myself how stupid I am and that I don't deserve feeling okay). I've read some articles about depression and even though I have a lot of the symptoms, I don't think that I have it, because I *know* that I can feel better, but I don't. By the way, I hear my parents argue more often, and I know that it is because of me, so it makes me feel even worse. I feel like this might just be a lack of motivation. Does anybody know what's wrong with me, please? Why do I act like this and make myself feel miserable?

My parents want me to see a doctor, too, but only because I don't eat a lot. Should I go see a doctor?",06Apr2020,1
142,So I've been seeing a lot of posts where people say they have brain chemical imbalance. My question is how come? I mean how do they come to this information? Who are the ones who determine and come to such a conclusion? A psychiatrist or other kind of specialist? Is it assumptions based on theory or physical testing is being done? I mean I've read a lot of information that it is likely that there's a relation between mental health and brain chemical levels but is there really a reliable way to measure so called chemicals?,06Apr2020,2

Anyway, for those of us who relied on routine to help cope with our issues, how is everyone doing with the interruptions to life because of the pandemic? Many of us are now furloughed, working from home, etcetera, which I know has really messed me up.

I used to have a routine where I'd snooze my alarm a couple times, get up, take my meds, get dressed, and so on before I went to work, did my morning file sync, check my email, and have my morning meeting. Now, I roll out of bed 15m at the earliest before my meeting and usually forget my meds, don't bother to eat breakfast or shower, and it's really hurting me.

146,"Hi

I will never be good at anything. I have never won an award in anything. The only hobby I like is reading. I love books. I used to write poems but they are mediocre. I also like to write in general but there are people out there to write so much better than me. Yesterday I read a friend's essay and cried because no matter how much I try, I cannot write like that. It was very well written. I like to draw and do art but I suck at it. I always have to look at a reference, even then it looks terrible. It looks like a child did it. I always have to force myself to do hobbies because I don't have any. I don't have any particular skills besides browsing the internet. I can't play an instrument.

I feel like I have disappointed my parents. I didn't do well in high school, I wish I did. I'm in college now and chose a major that I don't love anymore, and it won't pay me much. My courses are pretty easy, anyone can do them. I'm not sure what degree I want to do afterwards. I really don't know what I like.

I am not good at math. I can't help it but compare myself to others. So many families in my community have kids that are successful doctors and engineers. You would think that they're doing it for the money but they are actually passionate about it. I will never be like them. I don't even know what I want. 

I have anger issues sometimes and get really affected by what people say. Everyone in my life leaves me on read. I feel like I have no value at all.

I have disappointed myself and my parents so much.",06Apr2020,2
147,"(Cross-posting this a few different places)

Pretty much what the title says. To clarify, this doesn't happen super often, but it's been happening for a while now where suddenly I'll just start hearing people talking even though nobody is. It typically happens when one or more of the following is true:

1. It's really late at night
2. My eyes are closed
3. I'm really tired

When it's really late at night, I figure it might just be paranoia because I worry that somebody else will still be awake without my knowing or that I'll have woken them up. If I'm really tired, I figure maybe it's just exhaustion or I'm half asleep and my dreams are bleeding into reality? But there have been times where I was very well-rested, it was the middle of the day, and I closed my eyes and I could hear people talking -- even though nobody was. It differs in what it sounds like; sometimes it'll be several people speaking softly and indistinctly (as if they were far away but without sounding far away, if that makes sense) so I can't tell what they're saying, sometimes it's just one person and sounds very loud and distinct, sometimes it sounds like people I know, sometimes it sounds like people I've never met, etc. But it always comes and goes very quickly -- almost as soon as I notice it, it disappears.

Could it be stress or something? I'm not super-worried; like I said, it's fairly rare and I'm not in my 20s so chances are it's not schizophrenia. They never tell me to do things -- in fact, most of the time I can't even tell what they're saying, or if I can it's usually just a word or phrase, *maybe* a sentence and I forget it almost immediately (probably be my ADHD). Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

He has some serious trauma because of his past, and sometimes it affects our relationship, especially when we're having an argument. I would like to talk about things calmly, but he tends to overreact and he just starts to panic. He gets very melancholic. He is scared of losing me. This is very draining for me, since I have my own mental health issues that I'm dealing with.

We live in different countries, so the healthcare in his country is very different from what I'm used to. He lives in the UK. He's said that it's too expensive to go to therapy and that the psychologists and are shit. He'd need proper therapy, not just a nurse to talk with.

153,"&gt;""All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us."" \~ J.R.R Tolkien

**My interpretation**: The world is ruled by both karma and chaos, and since we cannot control everything, we should focus on the power that we do have, and use our time in the wisest manner possible.

&gt;""Yet is it far better to light the candle than to curse the darkness."" \~ William L Watkinson

**My interpretation**: No matter how bad circumstances are, or how much you would like to complain about the world, doing something positive, no matter how small, will always be the better choice.

&gt;""Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise."" \~ Victor Hugo

**My interpretation**: Just as the sun rises again every morning to cast its light and warmth back into the world, so shall our times of darkness and despair pass. All because you cannot see the light right now, it does not mean that it is gone for good. Hold on a little longer and have faith!

**My interpretation**: A key principle of stoicism is learning to accept the external factors in our lives with minimal resistance, whilst focussing on what we do have control over—our mind. The more we do this, the more resilient we will become, and the more we will be able to flow throughout life with relative ease.

&gt;""This too shall pass."" \~ Persian Adage

**My interpretation**: This old saying is an extremely useful one when going through difficult or troubling times and is almost always true. The mind has the tendency to lie to us about the transient nature of negative feelings, emotions, and beliefs, and what may seem like a never-ending thunderstorm, is really just a passing cloud with a rainbow on the other side.

&gt;""God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference."" \~ Reinhold Niebuhr

**My interpretation**: This quote is known as the Serenity Prayer, and is a profoundly simple yet wise piece of advice, which is applicate to many situations in life. When things can be changed we may require courage to overcome any fear that is holding us back, but other times simply accepting the situation is the best response. One could argue that acceptance also requires courage.

154,"Hi everyone, I am here for some guidance. I think I may suffer from some form of depression due to certain feelings I have been experiencing over the years, which have gotten stronger in the past months. 

For some back story, I lost my mother to cancer back in 2011, and wasn't allowed to see her during the 6 months leading to her death. I admit I feel betrayed and angry because of the decision my parents made to hide her from us so we don't remember her in a bad light, but I wanted to be there and I remember her in bad state when  she was still at home anyway. Following this ordeal I was told to keep living life normally, I graduated, got in a serious relationship, travelled, got a job, etc... Not once being allowed to fully express my feelings of sorrow or seeing a therapist in these 9 years. Over these 9 years I have become more shut off from people and have a problem trusting people with being my true self, so I just show my happy normal self instead. 

Things got to a head around a year ago, I left a job that my family was happy that I got (I hated it) without telling anyone, I left at the time everyday until I had a few interviews and got my current job with an airline. I didn't care what my family thought about it and I was happy I made this decision without consulting them. I also ended my relationship of almost 6 years because I was starting to feel like I would be stuck here taking care of someone and I couldn't bear the thought of feeling trapped. 

Now I am at home (due to the circumstances) on forced leave, and I feel like I am a burden on my family. I feel very low and upset sometimes at home as being here brings back some terrible memories and I have found that trying to talk to my friends about this only brings short answers from them. So what on earth can I do? I just stay in bed and out of the way, let them have the space for themselves to be comfortable, as when I am in a common space (such as the living room) they don't come to hang out there anymore. 

I am at a loss, I don't feel comfortable at home, it's not a good time to move out, I feel lonely and like a huge burden. I feel deeply unhappy and at this rate I just want to hide somewhere alone and never come back. I'm not sure what I can do at this point, if I show that I am sad or upset to anyone it's generally brushed off. I can't cry anymore and I don't want to feel like life is not what I dreamed it would be like when I was younger.",06Apr2020,1

I’m scared of dead air that’s why sometimes when they invite me somewhere, I decline and make excuses. Since own country is on lockdown, my only communication with them is messenger. I still talk to them and pretend everything is fine and push myself to tell them something but I couldn’t feel anything. I feel like I’m just fooling myself. Same goes with my family. I get annoyed easily and cry when things doesn’t go on how I want it to be. Or because of the smallest things. Even before all these, I question myself who I really am.

163,"Hi there, 

So i've always struggled with anxiety but I could cope so ignored it. This developed into a mega panic attack which made me feel like I was going crazy. Since then, I get spurts of existential intrusive thoughts, derealisation episodes lasting days, anxiety, and occasional attacks. Its really worrying and  I haven't felt the same in a while - it preoccupies a lot of my time and thoughts. 

From what i've googled I have Generalised Anxiety Disorder and i'm convinced perhaps Existential OCD. I've been to see the campus Nurse and tried to make it clear how distressing everything was and she agreed it was anxiety and prescribed SSRI's. But that was that. 

What I wanted to ask is how can I be properly diagnosed? It didn't feel like a diagnosis- I don't know what I was expecting. This might sound silly but I feel like I need some sort of validation from a professional. She didn't tell me whether she thought I had some form of mild OCD, she didn't tell me I had an anxiety *disorder*, she just followed my lead, agreed I have excessive anxiety and then prescribed some pills and that was that.. 

It doesn't feel like its enough. It seems so wishy washy, and so I have constant doubts that there's anything wrong with me and that i'm just 'self diagnosing' and because nobody has affirmed that anythings wrong with me this constituently fuels inaction until I have big attacks again which knock me back into believing something is wrong. 

Is it strange that I haven't been diagnosed as having a disorder? Or does nobody actually get 'diagnosed'.. I'm not asking for a certificate I just want to hear the words. Can I ask for this?

165,"TW/CW: abusive relationships  

Hello people of Reddit. Sorry this is an absolute novel. Hope you are all doing ok during these difficult times. I (34f) would like some advice on this tough situation my best friend is in right now. For background she and I do not live in the same country as I moved abroad for work.

So here goes. My best friend (28f) is my favourite human being. We are cousins and grew up together and we talk pretty much every day. For privacy I will refer to her as Tina in this story.

When Tina was 20, she met a guy who we’ll call Kurt, who was 26 at the time. About 10 months later they got married and 2 months after that she got pregnant. So basically, within a year she was married and pregnant.

I’m going to fast forward and leave out the meat and potatoes of their horrible horrible marriage but she went on to have two kids with this man.

Tina suffered some of the worst sexual, emotional and mental abuse I’ve heard of during the subsequent years, none of which she let on about until after she had split up with him for good. Eventually she did and I was very supportive of her choice. When she told me I played it cool but internally I was throwing a fucking party. That was 2.5 years ago. He didn’t make it easy on her, and he still continues to be a dick but at least she’s out of that situation.

This story has a happy ending for Tina though. Since she left him she has turned her life around completely. She went to therapy and has gotten great support from the local womens crisis center. She is now enrolled in college and absolutely killing it. She joined a crossfit gym and lost 40 pounds. She’s a total beast now. She’s got more energy and her sense of humour came back. She’s way more present with her kids now, who she has sole custody of (Kurt sees them every other weekend when he bothers to show up). Generally, she is feeling strong and confident and I’m so proud of the person she has grown to become through all of this.

So that’s the back story. Fast forward to now, she has a boyfried that she met at crossfit (who is awesome and a total snack btw). They recently moved in together and are slowly ironing out the kinks of their new blended family (snack has an 8 year old son).

Her oldest son who we will call Greg is now 7 and a half. Her youngest who we will call Barney is 3 and a half. Barney is doing fine; he was too young to understand most of what happened. Greg however, is not. Greg is highly intelligent and does really well in school but at home can be explosive and really knows how to be annoying. He can fly off the handle and will scream bloody murder when he is upset. Sometimes when he doesn’t get his way, he will make these high pitched screaming noises over and over and over without relent and poor Tina wants to tear all her hair out. It is so hard for her to deal with him, especially when he screams and says he wants to go see Daddy. He gets really upset when his Dad bails last minute on his weekends with them, which happens ALL THE TIME. Considering Kurt only gets to see them every other weekend, when he bails it means the kids go a month without seeing their Dad. Two months if he bails twice in a row. When Kurt bails he does so very last minute and blames his anxiety, says he’s feeling suicidal, or says because of his child support payments he cannot take his kids that weekend as he can’t afford food. Since the pandemic he has lost his job and has asked Tina to cancel his child support payments as he is out of work. Tina, also being out of work due to the pandemic, said fuck no to that.

So this past weekend, Kurt had the kids. Tina got them back this morning. Barney was fine but Greg was in a state. Since he came home, Greg has refused to speak to his mother and when she asks him a question or to do something he kind of just stares right through her. If he wants something and she says no, he will do the high pitched screaming thing. She basically said dude, until you calm down and relax, you’re in your room. Go read a book or do whatever.

I realize it is a pandemic. Everyone’s life is fucked. Greg’s school is closed (a place where normally he really excels and it’s a really positive thing in his life). He’s not been seeing his Dad regularly for the past two years. He’s adjusting to living in a new house with a new step sibling and mom’s new boyfriend. Tina thinks that Greg blames her for him not being able to see his Dad that much anymore. She obviously cannot explain to him much about what happened, but fears that Kurt is telling him all sorts of things during their weekends together.

Kurt plays the victim through everything. He cannot keep a job, is horrible with money and blames Tina for his life falling apart. Nothing is ever Kurts fault. In his mind, he was not abusive and in fact was the victim of abuse himself. One can only guess what he says about it to Greg when they do see each other. Greg is usally a mess for several days after a visit with his Dad.

So with no school, no family therapists being open or available, and Tina having the kids basically full time she is REALLY STRUGGLING and doesn’t know what to do. Greg’s behaviour has worsened and there’s just so much going on that she doesn’t know what to do. She finds herself snapping at him and not being as patient as she normally can be. I think that’s totally understandable but I have no idea what to do to help her out. I’m a first grade teacher so I’ve been helping her out with giving the kids stuff to do education wise. But this stuff which I consider to be deep emotional childhood trauma stuff, I really don’t know how to help with. And everything is shut down so she’s not got much available in the way of outside help.

So dear Redditors, help my best friend out. If any of you were in a similar situation, can you share how you coped? What strategies did you use that were helpful? Are there any youtube videos or ted talks or books or literally ANYTHING on the subject of dealing with this kind of behaviour in kids that I can share with her? I know she wants the best for her kids and loves them and I hate to see her struggle. I know this pandemic is fucking up all our lives so send a little love and support this way if you have the time. Thanks, and hope you are all stay safe at home.",06Apr2020,1

I treat people well, I work towards my future, I develop my hobbies, I look after my things and my cat. I am actually well, but I am constantly having to defend my mental health against my family because of my past and they now use that as a way to focus in on something so they don't have to deal with their own shit.

171,"**(I’m not a mental health professional.)**

After doing research and self-reflection over the years, I’ve developed my own understanding of why the fuck our brains give us fucked up suicidal thoughts. So basically, this is my interpretation.

**When do suicidal thoughts occur?**

First, there’s some kind of trigger (external or internal). For example, I may feel overwhelming loneliness. The feeling of loneliness is the trigger. Then, the brain (limbic system, specifically) reacts with “Fuck, this is so painful. I’ve activated fight or flight mode bc this feeling is so painful, we must be in DANGER.”

Then, the anxiety and depression kicks in. Something to note is how the limbic system doesn’t take any time to identify why the trigger caused distress and what actual emotion you are experiencing. The brain basically just detects a vague negative feeling, and then freaks the fuck out. It basically overreacts without even trying to understand the source of the problem. It’s lame.

**Why do we have suicidal thoughts?**

I’ve often wondered, why the hell would humans be evolved to have suicidal thoughts? It doesn’t make sense because our brains should be focused on helping us SURVIVE. Suicidal thoughts obviously don’t promote survival. The only logical answer to this question is that the limbic system is well-intentioned but dumb as fuck. The limbic system is overreacting and putting you in fight or flight mode. It’s actually trying to help you by doing this. It’s detecting danger and discomfort. The brain thinks “what is the easiest way to get rid of this pain?”. When the negative emotions are so strong, suicidal thoughts emerge because it’s the only solution that the limbic system can think of. I believe this is a normal response to deep emotional pain.

So, I think the brain ultimately wants you to survive, but it’s accustomed to overreacting to negative feelings/triggers. The brain wants you to survive but it also wants you to not experience pain. When you go into fight or flight mode, the focus is on ending the pain even if that means ending your life. It’s quite ironic because the part of the brain focused on survival is telling you to kill yourself. (My sense of humor might be terrible but I think this irony and the misguidedness of the brain is hilarious.)

**What is the point of understanding the brain’s reaction?**

I think understanding this can help you be more compassionate toward yourself. It’s not your fault you’re experiencing suicidal thoughts. I actually think it’s quite normal to have suicidal thoughts, but that doesn’t mean you have to cling to them or act on them. It’s just your brain’s normal reaction to emotional pain.

**We should be compassionate toward our silly, well-intentioned brains.**

Although I describe the brain’s overreaction as “dumb as fuck”, I shouldn’t be so derogatory. We should be compassionate toward our limbic systems. Even though the brain is sometimes horribly mistaken by suggesting suicide, the brain is ultimately trying to help. I’ve heard suggestions for thinking of the limbic system as a child that doesn’t know any better.

NOTE: I suppose this may all sound like a bummer. The bright side is that through neuroplasticity, we can consciously change the way our limbic system reacts to certain triggers. If you aren’t happy with how your brain reacts to some things, you do have the ability to change it. It takes time, effort and repetition but it is possible. 

**Suggestions for responding to suicidal thoughts:**

(IM NOT A MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST. THIS IS BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE AS A FELLOW DEPRESSED PERSON.)

When you’re in an overwhelming trance trickled with suicidal thoughts, the main thing to do is to SLOW DOWN and calm the nervous system. The key is to get out of fight or flight mode. I prefer taking deep breaths and/or listening to calming binaural beats. There are also “grounding techniques” that may help. Find what works for you.

**Look Inward to understand yourself more.**

\*\*\*\*DISCLAIMER: Please note that if you’re struggling A LOT, you may not have the energy to dig deeper into your feelings. That’s okay. If you are responding to **trauma**, investigating your emotions may not help. Trauma is complicated so I recommend seeking trauma-informed resources/counseling. Whether or not your experience is trauma-related, If the idea of looking inward is too overwhelming, you should just focus on calming your nervous system. (Then, perhaps distract yourself with positive activities/media until your mood improves.)

Anyway, If you have the mental energy, you can investigate what led to your suicidal thoughts by doing the following.

Think about what triggered all this in the first place. Identify the emotion. Write it down. Identify any external events that pushed you into a negative mood. I think it’s important to name the negative emotions you feel. We are so used to saying “I feel like shit” or “I’m depressed”, but that is so vague. I think our brains think that if we identify our actual emotions, the pain will get worse. That is not true. When we slow down, identify our emotions and allow ourselves to feel those emotions, it’s a bit easier.

For example, I may realize that the insanely uncomfortable feeling that led to my suicidal thoughts was related to vulnerability. I find that when I pinpoint the uncomfortable, triggering feeling as “vulnerability”, then I can do research or talk to my therapist about the specific challenges of vulnerability. If I don’t pinpoint the problem, then the problem is vague and it feels more overwhelming, mysterious and scary.

In my experience, I felt much more hopeless before I understood everything I wrote above. I think understanding yourself  and m human biology in general, can help mitigate the scariness of suicidal thoughts. It’s easy to think that your brain is against you but when you understand the response, it’s easy to see that the brain is trying to help in a terribly misguided way.

I hope this helps at least one person. I wish I knew this stuff when I was an extremely depressed teenager. I still struggle with suicidal thoughts especially during this quarantine. I don’t have everything figured out. All I can say is that understanding why suicidal thoughts generally occur can make the experience less scary.",06Apr2020,2
172,"So, for background, I have depression and I used to take Effexor for it. But it didn’t work for me and actually made it worse because back in December, I looked for my dads gun and put it in my mouth to see how it fits and made plans to pull the trigger the following week. I told my best friend about it and she worked with me to get me out of the house everyday so I couldn’t do that. And it worked. And eventually I had a change of heart and decided not to do it. 
But last night, I had a dream. I was walking down a dirt road in some run down neighborhood when I found someone having a kind of yard sale. I stopped to look and she had a white plastic bin and written on it was the word “Gun and Ammo”. I asked to look at it and how much it was. She opened the box and told me $20. It looked exactly like my dads gun. I asked if it worked and she told me it’s as good as new. So I bought it and I hid it from my girlfriend (who was majorly upset by what I tried to do back in December). I remember sitting in my dream, waiting for my girlfriend to leave at any moment so I could take it out and put it to my forehead. When I woke up, I was a bit... upset that it was a dream. I thought I had a gun in my closet right now. And now I want one. But I know I shouldn’t have one because of what has happened before.

178,"I’ve been living with a subdural hematoma brain injury that almost took my life years ago. I can speak and walk fine. I’m smart so a random person would never know. But mentally I’ve never been the same, I’m impulsive, depressed, filled with anxiety, my anxiety has givin me performance anxiety, (which means my dick doesn’t work even on 100mg viagra!) and my newest symptom is relentless insomnia. I’ve had to take Xanax to combat anxiety in the past but recently have been trying to wean myself off. I’ve tried all of the non benzodiazepine options for sleep aid and none (including ambien and lunesta) even work. I’m in college and hate it, it’s way to hard for me, tried the military recently and was talking to recruiters and obviously I’m a walking and talking disqualification. I’ve lived such a crazy, interesting, so out of the ordinary life. I love to talk and listen. I love art and at one point I was a glass blower, wasn’t too bad at that. But it always seems like my passion in everything is short lived. Since childhood I’ve been through trauma after trauma after trauma. I’ve only lived this long because I know my mother and my sisters would crumble. I’m so tired of living for other people and I feel like no one understands me. I can’t take anti depressants because they make all these symptoms worse. Everyone who I’ve ever loved has seemed to betray me (girlfriends and friends). I don’t know why life has thrown so many obstacles in my way. I try to be so good to people and I care so much. Shit I’ve even tried sobriety from everything and it makes no difference. I can’t get more than 750$ a month in ssi. Like I’ve explored so many different options and I’m tired of everyone being more capable and have it way easier than me. Yet they don’t understand that because they have never stepped in my shoes.",06Apr2020,2
179,"To explain this, I need to go a bit further. I had heavy depressions, borderline and schizophrenic since I was 14. As I grew older, some symptoms got better. I'm 29 now, and I'm kind of mentally healthy for about two years. No borderline, no schizo, I'm thankfully rid of it. I would describe my symptoms now as mildly depressed, but it is by far the best mental health I've ever had. 
I'm still on antidepressants, like I will be my whole life, but this doesn't bother me. In Germany it's ""Venlafaxine"" I googled what it's called in English: ""Effexor "" (?).

So, to come to my problem. All I've ever felt were extreme feelings, like pain,  sadness, fear and other negative feelings. But somehow it seems like I can't really FEEL happiness and other feelings. Today the sun is shining and I heart someone beautifully whistling in the streets. I smiled and thought the thought of happiness, but didn't feel it in my body/heart. I smile alot and would describe my charisma as friendly, quiet and positive. But feelings? Not so much. I mostly feel nothing, it's like my heart isn't connected to my brain. All I think of are the ideas of feelings in my brain, as long as the feelings aren't extreme. Same with ""soft "" negative feelings like stress for example. I can't feel the warning signs,  I just recognize that I'm really tired or nauseous when I'm stressed way too long. But I wouldn't think of myself that I'm stressed. 

When someone asks  ""how are you?"", I have no idea. I usually answer ""normal"".

Recently struggling to not feel like a failure, in almost every aspect of life. 

I was a very bright student in school but when it came to my A levels I really did tail off only achieving sub par grades, I was told by my teachers the best thing that would happen to me would be to fail and that I’m just another statistic.

I ended up working at a hotel and I’ve been there almost 4 years. When it comes to work I’m very passionate about the hospitality industry however I have been stuck on a 0hr contract since starting, repeatedly asking for a full time contract yet change of management etc has seen me slip down the line and be forgotten about yet working very hard.
I now find myself out of a job as the hotel is closed and it’s very challenging to keep occupied.

I moved out of my parents house 6 months ago however with there being no job for me I now have had to move back in to my parents with no job. I am one of 5 kids, the youngest, and with this comes a lot of expectation, my parents do not understand my situation. I used to work 60/70 hour weeks at a hotel however they insist it’s time I get a “proper job”. I couldn’t agree more however the lack of full time contract where I work it’s easy to agree with them and beat myself up over it.

Few and far between unfortunately, I have always been a popular person but when it comes to relationships I freeze, I have no confidence in myself to try and start something, now everybody is isolating it will now be a longer wait until something happens.

Currently living with my parents I find them hard to open up to , we argue a lot but considering I have comments across the dinner table of “you don’t know what work is” I find very hurtful and feel like I have no one to speak to.

I’m feeling depressed about this, any feedback is greatly appreciated, opening up anonymously helps as not many would understand my pain if I explained, trying my best to stay positive.

(Please see pic, they did not apologise). They've made me feel terrible more times than I can remember and their apologies didn't have any action behind them. I have fear of abandonment and watched them unfriend me. But now it's starting to sink in, I had an attachment to him and the story we were both writing together. I stupidly feel worthless without him even though he makes me feel worthless. I was weak and begged him to stay but he told me I made him throw glasses and punch a hole in his door.

It feels like my fault. I wish he cared about me and I could know the ideas he had for our story that we'd been developing for the two years but he deleted it and blocked me there too which is so so painful. I wish he'd reach out because he thought our friendship was good, but here I am really upset about it all while he's probably celebrating.

Pre-pandemic I was creating and building up a social network as well as looking around for possible job/study to do next year. 

Prior to that I spend around 6 years in social isolation of which 3 while being severely depressed. The other 3 years has been about relearning social skills and gaining confidence. 

The past weekend however, everything is coming down...I havent seen anyone face-to-face since measures have been put in place and it is seriously fucking up my brain. Seeing people through skype or teams isnt doing anything for me and my ambulatory worker is just through phone. 

I dont feel like I can leave the house cuz I've had a fever for about a week now, though without any symptoms of anything. My soar throat is more down to my swearing at every little thing that even dares to annoy me even the slightest....

I don't have anyone to talk to cuz my new social circle is not established at all. I have got to know people but its not that I can call them friends, there is still a lack of trust on my end towards them.

This afternoon I just lay on my bed simply because I didnt want to do anything lest it woukd bring out a burst of anger. 

I really dont want to break any of my stuff nor do I want to hurl my anger at my pets but the danger of it is there. 

I know I'm far from the only person having to deal with loneliness at the moment and I absolutely fucking hate asking for help or god forbid....express how I feel but if I don't...I may hurt my pets in a flash of anger...

I know my anger is merely a mask for all the pain and sadness in my life. The pain that no one has bothered to ask me how I'm doing aside from the ambulatory worker, despite me asking others how they were doing. 

Hsck, today I was thinking about how nice it'd be if I was in a mental institution, atleast there would be people around...

All this fucking work I done and its all falling to pieces because someone decided to eat a pengalin that ate a bat or whatever the fuck cause of it....today was the first date of measurements to be lifted ...now its the 28th of April....

I think I deserve it because I'm worthless, but I'm not near to committing anything. This is also probably a dumb place to post this hear because validation over nothing is meaningless, even though it's something we all crave. Nobody understands how worthless someone is besides themselves, and escaping that is just falling back on lies, I guess.

I don't know what I want in life. I know there isn't a point to it and that I--just like everyone else in the world--am a bundle of meat, emotions and instincts. That is something that I have accepted for a long time and it usually doesn't bother me, but sometimes I just lose the point of it all. 

&amp;#x200B;

To be frank, I'm in University because I want to find purpose or meaning. I care about money, but my goal is to do something that makes me feel good, or makes others feel good (which would make me feel good, selfish right?). My program is good and it excites me. It feels like I need to change the world to feel worthwhile, but I'm not skilled enough to do that and even if I was, what's the point in that? I probably won't feel fulfilled and even if I do, anything that I can do is pointless. 

&amp;#x200B;

This feels like a bad representation of my feelings, but I figured I'd try. The reason I'm posting is because I've felt afloat for awhile (it comes and goes). Today I was having a conversation with a friend through Facebook and voiced my beliefs about everyone being a bundle of lies, and that it's just part of who we are and the faces that we wear. My friend was fine and didn't say anything wrong, but I just felt the urge to delete facebook and all of my other apps. I waste time on them and I don't see the point anymore. We're all just talking about ourselves to other people, no matter how much we pretend otherwise or try and hide it.

Sorry for the long and rambling post. I don't know what you can say, but I just don't understand how the world has meaning and how anyone does anything. Not sure if I'm depressed, in a mood, or something else, but I don't want to talk to my family or friends about this.",06Apr2020,1

211,"Hello,

I'm not sure if these kinds of posts are warranted here, and if not I greatly apologize. My mom has progressively been getting in a state of psychosis (I think) for about a month and a half. She started watching The Bachelor back in February, and slowly started to make up stuff that was totally off the charts. It started with this show, but started to get worse and worse, until a little over a week ago, I believe she personally snapped. I never knew it would get this serious, and have felt terrible about it. At about 3:30am the day it started, I heard her screaming crying and I was scared to death. I'm home from school so I was staying at my house with my mom. I ran in there and she started talking about people physically harming her, how I wasn't her child, how family members that had been dead for years were alive and that I had been pregnant and had multiple abortions. These are just some things of course. Some are worse. Her main source of these delusions was her phone. Well my dad has been keeping her at my granddad's house where he is my granddad's personal caregiver. He has frustrated me to no end. In this time of COVID-19, the hospital situation is tough and he doesn't want her there which is completely understandable. We've called a psychiatrist, and they have prescribed her medication to help her. This past week has been absolute hell, she has had multiple moods swing, very easily aggitated and sadly she still believes these delusions. She had been taking the medication since Thursday. Well she refused to take her medication last night, and my dad didn't ask her to take it because he didn't want to argue with her. In this instance, I felt like he needed to push it because she is still not mentally stable and she believes she is being treated wrongly because she thinks she's fine. I want what's best for her but I feel like I'm hitting a brick wall with trying to do what's right. I want her to get better but be doesn't listen to what I say and my mom doesn't either. Again, I apologize if this post is not warranted here, but I had to vent somewhere about it. It's been bothering me so bad.",06Apr2020,2
212,I’ve had anxiety and depression for a while.

I think that’s something I’m always hard on myself for. I always think I’m gonna be stuck. but quarantine has made it a little harder. But like it hasn’t been too bad since I wanted to isolate myself way before this happened because I just couldn’t take being around people. I always need time to be on my own for a moment and just calm down. But now that everyone is in isolation I have people coming to me for advice. Or when I try to reach out to somebody they end up talking abt themselves and I’m the one giving them advice. I don’t want to be ignorant or selfish but it really has been making this even harder for me. It just upsets me that close people to me are struggling too and I want to help them. Sometimes I can’t and I just end up blaming myself. It makes me so anxious. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to turn them down but it really has been affecting me lately. I care abt friends and family and I want to help them and be there for them. But I feel like when they ask for me I have to mask myself and act like I’m okay so that I don’t make it all about myself.

215,"My depression hasn't been this bad since I last ran away from home.

Firstly, I wanna say that I don't plan on doing this again . I have friends who are my family and who always will be my family so I don't plan on running away. Nor do I have any 'other' intentions like I have done before for the same reason - I love them all and care for them all.

Part of the cause of my poor mental health is the isolation, I've always struggled living at home even if it's only a 'normal' holiday. I struggle to be myself at home due to transgender issues (it took me running away across half the country before they accepted my name but I still can't wear proper clothes at home) and there's nearly always a negative atmosphere which hasn't helped my mental state at all.

Another cause of my poor mental health is being scared. I've had a really bad past with friendships and with my own self and I'm scared that it's happening again . Last time this happened, it took a lot out of me and mostly destroyed who I was. Lots of people have helped bring me back up , and honestly it meant the world that I had everyone's help, but I'm scared that I'm slowly going back to who I was before and that I'm letting them down  . I also lost a lot of other friends and people I loved due to having the depression which just makes things spiral out even further.

There have been some tearful nights lately, and plenty of dramatic mood swings but I am doing my very best to get better and I am trying to get as much help as I possibly can - which is where you guys come in. University is only 5 months away and I'm sure that things can only get better from there.

I still want to figure out a lot of stuff with my mental health, and access some type of service because I am aware, just because you don't want to die doesn't mean you're okay (at least this is the case in my journey, for a lot of that is a huge thing and I'm super proud if you can get to this stage, even if you haven't yet, proud of you for keep on keeping on).

 It's just, I was suicidal for 5 years, in an awkward limbo for 2 (sometimes very suicidal, sometimes not), honestly very mentally well for 1 year but had a severe re-lapse towards the tail-end of last year. And when I FINALLY got to therapy, it helped me get past the re-lapse. But the main purpose was to get me away from a very, very suicidal mind.

Now it's weird. I fit in bipolar perfectly, BPD is also very accurate. But I am also schizoid for a pretty long periods (weeks), which is incompatible with bipolar and lately I have also short phases where my childhood personality comes back. 

Sometimes it changes within hours for few days, in these days I crave for anything constant even depression or physical pain. Usually it's (1-4) weeks of one dominant with short flashes of the others. Longest was 2,5 year long bipolar with very few flashes, which I thought I won't ever survive.

Over the past 6-8 months I've gone through some major changes in my life and I cant seem to find out why. My everything is bad now. I cant seem to focus, remember anything, or understand anything new. I cant even understand math anymore which I was really strong in and was ahead by 2 (now 1 year) years and had straight A's in and AP stats class in 9th grade and now I'm now struggling to maintain a C in pre calc and my algebra is much better than my stats. I feel I have literally no motivation to study or work anymore. I can barely read anymore and I think so freaking slow that a 6th grader could probablythink faster than me. I also cant sleep and will go to bed at 10 to fall asleep around 2 or 3. My personality has also seen a major hit over the past 6 months. I have turned from an extreme extrovert who was funny and felt like conversation to anyone was the easiest thing in the world and now I have turned into an extreme introvert that can barely speak properly or make conversation and now prefers to be alone more often. I feel I'm kind of pushing away the people that mean the most to me. I have also become more hostile and pessimistic towards others randomly. I also feel like my emotions are sometimes numb and feel I should feel (as an example) I should feel sad but I'm not. I just feel sort of uncomfortable like I want to just teleport or go back in time to get rid of any emotion that occurs. I have been diagnosed with extreme undiagnosed ADD but I'm not sure that's the only illness at play at the moment. I feel many of the following: ADD (Obviously), Bipolar disorder, ASD, and OCD.

I'm almost turned 17. I'm in transition year in school (in Ireland, it's an optional, easy going year).
I've stopped caring about school, I cant say why. I still do well naturally but I dread going.
Some days I think I'm perfectly fine and I'm happy as could be. Some days I'd cry myself to sleep with suicidal thoughts racing through my head. I never have any sense of commitment to these thoughts but they're so very real. 
Socially, I'd say I'm pretty well liked by most people in my year but I do have self confidence issues, but nothing out of the odd for a teenager. I'm pretty outgoing.
I'm uncertain if I can say I have bulimia, it wouldnt be unusual for me to purge, but I've never done it long term or lost any weight from doing so. Im pretty sure my mum has found out about it, but I deny it to her. I'm not skinny in anyway from it. 
I used to love music, I was really amazing at playing guitar for my age when I was 14, but since then I've made no progress. I started piano two years ago and have advanced pretty far, but only because I'm afraid of my teacher. I dont really enjoy playing any of my instruments anymore. I don't remember where that passion came from. I think ever since I started piano the stress of it has built up. I wish I could take a break from music, but I've built it up to be so much a part of me I feel like my parents would be disappointed. I've told my mum before I dont like my piano lessons and she'd get angry, saying thing like ""I've put so much into this and you're going to quit?"" But I dont want to quit. I can teach myself at this point. I want to take piano at my own pace, not my teachers.
Recently my brother got engaged and has asked me to play the music at his ceremony, I feel like I should be honoured but honestly I am almost angry at it. I love all of my family and they're very supportive.
Today is a good day, quite relaxed and stress free, I think the social distancing has helped as I no loner have lessons. I'd commonly fake being sick to stay out of school for no reason before, and wonder why I did it. I'd actually be annoyed at myself for doing it because it didnt make sense.
I've had a fall out with my best friend recently. It wasn't dramatic, and were still friends but were just slowly distancing and I dont know why. She started hanging out with new people in her class, not in a way that she was trying to become more popular and ditch me. It was almost the opposite. I know it's bad saying this but shes started hanging out with the weird people. I've never said anything about then to her, I'm not gonna stop her from talking to them I'm not that kind if person. It's just since then weve grown apart. She often would leave a text I sent to her on read. Or one of the two new friends would try to start a fight with me over text. I feel paranoid that they're talking about me. I have other friends of course but this has made me feel that way about everyone. Maybe secretly my friends cant stand me. It sucks.

I realise that maybe it's not best to use reddit like a therapy session, but maybe that's not really the idea. I just want an outsiders view on this. Sorry for the long thread.",06Apr2020,1

It’s not just about the out there common symptoms of repetitive activities, and perfectionism which in itself can be pretty bad if it’s out of control for some. But it’s definitely something related to how the habitual impulsivity of our mind creates certain tension in the thoughts we have every day. Thoughts, relationships, jobs,careers that take our importance and everything pretty much turns rigid, and then we get in the way to the things we need or want to do. Can you see my point?

231,"My name’s Greg, I just turned 18 a week ago, and as the title reads, I’ve recently been experiencing some very intense fits of rage. I’ve put several holes in my upstair’s walls, and likewise have begun randomly screaming obscenities to myself. 

I blow off steam by hitting baseballs and lifting, but that’s not enough to calm things down. The rage gets its worst at night and in the evening, though I don’t entirely know why. On top of this I suffer from insomnia as well, so bear that in mind. 

I’m confused in life right now, with my future, and I’m just so god damned angry all of the time with everything. I talk with friends about my mental health, but they don’t seem to care much, I suspect, so no help there.

Then my sister asked me if I was retarded because I wasn't coming out. Then they told me I would have more chores to do stacking wood by myself. (Typically a tier or two but I usually do it with my sister). Then they told me to leave because I wasn't excited or happy in the least. My mother made fun of my voice because it isn't amazingly cheerful or excited in the slightest. Then everyone told me to leave because I was ruining the mood and now I feel wonderful about being tired and bored. So now I feel like shit (I didn't read the rules I just figured this was a mental issue support website) and I honestly think about suicide all the time.

235,"Sorry if my thoughts will be all over the place.   

 I'm a bit scared because I woke up from a long ""brainfog"" and even now I don't know if I'm fully recovered or what the heck even happened because I don't know what I have even done to have this switch inside my mind. It's not a different reality that I'm living, but a life with more merit. Everything feels the same but better, my reality feels more real than ever before, music sounds more real, better, i can sense the deepnes of the melody I can see colors brighter I feel like I'm in more in place in space, I feel like my mind is working properly, but at the same time I feel so scared because I have no idea what happened in the past and affraid that I will go back because i have 0 control over it.

 So it started 2 years ago my mind ""got shut down"". I remember even now that i've read about determinism, not having free will and I remember It fucked me up really bad, because then on I felt like nothing matters, because I'm not even in control of my actions, the actions, the life I've been living is a lie, the lie of the chemicals and electric current in my brain. I woke up I wanted to study a new language but I couldn't focus at all, I couldn't enjoy anything, even if I studied words didn't stuck, days went by fast, months went by fast, I just had this mundane feeling all day long everyday for months, but yet no one in my family noticed anything, even I didn't notice anything, it felt normal in a sense but I knew something was off, something was not quiet right with me, its like I lost my personality, my dreams etc. and I thought it is normal to function like that, i still woke up everyday, i still did my daily things but I felt so soulless, so out of touch. I had OCD thoughts about what other people think of me, the interactions I had with people came back with emotions daily, even the ones I had 2 years ago it came back.  Everything felt like going 100% speed and I was going only 40%, i felt out of touch with the real world. Corona happened and I was like what? who cares? I didn't feel sadness or anything I felt nothing, i felt nothing for months because everyday felt the same, I felt the same emptiness, unableness to do anything meaningful, even if I wanted to study a language I could not bear myself to do it for a prolonged time. So I played videogames because that were the easiest things to do that gave me slight pleasure.  I also had derealisations for exampe I was sitting at a table with family and I had this weird sudden feeling that life is a simulation, the people around me were robots and everything is planned and I've been lied to. 

 A bit about myself: 25 years old male 180 cm 75 kg I excercise a few times a week mostly cardio. I sit in front of the computer everyday for 10+ hours. I dropped out of college, studied marketing &amp; commerce but felt so disconnected from people and life that I had to drop out, but planning going back to study Computer Science.

I have walked out of work a couple of times due to being embarrassed to explain myself or unable to, I know this is wrong of me and I always regret it after, but in the situation, I feel very overwhelmed. currently, I'm looking for part-time work so I can focus on bettering my mental health and study online, but it's very difficult to find work due to the coronavirus.  I currently work in a warehouse but the job is awful and I feel as if I'm due to be sacked soon like many other people working there.  My irresponsibility is disappointing my dad and giving me a horrible feeling of guilt as it also puts a strain on my girlfriend. iv tried many different antidepressants at different strengths which never really worked. I'm no longer going to see the doctor about my mental health because iv been so many times and still feel the same way.

238," 

I just want to clarify a few things before you read this post. I really enjoyed writing this post because I feel like I truly have a chance of spreading understanding and reducing ignorance around schizophrenia. The two 'beings' I talk about in this post are obviously not physically real beings. They are 'real' mentally or metaphysically, as in I experience them. They are real in the same sense that dreams are real, they are seen by the self. I don't get open eyed visuals except for typical early morning hypnagogia. I don't get auditory hallucinations other than in dreams or in rare instances of extremely random tinnitus. When on psychedelics, I still don't have auditory hallucinations but I do get some open eyed visuals. The two beings are not auditory so they instead speak to me visually. Visual communication might be hard to understand if you've never taken a psychedelic. They don't say anything to me. They show me what they want me to know through closed eye visuals and ideas.

I truthfully believe that the main causes of delusion are ignorance, overconfidence, and fear. I really doubt that all schizophrenics are delusional. Imagine growing up in a society where nearly everybody tells you that you're dangerous, mentally inferior, evil, and delusional. Don't you think that that would drive you a bit crazy? What if it gets so stressful that you start to believe it? And on top of the shame, stress, and suicidal ideation caused by societies collective gas-lighting effort, schizophrenics have one big hurdle in their way. Language is useless to them. Think about it this way. Let's say you have a speech to present. If you walk in and just give the speech normally then it should all work out ok. The people who listened will learn and the people who didn't listen will just pretend that they were listening due to conformity. However, if you announced that you were schizophrenic at the beginning of the speech, well, good luck man. Good luck because absolutely no human would listen because schizophrenics aren't seen as members of society worth listening to.

Let me start off by saying that it's obvious that many people with schizophrenia suffer. But is that suffering from the schizophrenia itself or is it from the way society treats schizophrenics? SWIM is obviously schizophrenic and sees no problem with it because it affects his life very positively. He has these entities in his head that act exactly like advisers. If he does something bad or immoral, then the beings/entities/archetypes or whatever the hell they are, will start making him feel bad through guilt, regret, shame, fear, etc.

Speaking of feelings, do you consciously make your feelings? I'm guessing most people will answer no to that. Feelings just happen to you, as if they're being served to you by the subconscious mind and it's your duty to interpret the feelings. For example, if I miss a workout day I can choose to view it as a good thing and just grind harder next workout, or I could view it as a reason to quit. I believe that life is entirely about the choices you make in it.

Speaking of choices, what makes someone suffer from schizophrenia? Think about it like this. You're born into the world and you, like other humans, start to grow and develop a personality. Throughout early childhood you have an intensely strong and visual imagination and love having it, although everything good has it's negative aspects. The imagination can be a source of great fear, shame, and cowardliness if you pussy out and don't accept it's challenges. This reminds me of a while ago when I thought ""Damn, I need to go for a ten kilometer run"". I went the whole day thinking about the run but never did it and instead played video games or wasted the time some other way. My brain punished me for that because I knew what the right choice was and I decided to make the wrong choice.

You might wonder, how and why does the brain punish me? This is how I see it. There is a force/being that has been guiding me my whole life to do the right things and follow love, learning, growth, responsibility, laughter, and all the other things that are worth struggling for. This force of good, lets call him Henry, is the force letting me write this post in hope of piquing interest in others and reducing stigma, hate, and ignorance towards schizophrenia so I can maybe one day open up to someone about it without being labeled as some useless, delusional, evil, sub par member of society. Henry is such a good dude. I associate my boy Henry with virtue, responsibility, love, sacrifice, and anything good. Henry grows stronger, hangs out with me more, loves me more, and improves my mood when I make the right choices like working out, doing homework, going out of my way for people I love, practicing ukulele, etc.

Henry is the force of good but every yin has its yang and there is indeed a force of evil. This force can be described as evil, satan, or 'the shadow', but for now we can call him Hank. This douche-bag uses fear, weakness, shame, jealousy, greed, laziness, etc. He uses these to manipulate me and make me stray away from doing good things. To give some more understanding of this Hank fellow I will try and show you how he operates. Let's say you have two plates on a table. One of the plates has plenty of good, healthy food. The other plate just has Doritos or some other junk food. This is where the advisers come in. Hank will be like ""Bruh Doritos taste better than healthy food, you can always eat healthy food some other time"". Henry will be saying ""Hank wants you to eat those Doritos because he wants you to suffer, pick that healthy plate and you'll function better in the future"". This is a very important thing to realize. Henry (good) is a man of delaying gratification and making sacrifices in the present to have a better future while Hank (bad) is a lazy, cowardly, hateful slob whose sole purpose is to make me like him. Without Hank constantly posing a threat to everyone life, things would get boring and Henry wouldn't really serve a purpose anymore. I hate to get all cringy and bring up the movie Mega Mind but writing this is reminding me a lot about how Metro Mans absence caused Mega Mind to make a new villain. A consistent battle against evil and reinforcement of virtue gives life its meaning.

People will inevitably ask ""If the hallucinations are not real, how could they possibly be helpful?"". Let's say I've oriented my entire life around hanging out with Henry and avoiding Hank. Henry is associated with good so If I hang out with him, I succeed more. Hank is everything that I do not want to be, so he belongs in my mind to make me hate the evil he is associated with. Sure they aren't real people that I can show to my friends, but maybe that's how it's supposed to be. They belong in the mind, where they guide me along my life journey. These two characters of my imagination compose the moral system that I live my life by.

Regardless of all the misunderstanding and hatred surrounding schizophrenia, I would truly, absolutely, frickin hate to be born any other way.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated. I know this is a big post but please at least read the first paragraph or skim through. I tried to make it entertaining and interesting while also explaining my ideas.",06Apr2020,1
239,"being bipolar with ADHD is hard; I feel whiny

hi i’ve never posted really. but this is just a rant because I hate to burden anyone around me. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (type 1) about a year and a half ago after five years of struggling with what I thought was just basic depression and anxiety issues. My family does not recognize mental health illness and that has undoubtedly made it harder to deal with. Last November my psychologist recommended I get an ADHD evaluation and my college funded the testing. After the long evaluation, I did end with an ADHD diagnosis with more hyperactive issues than attentive. I have been on and off of Zoloft (Sertraline) since I was 16 (currently 21) but it doesn’t seem to help as much as it used to. This time around, I have been on 150mg daily since October. In February, my psychiatrist prescribed me Adderall (Amphetamine Salts) as needed (Up to 30mg twice a day but I usually only take 15mg once a day because the 30mg interfered with my heart condition). Being home from college due to COVID-19, it has been so extremely difficult. My doctor had suggested mood stabilizers or antipsychotics before but I always said i’d rather keep trying zoloft because if my parents found out about the different medication, they would flip out and make me stop it or I would never hear the end of it. I just don’t know what to do because sitting in my house with no one that is comforting or loving or caring or understanding towards what I have going on is so trying. On top of that, the new online course format from my university has clashed severely with my ADHD. At college, I lived on my own in university housing but I had a routine, and I had physical classes and attendance to keep me accountable and on top of things. The lack of structure and routine has hindered me in trying to get work finished. I don’t blame only ADHD because I am not disabled and I deserve no pity or accommodation. I have never asked for learning/classroom accommodations after my ADHD diagnosis because I feel like it is unfair to all the other students. I just wanted to get off my chest how stressed I am because I have no one to turn to at home. I feel like such a burden to everyone. All of these “battles” I face everyday just stay to me because I can’t tell anyone without repercussions. 

TL;DR I have bipolar disorder and ADHD, with not a great home life and forced to be here due to COVID-19 pandemic.

240,"I’m 16(f) and have had really bad anxiety for the past couple of years, my trigger is public speaking, and I know it sounds cliche, but in some cases, I can’t even talk in front of my family during a party. I know that being able to present your self is one of the most important skills in life, and i (a sophomore) don’t think I can overcome this. In freshman year of high school, I missed 30 days of school trying to avoid speeches and discussions, and it came to the point where I was granted a 504 plan in school which excuses me from anything I don’t feel comfortable doing, which led to me avoiding my fears even more. Now I feel that i have fallen into an idea that I will never have to face my fears again. I question how I will get through life and sometimes think about giving up on trying, I have big goals in life, like being an anesthesiologist, but my anxiety makes me feel like it’s impossible. I have tried therapy and I absolutely hated it, I couldn’t even sit in the room alone with the therapist. Please give me advice.",06Apr2020,1
