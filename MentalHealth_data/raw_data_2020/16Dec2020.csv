0,"15M, diagnosed ADHD, Anxiety, Depression. (New account as i’m scared to post this, but i need to get this off my chest. 

My mental health has been really bad lately. I have recently had a depressive episode where i did not care about myself at all. I recently started to get better, but it’s all gone downhill again. For example, today, i have been crying so much, especially this evening, i relapsed and self harmed again after having just over two days clean. (Pardon me for this) but i fucking hate RSD (rejection sensitive dysphoria, it comes with ADHD.) Basically, someone said that my hoodie looked nice. I got home and started having intrusive thoughts and thinking that they were being sarcastic towards it and i wanted to end myself more. 
I try to tell people, such as school, as they advise to, but they don’t take me seriously because i’m a male and i don’t seem depressed. So whenever a female talks about mental health to school, they actually get taken seriously. For example, a girl a year older than me, but still in the same school year, was getting insulted (being called fat, ugly and whatnot) but i was literally crying, and they didn’t say a word to me. It’s like they ignored me. I don’t get it. School says “we are all about mental health”, but clearly not. But i cannot stop crying tonight. Now, i’m not saying girls get all of the support, but it really feels like it. They have friends who constantly reach out to them, and ask if they are ok, or they give them a hug and cheer them up, or they compliment that person. All i get is silent suffering or a friend telling me to cheer up. This is not looking for attention with that statement, i’m just stating what is true on my side. My gut says i need to self harm again just to make me feel better, but my mother is asleep and i can’t find anything that can actually inflict a cut on my arm. I have been searching for a razor / pencil sharpner for 2 days. 

I have previously attempted suicide via overdosing, but i ended up throwing up the pills and having a mental breakdown. This was 2 months ago. I want to try again, yes, and alot, but i know that if my mother finds out she will be ruined. I can’t hurt my mother like that. I don’t know what to do at this point. It’s either killing myself via jumping, (suicide will make it so i won’t be there for the grief that my mother will have on me) which i’m ok with the idea of suicide as i can’t see my mother upset. But i don’t want my mother to be upset.. Or, dealing with it in silence, the same as now. Two of my friends, out of three, know i’m suicidle. I have massive trust in them not to tell anyone, because if they do and i don’t know about it, it will make me give up on everything. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I am giving up in school, but i have my final exams coming up, as England didn’t cancel them, which in my eyes, is a really stupid idea as it only piles more stress and work, as well as homework, afterschool learning activities, things like that, onto students’ heads. I mentioned that i am diagnosed ADHD, i hate it so much. The teachers / staff at my school, don’t know how difficult it actually is for me, especially if i cannot focus. It makes me really pressured and i break down. I’m just going to end up snapping out at a teacher or having a mental breakdown during school hours. I can’t carry on with it. I’m not saying school is bad because i’m “a teenager, and they hate school”, no, as a matter of fact, i don’t mind school, but it’s crazy how much work and stress they put on our heads, and get aggressive towards us because we didn’t do our homework. It’s pathetic. The government need to re think there education system at the minute, especially in the middle of a pandemic. 

-I really do apologise for drifting off track and going onto the subject of the UK’s messed up education system, but i just really wanted to get my head off the subject of me wanting to kill myself, or atleast attempt it again. 

-Also, i apologise that there is no TL;DR, as i don’t know what to summarise all of this up, into. I just really needed to vent. But i have atleast sort of stopped crying now.",16Dec2020,1
1,"I am a 32M and I have been constantly freaking out about aging for over a decade now. There are certain times(more ""transitional"" years) where it intensifies, but in general the idea of no longer having the image associated with young people never sat well with me. I've also always been hypersensitive to the fear that women find younger guys more attractive. 

What I've realized is that I think the core issue behind this is that I consider being young a core part of my identity. Not only do I strongly identify with the undifferentiated ""still exploring"" lifestyle associated with young people, but I also find the physical appearances of young guys to be more relatable and aesthetically appealing. I've noticed this is reflected strongly in which types of characters and media I tend to prefer(e.g. I have a soft spot for anime, largely because of this I think). I've also noticed that I always feel very uncomfortable hanging out in social groups where I most others are younger than me but totally fine with groups where most others are older than me. I also feel uncomfortable with the idea of dating someone younger than me and more comfortable when they are older than me. This causes a lot of anxiety, whenever I come across women I'm attracted to I find myself obsessively worrying about their age and the older I find out they are the more happy I am.

This being the case, I feel like aging is an existential threat to my identity. Like, the prospect of losing my hair is horrifying to me. Up until now, I've managed to look like I'm 24-25, so I think that the persona I project is that of someone younger than my actual age. But when I lose my hair, my age will be visible and my persona will likely change. It feels like I will no longer be myself. Can anyone relate to this kind of feeling? I am wondering if this is a similar feeling to that of people whose gender identity doesn't match their biological sex.",16Dec2020,1
2,"A girl,12, told me she wants to kill herself

A girl,12, wants to kill herself

She told me this on Omegle, and now I’m devastated. She went on about how she’ll jump off a bridge tomorrow morning at 10:30 (British Time), and I really don’t know what to do about it. I tried so hard to talk her out of it, but she’s still adamant on killing herself. She said her mother suffers from drug abuse, and that she’s said that her daughter should’ve been an abortion. She also told me that her father died when she was 6. The girl also told me she’s been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. 

I really don’t know what to do. I’ll link the Omegle chat in the comments. Please offer me help and advice regarding what to do. How can we prevent her from committing suicide?
I’ve also posted this on r/suicidewatch and r/depression because I want to get her as much help as possible.
Any help is really appreciated. I really don’t want this girl to kill herself.",16Dec2020,1
3,"    Tea man had been feeling too lonely but he didn't want to kill himself yet. Tea man just need someone who genuinely rely on him and not out of pity. Tea man happily always accept whatever chore his parents gave him and he knows his parents at least gave him something to do because they really needed it. But it's kinda different from other than the people's that shared his blood. 

     Tea man knows he just used other people to justify that ""someone really needs me"" like volunteering to do their homeworks or things like that, but in truth he feels it was just them giving their empathy. Playing video games and watching videos on the internet makes him feel like he is wasting his time. But he also doesn't know what did he want actually other than filling the void. 

  
    Tea man actually wants to do something and get rewarded as if it is deserved, not because people just gave it because he looked like he tried his best. Now he for the first time in his life he genuinely, 100%ly don't know what to do. Tea man has some friends that he sometimes shares his worries to. But this time Tea man knows exactly what advices his friends going to give him. 

     Tea man may write a letter to himself to distract himself from the situation he currently is in. Maybe tea man will sometime spread his letter to the world for them to see, but he is not ready yet. Maybe sometime when he feels it's the time, way after he finished his letter. Maybe he will write his letter with poor wording and broken grammar's.

    Tea man kind of thinks he know what is the response of the people that read his letter to himself. But after he is ready to just release them he won't care for even the slightest. Tea man also will probably have cringes to his spine seeing his letter he made. But at least  for now he is satisfied with it.",16Dec2020,1
4,"I keep going through so many feelings and I mean like, it's stressing me out. Like half the time I'm stressing out because I want to do something, but I can't get the conviction to do something, and the rest of the time, I'm stressing out because I NEED to get something done, but I feel like I can't get up and do it, or else I'll mess it up or something, and nobody I can talk to about it understands.

It's like I can't put it into words, and it's not good like, I can't sit still or anything, but I also can't get out of bed?

6,"This is about my mom. I hate her so much. I'm sorry that it has to start off with such a bad mood but it's true. She guilt trips me and gas lights me all the time. When I tried hinting that I had mental issues because of trauma, she said I didn't have trauma because we **""got away from the problem""**. The problem being my abusive step father (thats not the only part of my trauma though). She constantly pressures me about school and I've literally developed a trigger for the phrase **""You're failing""** because of how many times she's said it. I tell her to stop saying that to me because it bothers me, and she just rubs it into my face more. Recently, my depression has been getting worse and I haven't been joining google meets for school and such. This resulted in the law threatening to fine us and now she keeps pressuring me about that as well. She said to me **""Do you want me to go to jail? Do you want your mom to go to jail?""** and then she said something about how its my fault this is happening. She constantly makes empty promises and she lies a lot. She has a smoking and drinking addiction and she tried to stop smoking but soon continued. Every time I try to talk to her about something she shouldn't be doing, she says **""I'm an adult I do what I want you're the kid you can't tell me what to do"".** I know that because I am indeed a kid, that I'm not allowed to have lots of say in stuff but I really only tried talking to her about it. Besides that, she constantly picks on me about being antisocial and stuff like that. My whole family kind of picks on me (I know most of my family is just joking but with my mom it's a different story).  Also, I can't get help because she always ignores me when I ask for stuff like that. When the eye doctor told me I needed glasses, she ignored it and said my eye sight was fine (just an example). I'm scared that if I ask to get diagnosed for depression and I ask to get professional help, she'll just blow me off and tell me something stupid like **""you're fine"".**   


Anyways, I'm sorry if this isn't actually that bad and I'm overreacting and I'm sorry if I wasted someones time. I just wanted to talk about it (I've talked about it with friends but dehjdebebd). Thanks for reading.",16Dec2020,1

Lately, my whole family has been pretty stressed and are mostly in a bad mood. They’re not rude or anything, but family dinners, while they used to be so fun and we were all happy and had conversations, now it’s the opposite. No one talks, my brother is stressed with school and seems very irritable. Little things like the lighting are just making me feel down. 

It’s been like this since the start of December mostly, or maybe late November. I know it’s temporary, and everyone has a reason for not always being in their best mood, I completely sympathize for them. It’s just taking a toll on my mood. Even if I’ve had a bad day, if everyone is in a good mood, it cheers me up. But on days like this, I just feel down, irritated and stressed. 

This is only a problem for me in the evening.",16Dec2020,1
10,"A friend of mine (13, female) is going to the children’s hospital in Columbus. There are a lot of rules about things like notebooks, she can’t bring her notebook because she could choke herself with the wire. This gives me the impression that she could get worse instead of better.

She is going because of major depression and problems with ADHD. She will stay for 12 hours to 3 days, and I don’t understand why so long. I have “worst case scenario” thoughts about this that she will get hurt and it will make her depression worse.

I’m really scared for her, I already prayed, has anyone gone through this? If you are allowed to tell, what happened, will she be safe?

PS- Before anyone else says “Her mental health is none of your business,” I have been one of if not her most trusted friend for three years now, I love her and care for her, and I need my second hand stress calmed down.",16Dec2020,1

And if so, do you always get them when you’re anxious without fail? Do you sometimes get them when you’re not feeling anxious?

Since yesterday, I’ve had this headache that comes, stays for a few seconds, then goes; it’s happened maybe seven times-ish and it’s REALLY triggering my health anxiety (I’m not diagnosed with it officially, though). Anyway, it comes sort of randomly. A very kind user on r/askdocs replied to my post there and suggested i could be having thunderclap headaches but that might not be the case since I don’t have any other symptoms associated with them (and thankfully, too, based on what I read). 

Thunderclap headaches are said, as I read, to not always have triggers but they *can*, physical activity and injury among others. Mine, like I said, sort of come randomly but they could also be from feeling stressed or anxious. I was actually feeling a bit anxious just now and I didn’t get one, though, which is why I’m asking what I asked before. Basically, I wanted to talk to my mum about some health anxiety-related thing, including how I had that headache again moments before, but I didn’t want my dad to overhear and basically I mentioned more on r/healthanxiety.

Ive been dealing with mood swings and stuff for years and always get help. Ive been off and on different meds but now that I've stayed on meds this time i felt saddened like i wasnt on meds.

19,"Right now I'm seeing a therapist twice a week as an alternative to an intensive outpatient program with the intention to get more personalized and individualized care. (mostly as a response to being administratively discharged from a PHP program because it wasn't serving me). however it seems that every session, all I do is vent about the shit that I get triggered by and how I think it's really unfair. I'm dealing with narcissist abuse and childhood neglect and unfortunately living with my parents who have not really improved any from those behaviors and now outwardly, emotionally criticized and abuse me. I've been trying to move out but because of this economic crisis there's really not a lot of affordable rentals available. Obviously I'm also unemployed and have been to two different mental hospitals this summer. I specifically chose this therapist because she specializes in EMDR which is one of the most recommended types of therapy to heal childhood trauma. (I've done it twice with other therapist and it's helped and I know I need more of it) Yet we haven't started it and it's been probably six weeks because she says I need to get more grounded and figure out what my emotional baseline is but I'm still having these manic rages because I'm being triggered daily by my parents. I'm 37 highly-educated have a fresh master's degree and can't get a job that's part of the reason why I hate my life right now. I've tried a lot of alternative careers and lifestyles like teaching yoga, farming, child care, working in a plant nursery --they all filled my heart and spirit but not my bank account in so one by one I had to leave what I love and take an office job to survive. I've driven across the country, lived in Paris, seen the Grand canyon, hiked up a waterfall in Jamaica, blah blah blah... basically exhausted my bucket list of shit I want to see and do in my life. which also kind of led to suicidal thoughts cuz it's like what the fuck else am I even trying to do on this planet. and that's why I'm really struggling to make any progress in therapy cuz there's nothing else that feels good to try to do because our society is so fucked up. like one of the three directions in my life that I'm discussing with my therapist is to become an expat and actually leave the United States and move to a Caribbean island and run an Airbnb with a contact that I actually know and has invited me to do this. But that's not the point the point is I'm showing up to therapy high on drugs because it's joke to me. my therapist called me out on it last week and now I'm super pissed about it and that's part of the reason I want to discontinue working with her. This whole time, even before I felt suicidal, I had the thought that may be working with a personal trainer would be more effective than talk therapy. but since I live with my parents, and I was suicidal, I gave them permission to be included in my treatment plan and they've been helping pay for a lot of my doctors and they will pay for therapist not a personal trainer. I kind of like what's therapist I feel like she emphasizes with me alot when it's hard to find elsewhere. but I guess I feel like she's not really challenging me or pushing me to change I feel like she's enabling me to stay stuck. I should also mention that this is not the first therapists I've ever worked with I've been majorly depressed and seeing therapist and psychiatrist and been on medication and pursued spiritual healing for the past 17 years. I guess I have one of those conditions that's classified as treatment resistant. I've pretty much tried everything short of Ayahuasca because I think that's a cheap shortcut. Actually got really triggered recently when a guy I met in a dating capacity said that he cured his depression with one hit of LSD. I know it's really popular to talk about psychedelics as part of mental health treatment and cannabis has been part of my treatment for a long time but I've also experimented with mushrooms and LSD and MDMA recreationally have taken probably more than a dozen doses combined and I'm still depressed. I'm getting off topic though I know therapy is important and it's helped me stay alive for 17 years but I'm in a pretty different place than I've ever been in and I know that my ability for logical thinking is maybe impaired right now.",16Dec2020,1

Can this much really be co-occurring in a person, or is it just all nuance that isn't so meaningful?

It’s like working up an appetite for pizza and you finally get it and it’s cold. I feel this emptiness like I’m missing something in life and I have no clue what it is. I always want to chase the next best thing and usually for me that is finding ways to make more money, I feel like more money will fix everything.

24,"I admit that I don't adhere to social norms when it comes to appearance. I am a male in my mid 30's and have very long hair and beard. This is not due to trying to look different from everyone else and not due to a lack of self care. I have always had an admiration for this style probably as my dad looked like this in his youth. I also mix this with a very clean cut look every half a decade or so which lasts a few years.

But no matter how I look I am sickened by my own image in photos. I am not enamored with how I look in the mirror but can sort of deal with it. But when I see photos it's like I've been punched in the stomach. My head spins and I feel panicked. I lose the ability to think of anything else. I can't sleep and I dwell on individual photos for days if not weeks. There are certain photos that heavily bother me years and decades later without prompting. I feel pathetic that they do but I have to be honest with myself and it is hugely affecting my life in a negative way.

I don't think I am a vain person. But as soon as a picture comes up I'm a mental mess. I cry about it, I can't stop looking at them (like I'm trying to see myself from a different perspective so I don't feel so awful about myself) and they become a fixation in my thoughts. I am also embarrassed about people looking at me in reality and freak out when a camera is pointed at me.

I really hope I'm not a narcissistic person as I believe my personality to be different to that and I also don't think I'm shallow, I try not to judge anyone else at all. 

So what's going on? Why am I so affected and bothered by photos of myself, why do I think I look so repulsive and ridiculous, why do I even care that I do and what can I do about it?

I decided to cut drinking, so I stopped this month and didn't drink anything since 30/11. I'm not dependent on booze but still, I became more irritated and anxious. Drinking a lot of beer every evening was my way to cope with boredom, anxiety, stress, and bad mood.  So I started to go for long walks almost every day, something between 4  and 10 kilometers. And it really helps me to deal with bad emotions. It clears my mind, calms me, and makes my mood better.

When  I was depressed in August, it was hard for me to deal with daily duties. I didn't study, left my temporary work (I was paid well but the work was stressful and I just couldn't function). My apartment was messed up. Sometimes I tried to ""get my shit together"", and cleaned the apartment, but it happened once in a while when I had a little more energy. And sometimes I went for a walk in the evening. It was hard because I was tired all the time, but sometimes I succeeded to force myself to do it, and when I did, I felt better. At least I felt less shitty.

Walk, walk, walk. Walk in the city, walk in nature, walk with or without music. This is good for your health, both physical and mental. It won't cure your problems, but it can help you to feel better. Even a little help is help. I know some of you are just not able to get out of bed, but if you're able to, it's worth trying. Good luck and keep care of yourself.

P.S. If you have enough energy, run. Especially if you don't want to spend too much time. 20-30 minutes of running will definitely make you feel a bit better",16Dec2020,1

I get 10 hours of sleep on average on average as I have a gene of narcolepsy. So I need it to feel refreshed.

But I feel very motivated to make my life better but while working I don’t feel like how I used to in having as much enthusiasm. And there’s no reason for me to be sad, I just don’t feel well, thoughtout the day I have dead eyes in that there always half open now by default. 

How can I help myself, I take 15 mg of Celexa but I tried 30mg with no noticeable increase in my well being. And I actually don’t think the celexa is doing much for me as I haven’t noticed any improvement, since taking it 3 months ago. My memory is also poorer than it used to be.

They’re showing sui*cdal tendencies, have an eating disorder, major anxiety that leads them to puke and stay up, and despite their parents offering therapy they are uncomfortable in seeking it. I don’t know what to do. I say what feels right, what I think will help, but I can only do so much. I am afraid that the things I say will trigger something. I strongly urge them to try therapy at least once, but they’re constantly afraid of ending up in a mental hospital, and tell me that they’ll waste no money when they lie. I don’t know what to respond to that, is it possibly true? I just really want to help. I care deeply about all my friends and I’m very concerned ..",16Dec2020,1

I went for a walk, spoke to friends and finished my final paper of the semester. I just submitted it and now i’m done with my associates degree. 

While it doesn’t feel like much of an accomplishment, I am proud I got through it. I am proud that I am here even though life can seem unbearable. Now I move on to my bachelors and see where the rest of my future takes me.

Dad moved to Baltimore, met his gf. Moved in with my mom in my home town. Sees dad on weekends. July, my very close Nanna. (Moms mom) died. She died of breast cancer. Schoo
Starts in September, my best friends ignore me. (Let’s call them amy and Julie) Iv been friends with them sense 3rd, and they have been friends sense they where babies. There the popular ones, I’m not really. All of my Old friends ignore me and talk to them. Another month of school. Amy dates this kid (not real name) Jacob. Jacob starts bulling me, for no reason. Everybody is acting different this year, Jacob never bullied me. Never. He called me a “lib-t*rd” becasue I am a liberal. He called me a “f*ggot” and he would throw  rocks at me. Sounds boring, but anyway Amy woulnt break up with Jacob. After I told her about the things he’s done. This other girl.. (not real name) Becky, she has been my friend for a good while. She just becomes toxic. She just ruins my life. Spreads rumors. Nobody talks to me anymore. Nobody texts me. I text first. At this point my dad is worried about me, and gets my to a dr. I have depression and adhd. I get meds. But theese meds make me feel worse. Self h*rm. I start self harming. I tell them that and now I get new meds. (Fluoxetine). My mom doesn’t seem to care at all and I feel like she can’t notice that I am suffering from this. But I start to do online Bc of the stress at school. I feel even more closed of from the world. I just can’t explain it. I can’t feel anything. I feel so angry, and i wand to just die. I want to kill. I feel numb. I don’t have simpathy, I have an RBF. So that’s fun. I want to inflict pain on to other people. I don’t care anymore. Please. I feel like I’m insane. I can take it anymore. SOEMBODY PLEASE TELL ME WHAGS WRING WITH ME. I need to know.

So my dad is switching a company, which I think because of my age he can not keep me with his insurance at that place. So yes, pretty soon I could go without insurance.   


Now he says if I continue to be suicide and self-harm, he would just call the police and not caring anything anymore.   


So I am wondering... if things do get that bad, what will happen?   


So I get to the hospital and he basically cut me off and also keep in mind that he is the only family I have in the US. I have absolutely no one to count on, no relatives, not even friends. I have no health insurance, no means, and absolutely zero income to pay for the medical bill.    
Now go with my thinking, if the hospital discharges me I will very likely become homeless, and I would rather suicide than become homeless, or another way around, been in a miserable homeless situation will drive me to suicide.

43,"To start, I guess I’ll say I’m a bit a depressed. I have not had a medical diagnosis, but I’m sure it doesn’t take an expert to realize I’m really feeling down. I wake up feeling exhausted. Unless I’m driving, I feel emotionally numb and fatigued. I am apathetic. I don’t care for holidays. I don’t talk to my parents even though we live together. I go to work, feign some amusement (think customer service smile), and then come back at 12 am feeling glum and disappointed. The cycle repeats daily except for the days I stay home to browse Reddit and sleep (usually 2-3 days per week).

I like to think this all started because of the pandemic, but deep down I’m sure it’s because of my failure. I’m a failed engineer. Left and right I see people apply for and get jobs related to their career while I sit and wait for rejections. Those people that get jobs are not outliers. Companies are still hiring engineers.

Meanwhile, I’m sitting in my car attempting gig work to pay off all kinds of debts. I make just enough to cover all my debts for the month and a few extra dollars to buy food, pay car maintenance (oil, filters, fluids, etc), and keep my bank account from reaching sub-0 to keep myself from going insane.

Whenever I stay home, I feel anxious. I want to go out and do things. But there’s nothing to do that comes to mind. I want to apply for jobs, but I feel too lazy to do that now. I want to be happy, but I can’t find a thing to cling onto. 

This all goes away after a few hours of being out or working. I get the urge to apply to jobs again when I go out, but there’s nowhere to do that. I can’t sit in a restaurant. I tried sitting in my car, but it gets too uncomfortable and gas burns up pretty quickly. The libraries are closed. The city is closed. Outside is no longer an option because it’s winter and my hands get too cold.

In all, I feel trapped in a cycle of procrastination and mediocrity. Nothing gets done and I feel anxious every time I think about it. I’m beginning to feel I wasted my time by going to college and getting loaded up with debt when I could’ve been working. I feel useless every day and honestly I see no end to this any time soon.",16Dec2020,1

I’m an athlete, so I’m good under pressure. And I’m smart, so I can slack off and still get high 80s and low 90s without trying. I think sometimes I’ll purposely not try just because when I try at things they aren’t ever perfect. I’m a huge perfectionist.

46,"  Nowadays, Social media plays a significant role in most teenagers’ lives, including you and me. A 2018 Pew Research Center survey of nearly 750 13-17-year-olds found that “97% of teens use social media platform such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat, 92% of teenagers go online every day, and [impressively] 50% of teens are addicted to social media” (“Teen Social Media Addiction”). Due to the Covid-19 outbreak, teenagers have got plenty of time to scroll through social media and improve their social media presence. Congratulation to us all! Now we all have our lavish lifestyle online. We are all happy, aren’t we?! Social media addiction damages teenagers’ mental health and boosts their depression and anxiety. 
       Social comparison is the main reason for teenagers’ depression and anxiety. “Social comparisons may seem to serve several positive functions, including self-enhancement. Frequent social comparisons, however, have a dark side” (C. L. Aberson et al.). The more engagement in social media, the more exposure to different followers’ posts that results in more people make comparisons. Besides, Teenagers tend to post only their “highlight reel” on social media to brag about the parts of their lives. So, excessively scroll through these massive followers’ posts and “like” their fake luxuries makes teenagers, including you and me, to have an upward comparison and think everyone is happier or better off than they are. That is why teenagers are depressed, including you and me. (Vries). 
Frequent upward comparison on social media not only makes teenagers depressed, but also they are more likely to experience envy (Monroe, par 2). These envious teenagers, however, are tempted to take away whatever that makes others superior to themselves, whether it is popularity or a unique talent. “And they use bullying as a tool” (Gordon). A new Pew Research Center survey finds that 59% of U.S. teens have personally experienced cyberbullying and 40% of teens have experienced cyberbullying more than twice (Anderson). Unlike face-to-face bullying, cyberbullying stays online forever, and there is no way to get rid of it. That is why most teenagers, including you and me, do not speak up after being harassed online, and they would drive into a deep depression that, in many cases, has led to suicidal attempts. I say, “Social media addiction is not worth a life at all.” How about you?!",16Dec2020,1
47,"I was in a very very bad state of depression for a long time. I didn't know what to do, everytime something helped me it would just go away somehow. comfort movies removed from streaming services, headphones breaking, loosing bonds with friends because they have more important people to talk to; it hurt. It just didn't stop.

But eventually things did get better. When your depressed small things feel like massive things. You just convince yourself that everything is terrible and will never get better

That's not a good mindset

You must do good for yourself. Take showers, take your meds, eat; drink water, it will make you feel so much better. Moping around will just make things worse and nobody wants that. You must be happy, you must be cheerful

I want you to be happy and I want you to be okay. I know what it's like way too well, but as long as you take care of yourself things will get better. You'll always have up and downs in your life but that's okay. The pain will go away. The happiness will come to you. But it won't just fall in your lap. You must do something about it. Get help, talk to people. You cant do this alone

55,"So first off i have to say im overwhelmed with gratitude right now.... Because i had my best and worst day of the year tonight. 

I moved outt on own for the 2nd time in my life this march.  My formal diagnosis are asd anxiety asthma clinical depression and essential tremors(the shakes kind of ). 

I was stuck in moms basement because one of the negative things about MY autism(theres gifts too). Is the struggle to be socialable. 

I literally had to look for 2 years tooth and nail and finally my mom realized i wasnt able to so she helped getvme my place in march. 

At first this seemed like the perfect place for me. I realized fast i cant live in a roim smaller than my old bedroom. Its above a bar. This didnt seem too bad becsuse i dint drink but i play drums so i could go to jamnights but covid shut the jam nite down like a week after i moved in. 
Lets just say its small and one of those the 4 walls are closing in on me type bachelor. 

Fast forward to december i1st. tell social work i need help aquiring a place cause the past gave me anxiety or ptsd prob anxiety. They get me in today.... I meet with a specialized housing worker she brought an lot alot of papers to sign. 
My appt gets rushed cause my dad is supposed to pick me up for a cruise in his semi truck. By the time i was with my dad my anxiety about moving out had taken a grasp of me pretty bad i got kinda manic with my pops but he handles it greatly always tells me its all good no mattervwhat. 

So i get back around 5pm tonight come upstairs and my neighbour is moving first thing i said jealous. Then it hits me his place is way nicer than mine so i pick up the phone and call landlord to see if i can get a showing from him to talk about options. My landlord says i have 2 appts 2moro for the suite but since ive been such a good tenant he would give me 1st dibs i said thank you like 3 times in 30 seconds. 

I text social work do i have the rent to do this and they respond after hours to a voicemail i thought was gonna be heard in morning. Yes rents 650 i get 1100 a month in current place but id get an extra hundred if i moved. Out so 1200. I was struggling with 500 rent and 1100 since march but i didnt aquire any debt thanks to helpful family. 

Keep in mind im gripped by my anxiety this whole time. I just kept pushing and pushing and i snaged the place. 

Got talking with la dlord again and hes says ill charge you the same for dec cause u move tomorrow. I thought like wow this is awesome. 
Ialso beforevthat part talked to him about having tonpay late cause proccessing money dosent happen overnight he said dont worry get it to me whenever. Now that was extra for sure he said youve been a percect tenant so far.

I said are you fucking serious out loud i have impulse issues as well. 

I literally was the one mainly responsible for getting this place and i didnt even reallybstop to think it was all of the top of my head. 

Of course my helpers and luck played a huge role to just come home at exactly the right time when all i day i wascoff timing wise. 20 mins latter i wouldve never noticed my neighbour moving. 

Guess that sums it up just the almagamation gave me one of those amazing but tough days. 

Where im moving is now ideal causecits bigger than my 2 previous homes. 

And stupid im not totally superficial but i despreatly need to house decorate to call it my den cant wait for 2moro i might not sleep tonight til after the move now. 

Ive always been told im very grateful but this day blew that outbof the water. 

I cant believe im being rewrded i burstvout in tears im not a cryer but i broke down when i realized my days over and i can wake up to another top of the line day 2moro havent had 2 good days comsecutivly besids vacay in march afteroving in with mom to help her at her new place 2. And the 11 years of clinical depression moderate. 

Thats all thx any responders or upvoters it goes along way to a guy like me... Take care of yourelves you cant wait for happy to come back you have to chase it like a dog and its tail. Its brutal when where going thru already brutal stuff but i just wanna say i could go darker to prove a point but im not gonna i think its proven already. Thx again see yall around",16Dec2020,1

I'm worried that I would do something to my kids someday (this may be the OCD though) even though It makes me sick to even think that it would happen.

What I did do once is that I masturbated to the thought of getting caught by my child (however again I've done idea this with many people adults, is this exhibitonism?).

Basically I think that my children would be better off if I died and I'm planning to kill myself in the next couple months after my finances are secured for them. Is this the right thing to do or am I clouded by pre-existing mental issues (namely the OCD)

57,"Ok, so, big post so get ready. Idk where to start tbh. I guess I should start on where I think my journey started. 

So, when I was around 12, I lost my two best friends and they started to bully me. I was never really liked in my class but people mostly left me alone. They basically hit a rock that made me the victim of the entire class and I distanced myself from my class. I wanted to go to school less and less, wanted to hide unter the covers until the sun goes away ans basically not talk to anybody. I also sometimes thought about hurting myself, but didn't back then. My self esteem was very low at that point. I talked to my mom and she said we'd work on this. For some time I was getting better, then, shortly before I turned 14, I met this guy. 16, and he basically ruined me. Every time I hear his name, I flinch, or on really bad days even have a panic attack. The full story is the first post on my pofile, if you really wanna know. Because of that I started cutting. It took months to come clean and it's been one and a half years since my last time now. However, I never fully got over it. As I said, the events still give me nightmares and I basically can't go a day without thinking I might be standing in front of him the next moment. 

Another thing is my home life. I never got abused, however it's ... strained. My parents, especially my mom, always had a closer relationship to my sister, that's partly on me, I'm just awkward with that. However, I always had and still have the feeling that my mom favours my older sister (she's 20, I'm 16) whenever we had a fight she'd always take her side, and despite knowing I was right, they always made me feel guilty about it. My mom was mad at me for things I didn't understand (stuff like eating the last pizza, YES that actually happened). I honestly wanted to move out as soon as I could. Me and mom had a long talk few months ago, and things seemed to go better. However, they snap at me very easily. Dad did just yesterday and I cried in my room for half an hour because I can't deal with people snapping at me and I thought it was my fault (even though it really wasn't). When I am emotional, I need some time to calm myself, however my mother doesn't get that and pressures me to answer her when I'm literally crying my eyes out and can't get a word out. 

This whole mental instability has led to me having intrusive thoughts. Thoughts I sometimes don't mind. Thoughts I sometimes wish to act on. I know I should go to a psychologist, however there aren't really good once in my city and my parents would probably have a problem with having to drive me all the time. I also still have some suicidal thoughts sometimes, especially when my past history of self harm and that stuff with that guy gets triggered. Just something that emotionally distresses me sends me into an instant episode. I don't think that's normal

I honestly don't even know what I'm trying to achieve with this post. Maybe some kind words? Maybe advice? Maybe I'm just venting? Idk. I'm having another episode and I'm just trying to cope with that right now.",16Dec2020,1

60,"I keep getting into a bad cycle of thinking and I don’t know what to do about it. I have atrocious social skills and because of that I don’t have many friends. On top of that the few friends I’ve been able to make the last few years have mostly either stopped talking to me (in part due to being annoyed at my lack of social awareness) or I had to cut out because they were being toxic to a degree that it was destroying my mental health. 

Cause of that I just feel like giving up, that no one is going to like me no matter how much I try. People tell me they like me then they just completely ignore me, I’m just someone everyone forgets unless I’m the punching bag.

It’s not like I’m not trying to work on my social skills/awareness but I think some undiagnosed issues are making it much harder until I can sort it out. And it’s also a bit hard when I can’t really talk to anyone, the loneliness is just getting to me. 

Along with that I have such a hard time talking to my therapist about this stuff cause while right now I’m feeling this, even an hour from now I’ll be worried I’m making this all up or that I’m just exaggerating my low moments, except it happens almost every day. 


I don’t know what to do with these feelings, and I have no idea how to express them, I can’t even really tell if any of what I just said makes any sense. But it just keeps happening.",16Dec2020,1
61,"Can anyone relate to this:

When I am sitting in my room (before the youngest child's bedtime) and browsing Reddit or watching a movie, I can almost fall asleep...and I have nodded off a couple times already tonight. It is so easy for me to fall asleep. BUT...then we finally get into bed and turn the lights out, I find that the first ten minutes, I can almost fall asleep (my hubby rubs my feet every night to calm me), but then after he is done, there are only about five more minutes that I am sleepy. After that, I snap wide awake again and I can't settle myself back down to sleepiness unless I put my music on, and I can't do that right now because my phone charger is broken and my phone is at 10% right now. The cord charges somewhat but it is slow and it drains faster than it charges, so it won't last.  


It is so annoying that I lay down now (lights on, computer on, phone charging) and I can easily fall asleep, but then when it is dark, I CAN NOT. Grrr.  


Anyone else have anything like this?   


Edit: I also wake up after about two hours after I finally do fall asleep, but that is because if I am laying on my back, my acid reflux is ok and quiet...as long as I don't move. As soon as I move, I get burning all the way up my throat and it hurts like a muddertrucker. I have to get up and drink milk, or it will keep on happening all night. It hurts and I don't sleep well...and yeah, I have to see my regular doctor, but they want to do an endoscopy (?) to see if I have an ulcer and I don't want to go. :( I am scared to death of being put to sleep again.

63,"So I was diagnosed with BPD, OCD, and ADHD combined type by psychiatrists and primary care doctor, and currently, on medications for mood swings, anxiety, and ADHD.

I recently did the full neuropsychological evalutaion by a clinical psychologist including numerous questionnaires about asking how I feel about myself, attention symptoms, and some computerized tests, pattern tests, reciting numbers tests, etc over 3 weeks and 6-8 hours.

And basically, for my result, I was told that I have a major depressive disorder with mixed features and traits of BPD and ADHD NOS. Apparently, because I'm an adult and I have comorbidities, even though I meet the criteria of ADHD combined type, she gave me NOS because she wasn't able to tell where the symptoms are coming from.

But, I just don't understand how I can have a major depressive disorder when I don't feel depressed at all?! Or I've never been depressed more than a few hours?

I'm more like a very happy and jumpy person most of the time, I found genuine happiness from little things like sunny weather, or going grocery shopping. And If I get sad or upset it will never be longer than 2-3 hours and I will be happy again. And this was the reason why my psychiatrist told me I do not have major depressive or bipolar disorders but emotional dysregulations (BPD traits and ADHD).

So now I'm confused. The psychologist tried to explain to me saying that I don't have the ""stereotypical depression"", but just a mild one with mixed features, and also she told me something like I have kinds of ""bipolar"" with it. But I just lost words because I or my family would never think I would have depression.

And then the fact that when I told her I've been on ADHD medications and it's working great for me, she told me something like if the medication is working, then I have ADHD, and that probably my depression and anxiety is coming from the ADHD symptoms. (But I have a friend with ADHD and reacting horribly to stimulants)

I'm just really confused. She just kept saying there is probably some underlying issues that I'm depressed, and me being happy and positive is basically the coping mechanism of my depression. And tbh, I don't even know what to say, because how can I be depressed without knowing that I'm depressed?! But if I'm happy, do I still need to find the ""underlying"" issues that cause my depression? 

This is all confusing now. I'm more confused about myself after this test. I thought I'd learn more about myself......",16Dec2020,1

So earlier today my buddy told me he wasn’t feeling well. I asked what was wrong and this is what he told me. (I asked if I could post this as he does not have Reddit)

So the other day, one of his mutual friends had passed away due to suicide. After a bit he started to feel weird, like someone was in his brain. He told me that he thinks it’s transmigration, which is the movement of a soul into another body after death. It seems similar to reincarnation. 

My friend thinks that the soul of his mutual friend is now in his brain and is speaking to him. I’m not sure what they’ve said to my friend, all I know is that my friends been having a hard time with this.

65,"I am a 17-year-old male in the USA. I do not have any medical issues nor do I have low self-esteem. 

I am asking about what I can do in order to improve my complete lack of passion and striving towards better things, my lack of social skills, my inability to feel empathy towards the majority of people, loss of interest in relationships and activities somewhat quickly, an inability to feel loss or wins (happy for doing good or sad and angry for losing), ETC. 

&amp;#x200B;

Story:

It all started when I was leaving third-grade private school towards public school. In private school, I had many friends with whom I can relate, have fun, and hang out with. I also was a happy person overall and liked to try new things and was very interested in sports. Also during this time, I did have an issue with completing schoolwork and tended to be lazy. 

During my transition into public school, I completely shut myself off from others and made only 1 somewhat awkward friend. I became disgruntled with everything and started to be indifferent to everything and only liked to play videogames. I also stopped communicating with others and often mumble and hum out sentences instead of speaking. My grades were still okay and I was starting to hate soccer and doing anything with my family. 

This continued to this day but with one exception, I am starting to procrastinate extremely badly and failed a marking period because of it. I felt indifferent towards my grades and kept saying to myself you need to do the work but I procrastinated on it. My parents got on me about it and how I basically ruined my chances to any service academy. But I thought idc, I had no chance anyway so I didn't mint it. They also got on my ass about how I don't care about anything or anyone and how I am unable to communicate with others. Along with this, (i quit soccer and many other sports along the way) they noted how I completely lacked any passion for getting better at anything and trying and how I can be okay with losing basically every single tennis tournament I participate in. 

&amp;#x200B;

My current tennis coach is trying to mentor me through these issues but it is not working or leaving a lasting impression that will make me willingly make a change in my life. I do realize that I am basically setting myself up for failure at this point but I just don't care enough about my future.",16Dec2020,1
66,"It's so hard to explain how I feel, but I just don't feel the same. I feel like I've lived several lives during this pandemic and not necessarily in a good way. Some of it was okay, and I appreciate that I've been able to see the silver lining in some things and learned to not take things for granted. However, there's been a *lot* of bad, and a lot of tears, and a *lot* of anxiety that I feel has changed me to some extent. 

Some things I expect to go back to the way they were eventually. The confidence I feel I've lost while sitting around makeup-less in pjs most of the time and rarely putting effort in will probably come back. Feeling like I'm not really that fun of a person will probably come back. Feeling like I've been quite negative will hopefully not linger too much outside of this situation. I guess I don't really expect this new anxiety to go away because it's not usually so simple.

However, we always run into situations about his mental health. I mean right now we are in this “break” which I learned I really hate and I just want to spend time with him already, but he learned he needs more time for himself. He has depression and anxiety and for the past year it has really been a struggle for him and when it is for him it is for us and me as well. Every time we argue it is because of how he DEALS with his depression and/or anxiety, whether that be not get help, cancel plans with me, skip work, spend money he cannot spend. Sometimes he even hides things behind my back like buying marijuana for example. During these times he lacks communication too so I only get one or two word responses, I never know when he will respond back and I always keep the conversation going. We usually only see each other on weekends and weekends are good for us, we are a happy “Tumblr” couple on the weekends, but weekdays are when we aren’t together, that’s usually where the arguing occurs. We had a huge convo last night on FB about him saying how he is not the right guy for me and how I deserve more and all of this stuff that usually would end with a break up, but he does not want to break up with me because I am his dream woman and I am the reason he persists, I am his world and neither do I want to break up with him. But is this healthy....? Is it healthy for a relationship to be guided by my boyfriends mental health status? Is it healthy that I blame myself for maybe not giving him the patience he needs or doubting that maybe I am not the right fit for him?

75,"**Have you ever had abrupt comments creep into your head, like ""Kill yourself"" or frequent images of you cutting off your own arm?**

**I'm just asking if this is a somewhat common side effect of stress:**

I started a new job a few months ago after being off during COVID for several months. The job is the most stressful job I've ever had, but I'm not dealing with life and death on a daily basis or a toxic workplace. I was pretty low when I was out of work, but I am also pretty low now that I am in this job which took me months to find.

Anyway, I worry about the workload, what people think of me, whether I will be fired, whether I am capable or cut out for any job.

I ruminate a lot, so I'm used to negative thoughts swirling in my head, but while I am at work, I will get thoughts in my head like, ""You should be dead"", ""I'm going to kill you"", ""Please, die"". These phrases can come up dozens of times in my day. I don't know how to describe them as different from other thoughts except that they come up suddenly as if not part of a train of thought, per se. They come on unbidden, almost like a song that you suddenly realize is stuck in your head. I'm taken aback, as if surprised when the thought comes up, then I get more depressed and anxious. I will sometimes zone out for several minutes and have a kind of waking nightmare about being fired or being found to be incompetent, and then ""awaken"" even though I was never asleep and find that reality doesn't feel much better. There are parts of the day when it's difficult to focus because of ruminations. I don't have full-on panic attacks, but I have moments when I can't do the simplest things (e.g. Today, I got halfway through zipping up my lunch bag and could not find the will to continue, which made me almost cry, but it hurt too much to cry).

**I know these thoughts and symptoms are by no means desirable, but is this not uncommon? Is it just stress? Does this go away or is this just adult life?**

I don't want to leave the job because I've never had a permanent job before and I want to prove myself, both in a career-establishing sense and in a I-have-never-been-good-enough sense. I want to be good enough to handle this job that other people in my company are able to do.",16Dec2020,1

He normally plays hockey with his friends 2-3 times per week and he was able to over the summer, but with the new restrictions here, he had to cancel this. He also hasn't been able to see his friends because of restrictions and a lot of them think zoom is stupid or don't know how it works/don't try to do online things with him when he suggests anything. He has told us he is upset and lonely but I don't know what to say or how to help. It's just the three of us and neither my mom nor I share any common hobbies he has such as playing guitar, making music, or sports. We recently lost my grandpa (mom's dad) and my mom has been preoccupied with that and distracted with the will etc so she isn't really there. I am trying to do more things with him like go on walks, watch some tv together, and go for drives around the city, but nothing I am doing seems to be enough and he keeps saying he misses his friends.

He also is beating himself up for not doing as much as he is used to and gets upset when we ask questions such as ""what are you doing today?"" because he doesn't feel like he is doing enough. Everything seems to be a bad topic and it's dividing us all (even more). Also - him and I are very different.

In high school I was never very social but never had any type of issues that hindered my day to day life. While most of my friends got jobs and seemed to “develop” into adults I was always studying. I had very few jobs and never really was taught about independence. I took every AP class I could take and worked my ass off to graduate in the top 1% of my class. I also passed every AP exam to get college credit. I got into many great schools but my dad lost his job and I didn’t have enough scholarship money to go to those schools so enrolled in the local 4 year in our city. My parents for most of my life seemed perfect. However, they reacted very negatively when I came out. Over time it has gotten better but I can no longer deny some of their toxic traits. One night in high school my mother and me got into a fight. I walked away and said she was acting like a cunt and turned around to be punched in the face. She beat me until my dad pulled her off and she kicked him in the stomach. Like my family usually does they ignored it. Over the years we have all had several breakdowns that were just ignored the next day. My parents always assured me that everyone “ acted this way” behind closed doors and that it was perfectly normal. I met my ex bf at the end of high school. I really fell hard for him and he showed me love that I really had never seen before. He didn’t yell and scream and cuss. Alas my terrible communication skills prevented me from diffusing small situations that led to me resenting him. We broke up right before he proposed. He was devastated and wants to work on things. My parents hate him. He is very introverted/ can be socially awkward and does not know how to talk to them. He also knows many of the things that they did to me that I now realize are not normal. Upon turning 20 I have noticed a shift in my behavior. I have been seeing a therapist who assured me that I have anxiety and that I need to “ take walks”. However, I am starting to feel it’s much more. Upon moving back with my family I have screaming matches constantly. I go into these blind rages where I don’t know half of what I am saying until it is over. I feel extreme guilt and remorse after. The guilt is so bad I just feel that I am a monster. My parents have allowed my 17 year old sister to move her 21 year old bf into our home. They are both extremely nasty and not clean. They bring their animals in the house and let them poop and do not clean it, leave moldy dishes in the sink, and keep our sheared bathroom nasty. I have talked to them and asked my sister to please help as she just turned 18 and should know how to pull her weight. I am greeted with the usuals “ fuck you” that gets thrown around in our house. I started to feel myself changing. Every fight was getting more and more intense. I am extremely ashamed to say that the last few have become violent. I keep trying to explain that it happens and I can barely recall or rationalize the outbursts. I am almost certain that some form of mental illness is beginning to present within me. I feel so much shame and I do not know what to do. Beyond myself, I am becoming convinced that my entire family suffers from untreated mental illness. They all react in such explosive ways that are not normal no matter how they try to claim others do the same thing. For instance, when I had one of my episodes my dad showed himself. He got in my face and said if you hit me I’m going to knock you out and show you what happens. I had not made any moves towards him or anything I was sitting down trying to calm myself. I also made a comment saying I was at the point of having myself committed. My dad misheard me thinking I said commit suicide. He then told me there was a gun in the closet and that nobody would care if I did it. He said I was an adult and could make that choice. I confronted my mother about her punching me and dragging me down the stairs as a young teen and she said that I always try to blame her. They said I’m self centered and just need to “ live my life” without drama. My dad constantly criticizes me about my gay mannerisms. Saying that if I acted “normal” I would have friends. If I complain they claim they are trying to make my life better. I have no money. No job. No bf. No other family members who are any different. I feel very alone. And my dads ruined credit won’t let me take out loans for school/living like others. I am able to attends school rn only bc of scholarships, gov loans, and living with them rent free. I can’t continue to live like this. I don’t know how much more I can take. I feel like I have a serious mental illness that is not being managed and I’m becoming afraid of myself. I have lashed out and hurt everyone who ever cared about me. If anyone has any thoughts, advice, or has known a similar situation I am open to hearing thoughts. Thank you so much",16Dec2020,1
95,"December 15. Winter is here. The skies are more grey, the sun is still there. The days get darker quicker, the sun is still there, on the other side at that time. This moment is here, we must live present in the moment and enjoy it for us. Enjoy something that has been given to us, a blessing.

  
Its been difficult at times to maintain presence and to enjoy the moment when goals have been set, time schedules need to be met and there are many things to do everyday but what I am learning is that the balance of life is, that in itself. Balance from day to day is what makes up, balance from week to week, month to month and the year in full circle. The calendar year may be coming to end but I truly hope you are not waiting for the switch of the calendar to start your ""resolutions"". You should be starting them right now, to get ready to go **FULLY IN,** once the ""new year"" changes. For me, I believe that the new year starts on my birthday, again you believe what you believe, I will believe what I do. I will still celebrate the change of the year but I am not waiting for the change of the year to start focusing on what I want now. Everything takes time though and within that resilience is where we learn how to manage our day to day, week to week, month to month, leading to the full circle of the year.

  
If you are waiting for the new year to change, start **right** now by writing down some goals that you want to start working on, **right now.** Then either later on today, tomorrow, the day after, start at the top of your list, middle, bottom, remember there is no true **structure,** but solely what structure we allow ourselves to think there is. Start working slowly on your new goals or what we have conditioned to be called ""new years resolutions"", so by the time the year switches over, you will be in FULL FOCUS for those goals and ready to conquer them Day 1. Remember, it takes time to move into what you want to work towards and that starts by beginning to work at them now, clearing space, changing day to day habits and preparing yourself.

  
**I love you.**

96,"My Highschool has regular school right now starting at 7:40 on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and no school on Wednesday except for special circumstances such as my IB class which has been required to still wake up at 7:40 and attend a special IB class for 4 hours. I need to know if I should ask the teachers to change that to later in the say (which I know is feasible) to allow us to get the sleep we need, or if it is more important to have a sleep schedule that is consistent. If any of you are experts on this subject I would greatly appreciate your input but anyone's input would be helpful as well.

97,"So in recovery and researching mental health I have been told to think back to a safe positive time in my life as a base. I've been told this is to find a solid foundation which to build my happiness. 

So my issue is that I don't really have any as far back as I can remember. My childhood wasn't really stable or happy, like many many people. 

So my question is what should I do instead of this? 
Is there another technique that can be used in place of this? Or is this basically pop phycology they shouldn't be taken seriously?",16Dec2020,1

99,"since i was young i always have had a disturbingly messy room. i had some trauma when i was young but i don’t remember the full extent of it and i somehow think it’s related but my parents don’t think so? i am unable to keep things in order and even writing this is making my eyes watery. it brings me deep distress to be in a messy space but i can’t keep it clean no matter what i do. i have special organizers, less clothes, not many things. but i just always destroy it. i feel very ashamed of this. i feel very scattered in my brain and feel like i have a lot of mental problems but no one thinks it’s a big deal. i’m really having a horrible time and don’t know where to start. just need support tbh. i feel really helpless, not just because of my room. but i’ll admit it’s hard to be at peace anywhere when i destroy everything i touch. i feel like i do the same to people. so i isolated myself by moving across the country from my family recently. which soon will destroy me to but i think that’s a good thing for them so i can’t hurt them/be a burden. i isolate myself from everyone so they don’t have to deal with me. i’m the problem. even when i’m trying my hardest. please pray for me i’m really deeply struggling with mental health and a lot of other personal issues. thank you❤️ God bless hope none of you feel like this. this is rlly the only place where i feel i can be honest and vulnerable.",16Dec2020,1
100,"Basically, I have a semi-decent life. Unlike most ppl I never had to be homeless and hungry nor live in the shady part of town where ppl die unlike friends I have. I dont have abusive parents that drank/do drugs nor gotten violence a lot like I knew a friend had. Nor did any of my parents commit suicide in front of me. However, there was something my parents did to us. They would verbal abuse me and my siblings. They hit us at times. They would belittle us and threaten us. The earliest memory I have of my dad was non existent. In my entire youth, my dad was not there bc of his job. I didn't care about that though.. In fact everytime my dad left, I knew he wouldnt get verbally violent so in fact i was kind of glad.. My parents fought everyday as a child.. I would just watch it just play out.. My mother was the only one there however she had a mental disorder. Our family do not believe in mental health so, yeah. She used to put her stress out onto us, whenever she was stressed. I remember I sucked up to her as a child bc I was the middle child, and I wanted a taste of love. As a child I was lonely my entire. Instead all I had was my siblings and internet. I was always dumb, ugly, and stupid. So my parents didn't care about me but, my other siblings. Haha. Sibling rivalry i guess... My siblings would be putting their stress from my parents on to me. I would always show my parents I was being harassed but they never believed me at all. Instead, they would beat us up if we didn't apologize to each other. I was wronged alot as a child, and it still upsets me but oh well. Right? Howeve, even in school I had selective mutism, and I didn't get along with others well. Technically I was never bullied except in Kindergarden, but my friendship with my other friends were  always so rocky. I moved school every 2 yrs I never had consistent friends. The worse part back then was that my teachers did not know that everytime they wrote bad reports about me, my parents would beat me up for bad grades or bad behaviors. As a result, I came to hate all authority figures. My parents would further degrade/humiliate me and compare me to my siblings after beating me. It was not really beating me up. They would get a ruler and threaten it in front of me. I was so anxious because of them. I remember cheating in my 4th grade tests bc I did not want to get yelled. I remember I was an impulsive liar too.. I had to lie in order to survive, so I did what i had to do.. I eventually got on the internet and I would watch YouTube videos of abuse/sadism. I didn't really realized but as a child I would watch shows where they abused other ppl and I would get a weird sense of thrill out of it. I used to beat up my youngest sibling. I would stomp on her head and beat her up. I would do it bc she was the only one who could not talk. However, I think that's where my start of my nightmare started. I still get nightmares about when I did that. Luckly for me, ive always been an emotional person.. The only reason why i hadvent lost my sanity,, but its the same reason im driving myself to a wall.. I developed bad coping systems very ocd stuff but dont want to trigger anyone so haha.. Though seriously,For a week straight I would get haunted by bad dreams to the point I got insomnia in 4th grade. I was sleep deprived in school, and my teachers thought I was doing it on purpose and decides to rat me out. Eventually, online I started talking to strangers and I would start watching videos of anime of pure sadism  of cutting vaginas and putting it in ppl mouths. I would purposely do actions my parents hate in order to get attention. It failed so I stopped completely to get their attention. I was never praised for being a good child nor getting good grades. I simply lost desire/passion as a result. My mom at her peak of anger would grab my hair and drag me downstairs. My dad at worst would punch me. It was rare for them to get that mad so this occurred like only 2 or 3 times my life. Other time my mom would often belittle me. My dad would throw light things at me. He would also belittle me and at one point told me to go and die bc I didn't listen to one direction. My friendship in middle school was so rocky bc of it. I always remained ""happy"" or i guess pretend to. Even in middle school my sadism was getting worse, and I started to talk to old guys/girls online. I guess i knew i was different when i had no interest in any genders. Instead I would be thinking about torture. They were all so sweet though. I met the right ppl. My parents in middle school would now punish us by kicking us out of the house for 30 minutes at max. They would yell at us. I never went through an emotional phase bc I was so scared to get yelled by my parents for being a teen. I developed a fear of my dad. Everytime he talked to me I started bawling my eyes out. I didn't know at the time but, I first started to cut myself. I would get a scissor and imagine what will happen if I cut myself. I did it with all my hand. It was bloody. It was a new sharp pair of scissor.  Finally, highschool hit. Im absolute at the worst peak of my life. They would not let me go outside whenever I needed to. They would blackmail me. They would belittle me. They would tell me that im trash. My dad got more physical violent. My two friends tried attempting suicide. My pet died. I got sick often. Nobody would care enough to take me to the hospital even though I was coughing blood up. Food was less frequent.   They wouldn't listen to me. Though, My sadism started to lower. But now I would imagine beating up my other pets. I really wanted to die. I still do. I would now start cutting myself on my wrist. I get frequent nightmares every day. Every month I'll have a dream of running away from my mom and my mom grabbing me and beating me up. I wanted to die. I still do. I want to escape all of this. I have to keep up my grades, deal with my abusive parents, siblings, keep up with my friends. I have no emotions anymore. Everytime I do something I get bored with it. My feelings die out. I dont know what friendship/love is. I only know fear. Everyone around me are reaching for a future, but I'm stuck in the past. I cant get over this feeling. All I can do is run away. Away to where? The only place I can run away to is heaven. Im not going to kill myself If ur wondering. Im extremely scared of dying due to my nightmares. In my nightmares I would go through a loop. Going through like 10 dreams. Exploding and getting killed. The only way to wake up in my dreams would be to get killed 10 times. Only then would I wake up in fear. I have horrendous esteem bc of my parents. Frankly, I feel so lost. Sorry for the rant. I just need someone to rant to. I cant tell my friends nor close friends bc im plastic. I can't be real, cuz I dont want to be pitied. I dont want any friends to stay with me when I'm at worst. They dont deserve to see me looking and behaving distant. Oh well... nobody will know. They can't know.....",16Dec2020,1

Because of the childhood I had at home and seeing my parents' toxic relationship at such an early age, it is really hard for me not to have obsessive thought of ""how hasn't he left me when I am like this"" or ""I hope our relationship will last"" and stuff like that.

103,"I need help with this. I've been struggling with alot of mental, emotional, and physical pain and frustration throughout the year and I've been unable to get professional help lately due to some mishap with a douche of a therapist where he put me on a blacklist that's followed by, as far as I know, all of the therapists and psychiatrists within the capital here in my country (I live in the Philippines, and I live in the capital) and I've come to believe it is a thing after making 20 more phone calls with 11 of them mentioning I'm on the list, and 9 others saying they can't help due to the pandemic... which is pretty much the same reason I was given when I was making plenty of phone calls looking for a therapist before this douche one put me in that blacklist.  


So, lately, my system's been just making me want to vent and/or express it, get it out of my system. I've tried the following, but not limited to:  


1.) Creative expression (it didn't work because it triggers my c-ptsd coupled with the part that it just reminds me even more of my situation)  
2.) Self-help (it doesn't when you know that no one's there for you anyways)  
3.) Trying to be just a lone wolf (it made me miss having company, and made me miss being part of a circle)  
4.) Socializing with people online through Discord servers and other platforms (problem is square doesn't fit the circle)  
5.) Violent expression (limited, and mostly unsatisfied and more frustrated due to limitations... such as neighbors because of noise complaints)  


I've been at it for months, I have no more friends, family and relatives haven't replied to my messages or picked up my phone calls, I'm all I got, I'm suffering from benzo withdrawal (I refused to take benzos after my previous therapist had me on them for 2 months and when I told her it made me more irritable, she had me taper it off... granted I was on just 1/4th the dosage back then...) and due to withdrawal fever that's lasted for more than a month, I can't go outside without being sent back home (I can't even get in to convenient stores because we get our temperatures checked upon entry, and 37c and up are sent home). Hospitals here are overloaded where there's prioritization now where the likes of me are sent home in favor of more serious matters... I've been living on food delivery services and what not... and it sucks my neighbors aren't the type to even want to socialize.",16Dec2020,1
104,"Please allow me to lay some stuff out and communicate this as effectively and honestly as I can to hopefully receive some legit feedback.

The main question I have is this:  Does a sociopath know that he/she is a sociopath? 

Stopping there and offering your opinion or others’ research is fine but I’ll go deeper - maybe mainly as a way to lift some of the weight of carrying that question.

On first impressions, in casual conversations, social situations, those types of environments, I’m consistently described as charming and persuasive.  People form bonds with me while I won’t remember meeting them at all.  They are of no consequence to me.  I don’t mean that to come from a place of arrogance, I am weirdly insecure, just to explain that, for whatever reason, I am unable to connect at any level to a large swath of people that feel connected to me.

And honestly, I don’t care.

When I was a child my mother, then 14, gave me up
for adoption to my grandparents.  I was very lucky to be given that opportunity and I was always aware of the situation.

I say this because of something my biological mother said to me a few weeks ago.  “You’ve always been manipulative, even when you were really young.  You’d know a weak spot and use it.  Put people against one another.”

All of that is true.

Even being successful at my job, the few employees I’ve had have gone on to tell others I’m a narcissist.  As mentioned early, I present well but I do struggle with self worth.   I’m not even sure i’m what context they view me as a narcissist.  

In relationships, my abandonment issues have lingered with me my entire life.  

I am sometimes wreckless.  Unworried of consequences and unafraid of others’ opinions.

Or am i?

The trickiest part is this.  Through all of this, I still look at myself as being a good person.  I don’t wake each day to cause pain.  I will respond to it but rarely instigate it.

I am very direct in both my public and private personas and often people misinterpret that.

So there’s my couch session.  Thanks for reading.",16Dec2020,1
105,"I desperately need advice about a huge mistake!!

I think I made a dreadful mistake 13 years ago!!

I am absolutely torturing myself here and need a way to have some opinions on this scenario. 

I need to give a background story for this to all make sense. 

I grew up in a large family. My dad was wonderful but was subjected by emotional abuse constantly by my mum. My mum was abusive to all of us, including all of my siblings. 

She would call me names daily. She neglected us and didn’t meet our basic human needs a lot of the time. To the outside world, she was an upstanding member of society. To us, she was such a cruel person and I really don’t say that lightly. She was very aggressive towards us and the depth of disgust when she spoke to us is difficult for me to convey. 

As I grew up, her abuse worsened. I managed to earn enough to leave home when I was 19 and I went completely off the rails. I was drinking very excessively and sleeping with lots of men. Sometimes because I wanted to, other times because I was taken advantage of. I felt like this was the only thing I was good for and was what men wanted. I felt worthless but having sex with people made me feel that I had some shred of value to someone. 

I can reel off story after story of scenarios where I was taken advantage of. I didn’t understand it at the time, but looking back it was so wrong. 

On this particular occasion, I am haunted by the thought that maybe I was the one to do wrong. 

My memory of the night or early morning is very vague because I was very drunk at the time and this is going back 13 years. 

Basically, there was a group of men, we were all drunk from what I can recall. There was on guy there who I touched down below. I remember doing so repeatedly but I can’t remember if it was over his clothes or under. I think it was over but I can’t say for certain. I can remember that he didn’t seem to reciprocate. I continued though. What I can’t remember is if he said anything to indicate he wanted me to stop.

I keep playing this over in my mind. Did he say “don’t” and I’ve said “but you like it don’t you” and carried on? Or something like that? The fact I can’t remember for certain really kills me. I’m also wondering why this specific incident is still in my mind. That alone makes me think that something must have been amiss. Then again, maybe I remember it because it was a rare occasion when he didn’t take things further. 

What I’m saying is, I just really don’t know, but something makes that memory jump out at me and I’m not sure what it is. 

I am really struggling with anxiety and depression and seeing a counsellor regularly for that but I’m sitting up on my own, in the middle of the night, replaying this whole thing in my mind again and again. 

Can anyone offer some words of wisdom. 

I want to be a good person and this makes me fear that I’m not. 

Thanks",16Dec2020,1
106,"Ive (27F) been with my boyfriend (28M) for over 12 years now. Last January we had a little girl who is now 11 months old. I was in denial for the longest time about my boyfriend being a narcissist, and mentally abusive. It has gotten so much worse after I bought our home and had our daughter. He sleeps on the couch by choice every night, I constantly clean up after him and what really gets me is he has no interest in helping take care of our daughter. I can’t tell you the last time he mowed our lawn, dressed our daughter, changed a diaper, or even put her to bed and he calls me derogatory names on a daily basis. Here’s where I’m going with this: I have a plan to leave him that I formed with my family. He’s toxic to me and our daughter. Even though I know I need to leave him and I know I’ll be happier without the burden of basically taking care of a man child, I’m so scared that I’ll end up alone. That I’ll never experience a love where someone respects me, cares for me, or wants to love me unconditionally. What if I’ll end up doing life alone as a single mom? My anxiety about this is so high, like I work hard and I want to find someone who also works hard and matches my efforts. What if I ask for too much or I’m just unwanted. I guess I really need some support, I’ve never felt this way or experienced this in my life, nor did I ever think I’d have to.

109,"I call it Centering because we take a mental and sensory inventory of our current environment and Centering ourselves within that precise moment.
Step 1 - Safety: Get yourself to a safe place of comfort and security.

Step 2 - Breathwork: Begin focusing on breath, walking yourself through a breathing exercise while counting, (5 seconds inhale, hold 5 seconds, exhale 5, hold 5 - then repeat). Try and breathe with your diaphragm and take an account of the movement of air going in and out of your lungs and watching your belly ebb.

Step 3 - Sensory Inventory: While doing this, try and perceive your immediate surroundings in as much detail as possible. Think of it this way, you will have five/ten minutes to try and remember as much detail as you can of your current place, (car, bedroom, bathroom, office, outside (which is the best))
-Try to visually see everything as much as possible, what are the tones of the colors, the depth of detail in a texture, the shape of everything, the devil in the detail if you will.
-Sense or physically feel everything too, the breath fluting in and out of your nostrils, is it warm or cold, is there a breeze, or some sun warming your shoulders, or an energy in the room?
-Any smells or aromas, the sea, a forest, a lingering candle scent, food, a pet, dirty clothing - it doesn't matter what it is, good or bad, you're merely taking an account of it like doing inventory. You don't care what you're counting, you're just counting.
-Hearing, this is my personal favorite. Find and listen to, attend Everything. Bird song, critters outside, the washer/dryer, people's chatter in the distant or muffled convo beyond a wall, a pet breathing, the wind rustling the leaves of a tree, traffic. Like sonar, take your attention to each sound as it resonates with you.
-Taste won't usually be too helpful here so concentrate on the other senses.

Step 4 - Mantra: Mentally or out loud repeat a mantra or prayer which resonates with you. Repeat this as you continue with the previous steps, replacing the counting with a mantra. I like;
""I am safe, secure, and loved."" or ""My breath is steady, my mind is clear and settled, my body is calm, my heart is pure, I am tranquil, safe, and loved.""

Step 5 - Memory Recall or Visualization: Recall a special memory of yours, one in which you felt safe, loved and had fun or it. Try recalling all the exacting detail as well as you're able; where you were, who if anyone you were with, how you felt (this is vital), the scenery or environment, etc. Some of us cannot do this however because the anxiety is too much, so I lean on a visualization technique instead. I recommend speaking out loud here as it will help your mind step away from the dreadful thoughts as it's tasked with speaking out loud. Paint the most perfect place to be, beachside villa or stroll or a forest sanctuary is great too. Walk yourself through the experience; the palms or pines and how they sway, barefoot walking on warm sand or cool earth, the forest canopy and the sun breaking through it and warming you, or big puffy white clouds sailing over the ocean, the sound of a stream or the ocean tide, the smell of sea water of the fresh air of the forest, etc. Paint out this place but as you do sprinkle statements such as, ""I feel so safe and loved here,"" or ""This place is my sanctuary, I feel free and my mind and body is serene,"" or ""I am loved, and I am love.""

Hope this helps, I suffered from extreme depression, anxiety, and the most torturous state of grief after the passing of my wife in 2014 but through a choice to live in a different way and do whatever was necessary to end my suffering. I was able to rise above it and now live a life of abundance, peace, manifestation, and love again. I teach this now to others and have dozens of videos explaining all the steps and I have some fun too trying to make people laugh.
I have a couple videos based solely on stress and anxiety which detail out what I've shared above in greater depth with a much better explanation and visuals. 

DM me if you'd like the link or check out my page and go from there.

There is hope for you and your struggle... there is a place, a version of you which is out there waiting for you two to merge. this future version is a person who smiles in public and it's authentic. This person laughs too, and doesn't have angst while going out in public, or speaking to another, or dread anything whatsoever. This person is confident, and secure with themselves, even proud and in love. This person helps others navigate their anxiety too!

110,"Who wouldn't be with everything that happened in my childhood and adolescence? Poverty, state custody, behavioral rehabilitation, medication, group homes, foster homes, electroencephalogram, juvie, and then back to my mom after 3 years. Then it was emotional abuse, physical abuse, verbal abuse, poverty and homelessness all before I was 18.
My sister gave me a puppy that had parvo and worms and then scolded me for crying when it died. I was made to lie to the police after my stepfather beat me one morning because he didn't like the face I was making after I woke up at 6 in the morning. Of course I'm fucking weird. I'm tired of all these bullshit standards for socialising being applied to my person. I don't throw feces, I don't do weird bullshit, I don't fetishize underage anime characters, and I have decent hygeine. I just socialise a little differently and act a little differently. I say weird shit because it amuses me. I don't always say what I should say because I don't always know what that is. I don't ask many questions because I was taught not to. Of course I'm weird.",16Dec2020,1
111,"Ok to start off I’m 16 and have pretty bad anxiety/panic disorder, along with tics associated with those. I’m on Lexapro for the anxiety, which also has the added benefit of stopping my tics almost entirely.

Me and my boyfriend of always joked about me having a bad memory, but in the past couple months I’m starting to realize it’s getting really bad. It’s gotten to the point where besides the one this year, I can’t remember a single Thanksgiving despite knowing that I’ve been to family Thanksgiving parties almost every year. 

I can list a lot more examples, but I’ll let this recent one be the last. So apparently a couple weeks ago my cat died (we had two), and my dad told me about it. I have no recollection of this, and texted him today asking if he had seen the cat recently. 

Is a shitty memory common in teens? Or should I speak with a professional?",16Dec2020,1
112,"Hello to all who may read. I doubt this is actually sadism, but perhaps extreme schadenfreudism? This does fall under mental health.
I by nature am extremely deceitful, manipulative, and persuasive. I don't do it unless needed, if I do it needlessly it's rude to me. I've been a bully before, I used to go online and bully/troll kids online for the intense satisfaction it gave me. It's almost orgasmic to see my teasing get a rise out of them. Irl I've manipulated friends and spread drama for my own enjoyment. Better if I'm the one behind the scenes. Dramatic situations make me so satisfied. Unless it becomes annoying, like people getting physical. I much prefer mind games. I love to see others in pure mental anguish, oh and it's so much better of I'm the one who caused it. I love the sounds of people screaming in pain, I love reading about human experimentation. Scientists can be so creative I love it.
I do have people in my life who do not deserve this, and I don't do it to them. I feel as punishments should be given to those who I don't know or deserve it. If my friends made me mad in some way, they would be a target. So like I said, if it's not needed it's rude. 
Something important to schadenfreudism and bullies is that they are lacking in something or are insecure. I am not insecure, I am very calm, level headed, and polite. I have an innocent outside that can persuade people with ease. To the point people who haven't known me long would believe I'd do no wrong. I also feel important and can definitely come off as egotistical. 
Lastly, I have a very poor sense of care or urgency. Most things are a burden to me, at the end of the day I can spend less energy on something if it's just gone. I have pets, but if they die, I'll be sad, but it's one less thing to worry about. People waste my time, and I hate to say it, but if I was asked if I cared about my best friend I'd have to lie. At the end of the day. I do not care",16Dec2020,1
113,So growing up I’ve had mental problems I’d say I was a “problem type child who craved too much attention” I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar depression and as of recent my friends all say I act different and I need help and I just feel so helpless and a problem. I’ve never really had suicidal thoughts before but I hate myself so dearly for what I’m becoming and I can’t even explain what it could be. I hurt my friends and I’ll even lay my hands on my boyfriend. I just feel like I’m a ticking time bomb.

I have no friends or anything because he just doesn't trust me leaving the house without him. Let me explain a little more. I am disabled from my brain cancer and treatments, and only get $600 a month from disability. We just bought a house together last year and alll he does is work his ass off just to keep us alive.

122,"So every now and again i could feel myself stop caring for people, especially friends.

As it is right now 2 out of the 3 People i talk with most are depressed and/or suicidal.  
My (selfdiagnosed) depression and anxiety are getting worse again because im beeing a therapist/emotional support for one of them. His parents dont help and he isnt convinced of the idea of therapy because it failed him once in the past.   
At this point i cant just stop talking to him because im afraid of what he would do to himself. Sometimes i think about it, my life would be so much easier and i would be way less stressed but moraly its wrong.

Half the time i also think im just helping to feel better about my pointless life and be ""a good person"" in some way.    
Im telling him im there for him but at times when im tired i would just prefer to sleep rather than having to try to talk him out of hurting himself and i feel like half the things i say are empty. I wish he would get better but there is only so much i can do. Sometimes im sick of even trying because i know it triggers me and stresses me out and i just dont got the energy for it.   
The thing i noticed especially right now again is that sometimes i feel like i couldnt care less, both of my depressed friends are thousends of miles away and technically its not my problem what they do or dont and im feeling horrible for thinking that way but i cant feel empathy at the same time, its like someone turned it off in my brain.

I had it happen before in relationships where at the end i didnt feel sad or happy anymore i just didnt feel anything for the other person anymore.   
Now i wonder what exactly is wrong with me most of the times when im with my friends im joking around and have a good time but at the same time im a emotionless b\*stard and ignore people because i dont want to deal with even more depressed stuff all the damn time.   
It could have something to do with my coping methode of trying not to think about things for to long and trying to distract myself as much as possible and not actually talk about it.

In the end this has gotten into quiet some rambling and i dont know if im really as heartless as i think or not. Sorry if some sentence strucktures dont make sense my head is all over the place.",16Dec2020,1

125,"So my friend basically is super clingy and she gets angry that I'm not clingy too yet she will get angry at me for asking her how she is? She's basically super hypocritical.

She gets so defensive every time I try to have a regular conversation with her. Like once I asked her what her music taste is like because I really like music and she said to me ""Umm... Why..."" as if I'd just asked her if her dad died. Or how I told her she has the same personality type as this celebrity and she instantly got defensive too with ""Um okay is that a bad thing.."". It's like I'm stepping on eggshells around her and I just don't want to be around her. She is also an absolute white saviour- if you don't know, it's a white person who instantly thinks they can save all people of colour from racism and act as if they understand what we go through. As a person of colour, it's annoying. I literally just said that I didn't want to hang out with her this one time and she didn't talk to me for 20 something hours because she was angry at me which had me shaking from anxiety the whole time because I have abandonment issues. She's spoiled and childish, multiple times I have tried to end our friendship and she hits me with a whole ""I'd kill myself without you"" or ""i am willing to work on this"" acting mature when she's literally a child.",16Dec2020,1
126,"Hello r/mentalhealth, these probably won’t be my final words but I want to at least get this off my chest because I have been carrying it around for years without telling anyone (well, rather having a LACK of anyone to tell it to) and I am hoping at least one person will read this so it’s at least out there.

I’m almost 21 years old and I’ve been diagnosed with clinical depression since I was 16, but I was depressed long before that. Everything I’ve tried has never worked for me, I’ve been on several different types of medication and therapy only works for a day then I regress to where I was in the first place (I have since stopped going because I was just wasting money at that point). What makes matter worse is that I have no support system in my life, my family either don't understand or they always avoid the subject when I bring it up with them, I do not have any friends (not even anyone I could go have a beer with or just talk to), and I do not have a partner (which I will touch on more later). So in other words, I’m completely and utterly alone and it scares me a lot when I think about it too much.
My life is pretty mechanical, I wake up at 3am, go to work, work, go home, attempt to keep up with hygiene,  watch netflix, go to bed, and repeat. I rarely leave my house other than to go to work and go grocery shopping, occasionally I’ll leave and go for a really long drive, but besides that my house is where I spend almost all of my time when I’m not working. Because I'm only an apprentice I make jack shit money and it brings so much stress into my life. I brought a car a year ago and have spent more then double what I've paid for it just fixing it. 
My love life is absolutely pathetic. Couple years ago i was with a manipulative chick that controlled me and played with my emotions, I left her once i woke up to what was happening. For the past year I've been very deeply in love with a girl and we have talked everyday of this past year. About 6 months ago I told her how I felt and that she ment the world to me for her to tell me she didn't feel the same, the following week was pretty tough but after that we were back to our normal selves. but about a month ago we had a very special moment were we slept together and slowly we stopped talking so much after that and there's been this slight distance between us, when I'm with her its the greatest feeling ever and I'm so happy, but when we leave I go back to feeling really distant. I tell her that I miss her and she replys with I miss hanging out with you. This makes me the most depressed and I’m just so lonely and pathetic it’s disgusting. I wouldn’t say I’m bad looking either, I’m not too overweight, I keep up with my hygiene / grooming, I dress nicely, and I try to keep some confidence. I’m also getting to an age where it’s even HARDER to find someone to date that doesn’t want to just hook up. I just want to hold hands and hug and just have someone care about me before I’m gone, but I honestly doubt that’s going to happen.
I've stopped caring about things that I used to love doing and for the past few weeks I've been really struggling as its getting worse. It started when my beloved car starting shitting itself again but really bad this time, so I thought it was about time I just got rid of it and upgraded but I'm having so much trouble trying to get a loan to get a new car and its making me so depressed.
Everything I used to love doing to take some of the edge off is taking long pointless drives and I can't do that anymore because my cars a pile of shit. I can't play games because for some reason I don't enjoy them anymore and it's keeps getting worse and worse.
I don’t see suicide as an optional thing, I’ve always seen it as an inevitability at some point, I really don’t see an alternative. Every time i get stuck in my head its always the one thing on my mind but i guess I'm just too afraid to kill myself because I'm afraid it's going to hurt and I don't have access to anything that would make it less painful.
I hope at least one person reads this so I don’t feel so alone and maybe my story can be a cautionary tale, thank you for reading and putting up with me if you made it this far. Sorry for any spelling mistakes, I just needed to get this out there",16Dec2020,1
127,"Trying to stay lean and fit in the Christmas season is going to be a nightmare than an actual holiday to enjoy.

I am a person who is a survivor of an eating disorder many years ago and the remnants of those dark days still lurk in the back of my mind especially whenever I work out and adhere to my diet because I prefer to take it seriously to see the results.

(and I must admit, I have a love/hate relationship with Christmas. They bring feelings of depression, sadness and anger and loneliness. Sometimes I do not feel festive at all and sometimes, in order to tackle these bad feelings, I indulge in food. Sometimes in Christmas food to hopefully gain that Christmas feel ... and then the battles of guilt and shame and other things pop up)

At the same time, I am also a foodie. I admit it. Food is comforting and nourishing and since I like to live in a YOLO state in many days of the year, food also happens to be one of them. I do not want to eat the same mundane meals every day. I implement cheat meals or add these tiny treats every day to slightly quench those cravings because otherwise, I might risk end up binging a whole horde of foods because it happened once or twice. 

And in truth, it is not only a lot of internal conflict to stay discipline and keep yourself in check with regards to adhering to your diet and fitness goals, but also keeping yourself in check on whether your desire to stay consistent is done out of the personal desire to stay disciplined or whether it is because of darker desires, or ones that you are not consciously aware of.

Let’s be honest, there is a very thin line between discipline and obsession and my experience with an eating disorder and OCD supports this. 

Whenever I see the slightest of results, good or bad, my mind immediately fires up to maintain control and my body reacts to it.

Sometimes whenever I feel bloated, my body is really telling me like I am gaining weight by the minute. Or whenever I eat whatever, my body is telling me that I am eating junk even though this thing could be very minute or insignificant or not that big of a deal, even though I also simultaneously was the one who wanted to indulge in it for the sake of flexibility and to temper this obsessive desire to maintain control.

And the holidays are definitely going to make this a difficult experience – same as every year.

I like many things that come during Christmas – Christmas log, minced pies, turkey and pudding. Yes, we eat in excess during the holidays and many of us encourage this.

Now I feel conficted – I really want to enjoy myself because food is good and you can only celebrate Christmas once a year.

But at the same time, two things are in the back of my mind – the desire to stay consistent to my diet because I do not want to lose all of my progress. 

And because of all the other things that I just mentioned – calories, fats, control, discipline, fear, paranoia, all of the darker voices of the eating disorder still taunting me to this very day and during Christmas season, they are definitely going to have a field day. 

I already do the best I can to keep myself in check and I must admit, it is not always easy because I am not exactly sure if I want to maintain discipline because I genuinely desire it or because these tendencies are indirectly telling me to do so (for many reasons – upbringing, social pressures, biological sensations, traumas and so on).

But Christmas – as much as I want to enjoy it, it is a huge war to persist through",16Dec2020,1
128,"He is not abusive or mean or anything lol. He is the nicest funniest most caring guy I've met. We are long distance, only buddies so far, but we call each other cute and clearly have feelings for each other. But damn, Ive learned so much about myself since growing closer to him. I am super. fucking. insecure. So insecure. I legit have so many issues. I've cried so many times over making myself believe that he doesn't like me anymore or imagining that he will leave me for someone else or just any stupid reason you can think of to cry over a boy. He didn't even do anything, my brain is just a fucking anxiety factory.

He's really into video games and stuff. I'm not really. I don't hate it, but I just don't play games. He's really into League and twitch and stuff. And I just always am thinking about all the cute girls out there who are really into gaming and have the whole gaming set up that he could fall for so easily. Also anime he is really into. I can't imagine all the cute girls out there who like gaming as well as anime fuckkkkkkk. I like those things and wanna do it too, but like i dont have the brainpower or motivation to do it. I barely have motivation to do the things that **I** enjoy...

He is quite short too for a guy. And I'm only 3 inches shorter than him. He told me he's had an ex that was even like 7 inches shorter than him. Like damn I can't stop thinking about that. I feel like I'm a giant. I feel like he'd prefer a shorter girl.

I'm so insecure that I am so sensitive to everything. It's so exhausting. And because I'm so insecure, I always overly try to make him feel good or talk only about him and his day. Like Jesus fuckkkk. Why am I like this. He's kind of aware that I'm like this and has even talked to me on the phone when I had a mental breakdown lmao, but I feel like he doesn't truly understand the extent.

129,"Compulsory sorry for typos, weird formatting etc. I'm on mobile. TL:DR at the bottom. 

I feel like I'm at the edge of a breakthrough or a breakdown. I'm failing my classes and I know its bad, I'm getting every chance to make up for it but I just do nothing. Absolutely nothing. I'm on my phone or I'm playing with my dog. If I'm not on reddit I'm on some website reading another manhwa that I'm already bored with because I know how it plays out. 

I'm literally watching myself fail and doing nothing about it. I was doing fine too! Just before September I had a solid schedule going to the gym, my sleeping pattern was A++, I was being creative 3x a week, and I was eating healthy. As the semester rolled out I saw myself let go of the good things , and I did them consciously to make up time for a full sched. Now I've hit rock bottom and I keep digging deeper. 

My brother suggested that maybe I'm just having a hard time with the new routine, with all my classes online and not being on campus. He also said that me being home 24/7 doesn't encourage any productivity especially since we don't have a home office so my workspace is limited to my bedroom, the kitchen table, or the cold basement.

On the other hand, my sister suggested that I just have terrible organizing skills. I prioritize the wrong things and end up creating problems for myself later on. Both of them suggested that this is part of my 'healing', I need to fight the urges to procrastinate and actively try to be better. 

However, I'm starting to think I have trauma with school. Dropping out of uni has been on my mind for a while but my parents keep encouraging and telling me to take it by semester. This isn't a new cycle for me, ever since I got into uni I've had a pattern where I start strong and end up ... scarred and defeated by the end of semester. 

I'm thinking that I should start seeing my therapist again. I'm hesitant since my sister told me that I already have everything (meds, techniques, support etc) and that I just have to use it properly. 

So I'm at lost, if anyone has any thought or opinions they want to share I am willing to listen (read?) . If someone is also in a similar position please tell me how you're coping, or at least let me know that I'm not alone. 

TL;DR: I'm self sabotaging and I'm not doing anything. Siblings basically say to tough it out (due to new style of learning or by applying what I learned it therapy) but I think there's something unacknowledged underneath that I need to work on with a professional.",16Dec2020,1

I’m normally really good at dealing with anger, I can forgive people and let go of my anger really easily. But today, none of my usual strategies have worked since I don’t even know why I’m angry. 

While this last year has been hell for me, I’ve had some really amazing friends to help me get through it, and these last few weeks I’ve actually been feeling at least close to ok. And I had a really amazing day yesterday, I met up with a few friends at one of their houses for an early Christmas party. I have literally no reason to feel angry, I should be feeling happy. 

I really hate feeling like this. I’m so scared that I might accidentally lash at out at a friend and say something mean.

134,"Hello Reddit, just a bit of background information. I have not been diagnosed with anything. I am female and have been with my wife for 8 years. Recently married, purchased our first home and I started a new career. All this year.
First, my mental health. I think I may have OCD, anxiety and depression. But, that’s just from google and research.
- I just don’t really care for much other than work. I have to force myself to go on outings, family occasions, etc. because I don’t want to regret not going.
- I don’t get sad often, and if I do, I’m very very sad for maybe 1-3 days. Sleeping a lot or just being sad around the house.
- I don’t want to kill myself, never have wanted to, but have wanted to just disappear. But, never had a plan to do so, I literally just want to vanish.
- Intrusive violent thoughts. I have these more often now. But, I know I’ll never follow through with these thoughts of harming people. They scare me more than anything.
- Obsessions with hobbies. I go all in with new hobbies. Most recently collecting yugioh cards. Then I know I’ll get bored and move onto the next thing. I think I’m trying to fill a void.
- Social anxiety. I don’t know how to explain it. But I don’t wanna go out or be in public or even put effort into what I look like in public. Unless I’m working. I have to almost reward myself for going out or really hype myself up.
That is all I can really think of mental health wise.
My relationship.
- I don’t want to have sex. And if I do it feels pressured. I just, don’t want to? I can’t really elaborate more on this.
- I also don’t like kissing unless I am wanting to be kissed. I love kissing my wife, but only when my brain/body wants to be kissed (I hope this makes sense).
- We are kicking goals, but I don’t feel any success from said goals. (Getting married, buying a house).
- I want kids, but I feel like my wife is wanting kids to try and fix sex issues. And idk what to do about that.
- My wife is much more affectionate than I am. And she feels like she loves me more than I love her. She says she more ‘obsessed’ than I am.

I know I need to speak to a professional, but I browse Reddit all the time and just need some opinions or personal experience with mental health affecting a relationship.

Thank you. I really do appreciate anyone taking the time to read this.",16Dec2020,1

So without all the details, I grew up in a very unstable and very toxic home. It was nothing out of the ordinary for me to be forced to pack all my bags when I was in first grade, or to for my mother to tell me she hates me, or to have alcoholism and all that comes with that in my household.

Bottom line, I had a lot of trauma in my life, walking on egg shells, living in fear, always worrying about the next crisis or fire I was going to have to put out.

I was the baby of the family. I had an older sister, she had boyfriends who got her pregnant move in and out of my house, there was just always constant drama and turmoil.

Now, at 27 years old, I look at where I am in my life, I look at other people I meet and see how far they are in their lives, and how they never had to even live remotely close to the daily struggles that I have.

While their parents were sitting down with them as a freshman in high school planning their interests and college paths and nurturing them and preparing them for adulthood, I was trying to calm an alcoholic mother down, or punching holes in the wall, or screaming and crying.

I look at myself as someone who is endlessly fascinated by life. I love to learn. I love to engage.

One way I coped with my stress and broken home lifestyle was when I was 18 I quit smoking cigarettes (funny thing to do when your 18 huh, goes to show how much adulting was going on in my world), either way, I had to save myself, and I did, I quit all cigarettes, quit all weed, quit all drinking and partying and became obsessed with self improvement, mainly in the gym. I still keep up with those habits to this day and thank god because it is such an outlet for me to manage my symptoms.

None the less, I still struggle with cptsd symptoms, still struggle with social anxiety, still struggle with dissociation and dp/dr disorders and of course with all this I struggled with feelings of deep numbing and ""what's the fucking point of anything"" depression like thinking and feeling.

I can't help but to feel...sad? regretful? angry? scared?...all of these emotions really.

Because now, I find myself VERY limited, VERY impaired.

Once a kid with ambition, work ethic, confidence, yano? A real force at some point in my life. I feel all the years upon years upon years of trauma has left me fragmented and broken, isolated and outcasted in society.

I'm 27 and I struggle with all these mental health issues daily, and I just can't help to wish and hope that I had a different upbringing and maybe this life could of been something really nice, really beautiful.

It is so hard to admit, but there is no way I am going to be able to do much of anything great, even by my own standards, when each day you wake up, you just do not know where you are going to be mentally, I could stare at a page in a book some days and spend 15 minutes trying to comprehend what the hell it is I am even reading? This is usually when I'm over stimulated which isn't hard to get me there now, and extremely dissociated, like a took an edible brownie.

I hardly graduated high school, and the last 5 years I've been stuck in a dead end job working overnights as a security guard, no health insurance, just enough money to pay my bills, and I can't seem to find a way out. I'm not entirely sure life is worth living at this point...

I look back at my younger years and want to break down and cry.

How did I get here?

I thought, yano, let me maybe try to learn to code, I hear software engineering can be really lucrative and I've taught myself how to draw at a very high academical level, maybe with some effort I can be a good software engineer or programmer, but what I'm realizing, is I come at a SEVERE disadvantage and the way my brain is operating currently, I'll be lucky to be able to just deliver pizzas.

Again, if you looked at me, you'd never know. I'm just under 6ft, most women find me very attractive, I workout almost daily, I stay on top of my nutrition, I take care of myself, ya know?

Yet my wiring, my software, which was programmed by abuse and trauma, is keeping this computer from hardly being able to function.

And that my friends, is my biggest pain, wanting to move on, but not being able to. Wanting to make a life for yourself, like we all should have the opportunity to do so, and I feel like I never got to jump, I feel like a bird in the next that never tried to fly and my wings are broken to shit.

I wonder if any of you have similar experiences?

Full of potential, full of curiosity, then...life takes the biggest left turn and you end up mentally ill, and your whole life, your whole future feels, hopeless and empty..just waiting to die it feels.",16Dec2020,1
136,"I keep seeing movement in my periphery of late. I'd guess that this is fine every once in a while, but I think I'm going above my usual baseline so I'm a little worried. It happens a couple of times in a week.

Usually what I see is kinda vague. My brain tends to jump to the assumption that it's insects or maybe my dad sneaking up on me to startle me. I generally just startle or go on-watch for a minute/check around to see if it really was something, then go back to my business.

Just earlier I was playing minesweeper on my phone and saw what I thought was a mouse. But we don't get mice here and it was gone when I looked at it directly.

So, should  be worried or is this just normal stuff?",16Dec2020,1

At the point when the beverage wears off, you feel more regrettable in light of the way liquor withdrawal indications influence your cerebrum and the remainder of your body. Drinking is anything but a decent method to oversee troublesome emotions.

Periodic light drinking is alive and well and pleasant for a great many people. 

Remain inside the suggested week by week liquor limits: 

 14 units every week for the two people 

Numerous individuals likewise smoke or use drugs or different substances to change how they feel. In any case, once more, the impacts are brief. Much the same as liquor, the more you use, the more you long for. Nicotine and medications don't manage the reasons for troublesome sentiments. They don't take care of issues, they make them. 

5. Stay in contact :

Solid family ties and steady companions can help you manage the burdens of life. Loved ones can cause you to feel included and thought about. They can offer various perspectives from anything that's going on inside your own head. They can help keep you dynamic, keep you grounded and assist you with tackling functional issues. 

There's nothing better than finding somebody up close and personal. Yet, that is not generally conceivable. Call them, drop them a note or talk to them online all things considered. Keep the lines of correspondence open. It's beneficial for you! 

In case you're feeling distant from certain individuals, glance back at our part on discussing your sentiments and begin! 

""Simply relaxing with companions loosens up me. We enjoy a chuckle and I feel better.""

6. Request help :

None of us are superhuman. We as a whole here and there get worn out or overpowered by how we feel or when things turn out badly. In the event that things are becoming a lot for you and you believe you can't adapt, request help. 

Your family or companions might have the option to offer reasonable assistance or a listening ear. Neighborhood administrations are there to help you.

A couple of moments can sufficiently be to de-stress you. Give yourself a bit of 'personal time'. 

""Once in a while when I'm perched on the transport, I let my considerations stream and it truly causes me."" 

Taking a break may mean being exceptionally dynamic. It might mean not doing particularly by any stretch of the imagination. 

Take a full breath… and unwind. Attempt yoga or contemplation, or simply resting.

It very well may be a great idea to have an interest where you're not seen as somebody's mum or father, accomplice or worker. You're simply you. 

An hour of drawing allows you to communicate innovatively. A morning on the football pitch gets you dynamic and allows you to meet new individuals. 

9. Acknowledge what your identity is :

A few of us make individuals snicker, some are acceptable at maths, others cook fabulous dinners. A few of us share our way of life with the individuals who live near us, others live in an unexpected way. 

We're all unique. It's a lot more advantageous to acknowledge that you're one of a kind than to wish you were more similar to another person. 

Liking yourself supports your certainty to learn new abilities, visit new places and make new companions. 

Great confidence encourages you adapt when life takes a troublesome turn.

141,"Hi Reddit. I do not know how to begin but if I say something wrong please forgive me because my English level isn’t good.

I’ve read something about stress recently which says that our brain is not able to understand the difference the stress which our prehistoric ancestors suffer from and the modern stress. I mean, for instance there is no difference between running from a lion and being late to work for our brains.

I am really tired of ‘running from that lion’ everyday.

If I love the sea, I should love the waves. But I can’t decide if I love being alive. Every step of my decisions in this life like is an another trouble. I can’t take risks because I am afraid of living. I don’t want to just watch the sea anymore, I want to sail.

But I can’t.

Furthermore, I know that I need professional help. I live in the UK and new here. How can I tell my story properly when I can’t speak fluently? I am 27, here in this country for about 1 year and still can’t speak English. What a shame... (Please don’t get me wrong, although I am trying to write, I can’t speak. It’s been not possible to improve my speaking, the reason is that I am afraid of judging by people because of my accent or my mistakes. I am so shy, nervous and confused while I am speaking. Maybe it is not true so maybe people won’t, I already can’t stop myself to think like that.) Another important point is that I don’t understand what people say, because I can’t listen, whenever I try to listen, I lose my focus.

Besides, even if I able to speak or listen fluently, I wouldn’t be able to pay the charge. I am having trouble even about paying my bills because I don’t have my own job (engineering) here in England. Last week my phone rang, it was a job offer. I had to say “I can’t hear clearly, please call me again later!” due to my language problem. I need an engineering job and wanted the first guy who calls me for a job to call me later. Funny! I just thought that how would I do this job even when I can’t understand or speak?

Finally, I realised that I feel more comfortable when I drink, don’t know why.

Thank you for reading and your patience. Actually, I feel more relaxed after writing all of these :)

Thank you, love you all.",16Dec2020,1

144,"I am 22 years old and male. I don't know what I can do to let go off this feeling off shame. I feel inferior to my siblings because I am ashamed for everything I do. If I see my sister or my brother I think that they believe I am such a loser. It became my identity to be a weirdo around them, I always feel the need to say something embarassing whenever they are near me. I can talk to my parents normaly but not to my sibligs. I feel like they judge me for my sexual inexperience. No matter what I do near them I feel like it doesn't matter what I do - I don t have any dignity. I want to ignore them and show them that I dont need them, I feel angry and embaressed around them. But on the other hand they seem to be a realitycheck and a reminder that I have to change my ways and make more effort in finally getting sex for validation as there seems to be no other way in order to maintain at least a neutral relationship with them. I feel like in order to get dignity I have to become a slave for my parents so I can get more respect from them and find some self worth inside of me. But is becoming a slave really the solution to make those encounters with my siblings more pleasant? I always freeze when I see them, and I look to the ground and I want to cry. My plan is to have something I can feel superior to them, thats what would give me some confidence. Will this help me with the relationship to my siblings ?  Just answer me one question can you gurantee me that my confidence will rise in the long term if I achieve a skill and will this translate in improvement of social situations like here?

He's always late, he's lazy, he sleeps through the shift, he's reckless (we work with patients and he's not always legit with them) and it's a wonder that he hasn't been fired yet. He argues about stupid things and is hated by everyone on the team.

I am frustrated with my bosses for not having taken action against him, because he truly is an anti-asset.

He's becoming the bane of my work life. Hopefully I'll change jobs soon, because I won't hold for long with him in my path.

Since I'm an Introvert, an INFJ-T to be specific, there's a lot of things I go through in my life at a daily basis. First of all, I wanna talk about my anxiety. My anxiety really sucks due to my turbulent nature. I'm really shy and neurotic and hate myself being the centre of attention in any place. I'm a socially awkward person and I get panic attacks while talking to strangers. I mostly like to stay alone in my thoughts or just with a small circle of friends/family members I'm really comfortable with. I'm a really intuitive and imaginative person and most of my times, I daydream about the future or just think about random stuffs just by myself. I also suffer from existential crisis frequently. I don't have many friends, just a few close friends as I prefer quality over quantity. My life is miserable and I often hate myself and my life. I've been the victim of emotional abuse and since I cannot just say ""no"" to people, I've been taken advantage of, a lot of times. I'm depressed, addicted to frequent masturbation, and also suffer from sleeping problems often. I mostly remain within the walls of my house spending hours watching YouTube and don't go outside unless it's really necessary. Since I possess a very rare personality which not many people in the world have, I have a hard time connecting with people. I really crave for a genuine connection in my life, a person who can understand me and listen to my problems and just accept me for what I am. I can understand and read people's minds easily but no one seems to understand me and think alike, like me. I hate small talk and try to avoid them as much as I can. I'm very perfectionistic and often dream of having an ideal life in future, although I know that it isn't possible. I'm never bored when I'm alone as I talk to myself a lot and poesss a vivid imagination which doesn't let me get bored. Sometimes, I feel so distressed that I feel like leaving everything behind and just run away from the place where I live and lead a peaceful life high up in the mountains. I've had suicidal thoughts before but I couldn't make an attempt because I have a fear of pain. My biggest fear is the fear of embarrassment in front of strangers and even the thought of this gives me panic attacks. I consider myself as an empathetic person and my heart goes away for the impoverished children and the helpless animals living on the streets. I often want to help them but my social anxiety prevents me from doing so. I'm a logical and practical person and I plan out and prepare for every task which I'll have to do later. I'm not at all spontaneous. I often make my decisions taking a lot of time analysing everything but often end up making my decisions based on what people around me feel. And also, I belong to the LGBTQ community, so it's hard for me to come out due to my nature and this is making me even more depressed. Further, I live in a country where discriminations against gay people still exist and happens frequently, which makes it even more difficult for me to come out. I know that I cannot remain closeted my entire life and often have panic attacks on imagining what I might have to face if my family gets to know about my orientation. Overall, I just have a very hard life and my mental health is just so bad and, it has actually worsen during this quarantine. I have so many thoughts racing in my mind simultaneously and it's just making me so miserable and dejected that I can't handle it anymore. I just need some psychological help but can't open up to my family because they consider this to be insignificant. They'll just brush it off to be something trifle and that, I'm being dramatic.

153,"Had my therapy session today and the things we talked about today JUST hit me. For the last few weeks I haven't been feeling myself. Like at all. I had an intense 6 week long anxiety episode. I'm still anxious now, but not as intense as during those 6 weeks. I told my t that I have been feeling really off, like my brain just shut down, when I need to do anything productive. Then my t said the thing I wasn't expecting: I was going down a depressive episode. I've been going for therapy mainly due to my anxiety, but being told that shocked me a little. 

My t said that anxiety and depression goes hand in hand in many cases, and that i can try to consider taking meds if things get worse. 

I can't wrap my head over that. I've always known about my somewhat terrible anxiety. But i've never once thought about depression. I'm now in this constant debate in my head over it. *Maybe you're physically ill? Maybe it's just a terrible burnout period. It's just a phase it'll pass.* 

Before this year, I've never had any depressive episodes. I've had many anxious ones but never depressive. Except for this year. When I try to rationalise in my head, my anxious thoughts kicks in immediately. There's no in between.

I'm really scared. My teachers and peers have so many expectations for me. My GPA is going to get ruined if I can't manage this. I'm getting closer to my internship too. Why can't my brain just let me be? I'm like trying to ""prove"" to myself that I'm fine by forcing myself to be ""normal"" and making jokes. But that spurt of energy wouldn't last long.

What can I do? I'm scared and tired at the same time. Maybe if I watch enough motivational videos online I'll be motivated again. Maybe if I push myself more, I can do things. Maybe if I manage my time well, I can do more things. Maybe I can complete more school work and study if I push myself more and try using the pomodoro method. But I just need the energy and the mellow feeling to go away. I hate having this brain fog feeling. What can I do to make it stop?",16Dec2020,1

156,"During lockdown, my mental health became worse and worse and I started getting frustrated and angry and loads of things that wouldn't normally make me like that. It got worse just before I was about to university because I was so worried. One day, I was with someone and they did something that seriously triggered me. The action itself wasn't bad but for some reason I just lost it. I went to push my leg into them to hurt them but my luckily body didn't 'let' me push forward and even though I was trying, my leg wasn't moving and nothing happened. I instantly started crying afterwards and had a breakdown. I got on the phone to a doctor and I got diagnosed with depression and got prescribed medication. I am doing a lot better now and I feel a lot happier but I can't stop thinking about how if I'd gone through with what I wanted to do in the moment and hurt the person then I wouldn't have been able to recover",16Dec2020,1

To cut a long story short, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and severe generalised anxiety about 6 years ago due to a number of childhood issues and triggering things happening in my life at the time.

I worked through it at the time and got myself in a really good place. But the last 2 years I’ve sunken back into it. It started with an unusual highly stressful job but even after leaving that job and going to another slightly less stressful if still a highly stressful job. 

I’ve been in therapy for the last 6 months and I’m told that it’s the circumstance and that once they change that I’ll be able to normalise again. 

So I’ve started looking at changing careers completely to an industry and role that should pay better and allow for better flexibility without the same pressures. Basic entry pay is higher then my salary after 3 years and 3 moves up the ladder in my current industry. I’ve started an online diploma and have a second one lined up with training to finish fully this time next year. 

The possibility of an out has given me some energy that I haven’t had the last 2 years. 
I’m just really scared that it’s not the job and that I’ll be as unhappy anywhere else but further back down the career ladder and maybe dislike the industry completely after getting employed in it.

How might I know if it’s just me?",16Dec2020,1
159,"Hey guys.

Made a post on here about 6 days ago about how I was confused about what to ask my GP to be tested for.

I spoke to them yesterday. I mentioned that I have an abysmal attention span, bad anxiety and catastrophic thinking, and potentially hypersexual.

I think I most likely have ADD. I was reading into the symptoms and I just relate to every single one. I constantly drift away when talking to people or performing any kind of important task. Can't finish one task before moving onto another. Get preoccupied with trivial things. Obsessive.

It's also an obsession with thoughts about sexual fantasies, and a lot of anxieties that surround them. I find myself impulsively wanting to talk about them with people. As of late just been seriously desperate for a boyfriend. I need someone to share these things with to cope with them

Is there much of a link between hypersexuality and ADD? I just want to get some opinions before I talk to another doctor about this.",16Dec2020,1
160,"For a good long while falling into the stigma and doing tons of research for potential mental health disorders others including myself may be experiencing, I was pondering a 'high functioning autism' possibility and after what I could ultimately gather from it, it is similar to ADHD but different in some big ways. ADHD is more being able to understand but being unable to focus, and autism is being unable to understand but being able to focus with the correct links.

It greatly hit me that this feeling of not understanding isn't what describes this core issue I feel, but it's having an intense feeling of understanding too much about everything, a perception, kind of like being able to flip switches on command to fit into specific social environments, while typically choosing not to because who cares unless it's truly important?

Everything seems to be linked to a big unexplainable spectrum of compartments that has too many variables for anyone to ever understand of the human perception, yet this understanding that I have is so overwhelming that there's almost a feeling of bleh toward most things but a couple and it's almost borderline nihilistic. I'm not looking to get diagnosed by anyone here, but what is this? 

It's almost like the opposite of autism if I had to explain, I'm trying to hear if anyone else is similar and what they've learned. I hope this makes sense.",16Dec2020,1
161,"My girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me a couple days ago. Said she didn’t feel the same about me as i did about her anymore, and wanted some time alone to try and improve her own life. She wants to focus on school and getting a career, which is good and I’m happy for her. She also wants me to focus on myself a little bit, and wants me to try and get a better job and to go back to school (I dropped out of college in March).

I have no idea what I want to do. For the last 3 years she’s been the direction in my life. Everything I’ve done has been for her, so she can be happy, because thats what makes me happy. I want to do whats best for both of us. I want to get a degree in something and get a better job because I feel like there’s a chance of us getting back together after a couple years. 

The worst part of this is that, ever since I was a kid my home life hasn’t been the best. So I’ve been living with her and her family for the last year (at least). I don’t have anywhere to go now that we’ve broken up. I can’t afford an apartment and I don’t think i could handle the stress of going home. So I’m still staying at her house. I know it’s probably not good for either of us but I don’t know what else to do.

Or if I do the dishes and someone says thanks, it makes me extremely uncomfortable and I'll feel like never doing the dishes again. I've even become especially stoic, because if someone notices me smiling/frowning/laughing at anything and brings it up my brain gets upset. If I'm browsing a funny app I end up locking myself away in my room because I don't want anyone to notice the expressions I'm making, even if no one is around/paying attention to me. I've always had issues accepting praise since I was a little kid, but now and days I have trouble accepting anything at all, but only from family. Friends, coworkers, strangers, etc etc don't bother me at all. I don't have a bad relationship with my family, I'd say we're all pretty close knit. I just have no idea what this means, or why I'm getting more and more like this. Is this some sort of off shoot of my anxiety?

I come from a “mental illness doesn’t exist” household but I’ve had so many red flags growing up and I’ve coped but I’m so confused now in my young adult hood. I don’t know if my memories actually existed or happened because I have some serious mental blocks or amnesia for large parts of my young childhood. But I suffered through nightmares and night terrors all throughout my childhood and would frequently wake up crying and screaming. I swear during middle school I frequently voices in my head telling me to kill myself (which I tried) or harm myself (which I did) and hurt others. I didn’t know how to cope with my anger and issues so I physically abused my little brother during those times and that shit haunts to this day, idk how he forgave me. I’ve have visual hallucinations during high school, the most during my walks to school and at night. In my final year of highschool I had a dream and took a philosophy class and I don’t think people really exist anymore?

Currently I’m in college and I’m doing ok but sometime I get scared in the dark because I feel like the shadows are moving and my sleep paralysis demons are going to come back and I just don’t know if I can trust myself?

I’ve gone through a lot in my life which has caused a lot of trauma and anxiety and ever since I was 16 it just felt like a dark cloud planted itself right under my head. I’m really exhausted, I don’t talk to any of my friends anymore because I pushed them all away, I’d rather be alone and I barely talk to my parents. I’ve started hating myself and feeling like it’s all my fault I feel like this, because it is. I feel so overwhelmed especially with school and applying to university for a course I don’t even know if I want to do. I keep thinking “how am I supposed to pick a university course when I might not even be alive then”. To put it simply, i am not living for me. I’m living because I care about my loved ones way too much to hurt them with my death. I’ve stopped going to school, failed all my classes because I have no motivation, I have reached out to childline but i stopped because I felt they had way more important issues to deal with that my own problems. Last week I made it to school but I was sent out of class because I burst into tears, my friend found me down a corridor and took me to the office of the school where I emailed the school counsellor asking if I could meet her to talk, so that’s something good. But the problem is, all my life I’ve dealt with everything myself. Everything. I don’t like involving people because from past experience when I was a kid, I do not want to put anyone through pain because of me.

170,"Hi, just wanna say that despite the setup of this story, it does not go into some really dark direction but a really uneasy one. So, just straight up, I have BPD and in the past that I will be mentioning I probably had both anxiety and depression, I think that there was BPD as well but the diagnosis is recent. So I was going through some old messeges on FB when I stumbled upon one conversation from the time when I was around 14 years old, with an adult guy. During this time I was fascinated by magic and kinda found it as a fantasy way of escaping my real issues and mental health problems that were not treated whatsoever, because my parents didn't believe in the existence of mental heath at all and severe depressive episodes, extreme isolation and advanced stages of agorophobia caused by anxiety were just *acting out*. That's why I think I had those disorders back then and am not completely certain - much needed mental support was refused to me, but I met all the criteria for the previously mentioned disorders. Okay, all of this was needed to explain why I acted so goddamn stupid. So, I was into magical nonsense and my internet penpal was also. We texted about it and he mentioned that he recently started texting about this shit with a guy who was a painter and REALLY into some New Age stuff and was supposed to be some actual  *magican*. Obviously, a depressed, lonely me at 14 added this dude on facebook and started texting about New Age magic. The dude was saying bullshit about spirit leaving the body, healing with mind etc. The manner he spoke to me with was really off and awkward. Despite that I was really curious so I kept texting him, also about my mental health to which he gave some ridiculous magical advice. I didn't really tried any of it since eating the sunlight sounded funny to me even then. I asked him about new-age magical meditation and tried that but gave up eventually. But there was a time when I hit really depressed bottom when two of my only friends(well, people who at least tolerated me) stopped talking to me, one of them had a mental breakdown and I really wanted to understand them, since I was clueless about any mental health related info and were really awkward. I vented it to this magican clown and he said he could read their aura from their pictures. Guy around 40 y/o asking for pictures of my friends. I was really unable to refuse anything to anyone back then since I thought it would make people hate me, so I said I'll do it later but I never did. But when I was feeling down again he suggested he could read *my aura*. Well, seen nothing wrong with that so I sent him a picture of my iris to get my aura reading and I got it, it was some bullshitty stuff about heaven energy etc, but yeah, I send a weirdo a picture of my eye. I also talked with him about my crush, and he was way too eager to question me about(love was supposed to be giving some powerful energy, yeah). Just to be clear, I do honestly think that the guy was and probably is simply batshit insane, since he also said nonsense about how he can destroy anyone with his mind powers and met God personally a couple of times. That's why I stopped texting him, it was just too ridiculous. Anyway, I found my conversation with this dude today and I was utterly terrfied reading it as an adult that he talked in lenght to a kid, asked for pictures(all be it in insane manner and probably without ulterior motive) and asked a unknown kid many questions about his crush and romantic stuff, it was highly creepy and disturbing, it kinda sent me spiriling today and made me feel terrible about myself. I wonder if I should report this conversation but am kinda afraid to do so, since I'm not sure how Facebook reacts to reports. I feel terrible now remembering it all and I don't really know what to do about it. I spent half a day deleting my messeges in that chat. Any word of support would be much appreciated.",16Dec2020,1

175,"i’m going to try focus on one issue at the moment, as thats what i’m currently struggling with 

this.. probably won’t be too coherent so i apologise in advance 

i’ve always constantly changed my tastes and opinions and what i like/dislike. maybe that’s normal, but i will have a strong opinion about something and then a few hours later i’m completely changed, then i go back on it the next day. but, in the extreme sense, not just about my favourite colour.

hobbies i like to do change on the daily too, i wanted to get into gardening for a week but now i don’t even understand why, i think it’s boring and i want to throw all the plants i have away because i’m uncomfortable that i felt like that in the first place (i got a ton in the week i was interested in it). but  i won’t because i’ll probably change my mind again and regret it. 

i think my emotions play a big role in it, when i get angry i get way too angry and i always feel guilty about the things i think and want to do when i’m angry. then when i’m the opposite it’s like i am the happiest person alive and i feel completely different, like a different person. then in amongst that i just feel, nothing, and it’s boring, like i’m not even there. i (tw self harm) used to hurt myself, burn myself and inflict pain just to make sure i was here, to see if things were real. 

like right now, i just changed my room around the other day and now i hate it, i don’t know why but it’s like, not my room, i feel so uncomfortable in it. it feels as if someone else designed it. i move and change my space every week because of this. i hate the posters that are up right now i’m not interested in them at all

the stuff i take in and the people i’m around and the tele i watch sometimes triggers me to act differently, super differently, like i take on characteristics sometimes of other people for a few days then change totally after. i don’t know it that’s a testimony to the how i feel about not being a complete and whole person. 

i just, don’t know what to make of it all. it just doesn’t t make sense and i’m so fed up of not knowing myself and not feeling like a whole person, lately it’s gotten worse and i’ve been drinking a lot, whenever i leave the house because i get so paranoid and anxious all the time.

my mind is messy right now, so this might not make sense, i just needed to get it out there. there’s so much more i could say but i can’t think straight right now. i’m struggling with a lot of things but i just wanted to vent this part of it right now",16Dec2020,1

178,"Background: me and my boyfriend got together last October, he had recently started taking antidepressants because he had a break down at work. He then didn’t work till March when he got a new job. From what I can gather he had a difficult upbringing. His gran parents adopted him when he was 10 because he was living with an alcoholic mum and possibly an abusive step dad. His own dad died before he was born. He doesn’t really open up so I don’t know how bad things were for him as a child but I understand some what as my mum is also an alcoholic and this is something that bought us close together in the first place. We have both experienced things like seeing out mothers try to commit suicide.

Anyway, for some reason my boyfriend stopped taking his antidepressants back at the end of July. As I said he doesn’t really open up but I think it was something to do with them making him but on weight or he thinks they don’t help. However since then I have noticed a change. One weekend in September he had this depressive episode where he hardly spoke to me for days. He admit to me he is always in emotional pain, and nothing seems to help. He still lives with his grandparents so I told them he stopped taking his medication and they got him to the doctors. I thought he was taking it again but turned out he wasn’t. After this he was alright for a while, or seemed it. The last month or so though his behaviour has just been getting more and more erratic.

For example, he collects his prescription of antidepressants but doesn’t take them. I asked him why he bothers getting them and he said “it’s nice to have a collection”. He said he wanted to try CBD for his depression and anxiety as he says he always feels anxious. So I bought him some as I take it then he didn’t want it. When I told him I bought it specially for him to try he took it and thanked me but I don’t think he will take it. I can tell when he is anxious because he will biting the skin off his lips/pick and the skin on his fingers. He also seems to not be looking after himself as well anymore too.

Yesterday I was round at his house and he randomly goes “I wonder what would happen if I took a whole pack of antidepressants” I told him that wasn’t a good idea and would probably be painful. Then he made some joke about wanting to hang himself at one point, and proceeded to tell me he knows how to tie a noose. He makes jokes a lot about killing himself, and it’s something I tend to do as well. We kinda of have a dark sense of humour but the way he does it is worrying. It’s really hard to tell when he is joking too, or being serious because a lot of the stuff he says sounds jokey. I’ll ask him something like “are you alright?” And he will go “no” and when I ask his why he says “I don’t know” He will also have these moment where he laughs so much he can’t breath but then it just looks like he is having a panic attack and I have to remind him to breath. 

Then in general he just acts erratically. We will be sitting watching tv and he will be fidgeting. Making weird faces. Randomly insulting people on tv and making jokes but it’s the kinda of jokes you would expect teenagers to make. He will also randomly blurt out sexual stuff. I’ll say something like “my toe hurts” and he will go “what colour?” He will make “jokes” about himself too. Saying he is fat, or weird, or fucked up. He says he gets random messed up thoughts that seem to distress him. I told him they are just intrusive thoughts as I get them too especially since I have OCD and that seemed to calm him down. Also yesterday he was messing around pretending he was hallucinating. He is only really like this when watching tv. If we are busy doing something he is fine.

He also seems to spend a lot of money, he is constantly buying stuff. He eats a lot too and it’s all junk. The other week he also admit he masturbates like 5 times a night, which seems excessive? He says he gets bored. This was after I left between 10-1 so it was like in 3 hours too. He doesn’t really have any friends. Just two who he only talks to online and sometimes goes weeks without talking to. He hardly spends anytime with family either. He seems to just isolate himself. Which he seems to of done since a kid according to his school reports. 

I get being weird because I’m really odd too, but some of the stuff he does seems to cross a line from weird to worrying. Should I be worried? It’s hard to tell because I have my own problems so not everything seems that “bad” to me as I’m pretty messed up so what I considered “normal” isn’t normal to others.

But, I really care and I really want the best for you and I love you... I know that our society and families don't portray and view depression as a disease and it is not something that is discussed. 

Any depressed person is just viewed as lazy or that they are not trying hard enough. However, this is similar to a disease of the body, like having asthma or something like that. If your right arm breaks, and someone tells you that you aren't trying hard enough, and that if you try you could still use the broken arm, it wouldn't make sense, would it? This is similar to that. I know it is hard to understand, but please try. 

I love you.",16Dec2020,1

184,"Hello dear Redditors,

I am a woman in her late 20s. I am going through a divorce after an abusive relationship. I feel that the reason I got into the wrong relationship is because I used to feel a void inside me. 

Few days after the separation I was so happy. But now, that void is back. It haunts me mercilessly. I feel incomplete. Again I feel like I need someone near me, even a hug would do. As a child I was so shy and always focused on studying and I made no friends. Now I don’t have friends except one maybe. I hate this feeling - is it the Pennsylvania winter? Why can’t I feel complete by myself?

I hate the thought of going back to my home to my parents - even though I am attached to them I feel suffocated in that house. I feel like I have nowhere to go and just have this feeling of being empty.

I don’t know what this is and why do I feel this way. Please help, I would greatly appreciate your suggestions and thoughts.",16Dec2020,1
185,"Hi r/mentalhealth,

I [24M] am very short (1,62m or 5'3), which always caused me a lot of implicit or explicit rejection from other people, in my child and adult life, in its love and professionnal dimensions. I always have been the shortest of my family, my class, my workplace - in regards to male, and also to females. 

Since height is so tightly linked to masculinity for basically every human culture, this caused me feelings of emasculation and worthlessness, that I always tried to fight. At some points in my life, I felt like the way people perceived me because of my height, and the way I perceived myself, were the fundamental root of the difficulties I was facing. I managed to make it not too much of a big deal, mainly by telling myself that it's an act of nature, a deed without author nor fault, that things are just the way they are, and that I should just get the most out of the ride.

However, 2 weeks ago, my mom told me something she never revealed. For a whole month, during her pregnancy, I did not grow by a single inch. This month, was also the month where my father left my mother and started living with his mistress. My mother was submitted to an incredible amount of stress, yet did not tell any of that to the doctor that was following her pregnancy and asked her if everything was ok. She basically was in denial, and didn't tell the pediatrist either, even though I was abnormally short.

I never got growth hormones, my short height was never discussed in the light of a stressful pregnancy with any doctor.

Now that I know that, I can not cope any more with issues linked to my height. I see human agency behind my issues. As a result, I'm feeling tremendous anger, resent, and feelings of unfairness and injustice.

I have no idea what I can do to get over that anger. It's crushing me and my narratives have collapsed. I resent my mom for burying this issue and never telling a doctor, and of course, I'm angry towards my dad for messing up my pregnancy. This anger should concerns mainly my parents, but right now it feels like I'm ""just angry"".

How to deal with that anger ?

tl;dr: since I know I'm short because of a stressful pregnancy, which prompts a crushing anger and feeling of injustice",16Dec2020,1

He'd yell at me daily and tell me I was useless. At school he wouldn't allow me to talk to anyone with the reason ""The teachers were hired to spy on me because some group was trying to ruin our family"". 

The truth is in 2010 my mother was going to divorce my father because his actions were too much. I somehow convinced them not to, and thus I feel it is my fault everyone in my family had to suffer. Things just took a turn for the worst from there on. All these questions come to mind, what if I didn't convince them to not divorce. Would I be a better person, would I not be a loner, would I have friends?

In 2016 I had a existencial crisis where I realized everything I did to waste my time was just escaping my reality. Thus I began truly isolating myself and didn't speak to a single soul for 3 years. Those 3 years were painful because he would have a break every weekend and a really bad one every 2 months.

In 2019 I managed to leave the house for 6 months to go to school. I didn't speak to anyone there either mainly because I was trying to process what I had just lived. The thing is I had to go back home because of the pandemic. Now everything seems just like it was before. It's as if nothing and absolutely nothing has changed.

190,"I was wondering about this today. I tried googling it and all I can find is how to talk to people who are grieving but not really anything the other way around. It's not about a death, but I went through a weird sort of bad break-up six months ago. It wasn't a girlfriend either, but still a relationship to a girl that I was very fond of. Some days I find myself missing her very much but I don't know how to explain it. I can't really talk to my friends who don't know her, because I can't really explain what happened, and I'm afraid of imposing myself on the ones who know. I feel like they might tell me that I'm supposed to be over it by now, and that makes me ashamed. Or maybe I'm imposing on them somehow, because they've got their own lives to live. Even though we were never in a relationship it feels like a bad break-up. Even though she's still out there it feels like my version of her died. It feels like this friend I was really fond of died and I can't make people understand because to them she's still out there. I don't know how to deal with it. We go to the same school and I'm afraid of seeing her again because I don't want it to hurt. I'm afraid of doing anything that reminds me of her, because it still hurts. I'm afraid of being myself around her, because that person wasn't good enough for her. It's like my friend died and I'm stuck with this ghost of her, and I don't know how to explain it or make anyone else understand.

192,"   Recently I've been feeling lost. I feel alone and as if nobody cares. My family claims to care but what have I done to make them care. I just exist in my house. At school, I'm nothing but a failure. I just don't do my work because I don't have the motivation to. Any time I get legitimate motivation, I lose it. It's just because I always fail. Even when I'm motivated, I can't do much. I have an education disorder and it REALLY weighs me down.

   I'm also alone, by myself, every night. I never have anyone to talk to. I live with two little siblings, my step-father, and my mother. I can't connect with them on anything, we're polar opposites. Also, they're always asleep when I'm awake, and I'm always awake when they're asleep. My step-father pretty much shuts me out from the outside world. I can't log onto internet and have no phone. Though my little siblings have Iphone's and all the internet access they could want. I'm just excluded from it because ""He's scared I'm going to do things on the internet I shouldn't."". He claims to be looking out for me, but I know that's bullshit because he literally mocked me in front of the dinner table in front of my family and he had everyone laughing at me. I just feel like I'm not loved.

   I've been losing my friends that I've recently met. I just moved away from all my friends and tried my fucking hardest to make some new ones at this school. Luckily, on the bus I ride there were a bunch of kids who actually made me feel included and cared about. Unluckily, I'm an annoying dumb-ass and they got annoyed at me and stopped talking to me. Some literally even stopped riding the bus. I just wish I wasn't so annoying but I can't help it. It just comes out when I try to make friends. I hope they think I'm cool and shit, so I try to mimic their sense of humor. I wind up failing and annoying the shit out of them.

   Along with all of that, I had gotten out of an abusive relationship at the start of quarantine. Good thing, right? Well, I hate saying this but, wrong. For some reason, I wanna go back. Even though she mentally tore me to pieces, flirted with other dudes, held break-ups over me when she was ""Looking out for me"", etc. I wanna go back to her. I tried getting into another relationship but I literally COULD NOT give a shit about her. Because I knew it was nothing special. I knew she was just gonna play me like every other girl. Long and behold, she did. Just yesterday she admitted to lying about all the good things she said about me. Along with, ""I never actually liked you"".  Which in result, made me want to go back to my abusive ex even more.

Hello everyone ! I hope this post finds you well and I hope you are having a beautiful day 💛

Ok so I will try to make this short ... I (F) met the man of my dreams 5 years ago. We flirted and ended up dating. We have been in a LDR for a long time but we were seeing each other every three months and it was fine with us as we started going to uni and I traveled a lot for work etc..
A year and a half ago, all of a sudden, he became distant and cold but still very caring which was very hard to deal with and it didn’t matter if we were staying together or apart it became weird. I noticed a certain weight loss and he ended up telling me he got sick with diabetes and that he felt like he was failing me. 
I had depression for 6 years when I was younger and I started noticing his behavior and he seemed depressed and I started feeling worried of course.. I won’t lie it triggered my own depression...

Ok fast forward to last year for his birthday I decided to surprise him and I traveled out there with gifts and I decorated our place and it was just cute and perfect and I felt happy to see him get back to himself somehow. But at the same time every time we were trying to have a conversation he was feeling emotional and decided to make me laugh or kiss me or change the topic just so we didn’t have to talk about what was wrong. He cried in front of me telling me he felt like he didn’t deserve everything I do for him and that eventually he would have to leave me because I am way too good to/for him. We had a conversation and we felt emotional we hugged each other and later that day he asked me to forgive him if sometimes he is being mean it’s beyond his control and that he is mentally tired af.
After a month I had an emergency so I have to leave and travel back. We spent the weekend together. He made love to me like he never did before and before I left he grabbed my face kissed me passionately and he said « I love you so much baby » (which made me feel so good because he stopped saying I love you and calling me cute names after he got depressed..).

Few weeks after that he texted me saying that he will stop texting everyday and that he would just check on me sometimes but that he had to stop the relationship and that he didn’t love me anymore that he couldn’t keep going. He said it’s not my fault he is simply mentally sick and that he didn’t want to ruin my life. I called him I tried not to cry and he said he couldn’t give me what I deserve and that he was thinking about what he has done to me everyday and that he feels like shit so he prefers to leave so I can find happiness somewhere else. I got mad and I told him he didn’t have the right to choose for me and that we have been through so much more than that we could talk and see how he needs help. He refused and he keeps saying he would ruin my life. He also told me he wouldn’t like me to be with another person but « what can I do about it ? You are free ». The thing is my heart is so broken and I am still in love with him how could I even date someone else ? (Call me naïve if you want)

After that we kept talking sometimes to check on each other. He was flirty but not too much. We even sexted and kept talking as if we were still together but without saying I love you or calling each other cute names or without sharing the way we used to. At some point I felt almost humiliated... like a dog running after a ball. But I am in love and other than that I have been depressed and sick and no one was there to check on me and I don’t want him to feel the same way so I kept checking on him etc. 

Few weeks ago my grandmother passed away. It was a very hard thing to see my grandfather cry and regret not saying I love you enough to her. I decided to text my dude and I told him what had happened and how I wish things were different but that I still love him and support him no matter what. He texted back saying he loves and appreciates everything with me but that it’s better for him AND for me to just forget about this love. I asked him if the past five years have been nothing but a lie since everything disappeared after few weeks he said « no, I mean you know love comes and goes.. idk please I don’t want to talk about it I feel shitty for what I am making you go through » I just felt numb and that’s it. 

After that we kept talking sometimes.. this situation has triggered my own depression. He told me few weeks ago how he thought everything was boring but that we gotta do what we gotta do. We talked about sexuality i don’t even remember why and he told me even though he still had desire for me he felt like he was getting completely uninterested in sex. He then told me how much pressure he has on his shoulders lately because he has exams and also his mother got sick but his siblings don’t help so he has to deal with his mother’s health his own mental health and his diabetes. He also told me that he was sorry if sometimes he doesn’t answer my messages but whenever he has a mental breakdown he feels like he can’t do shit. I reassured him of course but idek if he felt supported since he doesn’t show feelings for nothing.

His birthday is the day after Christmas. I know he hates surprises 😂 but I was thinking that maybe sending him a gift or something comforting would be good but I am doubting. I won’t lie I am feeling very down and worried. I am trying to be as supportive as possible even when he is being distant and cold and stressed. What he did felt unnecessary. He left and just came back saying that  « the situation between us is shitty all because of me ». But I swear we have seen worse together. Once again I know what depression can make you do/think so I am not blaming him. He even blamed me for not blaming him he told me « how can you be so supportive? » I just told him that I couldn’t be mad at him for something he can’t even control. He just kissed me and thanked me for everything.

Now I am lost. Idk if he loves me. Idk if I mean something to him. Idk if I should send him a comforting gift to let him know he is being thought of still and that I am still here whenever and whatever happens. Idc if I am the one depressed I have been there already it’s dark and hard but it’s even harder to see him suffer from it. It triggers mine too and I just can’t seem to understand what the hell happened.

Anyways I tried to make it short and here we are. I forgot a LOT or details. But yeah this dude is perfect even when he is down like you know when someone else feels like home ? And when you can be yourself and feel safe and at peace as if your soul finally reached its destination ? Well that how it feels like. Depression sucks. I hate that he pushes me away and that even though he describes me as perfect for him I am still not enough for him to let me in and support as we used to do for each other. I hate that the only moments of happiness we have are « loveless » and you can feel a certain tension.

I want to see him happy again. If you guys have any advice or story to share please feel free to do so. If you have any idea as to what I could send him please let me know. And I am sorry it got so long but thank you if you read it.

God bless and you guys take care of yourselves. And if you are reading this thinking I am stupid or whatever well I might be but I just also want you to remember that you are worth having someone fight for you to be good again one day 💗",16Dec2020,1
200,"_TW for sexual things and violence_


_Disclaimer: I never had any remote interest in hurting anyone, ever. I'm actually very much against any form of torture/violence as it might scar people for life and it is just overall inhumane. Also important to point out that I am quite sensitive to pain in real life._

_Comment if you can, I don't know if I'm just overthinking this or not._


Apologies for the long post, but I needed to let it out. 

Also, I need to point out that I'm not formally diagnosed yet but I'm starting therapy soon, because there are high chances I have OCD. 

Ok so since I (16, f) was a kid I'd get aroused by some torture things on the media. It used to be almost anything as a kid (including pretty gory/explicit stuff) and then I realized that there was nothing sexual about most of those things and so it stopped.
It kept happening but this time usually only if there was anything sexual about it. I watched some videos, saw some pictures, and I never really worried about it because it wasn't something ""recurrent"" and I could easily get turned on by normal things too (bedsides I didn't want to act on these thoughts). 
Also, I never really fantasized myself doing any of those things, it was always other people. 

During the months of lockdown I guess it got kinda stronger because I had more time in my hands and nothing to do with it. 

Then it kinda stopped for a while, it was barely non existent. I had been having my first intrusive thoughts (paranoid ones) and was too anxious too think about other stuff. I still fantasized about normal things during that time, and maybe sometimes (rarely) the more violent ones, but the last ones had just practically went away.

However, some weeks ago I started feeling very anxious about the fact that I had those fantasies, and started compulsively trying to get reassurance that I wasn't a bad, despicable person for having them. At this point, they gave me no pleasure anymore (I refused to think about them), and thinking about the things I had seen made me feel anxious. 
Then it stopped again, but I stopped fantasizing about it completely.
But about two weeks ago I realized that I probably didn't have those fantasies anymore, as they only bring me anxiety and disgust.

The problem? I'm afraid I still have them. And not only that, I'm afraid that if I actually hurt the people I love (or anyone else) I'd enjoy it. Which completely freaks me out. Thinking about the videos makes me anxious. Thinking about the images makes me anxious. But I'm afraid I might still like them, and there are always ""what if's"" running in my head. Bedsides there's the whole ""what if I'd enjoy hurting someone?"". 
And even if I really don't have them anymore, I'm dealing with lots of guilt and shame for the fact that they ever existed. 

Also it feels like this kind of ""eradicates"" the rest of my personality because it really doesn't ""look like me"". 

So basically, I'm afraid:
- I still have the fantasies and am just in denial because I don't like having them
- I'd actually enjoy carrying them out and hurting someone
- This isn't OCD, this time it is for real
- What if I'm not actually against torture nor sensitive to pain and this was just an excuse all along? 
- What if the groinal responses are actual arousal? 

{Summary}: Used to have a sexual fantasy (taboo) that I don't think I have anymore. Afraid I still have it. Afraid I'd enjoy acting on it. Afraid this time it isn't OCD, but a real problem. 

Any advice? And am I just overthinking this? Can it be part of OCD too?",16Dec2020,1

They say I won’t feel the pain, if I’m out of my mind.

Death peers through my window with an erie grin .
I’ve gotta go to heaven .because ive been to hell with the pain I’m in .

“Let me pop this in your vein , it will only hurt for a sec !“
“Oh and we must do an X-ray, just to check !“

This may make you puke , sleepy and sad.
But just think , others have it worse . So it’s not that bad ! 

You can’t risk infection, you must stay inside.
When you become so frail you can see your ribs, you will loose your pride .

Watch your friends grow up , have kids and get married.
And know you will never have a baby that you carried .

I sit here and think , why did this happen to me? 
This isn’t how I was told life would be.",16Dec2020,1
205,"for some context; im 14 and cannot get an official diagnosis. ive always struggled with passive suicidal thoughts since i was a child and have grown up within a kind of dysfunctional family dynamic? i always thought i was just depressed, and almost managed to get diagnosed but that fell through due to some complications. recently i stumbled upon borderline personality disorder while researching some of my symptoms and... i honestly think it fits. if someone with bpd could maybe interact with this or maybe even a specialist and could help me figure out if im right and give me some tips please i would love that.
i have extreme abandonment issues, have had about two people in my life (one currently) who im officially sure were favourite persons, deal with anger issues and have had extreme mood swings. i definitely undergo splitting a lot (more for situations than people, which causes a lot of stress in my life and is basically what drove me to depression), and ive ALWAYS felt empty. i also cant contain my emotions, and tend to dissociate-but not very frequently. ive also recently been feeling like im a terrible person because i keep splitting black on my relationships and lashing out and being passive aggressive and undergoing severe personality changes (i think thats because of how different my new fp is). i hate self diagnosing though... so if someone could please help?",16Dec2020,1

207,"Hello everyone. I don't really know where else to turn. I'll sum a little bit of my mental health history. I'm 26 and have suffered from depression since I was 14 years old. I didn't get a lot of support from friends or family and I pretty much carry on by myself. Up until the beginning of this year my depression was pretty presistent and I never got a break. I tried therapy, which I eventually ran out of resources (money) and medication turned me into a zombie. And I eventually ran out of money for that as well. So I had to adjust on my own.

Things started picking up this year for me. I got a different job, finally climbing out of fast food hell for the first time in 9 years. It was better for me. And finally being 26, I felt the difference that having a fully developed brain can have! It cleared up a lot of anxieties and attributes of depression I had had for most of my life. I could handle my emotions better and better yet, understand them and know how to counter them. I was finally maturing in the blissful way I had always heard. A ton of progress there actually, I'm hardly the same person I was only a few years ago.

...until about a week and a half ago. I started noticing a familiar lack of desires coming back. It's very familiar since I've been dealing with this sort of stuff since I was a teenager. I don't care about my hobbies now. I want to, but I can't pick anything up at this point. I also have no interest in doing... anything. I just go to work, come home, and go to bed. I don't even try to communicate with my roommate and we're really close. I just don't have it in me.

I just don't know what to do now. I felt like I had made so much progress this year and was finally seeing clarity for the first time in over a decade. And now it feels like it always had before I knew what feeling good was. And with depression comes the thought that this is it... That I'm going to spend another 10+ years trying to be happy again and never getting it. If that happens I'll be 36 years old, most of my life riddled with depression and being lost in the fog. And since I'm alone now... it'll only seal that deal more. If there's one thing that depression has taught me it's that no one wants to deal with you, and more so if you're close to 40 and still a big depressed loser...",16Dec2020,1

If you’re alone at Christmas, or if you *feel* lonely, don’t think twice about messaging me or others. I and others are willing, and more than happy to talk to you as much as possible. We don’t have to talk about your Mental Health at all times, we can talk about what brings *you* joy and what interests you - a general chat, to keep your mind off of things. There are billions of people around the World who will be spending Christmas on their own, which is sad to see. At times, we need to give back to them. Who will they talk to on Christmas Day? Who will they share their happiness with? Who will be there to listen to them vent or rant?

Spending an hour out of your day to talk and help others is what’s needed more than anything. So, if you’re feeling lonely at any point and you need someone to talk, and get all of your emotions out, my PM’s are always open for you. 

I wish you all a very Merry Christmas. You all deserve happiness, it’s why we’re here, after all. 

Much love to you all. And remember, if you need to vent, rant, gain some support or help, myself and other people’s PM’s are open for you, at any given moment.

209,"I understand that the NHS is under a spectacular amount of strain right now, and generally I am grateful for them, but I've been getting screwed around by them for months now. I'm especially angry at the moment, I had a psychiatry phone appointment in September and was due to have a follow up six weeks later. Six weeks came and went, no appointment. The longer I went without hearing from them, the more stressed and anxious I got, and the more impossible I found it to call them and chase up. I finally built up the strength last Monday and I was told that, in spite of me being told six weeks and my GP surgery getting a letter saying six weeks, someone had input my next appointment for March, six MONTHS instead of weeks. 

The secretary told me she'd speak to the doctor and see if I could be squeezed into a clinic as soon as possible, and I got a letter through with today's date and a time of 1pm. I waited until almost 2.30pm then went to the supermarket to get some stuff we needed, and they called while I was in Tesco. I got what felt like an insincere apology and the offer to carry on the conversation of reschedule for ""as soon as possible after Christmas"". Seeing as I wasn't about to have that conversation in Tesco and wasn't able/willing to dump my trolley, I opted to reschedule. I'm just so angry with the (lack of) care I've received in the last few months and I have a friend who works for a city council who has sent me resources and is encouraging me to put in a complaint.",16Dec2020,1

211,"this is my first time posting here - have been lurking and upvoting for a while. i don't really have anyone that im comfortable with sharing, even my closest friends, so here goes.

in the past months, i have been losing my sense of self. i lost myself.

everytime i look in the mirror, i dont recognize who i am. that hair, that nose, those eyes, they belong to someone else and not mine. when im not looking in the mirror, i cannot remember what i look like physically. when i think about past memories, even things dating to as late as last week, i do not recognize those activities. like i remember finishing them but no, it wasn't me that did those things. they werent real. someone else did so. i feel like im just staring at myself from a distance and often i catch myself heavily dissociating. its like this body is not mine, this mind is not mine, but when i think, well who am i, i do not know who that is. my sense of self is not big or small, its just not there. i have zero sense of self. i really dont know who i am.

i talked to my therapist and she deduced that this had something to do with a recent move. i was dislocated to my home country back in march from my school in the us because of covid, and life has been on a downward trajectory since. im a tck and experience serious cultural conflict that is only heightened by extreme social anxiety, and i have pretty much been sticking to myself since the move. my therapist mentioned that bc my newer identity was established in and grounded to the states, now that im away from the place, i am disconnected to an identity that ive become comfortable with. it all makes sense. sounds like ive been on extreme survival mode for nine months.

but its only been getting worse. im not a workaholic, but finishing work is the only thing right now that can distract me from dissociation. when im not writing essays and coding and watching criminal minds (my newest avoidance as a coping mechanism), im just there. literally no thoughts head empty. in the past few months, living has become more difficult. i feel like i have no control over where my head goes, and have to ground myself to reality with sound. cooking because the sound of metal clanging soothes me. walking because the sound of my bare feet sliding on the wood is okay. getting out of bed because i want to hear the bed sheets rustling. typing and doing work because the keyboards heap up and down. without those sounds, i feel like i cannot move - my body feels heavy because its not mine.

ik its nothing compared to what has been posted on this sub and this is not the lowest that ive been, but identity-wise, this rly is foreign. im not sure if these all make sense either. my therapist is specialized in cultural psych and working with tck-s, but i dont think she understands that my depression is only escalading worse. idk how to voice how i feel to her because i feel like she always second doubts my feelings. not sure what im rly looking for, just hoping that someone maybe is experiencing the same thing. cultural crisis is rly not the nicest lmaoo",16Dec2020,1

215,"_TW for sexual things and violence_


_Disclaimer: I never had any remote interest in hurting anyone, ever. I'm actually very much against any form of torture/violence as it might scar people for life and it is just overall inhumane. Also important to point out that I am quite sensitive to pain in real life._

_Comment if you can, I don't know if I'm just overthinking this or not._


Apologies for the long post, but I needed to let it out. 

Also, I need to point out that I'm not formally diagnosed yet but I'm starting therapy soon, because there are high chances I have OCD. 

Ok so since I (16, f) was a kid I'd get aroused by some torture things on the media. It used to be almost anything as a kid (including pretty gory/explicit stuff) and then I realized that there was nothing sexual about most of those things and so it stopped.
It kept happening but this time usually only if there was anything sexual about it. I watched some videos, saw some pictures, and I never really worried about it because it wasn't something ""recurrent"" and I could easily get turned on by normal things too (bedsides I didn't want to act on these thoughts). 
Also, I never really fantasized myself doing any of those things, it was always other people. 

During the months of lockdown I guess it got kinda stronger because I had more time in my hands and nothing to do with it. 

Then it kinda stopped for a while, it was barely non existent. I had been having my first intrusive thoughts (paranoid ones) and was too anxious too think about other stuff. I still fantasized about normal things during that time, and maybe sometimes (rarely) the more violent ones, but the last ones had just practically went away.

However, some weeks ago I started feeling very anxious about the fact that I had those fantasies, and started compulsively trying to get reassurance that I wasn't a bad, despicable person for having them. At this point, they gave me no pleasure anymore (I refused to think about them), and thinking about the things I had seen made me feel anxious. 
Then it stopped again, but I stopped fantasizing about it completely.
But about two weeks ago I realized that I probably didn't have those fantasies anymore, as they only bring me anxiety and disgust.

The problem? I'm afraid I still have them. And not only that, I'm afraid that if I actually hurt the people I love (or anyone else) I'd enjoy it. Which completely freaks me out. Thinking about the videos makes me anxious. Thinking about the images makes me anxious. But I'm afraid I might still like them, and there are always ""what if's"" running in my head. Bedsides there's the whole ""what if I'd enjoy hurting someone?"". 
And even if I really don't have them anymore, I'm dealing with lots of guilt and shame for the fact that they ever existed. 

Also it feels like this kind of ""eradicates"" the rest of my personality because it really doesn't ""look like me"". 

So basically, I'm afraid:
- I still have the fantasies and am just in denial because I don't like having them
- I'd actually enjoy carrying them out and hurting someone
- This isn't OCD, this time it is for real
- What if I'm not actually against torture nor sensitive to pain and this was just an excuse all along? 
- What if the groinal responses are actual arousal? 

{Summary}: Used to have a sexual fantasy (taboo) that I don't think I have anymore. Afraid I still have it. Afraid I'd enjoy acting on it. Afraid this time it isn't OCD, but a real problem. 

Any advice? And am I just overthinking this? Can it be part of OCD too?",16Dec2020,1
216,"So basically I’m an emotionally detached person, so much so that I’ve become unmotivated with everything to do with life. I find no joy in almost anything and my only form of escapism is reading books and fantasising about being anywhere but where I am. Even though I consider reading a hobby I don’t actually feel much whilst I read, no excitement and barely any joy and happiness. If anything it’s mainly something to focus on as I have ADHD and don’t like being bored. That being said I do somewhat enjoy it just not to the level that I think most people enjoy their hobbies. Because of this incredible lack of motivation I find myself feeling less and less emotion every day. And eventually when asked what I would like to do in the future ‘die in my sleep before I have to work’ became my default answer and has been for years (though people think I’m joking) and it’s not like I choose this just because it’s a better alternative, the thought that when I go to sleep I might not wake up makes me giddy before I go to sleep, like a kid on Christmas Eve, almost every night without fail the thought pops into my head and I feel the strongest surge of positive emotions I can remember feeling in a long long time. That being said I don’t consider myself suicidal, I would never kill myself and don’t actually like pain so I’ve never self harmed. Granted the main thing keeping me from suicide is that whatever happens next has a good chance to be boring as hell (I find the idea of heaven, hell, limbo and eternal peace Boring and only like the idea of reincarnation as it seems like it would be more enjoyable). While I know it’s a bad sign I’m wondering how bad this actually is?

Sorry for any bad grammar, punctuation or bad wording. I have thick mental fog and have trouble getting my thoughts in writing",16Dec2020,1
217,"I'm learning to drive and it feels like I am learning how to breathe and blink and swallow and see at the same time. I see a car and all i can think about is swerving in front of it. What if I did? Why do I think that?

Thinking about every single thing that I don't want to think about. Remembering every mistake I have ever made in my life to the point where I feel like relapsing on a self harm behavior i've been clean from for four years. I know that I can't realistically I can't, but it is the easy way out of my brain when this shit happens. 

And i'm so tired because I can't go to sleep until i pass out. Any second alone in my head without some sort of stimulation is painful. I can't help but think about bludgeoning myself or kicking my dog across the room, and I don't want to. I don't want to think about these things. 

And the days when this doesn't happen are the days when I break down for hours. All i can do is feel like everyone is abandoning me and that everything in life is all wrong forever. And when I stop crying I am so blatantly disgusted with myself. 

And I can't focus for the life of me I have not gotten one thing done. I missed the application date for my dream college because I am so strung out and I don't even do anything. I sit around all day but I string myself out with my head to the point where i'm too exhausted to do anything even after of 12 hours of sleep. 

And I just need to go outside. I need to see people and I need some fresh air but I'm not allowed to leave. 

I'm okay, i'm just so exhausted. One of the nights where my brain won't shut off. It's morning actually, it's almost 9 AM. I just want my brain to be quiet for a day.",16Dec2020,1
218,"i dont have many people in my life and i also have anxiety and trust issues. its hard for me and im scared to meet new people to not get hurt etc. but i ended up breaking that barrier and for a while i was in a long distance relationship but i found out that he tried to cheat on me with his ex.
i keep torturing myself that it was all my fault and i was too much to handle or wasnt good enough. i cant stop making excuses for him.
and im doing all that to the point of mental and physical exhaustion. im in pain all the time. self-sabotaging, that im worthless and unloveable, when i just wanted to make him happy, love him and always be there for him.
it feels like im always being used and then ditched like im nothing. like i dont matter to anybody. i remember that whole situation was so stressful i had a panic attack at some point. but the weirdest feeling is that even though he hurt me and probably doesnt care about us anymore, i do care and i miss him.

219,"I have GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) and I’m constantly anxious.... like just living makes me anxious..
And sometimes I get so caught up in the anxiety &amp; the intrusive thoughts that I feel like I’m going crazy. Sometimes when the anxiety is too much it turns into anger/frustration, but towards myself. Moreso angry about how I can’t just let things go (thanks ADHD..) and how this upsetness keeps happening because I can’t accept things as they are/or aren’t. 

Sometimes I stomp (which I’ve hurt my heel a few times) on my floor or I’ll slam my door, because I just can’t combat my thoughts and a loud noise tends to interrupt my intrusive &amp; ruminating thoughts. As I react this way, I’m quite “here” and acknowledge what I’m doing (like hurting my foot, cracking my door) but it’s just I don’t care during that moment. 
Right after I’ve done it tho (some type of small destruction), I instantly regret and feel even more shittier because I’ve ruined something or hurt myself. 

I’m very emotionally driven in general so emotions seem to really takeover. But again, it’s not like I disassociate &amp; not know where I am or what I’m doing, I 100% do, it’s just I don’t CARE during the happening because the emotion has taken control in a sense.

*So my question is, what’s the clearest difference between mania (which I don’t believe I experience because they are rational &amp; make sense, it’s just as if I’m ‘overreacting’) and just having anxiety/an anxiety attack?",16Dec2020,1

222,"I have a serious problem and it's about nostalgia or just looking back. When I do, it hurts so incredibly and I get a feeling that just wants to tear me apart. It really hurts and it's the worst feeling I've ever had. And I get this feeling all the time, it almost does not matter what I think about. Almost every event that I think back on, gives me that feeling and that's what's so weird. These events do not even have to be important or mean anything to me, but just the thought of how it was before gives me this feeling. And then when there are events that actually matter, this feeling becomes really torturing. It hurts so incredibly. Such events can be, for example, tournaments with the team, people I will never meet again or do not have the same relationship with, different events such as Christmas Eve or activities with friends, which I know I will never experience again. Then it is not really that I feel bad or sad now, because then maybe you could understand that you miss old times, and that is what is so strange.I am seriously afraid that I will commit suicide some day because the feeling will tell how it was in my childhood and so on. The more important events, the worse everything gets, I constantly build on small events that I for some reason miss. 

I need help. This is torture and my mind is killing me.This problem makes me just want to sit at home and never do anything, because I know that if I do anything, I will feel this way again because I get even more new events. For example, I can not even listen to my favorite music anymore, both because of this strange reason for missing completely random events, I associate the songs with important events that I miss, but mostly just because I miss these artists who are old and never will do music again (I listen to rock, etc.) It means, for example, that I can not play electric guitar as I have loved to do because I get so bad in my mind that I just want to cry. And what's so weird is also especially Christmas, which hurts me just by hearing Christmas music or just watching videos that are based on snow and Christmas. Then I immediately get this feeling for the 387th time that day and it hurts as much as the feeling of important events. I really do not understand why I get so much pain from looking back in time, even to events that are not even important, and even just from hearing about Christmas.

What is also connected with this is the future. I'm so scared that when I end up in an 8-4 job, I will be overwhelmed by these memories where I look back on my childhood where I had all these dreams of a football player or artist with the guitar. I will miss everything from my childhood so enormously and feel so disappointed in myself that I ended up in a completely normal adult life. I do not understand where people get joy from when it. It makes me push myself so much now and lose all motivation to practice on what I want to be good at, and when it happens I get so stressed, etc. precisely because I do not practise, because I know that I will then end up on such a job.

My friends are not taking my problem seriously, and they seem to not really care to much, I have spoken to my parents but they have no idea how to deal with it.",16Dec2020,1

224," The conditions at RidgeView Institute in Smyrna GA. are beyond unacceptable and should be investigated immediately. This “institution” is unethical and has serious violations of healthcare standards, including violation of COVID-19 safety practices.

This institute has a history of complaints about the conditions and lack of care. The parent company, US Healthrest LLC had an entire expose by the Seattle Times describing the same conditions as the RidgeView facility in Smyrna GA. As a result Massachusetts prohibits the company to operate facilities inside of their state. Washington Governor Inslee has demanded stronger oversight of Washington’s Mental Health providers, specifically those operated by US Healthreast.

***What patients consistently describe:***

Covid-19 safety precautions are not being followed including the staff not wearing masks. Patients are forced to walk in line “toe to ankle”, i.e. no social distancing. There isn’t soap in the bathrooms and only one hand sanitizer station.

The staff is incompetent' to care for the mentally ill.

Patients are left unattended for hours while staff talk on their personal cell phones. Patients are left to sit together at tables and play cards for hours. The staff often calls the patients “crazy”. The overnight staff plays music loudly on their phones without regard to patients' sleep. The beds in which the patients sleep are significantly uncomfortable made with the barest of materials.

The treatment is at best minimal.

Patients are rarely seen by a doctor and group therapy consists of a couple of questions that would be asked at any 4-H Camp introduction, such as what is your favorite color or favorite movie. Mental illness discussions or coping solutions are not discussed.

The facility is cold, and patients are not provided with adequate clothing to keep them warm. There is very little hot water.

The place is filthy. There is mold growing, due to insufficient shower drains. The sheets are reported not to be always changed between patients

The food is minimum and inedible.

Patients are not allowed any “outdoor time” unless they are a SMOKER! Fresh air and exercise is a proven benefactor in improving patients with mental illness.

***What Ridgeview employees say:***

Currently, the new management has decided to micro manage all employees in an attempt to increase revenue with no consideration for patient care or the autonomy of the professional. Moreover, the skills, abilities, and attributes of the individual employee are not being recognized by those in middle/upper management.

**- Former Program Therapist Smyrna, GA.**

Focus is on surviving and patient care is not a priority. Management has no idea what they are doing. They are always panicking about getting in enough patients and in denial about our actual service. We barely have enough staff to function as a hospital.

**- Current Employee Smyrna GA**

At the risk of sounding persecutory, any nurse working in this facility is at risk of losing their license on a daily basis. The patient acuity is severe, the standard nurse/patient ratio ranges from 18-22:1 with the help of one tech, management is generally unsupportive and unbelievably out of touch with the staff that actually keep their units running, 25% of staff are agency nurses who struggle with our archaic paper charting system and thus are pretty unhelpful, and so much more. The toxic culture and unsafe conditions have created an incredibly high staff turnover rate. It's unfortunate, but Ridgeview isn't interested in staff retention because they truly don't care about their staff. They are a for-profit healthcare system, and their focus is entirely on just that- money.

226,"In my 28 Years 11 Months alive I've been Hospitalised 14 times in my country of origin and about 8 times outside in other places. I've spent about 4 years of my adult life on the streets. This is due to Mental Health difficulties and what I would say amounts to misunderstandings compounded by misinterpretations and also addiction. After years of bouncing in and out of hospitals eventually this year (2020) I was put in prison the reason I was put in prison was because my juggling sticks\[I am or was a part time street performer\] can be classed as offensive weapons. Something inside me died. Or has it? 6 times I have been in prison in 2020. 6 times I was put into COVID isolation which consists of 2 weeks inside a cell no leaving. I'm not sure if its a good or bad thing but something inside me has changed, I can quite grasp what it might be I feel somewhat defeated by incarceration to the point where its like such an inevitability that I feel like I am trapped either way  and that there is no point taking liberties because freedom isn't free and I cant defeat the system as I am a part of the system as it is a part of me. Prison doesn't bother me neither does a psychiatric ward the prospect of either sometimes is borderline appealing though I feel like I am able to break the chain. Maybe the behavioural correctional system works? Maybe I am conditioned / partially institutionalised? No doubt I am in prison mentally due to the many times I've been arrested (40-50) and the amount of times I've been done in and the many head trauma's I've sustained I am an on edge most of the time. I'm not sure what's going on. I've been changing medication for 10 years nothing is working so I am seeing about getting a new diagnosis, we'll see what happens.",16Dec2020,1

I sacrifice my well-being for the sake of others, while they can’t even seem to reciprocate the bare minimum.

I have so much to say, so much to share, yet my voice is never heard.

I have all this love to give, I wasted it on someone who didn’t appreciate me. 

All of my “friends” are pursuing their goals, getting into relationships, appearing to be happy... then there’s me. 

My so called “friends” begged me to tell them what was on my mind, I uttered the statement “suicidal thoughts” ..and they left. 

I’m trying every single day, I brought myself into a psych ward, I was given medication, and virtual therapy.. yet I don’t see myself moving forward.

I haven’t stopped my medication, I’ve tried all forms of breathing exercises, meditating, yoga, etc.

NOTHING has worked, and I walked into each activity with an open mind and the desire to get better.

I just feel as if, there’s a much bigger issue at hand that I’m not being able to address or overcome, and it’s not being taken into consideration.. yet I was transparent as ever with my psychiatrist. 

It makes me wonder if perhaps I should seek a neurologist, and maybe then I’ll get some answers.

I just want answers, and it’s just biting away at me day by day. 

I had all the energy in the world, I fought through everything that came at me.. now I can’t even get out of bed. 

I’ve lost my joy, and my desire to do just about anything other than sleep.

i am posting this with a new account (i dont have one, just a lurker) and with tails os as my Operating system.

My  question for you is: Are you able to live a Life without going off the  grid or isolating yourself, while still not be tracked?

Over the last couple of years i grew very afraid of unkown tracking on the internet and the real life.

For  example i dont like to give people my phone number oder email because i  know on there phone it will be send to the major companys apple,  facebook, google etc.

But  my quality of life suffered a lot. I feel lonely and isolated.  Especially with Covid where i have to use even Goverment Services online  and see all the google analytics and other tracking i feel trapped.

I go to see her every week, call her everyday and constantly reassure her that I wouldn’t leave her.

It’s had such a mental toll on me where I feel like I can’t even have a relationship of my own because she would feel so shit about it. I’ve tried to get therapy for her but it’s near impossible due to COVID and when we did get her temporary help she didn’t want to get better.

I’ve told her school but there isn’t much they can do about it, her family is awful and not supportive of her at all but she can’t leave them. She doesn’t really have friends and doesn’t want to make any because her trust issues have gotten so bad.

I’ve also tried suicide lines but they can’t do anything because she’s not in any immediate danger. And whenever I get her to call them she doesn’t want to because she says she can’t open up to anyone on the phone.

She says the only reason why she’s still alive today is because of me, but sometimes wishes I wasn’t her friend so that she could kill herself.

I want to be there for her but it’s really weighed me down mentally, always having to be there for her when she’s crying, staying up late, having to prioritise her so she does get sad.

She knows she’s obsessed with me and that she is low-key toxic yet feels she can’t do anything about it and gets extremely jealous whenever I do anything outside of her. Every little thing I say she always sees negative and then gets upset over and I always feel like I’m walking under eggshells.

I just feel like I can’t do anything with my life and that I can’t get anyone to help her because she doesn’t let anyone in. I’ve tried so much to help her and give her as much advice as possible but she juss doesn’t want to get any better.

The worst thing about it is, that I KNOW that I’m the only person she truly cares about and that if I do leave she WILL kill herself (or at least attempt to) and I really don’t want her to do that. I’d rather go through what I’m going through than her commuting suicide so I’m just so stuck.

236,"Its been a rough year.  Without going into too much detail, my wife and I agreed to try polyamory, and I had a girlfriend whom I got probably too attached to.  My wife's jealousy pretty much killed the relationship, and caused me a ton of stress trying to keep both of them happy.  My girlfriend got tired of dealing with the constant issues (rightfully so), and broke up with me over the phone while we were all on stay at home orders.  Just gone, never to be seen again.  That led to a month of severe heartbreak and depression, and some resentment for my wife.  That's all cleared up since then, with some depressed days here and there, but nothing too intense.  Still thinking about my ex-girlfriend and missing her even though its been around 6 months, but its gotten less painful.  About a week or so ago, some switch inside flipped.  Before I was depressed that my girlfriend was gone and I wasn't able to be poly, which felt like the way I was supposed to be.  But I think I was depressed because I felt I deserved those things but couldn't have them.  Now I don't feel like I deserve anything.  My wife rarely wants to be intimate, but now I don't want sex or affection at all.  I don't even want to look in mirrors because I don't want to look at myself.  It feels like there's a weight in the center of my chest.  On top of that I've had dizzy spells for the last few weeks, not sure if they are related.  Also in spite of feeling worse about myself than I have in a long time, I've been very functional.  I'm getting tasks done and staying focused better than usual.

I finally got her a therapist and she’s been talking with him for a bit. I had no idea how hard it was to get a therapist. Anyways she also had trouble sleeping so we got her a sleep specialist and she’s working with them. She will soon start DBT group therapy. She’s doing pretty good besides the occasional freak outs and bad trips. She told me that she’s working step by step with her therapist and career/passion and jobs are not being focused on yet which is completely fine because you have to heal the mind I guess before worrying about money and what you want to do in life. 
So my question is I’ve been feeling pretty useless because I work pretty much full time and I focus a lot of my time when I can on my own craft but I want to know if there’s anything I can do to spark some interests for her. I know what she likes but I feel awful cus she tells me she wishes she knew what she likes or want to pursue and I want her to feel that joy of doing something you love.

I'm 19F and I've never been diagnosed for anything but both me and my mom have noticed symptoms of anxiety, adhd, and ocd. Theres probably more, but like I said I've never been diagnosed officially so I'm not sure what is/isn't actually there for me. Some probable mental illnesses I could have, or have been mentioned to me, is depression and bipolar disorder but I really don't like taking those into account because of my lack of research and lack of symptoms outside of manic states and quick mood swings (which I blame on adhd/anxiety).

The problem started when I would get into relationships, have a honeymoon phase for about a month, and then quickly became irritable and annoyed by my partner. All of these relationships were with men, so I assumed I was just a lesbian instead of bisexual and began trying to date women instead. This is my second wlw relationship, and I've been with her for longer than a month (6 months on the 22nd of December,) and I've suddenly just found myself extremely irritated and annoyed even thinking about it. I also began feeling gross and uncomfortable being in a relationship beforehand, which to my (awful) knowledge hasn't happened in previous relationships. I feel really bad because she really hasn't done anything to me, and I feel like a major AH when I think about how it isn't fair to her.

While this might look like it needs to be in r/relationship_advice, I'm actually coming to this reddit because I'm really worried about how quickly my happiness turned to anger and irritability so quickly. Is there any disorders or symptoms of the ones mentioned above that could cause this type of reaction? Or is this just a relationship problem I'd have to slide into another reddit to get answers for?

But I am tired. I am seconds away from having a breakdown. I am trying to hold it in but I doubt I can. These last few weeks have been so difficult and I don't know why. I have been dreading life so much lately. I need to continue writing my master's thesis but I can't. It's not even that I don't want to, I just physically and mentally can't. I spiralled back into this dark pit of sadness and constant disappointment. 

These days I fall asleep very late as I get very anxious at night. Thoughts keep going through my mind stating that I am a failure, doomed to fail in life, will never have a future. I can't see myself having a future and it scares me. Everyday I wake up wondering why I'm even here. Due to the fact I moved about 7 times in my 24 years of living, I do not have any in real life friends whatsoever. Sure I have a dozen of amazing internet friends, but I have no one in real life. This pandemic isn't making jt easy either. I long to enjoy life and find happiness, but all I can do these days is sigh and cry and wish I had died when the doctor told my mum I would. 

My mum calls me a miracle child, because somehow I managed to survive a very difficult birth despite the doctors giving me only 18 months to live. Yet everyday I wish I didn't. 

At first I blamed my constant sadness and negativity on PMDD (Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder), but looking at my cycle, it isn't that.

I feel like I am running out of time and having a midlife crisis at the age of 24. I haven't finished university yet, I have never been in a relationship, I have no friends. While it might not be true, other people their lives seem so much more glamourous than mine. I am scared that I will forever live in this dark cave and never be able to find happiness. 

I don't know what to do, I am lost and scared. I am so disappointed in myself for allowing myself to fall back into depression. I thought I was over and done with it, alas it came creeping back.

We're both in our 30s. Together 5 years.

She has a history of not doing anything about her mental health until it deteriorates to a breaking point (this has happened a few times now). Until we met, she just kept it hidden (and she did a good job of hiding it from me for the first while too),

This means that she lets it go and go, and we're at that point again, where she reached a breaking point, and everything falls apart. Then she finally accepts a (widely and very well known solution) and then she's okay for a while. Meds. Sad light. Therapy. Eliminating the root cause of the problem. etc

I'm supportive, I offer solutions, try to get her to talk thru the problems and come to her own solutions, I sit and just listen, help her see things from new angles, try to get her eating better, drink more water, go see friends, parents, socializing, exercise, (all the things you're told you're supposed to do), but it almost always falls on deaf ears. 

And it's getting frustrating. I'm living with someone who comes home from work, heads to their indent on the couch and buries themselves in their phone, games or TV until bedtime. She says she's fine... but it's very clear that's not the case.

How do I keep myself from getting sucked in? It's really dragging me down, having a partner that won't take care of themselves (when good or bad) and just grinds until breaking. Otherwise, I'm in a pretty solid place overall. Friends, good job, good money, shit more or less together. I've slipped in the past, and I don't want to go back there.

The first thing is that I moved home for the holidays and at first my bedroom door was broken and would not shut. It would slide open all the time. As much as I didn't want to, I then remembered something that happened to me in Late September at exactly 5AM after a party my roommates threw. I woke up to a guy in my bed. My door was broken at my apartment and would slide open unless I forced it shut. That's how he got in. 

The worst part is that I drank so much (and smoked so much weed) the night before I can't really remember anything. I know I had to move his hand or hands but I don't know where from. I know I was woken up by wet on my face and what sounded like suction on my lips but I don't know what it was because my eyesight was blurry. I know he was white and had blonde short hair but I didn't know his name or who he was. 

I can't remember the details. All I have to go off of is that when I asked him what he was doing he sleepily replied ""resting"" and then said ""Okay I'll leave."" 

I want to think he had a good reason to be in my bed. I want to think that nothing happened. But I can never be sure. And for that I feel so bad.

258,"Hi. Last year, I went down the long and winding road of getting formally diagnosed with ADHD. After I finished testing and got my formal diagnosis, I was encouraged to consider medication as an option. I've been dealing with anxiety for longer than I can remember. I've been seeing a therapist for over a decade, and it's helped *immensely.* I figured trying medication would be helpful, another tool in my kit. 

I had a panic attack during my first psychiatry appointment, and it was decided that my anxiety needed to be managed better first. Just as I was building trust with my first psychiatrist, COVID happened. Appointments went to video chat, and I was transferred to a different psychiatrist. This second psychiatrist and I didn't gel at all. I gave it a good six months, but after our last appointment, I still wasn't feeling *better* and they seemed reluctant to switch up my antidepressants. They suggested lowering the dosage on my ADHD medication, *the only thing keeping me functional right now,* and I freaked OUT. 

Anyway, after that disaster of an appointment, I screwed my courage to the sticking point and called the office, asking nervously if there was *any way* I could maybe see a different psychiatrist. I talked about it with my therapist, because I felt really bad about making the switch. He said it was good that I acknowledged that I needed a change, and was proud of me for doing it. He said good things about the doctor I switched to, and I felt better about it.

Today was my first appointment with the new  psychiatrist, and she was so kind and patient with me. I was nervous as all get out, and she could tell. But she told me to take a deep breath and tell me how I was feeling. After a few minutes of me telling her my troubles, she smiled at me and asked a couple of follow-up questions. Then she launched into a story, and asked me if I could relate to it at all. Her story described so many of my issues *so well.* I started sobbing when she finished, because it was the first time in forever I'd felt that someone was really *listening* to me and *wanted* to help me. 

So, it turns out it's probably hypomania and bipolar spectrum, and my current antidepressant meds can make those symptoms *worse*. So I'm going to wean myself off of those and try and a mood stabilizer instead. I'm scared about making the change, but I knew something wasn't right with the current medications, and I'm so happy that this person cared enough to really listen to me. So I'm going to try this stuff instead and see if it helps more. 

I'm so tired but today, I felt *hopeful* for the first time in over a year.",16Dec2020,1
259,"this is my first time using reddit so my bad if im horrible at this or mess up. 

but long story short, i have a hard time figuring out my mental illnesses. they came after a long traumatic experience with an ex-parent. 

heres a list of things that i do/ disorders i think i have? 

- i think/pretty sure im bipolar? or have some sort of form of bipolar disorder, because at random times my mood will switch or ill be like, putting my mind into some sort of senario where i can act out the current mood im feeling? and my friends have told me in the past that they think im bipolar.

- im pretty sure i dont have adhd, but at random times ill just like, zone out. i do it frequently in class, or just do something else instead of what im supposed to do, and its been a problem woth me for all my past teachers. and at random times ill just, not be engaged with life? 

- i have depression. dont know how bad it is, all i know is that i have it because teachers have asked + i only got it after the traumatic event with my parental. 

- i know for a fact im hypersexual, result from the traumatic event with my parental + weird sexual stuff i wanna do or stuff ive read or that i sexually pleasure myself nearly every night. and then sometimes the thought of having sex is replusive to me - is that normal? 

- im sucidial + have self harmed before because of me losing friends or me being outcasted hahahaha 

- i dont wanna hurt people but at the same time observing their pain is fun??? like watching peoples reactions to different stuff is just really interesting to me. like sometimes i just wanna create accounts just to hurt people + ive been manipulative before and i fucking hate i dont want to be manipulative and i dont even realise how bad it is until i reflect on my actions after???

- i wanna do bad stuff sometimes??? the thought of killing someone is sometimes fun to me but at the same time i truly dont wanna hurt people 

- i have intrusive thoughts, like getting fucked by the ex-parental again or getting r*ped by a bunch of people because the thought sounds fun??? 

- um, im under 18 so i dont think i can get a diagnosis? the other parental is emotionally abusive and sometimes physical and im like 99.9% sure she believes mental illness is something that can go away like hahaha i wouldnt be like this if you didnt date a pedo???",16Dec2020,1

263,"Hi guys, I recently found this subreddit while I’m trying to improve my mental help. I live in Asia where no one really care about mental health and I’ve bene every avoiding dealing with my mental health by drinking and smoking, but I’ve decided that it time to take action. I never actually share with anyone about my mental state, all my family members and my friends see me as completely healthy. I never knew what I’m really dealing with and I hope you guys could help me.

I’ve been dealing with mental illness for about 4 years now (I’m 19 atm) and most of it come from being physically and mentally abuse by my father. My parents have me when they were relatively young, my mom was 18 and my dad was 26. My dad is an alcoholic and I recently found out that he use drugs as well. My mom always tried her best but I felt like it was never enough. I was 14 when my parents divorced and my mom moved to Russia to work on her business. I lived with my dad for 2 years, he opened a bike washing business and I was a full-time employees. I really have no freedom, I can’t hang out with my friends in school since I was always working. Working for my dad for 2 years gave me lots of traumas, he was constantly yelling and hitting me during the time. Nowadays, every time I heard someone yelling or a sudden loud noise, my heart would missed a beat. My dad kicked me out at 16 when I had enough and stand up for myself. I had no family to go to at the time since my mom was still in Russia. I ended up living with my mom’s best friend and her family. I’ve known them my whole life and they treated my like family, but I always felt like I wasn’t a part of their family for some reason. I stayed with them for about a year, then I went to Canada to study grade 12. The 1 year I have in Canada was the best part of my life, I have full control of my life and I never felt better, I made some great friends and I never miss home. I graduated in January 2020 and got accepted to a uni in Canada, I have to take a gap year due to school start in September. I have to go home for 9 months, it was pretty fine before the whole pandemic things happened and I’m currently studying at mid night everyday and I can’t comeback until next September. 

It doesn’t end there, despite being mistreated, I was also a bad person from 15 to 17. I been in a few relationship, but I always manipulate my partners and toyed with their feelings, I even cheated on 1 person and she was thinking about suicide, thankfully her friend stopped her. I never forgive myself for what I did, I used it blame it on my parents divorce, but deep down I knew the only responsible for that was me. I been in one last relationship after that, and I got what I deserve, my partner cheated on my with my best friend. It’s been 2 years, but I could opened myself to anyone anymore, I never truly trusted anyone but myself ever since. 

Now, I’m 19 and I hate myself, I don’t have feeling for anyone anymore. I never missed my mom and I haven’t seen her for 2 years, we talk once every few weeks but I can’t really see myself having a good relationship with her, I feel extremely guilty for it. I used to have suicidal thoughts when I was 15 but I don’t anymore. For me, living is suffering, and I want myself to suffer every single day. But now I want to give myself a chance to be a better person and I am going to help myself since there is really no therapy when I am living. I want to know exactly what I’m dealing with as a first step. If you guys could give me any help of tips I would be very grateful

264,"I am hopefully going to speak to a doctor in a couple weeks for a proper diagnosis and to hopefully address some of my issues but for now I'm hoping you guys can give me something haha.

What ever I have has affected my life for as long as I known; socially (forming relationships and with my conversations), educationally (dropped out of college 2 times of courses I've enjoyed), work (focus, explaining things, stressing very easily). I'll list some of the main symptoms I can think of.

MENTAL FOG
my mind feels constantly empty. It's nearly impossible to think before I speak because nothing is going on (or maybe too much?) When I do try and think my mind gets easily distracted. This gets me frustrated in easily especially when it comes to explanations or expressing myself.

EXPLANATIONS
I can't fully understand my thought process, I remember as a child being asked questions about myself, what I've done during the day etc and saying I don't know, and actually meaning it. I can feel what my opinions are but cannot always put them in words.

IMPULSIVENESS
It feels like my brain is pressuring me to do something I shouldn't and it won't leave me alone until I give into it. That feeling got me to buy a car 2 weeks ago which I wanted to wait till May to buy to have a decent deposit. (Now I'm paying 2 finances until April). It also happens with other things like my driving, I drive very defensive sometimes for no reason..

FOCUS
it's nearly impossible to start a task or continue a task I'm not interested in. I zone out alot while doing tasks or trying to concentrate.

SHORT TERM MEMORY
I forget what I'm doing/ been asked to do all the time this happens mainly when I lose focus. But it frustrates me and can cause a loop which can get a bit overwhelming at times.

LONG TERM MEMORY
My memories are very over generalised, like I can remember faces, location but rarely events. The main events I do remember are stories told hundreds of times. Or from pictures. This makes my life feel pointless.. what's the point doing anything if I'm most likely not going to remember it...

I know there's more but I can't think of anything right now. Also as a note, these things happen alot of the times not all the time. There are times when I can concentrate on one thing perfectly, but this can burn me out mentally after a while until I lose focus (then I usually don't care about it any more haha)",16Dec2020,1

When this happens sometimes I do stop them, but I can't exactly tell if I'm upset, or anxious or anything in those moments. It's like my emotions just turn off and I don't feel anything. This happens kind of frequently for me where it's like I just unplug from myself, not just during sex. My question is, is that the same as being triggered? If not, is there a better word for this detachment from myself? I can't tell exactly what's going on with me in those moments, so I dont know.

274,"Little background: I (19F) am in the United States. My family has a history of anxiety, depression, ADD, and ADHD. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Two years ago I was told that I was at risk of developing an eating disorder. I saw a psychiatrist and a therapist but due to insurance and financial issues I had to stop. 

Recently it feels like my mental health is spiraling out of control. Nearly every aspect of my life is currently causing me stress. I’m worried about school. My home situation stresses me out. I’ve started a new job that I *love* but it also stresses me out. My car is on the fritz. I’m stressed about money. It just feels like everything is causing stress. I haven’t cleaned my room in so long since I feel like I don’t have the energy to do that, because I feel mentally drained, but my messy room stresses me out. 

I feel like I was finally getting a good grasp on my anxiety and depression but it feels like it suddenly intensified and hit me like a truck. I rarely have the  energy for simple tasks. I’ve rarely been eating. I feel like I have a very unhealthy relationship with my body right now. I don’t feel like myself. I feel like my body isn’t my body. Or that I’m not me? I feel very despondent and almost like I’m watching my life play out in third person. I feel like that this point it’s probably safe to say that either I’m starting to develop an ED or that my depression has suppressed my appetite. 

In addition to the above effects, I feel like I want to turn substances to help me. I think I have an addictive personality and I know that turning to a substance will only result in more harm. The past few weeks I’ve been considering getting a vape pen. I used to vape before I saw a psychiatrist and therapist. It felt like it helped with my anxiety and calmed my nerves. I don’t think I did it often or was dependent on it. Quitting was relatively easy as I did it on my first attempt but I still doesn’t want to turn to that as I know it could cause health problems. I’ve also had passive thoughts of self harm and that scares me. I’ve been free from it for two years and I don’t want to relapse. 

I haven’t really told anyone close to me about this because my parents usually act like I’m exaggerating things. My friends all deal with mental illness and they are all struggling pretty bad. It feels wrong to bring it up when they are already struggling. I’m always their rock. They’d worry too much. The same thing with my boyfriend. He’d worry too much and he feels too deeply. I don’t want to be a burden to anyone. I know that I SHOULD tell someone. I know my friends and boyfriend want to be there for me, but for some reason I can’t bring myself to say anything. Plus I can’t afford to seek help so I’m not really sure what good would come from it. 

I feel weird because you can clearly see the mental battle I’m facing of self preservation and wanting to destroy myself. It makes me feel like I’m just making things up or that I don’t actually have depression or anything because I’m trying to save myself. I guess I feel like a fraud. I’m sure I need to get back into therapy but I just can’t afford it. I’m not really sure what I’m looking for right now by posting this? Encouragement? Advice? Validation? I’m not really sure but here I am.",16Dec2020,1
275,"Hello! 

After a very dark period of my life, I recently decided to get myself some help and this has included medication. With some deliberation with my psychiatrist, I’ve been prescribed Wellbutrin and I think it’s working for me. 

This being said, I’ve noticed this past week that I’ve been consistently agitated and fairly irritated throughout my days.

277,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently trying to find papers and official research into mental health genetics and mental health causes. I will explain below in more detail.

&amp;#x200B;

I am wanting to understand whether mental health disorders such as EUPD (Emotional Instability), Narcissism, Bipolar Disorder, Anxiety and Depression can be caused from genetics or are they solely environmentally caused?

&amp;#x200B;

For this next part I shall name the person in question ""Fran"".

Fran is in her mid 40's, married (petty arguments common with husband, never physically violent though), and has 4 children. The Children's sex and age are as follows.

Eldest Child: MALE,  19

Second Born: FEMALE, 18

Third Born: MALE, 15

Fourth Born: MALE, 11

&amp;#x200B;

The Husband (male, 48) has struggled with mental health for practically half of his life. He lost both his mum and dad at around the age of 18 and joined the army almost immediately after this. He met Fran and had 4 children with her. in early 04/05 he was diagnosed with diabetes. In recent years he has been admitted into psychiatric units for his safety (at least once a year he is admitted). In the past year he has lost practically all of his eye-sight and is registered sight-impaired, along with having a double transplant mid last year. He struggles with his emotions as he keeps it inside, and he has been diagnosed with multiple mental health disorders. He constantly has petty back-and-fourth arguments with the female child.

The oldest child (male, aged 19) was diagnosed with diabetes just after his father in 04/05. He has struggled with emotions and depression since the age of 11, from the age of 11 until 18 he would self harm almost daily. aged 17 he was admitted into a psychiatric unit following an attempted overdose. Whilst in the unit he continued to attempt suicide, along with head-banging and frictions burns that would cover his face and arms. He has been diagnosed with: Depression, Anxiety and EUPD, along with possible bipolar.

The second oldest child (female, 18) has possibly suffered with mental health issues for the past couple years, led from witnessing and being around her father and oldest brother whilst they attempted suicide. Admitted into a psychiatric unit mid 2020, she was released with the diagnosis of psychological un-development and adjustment disorder. Eldest child has done some research as well as talking to his physiatrist and both the physiatrist and him agree that it is more than likely she has underlying narcissistic traits.

&amp;#x200B;

The third child (male, 15) acts oblivious to this all but knows what is going on. He has not been diagnosed with any disorders as of yet, however there is a possibility due to the things he has witnessed and heard.

&amp;#x200B;

The youngest child (male, 11) is also diabetic and this has had a huge impact on his life. He is awaiting multiple diagnosis's such as ASD and mental health disorders led on from the trauma of the diabetic diagnosis. Around the ages of 7-10 he would constantly take about death, say that he wanted to die and also head-bang, this has all since stopped since coming out of public school to be home-schooled.

&amp;#x200B;

Fran (mother, female, 45) has never been diagnosed with mental health disorders however has struggled with all of the issues presented in the past decade. She has been prescribed sertraline from the doctors but has been advised only to take it when needed (she is stubborn and says she doesn't ever need it). It has been suggested that she may also have EUPD along with the eldest son. She is denying any possibility of mental health disorders and says she is ""just emotional"".

&amp;#x200B;

Please can i have a professionals opinion and answer, or official papers or research to the above information. I would like to know how likely it is that Fran has mental health issues, along with mental health and genetics.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance to anyone that can help or provide relevant information.",16Dec2020,1
278,"I have a serious problem and it's about nostalgia or just looking back. When I do, it hurts so incredibly and I get a feeling that just wants to tear me apart. It really hurts and it's the worst feeling I've ever had. And I get this feeling all the time, it almost does not matter what I think about. Almost every event that I think back on, gives me that feeling and that's what's so weird. These events do not even have to be important or mean anything to me, but just the thought of how it was before gives me this feeling. And then when there are events that actually matter, this feeling becomes really torturing. It hurts so incredibly. Such events can be, for example, tournaments with the team, people I will never meet again or do not have the same relationship with, different events such as Christmas Eve or activities with friends, which I know I will never experience again. Then it is not really that I feel bad or sad now, because then maybe you could understand that you miss old times, and that is what is so strange.I am seriously afraid that I will commit suicide some day because the feeling will tell how it was in my childhood and so on. The more important events, the worse everything gets, I constantly build on small events that I for some reason miss. 

I need help. This is torture and my mind is killing me.This problem makes me just want to sit at home and never do anything, because I know that if I do anything, I will feel this way again because I get even more new events. For example, I can not even listen to my favorite music anymore, both because of this strange reason for missing completely random events, I associate the songs with important events that I miss, but mostly just because I miss these artists who are old and never will do music again (I listen to rock, etc.) It means, for example, that I can not play electric guitar as I have loved to do because I get so bad in my mind that I just want to cry. And what's so weird is also especially Christmas, which hurts me just by hearing Christmas music or just watching videos that are based on snow and Christmas. Then I immediately get this feeling for the 387th time that day and it hurts as much as the feeling of important events. I really do not understand why I get so much pain from looking back in time, even to events that are not even important, and even just from hearing about Christmas.

What is also connected with this is the future. I'm so scared that when I end up in an 8-4 job, I will be overwhelmed by these memories where I look back on my childhood where I had all these dreams of a football player or artist with the guitar. I will miss everything from my childhood so enormously and feel so disappointed in myself that I ended up in a completely normal adult life. I do not understand where people get joy from when it. It makes me push myself so much now and lose all motivation to practice on what I want to be good at, and when it happens I get so stressed, etc. precisely because I do not practise, because I know that I will then end up on such a job.

283,"I’m 23. The first time I tried to kill myself I was 8. So the first doctor, and the first diagnosis and prescription I was given started 15 years ago. Since then, I’ve bounced to at least 20 different therapists, psychiatrists, primary care physicians and specialists. Thousands and thousands of dollars, hundreds of medications, a few days in the loony bin and still, I don’t feel I’ve been heard or taken seriously. 

For example, a couple years ago I gave up and checked myself into a mental ward in hopes one on one daily evaluation would result in a treatment that curbed my suicidal ideations or my overwhelming fear of life. $1,500 and 5 days later I was sent home taking 1 mood stabilizer, 1 sleeping pill and 4 tabs of Xanax a day. Shit, I did feel better, I was numb. But when I went to my new psychiatrist the mental ward prescribed, I was informed the amount of Xanax I was on should have killed me. 

I change physicians, they hand out smiles and prayers and well wishes. But when I mention I’m non-functioning - can’t get out of bed, can’t walk out the door, anaphylactic shock every time I feel immense stress, unable to look in a mirror - they tell me “hold on, it gets better!” Or “that doesn’t make any sense, what do you have to be sad about?” And even better, “let’s scroll through this medication list and see what you haven’t tried.” 

Im in debt thousands to all of these doctors that never listened and never helped.

At that point I don't think I am able to see the difference between ""trusting someone"" and ""I don't care what happens because I'll survive""

Obviously when it comes to someone I love, I can't just not care.
When I hear something, my brain will automatically pick every possible outcome that could be harmful to me so I can protect myself in case it happens. I'm always ready to just run away and disappear because I'm used to things going wrong and getting hurt even if everything was previously completely fine, so I try to predict the unpredictable and just because ""someone, somewhere would"" it becomes a valid possibility, it has nothing to do with what I know about the person because I expect that anyone, any second, could do something unpredictable. Even with people I know are good, like my partner, who genuinely loves me. I keep waiting for the moment it'll happen, because I've always been treated that way. I'd like it to change, though

286,"I've been diagnosed with GAD and MDD, but over the years I've interacted with people with different other conditions, and as I interacted with them I started to develop symptoms of their conditions and begun to think that I may have them as well. The moment they moved out of my life, though, the symptoms went away. I don't know what symptoms are my own or what symptoms are me taking them from others.

* I dated someone with OSDD, and began to think that I had alters too but when we broke up and cut contact, I never thought about it and the 'symptoms' went away.

287,"I don't know the reason why they call me crazy, i kind of guess it and i don't know where to start. Firstly no one was calling me crazy, when i was in secondary school everyone was telling me i had some unusual behaviours (I don't even know what were they. I was a kid just like them) that's why i had no friends, boyfriends, or teachers admiring me despite my academic success

As the time passed, ""You have unusual behaviours"" turned to ""You're crazy"". From my mom to the cashier of my local market _(ok i exaggerated a bit, I don't even know the cashier of my local market)_ calls me crazy!

__I talked about myself too much, let's talk about the reason made me think i might be crazy...__

So, i fell in love with someone I've never seen in person (aka online). And moreover i thought he was my boyfriend for months till it came out as i was the only one had feelings like crazy, he loved me as a friend and we never became a thing (well he didn't even asked me sth like 'would you like to be my gf', I created everything in my mind.

Forget about that part. It's another dramatic story, now it came out (i think) an old friend of mine has feelings for me and I'm really scared because of the scenarios i create in my mind. [If you're not lazy to read you can check this submission about all the thing between me and him, and my fears.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/kdxhe4/theres_a_guy_who_has_feelings_for_me_i_think_im/) I'm like ""What happens if he murders me when i reject him?"" I don't know what makes me think in this way. I see news about the victims of femicides everyday, i think it makes me terrified this much. And if he has feelings for me or not is not even clear!

Every night i first start thinking about the guy who friendzoned me, then i try to tell myself he's gone. Then i start to think about the old friend and the evilish plans of him that he wants to apply on me such as throwing acid to my face or burning my house. Thinking about such things of course don't affect me good

Then i merge those 2 stories in one scenario; _""That old friend of mine confesses his feelings for me, i tell him about my fears while my body is shaking and I'm crying. He looks at me frustratedly and says 'I have loved you for years and you imagined me as a cerial killer seriously?'. I can't even reply him but say 'Please don't hurt me' then he tells me 'No, i never hurt you. Never intended to hurt you, I'll hurt myself' i still can't say anything but 'Please don't hurt me'. Then I learn that he attempts to commit suicide but he's now fine. And tells his family it was something I wanted. I start to feel guilty and tell myself what an insane creature i am. The old friend's family denounces me, so authorities decide to institutionalize me. They tell me I'll stay in mental hospital till i beat my paranoia. By the time they take me there, my best friend sends a message to the guy friendzoned me months ago, she tells him about all the stuff and he tells her he already understood i was crazy from the beginning""_

Don't judge me please. I know the scenarios i create in my mind aren't okay and so am i... How can i beat this? Am i seriously crazy? Even if i am, how can i get over this? I'm just a 17yo girl",16Dec2020,1

I've been having really big urges to do useless stuff (I don't know how to say it), basically stuff that would only have negative consequences. This is especially breaking valuables. Whenever i walk over a bridge/near a high drop I strongly want to just chuck my phone down, and that urge is nearly as big as my logic saying 'that's a dumb idea'. when I hold glass I also really wanna smash it, but knowing the cuts or mess to clean up I can just barely resist

on a bit of a darker note I sometimes have thoughts that sicken me, sexual stuff that I don't want to get in to but it disgusts me and actually doing it would land me in so much shit. I don't want to do these things but the thoughts happen. additionally the n word appears in my mind too much for my own comfort, but I know I have no prejudice against people of colour and id never want to call someone it. I get really worried with these thoughts because, it wont, but what if i say it or what if i act upon those thoughts?? im a very carefree person otherwise but thatd ruin my life and thats terrifying

Are urges like this normal? am i just worrying about this too much? If I am just a simple 'youre overthinking it' would clear my mind and make me feel way more content about it all, thank you

294,"Some mornings after my sleep, I wake up and feel tired, I feel refreshed but as well as exhausted from the travels that I did through my subconscious. Some mornings I wake up and feel like I need more sleep, some mornings I wake up and feel fully refreshed and ready to go. All mornings I know that I must follow how my body feels but as well as sometimes push through what my body is trying to condition me into feeling. The life of a human being is very peculiar, always changing, always evolving, always growing, always sharing, always learning, always failing, always realigning; We Pause, for a moment.

Energy is based on a feeling. Everyday is a new day, everyday is a new start but all mornings are a blessing to wake up, rise and start new. Its so interesting to me when I get energy based feelings that are different from what is trying to perceive me, that is trying to tell me, that is trying to scare me, that is trying to say one thing, when I can feel otherwise; God, I Thank you. Everyone and anyone can connect with those feelings, what it took for me was getting to a point where I was over my alcohol and marijuana abuse on my soul, spirit, being and my body. I had, had enough; I knew that there had to be more, there just HAD to be.

It all takes time. Life is about the time we are given daily. We can set goals to accomplish, we can work hard towards them, but most of the time the Universe will guide us differently, we may still accomplish said goals but it will come with many different experiences, learning, self growth that was unexpected; always for our Highest Self. Keep doing your best. Growth and Change comes through day to day hard work; giving yourself time and space from what is being focused on, to maintain grounding, presence and pausing.

a husk of what used to be

The ones that want to know the truth

The ones that when around me are uncouth

297,"I have two different issues that may or may not be related which I’ve discovered recently due to my relationship getting more serious and hence having to discuss more issues . First of, no matter how bad someone does me, I’m unable to get mad, I don’t even remember how that feels. I do feel rage sometimes, but not more than 2 minutes and just with my sister o mum and I shout something “rude” like fuck off or leave me alone and then I move on to something else or bustt into tears. But apart from that situation, when friends or my bf hurt me I don’t feel anger, I just think I should feel it and sometimes pretend I do. That makes it difficult for me to set healthy boundaries.

The second which I’ve only seen with my bf is that when I’m sad or sometimes even when I try to share things that worry me or that are not positive I feel like I can’t talk. I want to say these things out loud but I phisically feel like I can’t. He usually tries his best to support me and make sure I’m comfortable and within 10-15 minuts I’m able to say what I wanted to say.
For instance yesterday I told him I needed to set new boundaries, I didn’t want him to check my phone or have my insta account on his phone and that I will keep talking to my ex even if he doesn’t approve . It took me 1 hour to say it because I couldn’t even look at him when we meet ( we had previously fought about this) . At first I couldn’t move or look at him, he started to touch my hand and asked if it was okay( him asking always makes me comfortable). He talked first and stated his opinion in a passive-aggresive way and then he tried to get me to speak and i was able to tell him all. Once I start I don’t struggle to keep talking. I’m actually a very honest and talkative person so that is really contrary to my values.

He has been pretty shut in for most of his adult life, and has struggled to meet anyone romantically. For a whole, he seemed okay, just happy enough in his job and seeing his friends when he could (they don't live in the same city). 

But ever since the pandemic he's seemed even worse. He's always been easily agitated but now it's hard to know if a call or message will set him off. He only goes out to get food, and never sees anyone except occasionally me. He lives alone and works from home in a small flat. 

I'm really worried that he is depressed, but anytime we mention that we are worried or want to help, he lashes out. He doesn't ever seem to want to talk about how he's feeling and barely likes to chat at all. 

I don't want it to become so bad that he's deeply unhappy and depressed and I was just to afriad of causing an argument to do anything about it.

But how do you help someone who doesn't want to talk about what they are feeling??

301,"Diogo Portela - a professional Brazilian darts player. 

Unfortunately, tonight, Portela lost his darts match 3-0. But, that’s not the story that’s going around, there is a much better story to be heard. 

In the first road of the tournament, Diogo won his match 3-0. After the match, he broke down in tears. During his interview, Diogo revealed the adversity and challenges he has faced beyond the darting stage. Diogo sadly battles with depression, as does his wife. Also, his daughter is fighting an illness. He said “*To win at Ally Pally would be special any year, but this year was even more special. I've been to some really dark places this year. What I've been through this year I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. I was thinking about quitting darts and even killing myself. To overcome that and win on the stage after just two or three months, what can I say? This was a win for myself to prove how strong I am”. 

This shows everything. If you’re feeling down in the dumps or suffering with any Mental Health issues, your dreams are not going to give up on you. Life is going to challenge us in different ways, the most important thing to take out of it is how we fight back. Yes, you will experienced bad days, you’re going to face setbacks, but they will make you a stronger person. The pain isn’t there for nothing, it’s going to build you up into something you thought you were never going to be. No matter how you’re feeling, no matter what you’re currently going through, it will get better, I promise you. This stage of your life is important, it proves how strong you truly are deep down. 

Be like **Diogo**, don’t let this feeling get you down, don’t let it push you about and don’t let it defeat you. Take it each day at a time, you will come out the winner, even if you feel like the loser. We are currently living in hard times, but it will all be worth it in the end. You’re learned a lot this year, more specifically, about you. You need to believe in the person you are, believe that this whole situation is going to blow over and you’re going to leave with your head held up high.

303,"TW: My struggle with what’s pedo and what’s POCD, the OCD fear you’re a pedo.

I found out that most people online find it on when someone find an anime character who is in high school attractive.

I figured most people just aged them up in their heads, since most anime high schoolers look 25. They make underaged characters look so adult, it’s weird.

Online, I found takes such as “An adult should be able to see a character they were initially attracted to, find out their age, and then seperate themself from the initial attraction.”

So I decided it was creepy. However a few times I felt that attraction still and justified it in my head.

I finally tested it with Starfire from the animated movies

https://youtu.be/9TLX1KRDmV0

They decided to make her adult form and her on the Teen Titans look the same age. And lo and behold, despite knowing when they take place, I still got aroused by, and justified the feeling as just drawings, her TEEN Titan era form. 

Apparently, the aged up mentality is still very much frowned upon.

I once liked the taboo that I was able to find a character canonically underaged attractive because they looked like an adult.

So that means I do like underaged things? I really hope not.

Now I’m afraid that I’m an actual creep. How do I process this? Am I a pedo? Or doing pedo things?

The way they took attendance was if you turned in a certain amount of assignments per class per week, you were present. Fair right? I understand there are many teachers and students who have never had to do everything online to this extent before and the way things are being done is because students are having difficulties completing things when they’re not in a physical classroom. I am attending a high school who is doing remote learning due to covid-19, not an online school. I was confused about the requirements in order to be counted present and due to this I got marked absent a crazy amount of times, despite completing my daily work. The dean sent me an email saying she was coming to do a home visit on this date at this time. She didn’t ask my dad if she could come or gave us any notice she just said that. So my dad called her and said why that was disrespectful and told her a different day and time she could come. She said that she had to check with some other staff if that would be alright and that she’d get back to us. She never got back to us and showed up at the house on that day. My dad told her to leave because she never told us she was coming and it was disrespectful to do that which I would think is fair? Anyway, after that, I sent a very long email to the school counselor, explained my situation and told her i’d like to meet with her on zoom in an attempt to clear any confusion regarding my situation. She said she would like to do that and that she would let me know a date, in which she never did. After that, I had no staff members reach out to me regarding my attendance until I was put on a truancy diversion program. Up until that point I thought I was doing fine and was improving because they hadn’t said anything to me. but no. No warning, nothing. I understand the expectations now to be counted present during remote learning at my school and my attendance rate is at a high 80%. I am planning on dropping out and getting my ged once i turn 17 which i have told my truancy officer. I thought I was doing better she and everyone told me i’m doing better but she’s trying to get a release of information from my therapist which seems extremely intrusive and i’m honestly regretting ever being honest with my therapists again. I just started to open up about things to my therapist because I want to better myself but it feels like i’m being treated like a criminal for being confused on what I needed to do for attendance during a global pandemic when the instructions and expectations have been constantly changing and have been consistently vague. Are they even allowed to just put me on truancy without a warning? Are they allowed to get a release of information from my therapist? The paper i signed for truancy only said they were allowed to get info from my school. That was the only box that was checked. I feel like relapsing i haven’t gotten thoughts like this in a long time i feel awful about myself and everything. Shame on me for trying to get help. Any effort i put in isn’t enough. I’m literally dropping out the second i’m old enough to. I will attend school until then but I have no interest whatsoever in doing credit recovery or finishing high school. The school system has made me feel worthless my entire life and this is probably the worst it’s been. I am trying so hard to make things right to get out of this program as soon as possible but the fact that this lady is trying to get a release of information from my therapist honestly just doesn’t seem right. I am trying to get better but I don’t even want to anymore. I am so mentally exhausted I wish I was normal I wish none of this ever happened.

I’m being pushed into a depressive episode and I feel like i’m loosing control again. I was so hopeful for the rest of this year before this. I’ve seriously started improving so much with myself but after this all happened I started lashing out again and have been having panic attacks and less and less care for myself. I just wish I could have control over this. I hate being underage it feels like my life is in the governments hands. It feels like I have no control over what’s going to happen to me.",16Dec2020,1
319,"I don't know what to do anymore. Everyday is crying, severe stress and suffering, I harmed myself again after I had stopped for months. Shitty sleep schedule. Phone addiction, unproductiveness, time waste, and on top that being in love. I am uneasy 24 fucking 7!

Every time I love someone I end up getting hurt, and it is MY FAULT, not theirs. I have very unstable relationships, meaning I probably love everyone 10x more than they love me, and it is tormenting, because my brain creates unrealistic expectations to my friendships etc. 

Sometimes I just want to say fuck having family and friends, smash my phone, delete all social media and isolate myself from this world. I can't love anyone more, because it always hurts me (and that's MY fault, let me make that clear).",16Dec2020,1
320,"The first time I was abandoned, it hit me incredibly hard because I was already at an unprecedented low point, had very few resources, and was very unprepared in terms of mental health awareness in how to navigate such things. It turned all of my outward resentment inward, and resulted in excessive self loathing and feelings of worthlessness.

Then in short succession, it happened again. Then over the next two years or so, it happened several more times. To varying degrees of severity, I'd say it happened about 9 times. Each one left a mark, though particularly the 3rd and 5th, and 6th. The 5th was the most painful experience of my life.

I've had periods of enthusiasm and concerted efforts, but each day that I feel exhausted I return to the same old place. The more effected I feel, the less capable and worthy I am of pursuing new connections.

I've used dating apps/sites for about a year, from mid 2019 to mid 2020. I've also occasionally responded to other personal listings and such. I know these matters are pretty dramatically different between men and women, but although I haven't literally kept count I'd say I probably messaged some 150-200 people. For my own profile on rare occasion someone would message me first, but it only happened a handful of times. On several of those the girls lived extremely far away, and it never amounted to anything anyway.

At a certain point, adding up the congruence of evidence, I came to the conclusion that I must be generally perceived as a very low value person. I'm not really sure why though.

Sometimes when people talk about abandonment or rejection, within a short interaction it's fairly easy to see why others don't want to be around them. Maybe they're aggressive, resentful, have disorders or addictions, are disrespectful or emotionally erratic, boring, unattractive, self-absorbed, some repellent trait. Others aren't so immediately obvious, though after a good amount of time their flaws become more apparent. Others sabotage themselves. They complain about being lonely, but dismiss or avoid opportunities for connection. It's like being hungry, but also being extremely picky about where and what you'll eat.

I don't really know what my repellent trait is. I have theories, but I can't apply those theories to others as they're not repellent to me. When I encounter someone similar to myself of the opposite sex, I'm usually attracted to them earnestly. I can only assume it's something regarding the dichotomy of the sexes, that I can't ever put myself in a woman's position to see things from her point of view because men and women relate to each other differently and the same standards don't apply. If I go too far down that route though, it leads me vaguely toward a sexist mindset, and that's something I don't want to pursue.

From what I hear from women though, they typically have the opposite experience. Their dating profiles are overloaded with messages, even if they're pretty unremarkable, even if their lives are a mess and they possess many of the negative traits they condemn in others - even if their profile doesn't even have a picture.

I became so exhausted by these trends that for awhile I stopped altogether. During my break, I focused on improving myself, so as to raise my value, and I've made a fair amount of progress. Then as of late, I've gently tip-toed back into it, but even with the lightest attempts I see the same old patterns. I feel too jaded to go back to my initial idealism and determination. The people who really hurt me, the way they've treated me I'd never treat anyone else, and I prove that through my actions. I'm conditioned to all of my investments abruptly going poof, to patience not paying off, to low-quality people. I'm used to taking the high road, while everyone else takes the low. I don't feel as if my energy will ever replenish, but maybe at best see periods of optimism, followed by cynicism at being proven wrong again.

I guess I'm just sick of every day that I feel less capable, I'm taken back to the same old place. People can't exist in a constant state of recovery.

I recall Tara Reade, the woman who was sexually assaulted by Joe Biden, claimed that her experience stuck with her for now almost 20 years after. That it wasn't just his actions, but his words ""you're nothing to me"" that caused her trauma. I can relate to that. I know that how I feel and what I think don't matter to those people, that in their minds they're better off without me. I know that it's not the physical setting that impacts us, but the way those situations made us feel. It's knowing you're nothing, that you don't have value, and that even the best you can do or the most you can give isn't worth it. That's what sticks with you.",16Dec2020,1
321,"I often hear many people say, ""well, it's an ideal vs realistic world."" Personally, it sounds like one is merely making excuses for others when they use this phrase. Do you agree, and please explain why or why not? Thank you so so much!!",16Dec2020,1
322,"I feel like I'm a lazy adult living with my parent in my late twenties to thirties not doing anything with my life but I'm 16. 

I feel like a failure and like i need to provide for myself but I'm only 16. 

I feel like I'm desperately holding onto whatever bit of my childhood is left and wanting it to come back and stay with me. I'm still technically a kid. Idk why i feel this way. I can't enjoy my childhood and haven't for years. it feels gone.",16Dec2020,1
