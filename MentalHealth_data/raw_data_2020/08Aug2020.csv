0,"So, I (17) have a very nice friend of many years. Recently (passed couple of months) he has being struggling with his mental health. He has opened up to me a few times, when it's noticeable that he isn't right, he explains that his 'mental health is in the gutter' and he's 'really struggling now'. He feels like he is losing some friends and has mentioned having experienced the fear of missing out alot.

This, obviously, is worrying. He has a very strong relationship with his girlfriend who is trying to help out all she can. He has mentioned to me that they are looking into some form of therapy for him, which I have heavily pushed for. 

However, he hasn't started yet. In the mean time id just like your thoughts on what to do/say to support him as much as possible. I want him to get better and be his best self but I'm not too sure what to say to him. 

Thanks for your help",08Aug2020,1
1,I feel like whenever people get angry at me I feel like I’m about to cry or lash out at them. I always feel really horrible for doing whatever they’re criticizing me for and my mood goes super sour. I just don’t know how to take criticism. I don’t want to feel like I’m about to break down or get super pissed and yell at them every time someone says something I needed to work on - whether it’s an insult or with good intentions.,08Aug2020,1
2,"My younger sister is 23. Her health issues began her second semester of college when her anemia caused her to be tired to the point of needing to crawl to and from the bathroom. She received the help she needed and served an 18 month religious mission in Chile where she regularly walked miles a day and interacted with people.
After her mission she resumed college and, for a time, she seemed okay. But, at some point she stopped going to classes and she was diagnosed with depression. She received therapy and is on medication. 
But, she still struggles to do literally anything aside from sleeping and eating. Currently, she has been home with my parents since Covid19 began in March. I'm also visiting my parent's from college as I'm worried about my sister. She's getting all the treatment she should need, but seems unwilling to be helped. She regularly doesn't take her pills and becomes resigned or angry when we try to encourage the most basic activities like going on a walk or watching a movie.

What can I do?",08Aug2020,1
3,"Any response is greatly appreciated, I don’t really have anyone I can ask.

After she confessed to me, I tried my best to say the right words but I wasn’t sure what the right words were. I asked her if she rather not be alive than go to school to reconfirm, and she hesitated at first but then said she told me that she thought she rather kill herself than go to school. I said that “we can’t afford therapy right now even though I know you want to see a therapist”, I told her I will try my best to arrange something for her. I myself have considered suicide and I told my sister words that would have reassured me. I said that what I do is sort my feelings so that I can comprehend them better. I didn’t want to say that this will solve her problem, as I myself don’t like to hear false guarantees like that, but I said that it’s better than letting the problem sit there. I also said that I meditate in silence to focus more on myself more but now I realize that she might prefer to listen to music (she listens to music very loudly) to fill any silence. I feel bad because I know that everyone has different ways improving their mental health and her way and my way are most likely different from each other.  I explained to her that suicide and going to school might seem like the only options but they aren’t. There’s also the option to do independent study or the option to go to another school where she can finish high school early, I also said that if she doesn’t like those options we can make a new one. I also tried to explain the positives of maybe going to school, as she is transitioning from middle school to high school and they are different. I said that when it’s hard for me keep going I try to appreciate small things, like how she doesn’t like people but I said that people also have a good side, which I know was very poorly said of me. I expressed to her that I wish she could have the good feeling of excitement before the first day of school to show that I want the best for her. I don’t know what to else I should say. I am aware that I am not good with my words, that is why I am asking for help. What would be the best thing(s) I can do for my sister?

FYI: My sister is not being bullied and she has a good group of friends (not close but they can exchange homework help and eat lunch together and have hung out twice and sing songs together but they don’t text outside of school, strictly school friends as her at-home personality varies greatly), but rather she finds school terrible and unpleasant...from the fake/toxic/annoying peers around her to the staff that don’t do their job the best.

I also believe the pressure of high school and onwards adds to her negative feelings towards school. my sister has also mentioned multiple times before that she is unsure what she wants to be when she grows up/she doesn’t what she can be good at when she grows up, I have told her many times that it’s normal to not know at that age and even at age 20 people are still exploring.",08Aug2020,1
4,"I fought (diagnosed) depression for 2 brutal and terrible years and made it out alive, but recently I’ve been feeling uncertain in life. I moved away from my parents and got a job about 5 months ago and felt GREAT but recently I’ve felt odd, not in a depression way but still bad. I feel like I’m going to spend my life working a manual labour job and I’m just not sure how to handle it.
I no longer feel depressed or suicidal but I also don’t feel happy I officially graduated my school and feel NOTHING. I’m not at risk or anything but I’m starting to worry about my mental health and possibly slipping back into my “slump” has anyone felt the same?",08Aug2020,1
5,"Basically the premise of the dream was that I was hanging out woth some friends who I do put to a high standard and genuinely appreciate. Now these friends in the dream tended to go off and do their own thing with each other, often times saying “oh i forgot to tell you we were going [somewhere]” or “we lost you in the mall or in the street” stuff like that. So in real life this would’ve fucked with me hard I would’ve been beating on myself that they obv don’t want to hang out with me and that I was annoying, etcetera. But instead in the dream I thought, oh well this is an opportunity to explore the mall or explore the city, things like that. And the lesson you could say of the dream was that solitude can be extremely rewarding, that there are things you can do alone that will have been extremely fun. It was a strange thing to experience since I’m very people centered and put my value in how others see me, but I think I could align myself with the lesson :).",08Aug2020,1

7,"And I mean ""often"", not ""always"".

Like say somebody comes up to you, punches you in the face, tells you you're ugly and stupid and unworthy of love.

Upset? That's your fault! Because only YOU decide how you feel. Feeling bad is a choice and if you don't stop feeling that way it's nobody's fault but your own.

So yeah, victim blaming.",08Aug2020,1

9,"Ever since I remembered I wanted to have my own business. I had a massive backing from my family, who made it possible for me to study abroad, fully supporting me. 

Now I’m sitting on 3 degrees in management, while scanning items in a discount supermarket. I feel disgusted by myself as I am miles away from what I dreamt for myself and thrown away a background, others would kill for. 

I have had jobs in my field, established a company, but just cannot force myself to work on it. I have fully planned what I need to do to build the business, but cannot make myself to walk the talk. Every now and then I do some work and then feel happy that I did, but for some reason I do not have the drive to make myself happy by working on my dream, as if I did not wish myself to be happy. I always just say “fuck it” and have some reason why what I am doing won’t work or I’m incompetent to do it, even though I have proof I’m fully capable of competence. 

I just don’t know what I should do to make myself do, what I know I want to do. This feeling is leading me to dark places, where I feel in a vicious cycle. Please give some advice how I could help myself.",08Aug2020,1
10,"I love to read but in the past few years my symptoms (either from meds or just my diagnoses) have not allowed me to concentrate as well as I need to. I have found that I can’t read a book unless I have the audio version. Then I either just listen or listen while looking at the text in a physical copy. The only problem...I can’t afford to buy an audiobook (AND possibly physical) version of every book I would like to read.

11,"It’s like people keep saying “who knows your life could easily change tomorrow or in a week or even a year” but it’s like I’ve been stuck in tbis place for 3 years and it won’t change, and I’ve tried to change myself, I’ve tried to excersise, to be positive etc but it still won’t change, it feels like I’m sitting here waiting for things to get better and trying so hard to keep going and living and trying to make things okay but I always feel empty no matter what I do, it’s like the problem is me, my family has had no idea I’ve ever felt like tbis and I’ll never tell them because they’ve been through too much already, it feels like my time is being wasted with sadness and it feels like even if I do someday feel okay I’ll still constantly wish I was happier for tbis period of my life, I’m 17 and tbis is the time where you’re supposed to “make the most” and I do everything I can, I have fun but as soon as I’m alone I’m empty again, I can’t fucking take it, and now I just feel like an asshole because I’m not even mentally ill but I’m complaining in a subreddit of people with worse issues than me,  I cut my leg yesterday on purpose and it was a strange sense of relaxation, like I had control, the pain felt good, I know it’s fucked up and I’ll regret even making this post but I don’t know when things will be okay",08Aug2020,1
12,"I doubt there will be much coherence here, my mind is pretty much a cluster fuck of fucked up things.
Like anyone it feels like a lot has gone on in my life. I’ve gone through so many stages and transitions of who i am and what i think and it’s hard to know who i am sometimes but i feel like i’m getting far away from the toxic versions of myself that i despise and see now as a product of things i never saw before, things i’d just blame on myself. 
When i look at things at a mental standpoint i always view myself as insignificant figure in terms of how ‘bad’ i was. I don’t ever think i had any conditions yet i have these lines all over my arms and legs. What are they i ask myself sometimes, are these proof or are they just what happens when someone is sad? I don’t think i had anxiety or depression but i spent years void of any real emotions, not understanding what to feel in different situations because feeling doesn’t feel natural anymore. A pessimistic view of everything life could possibly bring me, letting things go downhill because what does it matter in the end? Going to school and interacting with people like i don’t wish the cars i don’t look up to on the way there hit me, like my arms and legs arent in pain from the cuts i give myself to see something that at least makes me feel alive. Like i don’t have storms of thoughts that freeze me in place unable to do a thing, frozen in place like the dread is physically holding me by the throat. Like it doesn’t feel like there’s people inside my head that want me to sit by and just watch life happen and just accept what comes to me. Like i don’t feel like i’m completely insane, my head telling me the worst things possible, telling me i’m someone i’m not, telling me the pain feels good, telling me my end will be a simple blip in the grand scheme of things for anyone who knows me. What does it matter? Why does it matter if i’m gone, in the complete darkness there won’t be any of the pain, it won’t by scary, it won’t be riddled with self hatred and mental scars i wished i confronted earlier. 
Have i tried to end it? I ask myself that quite a lot, i guess i have. But i have this thing about questioning my worth as someone with mental issues, did i do enough to say i attempted? Was doing something i thought could kill me one? Was everytime i tried my best to push down the razor just that much more just so the tears could stop one? Another thing i question. Are my scars valid? I see people with much deeper scars and it makes me think if mine are just what ‘normal’ people do and i’m not really that bad. But in reality some part of me wants to cling on, so everytime i tried to go that bit deeper that part would fight so hard, my chest would go tight and my hands would shake, the tears would come but i never remembered feeling like crying. But once again i question this as well. I still think i’m just a bitch and i should just pick up the blades again and prove i’m not okay, and i never was ‘solved’. I’m a ticking time bomb that never got solved. I’m over a year clean and the battle of that thought is winning me over more and more everyday. It scares me. This ‘competitive’ nature around mental health i seem to have is a outcome of being introduced to self harm by toxic friendships who showed me their cuts and talked about how many they had like it was a competition and fake friends who ruined my confidence and made me lose any childhood innocence i had. Forcing myself to be with them to feel like i wasn’t alone, while i was their laughing stock. The fact my mind was innocent once is depressing, knowing at some point these thoughts weren’t here. And now that time will never happen again. 

I wish i could tell myself i have friends who really do care about me, people i can tell i’m not okay, people who i know care, people i don’t feel like i burden, people i can feel safe with. I don’t think i would ever ask more from this world then to just have people like that. 

I’m the black sheep out of the family, the one who just has to be fucking insane. It makes it hard for them to understand and i can’t blame them i just wish they could. But that feels like asking for too much at this point.

God i wish i could just get all of these thoughts and feelings out, everything i say just feels like the surface of everything and saying just that doesn’t feel like enough. I wish i could get help i do. But the mental health care system here feels useless and i’ve never felt comfortable talking to a therapist like they won’t take me seriously, like i have to make them happy by lying to them while my mind screams at me to just say the truth. To have someone who can help me and i can feel comfortable saying this too, someone i won’t be terrified to cry in front of. 
I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m at a boiling point and i’ve got so good at pushing it all down and being ‘fine’ that it’s so hard to confront all of this again. 

I’m scared of myself and i don’t want to, i don’t want to feel like a disgusting mess, i don’t want to hate how i look, i don’t want to feel terrified by social interaction, i want to feel comfort not be horrified by people’s touch. I want to feel like i know who i am, and i don’t. I don’t know what i am and i don’t know how to change it. I always feel like i have to make things better but i can’t even solve myself. I just want to be who i want to be. I don’t want this to be me. I don’t want to feel like this anymore. 


But what does it matter anyway, this world is so fucked and stress filled is it even worth it in the end. I’m trying so hard but my old habits feel like they could happen at any point and i know they’ll be deeper than ever, it’s all i’ve ever fantasied about for 2 years. That maybe someone will hear my silent screams when my body has deep carvings in them. I’m trying so hard to avoid that, but it’s getting so hard 

I’m just so tired",08Aug2020,1
13,"She has a semicolon tat. She's been suicidal before. She's never killed herself... but we've never lived through an isolating pandemic before, either. She lives alone.

15,"Hello, i’m sorry this is my first post on reddit so it might be off but i just need some kind of help. A couple days ago i turned 16 and for the past 4 years my dad has had a breakdown which resorted in him having a bunch of mental challenges some of which now add up to depression, anxiety and being bipolar.

Some times he is fine and normal and other days everything just goes to shit. we’ve been with mental health teams since the breakdown but all they do is change or give medicine once in a while and say how he needs therapy but just leaves him on the waiting list for it never giving him it

for the past month it’s been really tense and every other day its resorted in him getting angry at night trying to start a fight and just yelling at my mum about things mainly things i could’ve of done say months ago and every time slamming doors and breaking things. It’s been a horrible month and we really need help but when my mums been calling they say that he’s on the urgent list but he has been for 3 months. Whenever he gets angry and yelling and punching i end up going upstairs in my room because that’s what my mum tells me to do but i just feel terrible

I don’t know if there’s any ways to help or cope and i was just wondering how to go around this. me and my mum are just really struggling because of how it’s been but i can’t tell her because she has her hands way too full looking after him, meaning my way of coping is crying most nights doing voice recordings to myself as a way to let atleast everything out because i feel like a burden if i let anyone else know.

i’m sorry this went on longer than i thought but i’ve googled around and never really found any ways to help my situation. i don’t honestly know what i’m expecting from this but if anyone has any advise of growing up around this cause it fucking sucks being mentally put down for 4 years by a man who i can’t be mad at because it’s his mental health",08Aug2020,1
16,"I think I might have schizophrenia

Sorry for my bad English. It's 2 am and I can't check any grammar or anything It will be separated into different parts about different experiences, im new to posting on reddit so I don't know how to properly format everything :3 lol
During the last few months I've realised that I might have 

schizophrenia. I never hear voices like someone talking to you. It's more of someone putting something directly into my brain. Like someone typing a command like some nights ago when I started crying and taught about jumping out my window.

Sometimes I feel like I'm being watched. Like my parents (my abusive mom) is watching me or monitoring my computer and social media. When I was 11 or 12 I had to sleep in the first floor of my house and I couldn't sleep if I could be seen from outside the house. Now my bed is to the side of my window so I don't encounter this problem but I sometimes feel like someone is walking over and looking trough the keyhole or opening my door. I sometimes see lights shining into my room that disappear quickly (i live 20km from the closest big city and the only houses around my house are small and wouldn't be able to creat such lights)

I have a plushie that I've had since birth and It has its own personality I've never names it but I talk to it and it helps me in important life decisions.
I sometimes feel like people are talking about me or commenting or laughing at me but when I look for them there are no one around.

I can't take showers(I still clean myself when I take baths) cuz the sound and pain I get form the water hitting me. I can't stand the sound for more than 10 seconds and it feels like I'm being burner or like fire is hitting me. I know it's not the temperature Of the water or the water I have cuz I take baths with the same temperature and water. Idk how to explain more becomes in tired (24\7) and I should sleep but I can't .

18,"Hello. I am 19 y/o right now. Something about myself have bothered me for a long time. It's my weird, day dreaming.

Okay, so for some description on background, I like programming and Maths. Despite spending last years of highschool into games, family problems (and my mental state) I regained hope and dive into them again for now. I was not bullied much tbh, despite being nerdy. My father was a criminal and we left him, but my mom never let me feel I don't have father, so I doubt it has an affect on me. I was decently popular, though I kinda gave it all up, when I was starting to get addicted to games, neither I liked classmates and all much ever. Yeah, I never fit in. That's only thing odd with me. I tried, but I always felt something off, about myself, about others. And I see it relating to what I wanna say further. So now about what made me write this?

It's morning right now, I will sleep soon. Which reminds me of something happened last time when I woke up. I had a very good dream. And I instead of waking up, slept again to continue it. It happens a lot.
Now that's not serious. But it binds up to another real issue. That is, daydreaming of past actions, and what I could have done to alter them. Thinking too much ahead of what can happen in future, too.
Yes, I am a 3rd worlder, and broke. It made me devoid of many opportunities. Family problems got me into many issues myself. And when I was 13-14, porn addiction, and after it some game addiction too made me ruin many opportunities. Then the rumination came when I gave up hopes on all hobbies
But I regained it all. I have some plans. Just daydreaming seems to hamper me sometimes, when I struggle with a problem , I space out making up scenarios. It's a real issue for me,and yeah I think it has to do a bit with loneliness. I don't really have desire for luxuries and such, but just having a guy do something with me kinda motivates me way too much and I forget dreaming. It's just a guess. 
I want some genuine help to increase my productivity, after all the precious time I wasted. I'd really appreciate suggestions and help from everyone here",08Aug2020,1

21,"
I’ve been fantasizing for as long as I can remember. I’m a 17 year old boy from Toronto and I have some severe self esteem issues, I don’t know where they root from. I’ve got a great family, I’ve got hobbies and interests (I love music and play guitar) but somehow I never know how to appreciate the good in my life.  

For a while I’ve been fantasizing about being more social and going out more often and being more interesting (I’m an introvert and I wish i was more social) I’m working on my social anxiety and I think it’s getting better but in my fantasies I’m always very social. Also I’m obsessing over getting approval and I fantasize about getting approval from my idols (people who don’t even know me). I fantasize about being in an elevator with my friend and having a conversation with him/her that catches the attention of my idol.... the elevator is like my happy place. Whenever I feel uncomfortable with reality or self conscious, I play music and pretend I’m in the elevator. 

It sounds weird but it’s so normal to me at this point. Now I want this to stop, it makes me feel temporarily happy and self fulfilled but it’s ruining my life and I know it’s bad and toxic but I just can’t stop. I can’t learn to love myself and be grateful for my own reality. Also I fantasize about my male idol being my father. Even though I have a really good caring dad, I feel guilty about that but I think that’s because if he was my father I know I’d be getting direct approval from him or something. 

How can I learn to just live in reality and be grateful. I just want to love myself and stop fucking fantasizing. 
I keep thinking my idol would probably look down at me, and why? What’s wrong with me? Apart from my deep self esteem issues. I don’t know. I’m always trying to escape my flaws when I wish I could just face reality. Sorry to get so repetitive. I’m a bit drunk right now.",08Aug2020,1

My issue is like. nothing feels real. nothing does. and there’s almost two different feelings of this detachment from reality. 
sometimes i’m IN the moment and it does feel real, but it really feels like none of my actions have any repercussions. I know they will but i feel like. i can’t rationalize myself because nothing feels real. like i’ll blow up and get upset and angry and freak out and say stuff and not realize it was wrong until it’s too late.  this feeling of having no repercussions makes me lie a lot and i feel like that will really ruin my future. It lets me lie and procrastinate and i end up ruining so many relationships because i blow up with them and can’t process until it’s too late that this is REAL and not right. 

Or I’ll be just lying in bed on my phone calmly and i won’t feel like myself. I feel a thousand miles away from my body and reality and nothing feels real. it’s like i’m floating and not myself 
This is a vivid explanation but it’s like expecting a surface you’re going to lean against to be hard and solid like concrete, and when you hit it, it’s not there. nothings there, except soft, fragile fabric. and i break through the fabric, and i’m falling. like i’m falling in slow motion, in an endless loop, and everything’s foggy and soft. like a polaroid photo. and i’m just not myself. like i’m not me. and nothing is me. and nothing is nothing. and nothing is everything. and it’s almost like. an existential crisis. nothing is real and the universe somehow ends somewhere and that scares me but it doesn’t feel real and nothing i’ll ever do has any impact on anything because i’m so small. 

if you have any questions please ask, and if you could just. share if this is normal or if you feel the same way or if you think you know what this could be or if you could do ANYTHING or tell me anything to try to explain this please help. i’m lost and i feel like i’m trapped in my mind but also like i’m not myself and i’m just floating around encaged by the forced that control the universe",08Aug2020,1

28,"I went through a relationship where I’m pretty sure I was cheated on and lied to for 3 months. Since then, anytime I meet someone new, I don’t feel any desire to connect with them. I just think everyone’s going to walk out on me or use my personal problems against me. 
Don’t even get me started how I feel when it comes to dating. I want to date again so bad but I just think I’m gonna get lied to again and I don’t think the pain is worth it. 

I don’t like living in a world where I can trust anyone or talk to anyone but I don’t know how to get out of the pit I’m in. I’ve slipped into a more depressive quiet version of myself than I was before. I just want to know how I can try to get out of this.",08Aug2020,1
29,"As it says in the title I just feel trapped in life. I am under 15 (m) and, I don't want to sound like I have massive ego, but I would say above average intellect.

I love this about myself, the fact that I'm doing well in school/have good grades. But even though I have friends, no-one shares my interest or likes and I just feel lonely. Its like I'm the only kid in my year who's self aware, or smart enough to know what's going on in the world or make informed decisions.

There is really only one person who I can talk to about serious topics like climate change, politics and mental health. But she has gone to a different school and I got really made fun of for hanging out with her so I have kind of lost contact with her.

I think that the more aware you are the more likely you are to be depressed or have mental health problems, (I don't have any that I know of) but my base level of happiness is just quite low anyway.

My biggest fear is failure and sometimes I just want to escape and run but I'm smart enough to know that that is not a good idea.

My relationship with my dad is not great, but he probably doesn't know, I feel I have to hide my emotions from him l. My mum is better but it's still not great.

Sorry for my ramblings, I just don't feel great right now, and had to talk to someone. Hopefully I don't sound like massive narsacist.",08Aug2020,1
30,"Hey everyone, first time poster and on mobile.

So most of my favourite music is Pop Punk or Emo and  most of it has, as expected, less than optimistic lyrics.  I really like this music and listen to it frequently but I often find that it makes me feel worse in the long run. I love bands like: My Chemical Romance, The Wonder Years, The Front Bottoms and Modern Baseball (please (though it is antithetical to my post) listen to these bands and recommend your favourites) but after long listening sessions with them I find myself having similar hopeless and depressing thought patterns that are outlined in all their lyrics.   I am very aware of how music can drastically change a person's mood and I find myself in a lose-lose situation where I either enjoy my favourite music and continue to process pessimistic lyrics all day or give up a genre I love.  

Any advice?",08Aug2020,1

I work for my local government. This comes with all sorts of annoyances and struggles. Red tape slows my work, most of my coworkers are insanely lazy or just outright don't care about producing because getting fired is next to impossible, and the public constantly treats us poorly (being clear, I am not a police officer). Added to all of this, I struggle badly with a self blame problem. I don't know where it comes from or why I do it, but anything bad that happens at work I assume I could have prevented it or should have done something more to stop it. This leads me to feeling like I am constantly trying to keep the place running and worrying when the slightest issue pops up. This has only gotten worse with covid as there are less projects to complete and the work from home admin are getting board and pointing out every little flaw and wanting solutions. 

How do I cope with this. How do I make it through a day without beating myself up if I leave without my entire to do list being checked off.

My stress levels have so high that I...

- Begin feeling sick and vomiting for no reason (work, while driving, watching Tv)

- I can’t sleep. Even when I am completely exhausted. I work shift work and even after a 12 hour night shift I can’t sleep. Everything just races through my mind.

- I can’t eat. Even if I’m actually so hungry that my stomach growls, nice meal sitting right in front of me..I have no appetite and it makes me feel sick when I force myself. 

-I have little to no interest in socializing. My family try’s talking to me and I just force myself to give basic responses. I don’t hang out with my friends because everyone seems so happy and I’m miserable. 

I feel like my dog is the only thing that makes me happy. Seeing my boyfriend helps me as well but  I don’t want to smother him and make him feel obligated to spend time with me. 

I’ve had a lot going on in my life and i feel like EVERYTHING awful is just piling up.  My boyfriend of 3 years just found out he has a 4 year old kid and the mom is now demanding money. We just got approved for a mortgage together and we no longer think we can afford it because of his obligations to pay $500 per month in child support. I work a very stressful job in emergency services and I can’t feel like this anymore. 

It’s not safe for me to feel like IM on the edge when I’m supposed to be helping THEM when they are on the edge. I saved a suicidal persons life the other night, and when it was over I locked myself in a room and just cried and vomited. I was physically shaking while helping him, I feel I shouldn’t be going to work but I need to support myself. I’m lucky to still have a job during a pandemic. 


Has anyone felt like this before? I don’t know if I have depression or just anxiety... either way my doctor doesn’t want to give me medication or treat someone so young for issues like this. I’ve tried using cannabis because it’s legal here in canada, but it doesn’t work 100% as I still have racing thoughts and it’s not like I can drive around high all day and go to work like that.

I'm approaching my late 30s and all I see is failure, disappointment, and wasted opportunity. I went to school, earned a degree, and then... I eventually found a steady job doing something I hated and wasn't suited for, but paid well. I had a troubled career, and due to mental illness, I had to take a lower paid, unskilled position with the stigma that goes along with it. 

I never figured out what I really wanted to do with my life, and I doubt I ever will. I'm continually drifting through life. 

Also, the past two birthdays have been the worst days of my life. Two years ago on my birthday I had to give away a cat I really bonded with because he didn't get along with our new baby. It was absolutely heartbreaking having to leave him with strangers. 

Last birthday, I had to leave my job and (eventually) go on disability because I essentially got screwed out of an opportunity and faced abuse from a new supervisor. My health had been deteriorating for years but this was the last straw. My birthday was the day this came to a head.

I'm entering my third year of university and I've been wanting to do therapy for a while now. Problem is that my parents don't think I need it because it's just something that can be fixed within a couple of days. Not sure if it's quarantine or something else, but I feel like my anxiety is getting much worse. Sometimes when I get a text, my heart rate goes up super fast and it scares me. It has happened here and there before quarantine, but I've always thought it was something I can fix on my own by changing my lifestyle and incorporating healthy routines. Even if I manage to stick to it for a couple of days, I always fall back and I feel like I'm hard on myself for it :/

Since I'm currently a student and will be paying for therapy on my own, I was wondering which online therapy platform is most popular and has a good reputation. I was looking into BetterHelp and even got a 7-day free trial, but seeing multiple posts that are floating from previous years about it being a scam, I'm iffy about signing up. I understand that in-person therapy would be more beneficial, but seeing that I commute to my university, I would prefer any over the phone services, since I wouldn't have time to commute back and forth (I don't have a car either).

I’m not an idiot (I hope), but my brain has never been able to grasp the idea that bad things happen and people just... don’t do anything about it. Baby birds are left to die, and no one steps up; dogs are euthanized, and no one takes them in; people are hurt, and others walk on by. I’m 18, I’ve got time, but I just don’t understand. I’m an adult. Why can’t I understand? 

There’s a dog that’ll be euthanized on Monday. So far, no shelters have taken her in. She’s two years old, perfectly healthy, very sweet, and up to date on all her shots... and they’re not even giving her a chance? I talked to my dad and he’s willing to meet her, maybe take her home until we can find a rescue that can take her, but what if he changes his mind? He told me that dogs die all the time. This happens all the time. He doesn’t understand why I’m so upset, just like how my mom and him didn’t understand why I stayed up so late and worked so hard to take care of a baby bird (abandoned, we tried to return them and it didn’t work) and bring them to a rescue.

53,"So this is a weird traumatic experience that I had a while back and I really want to get advice on what could’ve happened to me because I don’t understand it. Writing it in a sort of story format is the only way for me to express myself and remember what happened. (Also please tell me if this is the wrong sub, I don’t know where to post this)

So, I was listening to the remix of a song with my headphones on on repeat. After maybe 1 or 2 hours I felt my legs starting to tingle. Then the tingling sensation spread out all over my body. But it was not pleasant, it felt aggressive and it felt as if 2000 ants were running around inside me. 

All of a sudden I start panicking, because I couldn’t breathe and it felt like I was not in control of my physical body. I got up and walked into the hallway and it literally felt like the world was ending. I didn’t know why I was feeling like that, it was so random but I guess it was because I had never experienced tingling like that before and I could not control it. 

I finally make my way to the bed again after I had kinda calmed myself down but new symptoms had appeared. My right eye was acting up. I was losing some of the vision in my right eye and it was difficult to message my friend. During this, I felt my eyes starting to throb and ache, and I had never exprienced such a terrible pain in my eyes. I started panicking again because the pain just kept getting worse. 

Suddenly all of my anxiety went away and I was just sat staring at the wall. I felt nothing. Keep in mind that I’ve had Generalized Anxiety Disorder my whole life and anxiety is my main emotion. It does not make sense that my anxiety just disappeared like that and left me with no other emotions whatsoever. My vision was back to normal at this point but the pain was still there. 

After a minute or so of staring at the wall I try to think, but it is impossible. I started asking myself questions. Why am I in my pain? Where am I? Why can’t I feel anything? Why am I so confused? My mom came in and I got even more confused. What is my mom doing in my room? She tried to talk to me but I couldn’t process what she was saying. She gave me a painkiller and some water, but I didn’t know what to do with it. She told me to put the pill in my mouth and swallow it. My hands were shaking even though I wasn’t anxious. 

My mom told me to try to sleep the pain away, but it was impossible to sleep with this pain. She told me to make my bed and I tried to, but I didn’t know what I was supposed to do. How do I usually do it? I couldn’t remember. My cat jumped up on my bed at one point and I didn’t know what it was. What is this fluffy thing? It looks different than my mom but I can’t process what it is. 

I eventually fell asleep after 4 hours.
I woke up and the pain was gone and I could finally think and feel again. I was back to normal. 

Okay so that’s it. Does anyone know why I lost my ability to process things? I’m guessing it was because I couldn’t cope with the pain, but there must be a name for it. Or is it just regular memory loss? I wanna tell you that not long after this I went to an optometrist to check my vision, because I had experienced the vision loss at least twice. I told the optometrist about what happened and she told me I had experienced eye migraine. And my vision had gotten worse as well so that was great news...

A couple weeks after the appointment with the optometrist I went to what I’m gonna call an eye doctor since I don’t know what her job is called. She diagnosed me with Posterior Vitreous Detachment. I’ve been to doctors and a different eye doctor and they’ve told me that they don’t know why I’ve got this condition since it is very unusual for younger people to have it. 

My question is what I asked above, does anyone know why I lost my ability to process things for 4 hours? Was it regular memory loss or mild dissociation?",08Aug2020,1
54,"I (20F) have always had the suspicion that i’m a “high functioning” autistic, but have never had the diagnosis. i’m not asking for a diagnosis, i’m just wondering if i should be tested or if anyone has had a similar experience. 

as a kid:
- didn’t start talking or babbling until 2 and a half yrs old
- hated switching to different clothes for different seasons. for example, in the winter i insisted on wearing short sleeves bc i hated long sleeves and socks and long pants. not bc i didn’t like the clothes, i hated how they felt 
- didn’t really talk to other kids or participate in group games , isolated myself a lot 
- couldn’t relate to other kids my age, i wanted things done a certain way. i couldn’t fit in from a young age, like kindergarten. 
- in grades 3-6 i directed “plays” with my friends and bossed around my friends and needed it done my way. 
- i was extremely socially awkward into my preteen years. from child to preteen, i had a horrible time making and maintaining eye contact. i would look at the person, then away, then back repeatedly. not bc i felt anxious, i couldn’t physically control it. 
- i had a hard time conversing with adults, which i think can partly be bc my parents rarely exposed me to extended family, they live far. 
- even into preteens, i couldn’t relate to my peers at all, i felt like an alien. this was also related to all my peers being the typical “blonde mean girl”’stereotype. however, i started dance lessons in middle school and made and kept friends there very easily and pushed myself to be upbeat and friendly. 
- had obsessive interests in certain celebrities and the occult, researched everything about them. repeatedly 
- terrible fine motor skills (couldn’t use scissors)
- read novels from an early age and extremely gifted in language 

as a teen:
- was very bossy and controlling in my theatre program at my high school. came to the point where i’d yell at people and saw no wrong in my actions at the time, even though other people looked at me like i was crazy. thought i was getting my teachers approval, even tho she would show obvious disdain when we’d interact. 
- had a hard time jumping into conversations, often was silent when having lunch with others. 
- however i was told by friends that i’m “so different outside of theatre” and they “like this different “me”
- had no romantic interest, convinced i was asexual 
- my interests shifted from celebrities to teachers (so weird ik ik) i’d find them on social media and search the internet for info on them ritualistically and repeatedly. often calmed me down from anxiety i often experienced. 
- to calm myself down i’d also fold my baby hairs with my thumb and index finger at the back of my neck and my shoulder and rub to induce an itchy/painful feeling but it calmed me down. came to the point where i had severe neck pain and the locks of hair behind my hair were so short (due to the damage by touching) that it almost reached my ears while the rest was long. 

as an adult: 
- i cringe at how i was in high school. i’m so much better at keeping up with conversations, appearing confident , maintaining eye contact and relating to others and asking questions off the top of my head. 
- i’ve now been told that i’m “bubbly and outgoing”. i’m great to talk to at bars and i can keep convos going with quiet people. 
- i’m still told that i make overt facial expressions when i don’t mean to. sometimes people look at me a bit weirdly when i speak and i have no clue why , such as my boyfriends friends. 
- my coworkers don’t take me seriously, they see me as a joke and weak because i seriously lack in fine motor skills (i always have) and taking directions.

I recently saw maladaptive daydreaming in a post on pinterest, and was curious about what it is. I looked it up, and I think I have a basic idea of what it is, but I'm still unsure as I couldn't completely understand some of the terminology that was being used. What I got from it was maladaptive daydreaming is that it can can have vivid stories, characters, and plotlines, an episode of it can span from many minutes to hours, and that outside stimuli can trigger a daydream. These can interfere with a person's ability to carry on with their life. Often times, maladaptive daydreaming is a symptom of a different disorder.

We had the conversation in which i asked ""did you listen to my concerns"" to which they replied with a rant on how they did but with a bunch of excuses like ""my week has been horrible, why did you think this was good for ME to here"" like just asking a question and presenting it in a non-harmful way is toxic. I'm trying to keep my distance from them right now but i know this sadness and anger feeling is gonna swell up inside of me I already apologized for my ""behaviour"" last time i did this and i don't wanna do it again. What should i do? And is it possible to remove this friend from my life and keep the others in my friend group that we share?",08Aug2020,1

62,"I know this may sound weird, but bear with me.

I have a pretty bad problem where I can't leave well enough alone when it comes to my pimples. When I notice them, they occupy my thoughts and won't stop until I 1) quickly distract myself mentally and physically or 2) I pop it. This has led to a lot of ugly scarring that tends to stay red for a long time. In my recent (and first ever) dermatology appointment, the dermatologist said some were infected. Popping pimples leads to the problem getting way worse, but I can't help myself and it's causing me to hate my lack of self-control and dislike my face. I don't take selfies without filters/edits because I just don't want to look at my face. I even resorted to not looking in the mirror as often so I can't notice the pimples.

I'm aware that this needs to stop since it's having an effect on my mental and physical well-being. I just have no idea how to stop this behavior. If you know of anything I can do, please let me know!",08Aug2020,1
63,"Before I get started, I’d like to say that I suffer from anxiety and a few other disorders I’d not like to name. 


I’ve resisted the urge to tell my friends about how I feel on the topic of mental health. I know they’ll jump down my throat and yell at me through the screen. One of my friends suffers from a mental health issue which is why I refuse to tell them this.


Mental health issues such as depression and anxiety straight up annoy me. I want to try to help someone who is suffering but when they refuse to take my advice or continue on a path of self destruction it makes me feel some sort of rage. I shut down and boil in my own anger because I couldn’t help. For example, if someone is depressed and going through a “depressive episode” of sorts when they’re really down,  it frustrates me. Its pretty ironic how I suffer from a multitude of mental health issues but I look down angrily on those with issues just because I can’t help. Friends and family alike with mental health problems just make me angry when I can’t help or make a difference.


I’m very open to opinions on this subject.",08Aug2020,1

66,"I recently got an ADHD diagnosis which helped me understand some issues I was dealing with. But I feel like something else is wrong with me and its hard to talk to anyone about it without it defaulting to me being depressed. 

Seems like my whole life I couldnt feel share others feelings. I could understand why they felt a certain way and I would feel the same in their shoes but in the moment I feel nothing. Its like when people say they are “happy for you”, I would say that and not mean it because your success doesnt affect me. I dont know if thats normal but I felt like that my whole life. If my close friend family member died, It wouldnt make me sad but I know its sad. Growing up it wasnt a problem because I knew how to act and I acted well. Social situations were like exciting games (mostly with girls) to see what I can get out of them. But there never seemed to be any genuine emotions except for fun. Everything had a sort of end goal that I knew I could get. It sounds bad but it wasnt because it was synergistic in a way. Like I’d comfort someone who is sad so I’d gain them as a friend and we can have fun together. Its against my own personal values to take advantage of people in a way that would leave them worse off, I had to help them to in a way. In result, I was very charismatic growing up. 

But some things happened and I ended up in a long depression in which I lost my social skills and some key friendships. This led me to realize the lack in empathy and other problems I’ve been dealing with. And honestly right now it seems that its not that I lost my social skills it just takes alot out of me to act in a social way. For some reason I always feel mentally exhausted. I keep wondering whats wrong with me. I thought it could be autism or aspergers but I dont fit the criteria. I thought sociopathy/ASPD but I feel loneliness, sadness, and crave connection. Sometimes I even doubt I have ADHD. Maybe I am just looking at regular interactions in an extremely logical way?

I am not looking for a diagnosis or anything, just thoughts and opinions. Im just trying to find the missing piece of the puzzle.",08Aug2020,1

I'll never have that with him again and it hurts so much. I'm having horrible thoughts of hating him and wishing I never met him and I hate myself for it. I don't want to be angry at him and I don't want to blame him for this. He thinks so lowly of himself but I think he's so amazing. I still love him so much and I just don't get why any of this is happening. I don't get why this had to happen. We were happy just three weeks ago. What changed? Did I change? Why doesn't he love me anymore? Things I'm too scared to ask and that I probably already know the answer to. Did he ever have any feelings for me? I don't want to know. I'm sitting in his hoodie in the dark crying my eyes out. I want things to go back to how they were. This is so awful. I feel sick. I miss him more than anything and love him even more and I want him back in my life. It hurts. It hurts so bad. Did he decide that I'm not worth it to keep trying for? It hurts.,08Aug2020,1

The only reason I’m able to have the help with my mental health that I do is because my parents and my boyfriend’s parents take turns paying for my doctor’s appointments and therapy sessions. Everything is so expensive for me. I feel like such a burden. I wish I could go to the hospital and ask for help and have them direct me to help and medication and a psychiatrist the same way they have for my nz citizen friend for free. Who knows how much that would cost me since I’m not a citizen? I’m also worried that reaching out for mental health help could affect immigration’s decision to grant me a working visa.

70,"I ended a very longterm relationship because my ex is secretly a terrible person and I didn't see them for who they truly are until now. I gave them so many chances after messing their and my life up repeatedly on a colossal scale. Instead, they manipulated me, took advantage of my generosity and the unconditional love that I had for them so that I would stay and continue to provide them with a stable home/opportunities that they never deserved. 

I fought so hard for them despite others begging me to leave them and their toxicity, that they were dragging me down when I could do so much with my life. Now I have no career, no relationship, and no ambition. I thought I was going to live the rest of my life with this person and now that I've cut them off, I feel depleted and used.

71,"This is gonna take a long time, so let's get to it. 2 years ago I changed schools, I was halfway through what I think is middle school in the American system. I adapted pretty well to the my new surroundings and met a few great people. A few weeks went by and I started to fall really hard for this girl (I'll call her Amy) but being a pretty shy guy, I never said anything about it. We started getting along way more, we hung out, he stayed till 5am playing games and all that cool stuff and it got to the point where she would talk to me about her relationship with her now ex-boyfriend. This whole situation was making me feel trapped in my own prison and very worthless as a whole but, as I told you, I'm not really confident in myself and have a tendency to let everyone walk over me withough doing anything about it, so I just endured that situation for a full year. Fast forward to the last year of middle school, the same year my sister left for college. She has always been of invaluable value for me when it comes to venting and seeking help so her leaving was a way harder hit than I could've imagined. Anyways, this new school year, I started talking with this other girl who we'll be calling Andrea. Andrea was already in the school when I swapped to it, but we didn't really talk or anything, so we kinda knew each other to an extent, the thing is, I talked a lot with a friend during classes, so my teacher decided to change my seat a few places forward, which was right in front of Andrea. We started to talk way more and discovered we has a lot in common, and being the inexperienced relationship-wise 16 year old than I am, I immediately fell for her too. This lead to an inner conflict where I felt really confused about who I wanted more, but eventually set myself on Andrea and lost interest on Amy (as a potential girlfriend, not as a friend). Andrea and I were getting really close with each other and after a lot of hesitation I decided to tell her how I felt, and asked her to go out with me. Unfortunately, she wasn't interested in me the same way I was. We tried to keep in touch, but eventually stopped talking whatsoever. After a few days of feeling pretty bad about myself, I started getting better, because I finally understood that I shouldn't depend on other people to make me happy. This amazing streak went on for a few months, but just yesterday Amy, another friend of ours and I threw a ""party"" with just ourselves in a house. As the night went on we got increasingly tipsy and sleepy, so it do didn't take long until we were ready to go to sleep. Initially I was supposed to sleep on a sofa, our friend on another sofa and Amy on the floor (by her own decision mind you) but Amy told me she couldn't sleep without a pillow to hug, so I offered myself as an alternative. We were basically lying on the floor hugging and looking at each other, but I know that it was nothing more than a friendly hug to let her sleep better, however I can feel myself falling in love with her again because I know she has no plans to get in a relationship right now, so I'm scared of going through all the shit I've already dealt with and this time not being able to do it because I have have to focus ony grades for highschool.
tl dr: I'm falling in love with a girl that doesn't want a relationship.

I'm sorry for this being so long and the horrible way I explained myself, but it had to let everything out, and if you know the whole story, you might be able to help me more if you want. Thank you for reading and have a great day.",08Aug2020,1
72,"So, just a few days ago I found out my Dad was diagnosed with cancer and he's quite a stubborn guy and refused to checked out for months. Finally convinced him and its probably too late to do something as the cancer has already spread so much and its not looking good. 

Less than a month ago my grandfather passed away from covid as well, and my dog of 13 years passed away a month before that. 

I'm only like 18 years old so I'm also trying to take classes, manage internships, help my family and im dealing with all this hardship and I feel like I'm going to explode. 

Covid doesn't help either as classes are so poorly managed and I'm also trying to make a career and do internships and it's extremely stressful. All things considered, I feel like I'm dealing with it decently, but I just don't want to lose my dad. I feel like I didn't get to spend as much time with him as I wanted and I'm just sad he's most likely going to miss out and all the things I want him to be in my life.

He had a stroke five years ago and his life and health has been generally miserable. I mostly feel bad for him more than anything else. He just lost his dad less than a month ago and now his health is rapidly declining. 

I don't really know what the point of posting this was for exactly other than to vent. I have friends, but I just am unsure to open up about this stuff bc I don't want to burden anyone or act like I'm seeking attention. Anyway, congrats if you actually read all this lol.

73,"I (18f) have been struggling alot with my self esteem lately to the point where its almost making me suicidal.. tbh the only thing thats keeping me going are my parents.
I dont feel comfortable talking to anyone about this in real life so i guess i just want to rant and maybe ask for any advice.
So basically i view myself as disgusting and really ugly and a loser. I have my positive moments but they are getting more and more rare as time goes. I never really struggled with self esteem or thought of myself as ugly until like a year ago, and ever since then its only getting worse. I feel guilty asking for help because other people go through so much shit in life and compared to that, my issue seems dumb, like im just ugly? So many people are? But its a big issue for me because it’s affecting my confidence alot. 

The main issue is that i kind of have an asymmetric face (e.g some septum deviation etc) which people around me seem to not notice? But it looks so visible in pictures. I talk to my mum about this and she tells me that im blind because my face is normal (and shes very honest with me always ) she says that if that was the case, she would be more worried about it and would want to fix it but there is no issue. Like i know shes not lying because i know her very well, but at the same time, i cant believe her because what i see in the mirror and in pictures tells me other wise.. 

I know 100% that my face is fucked. I’ll admit im not in the best shape and im on a weight loss journey rn (im not obese just a bit overweight) and i know my appearance will improve after that but idc about that. I hate the way my face looks, thats something I can’t change. No one seems to be interested in me and im 90% sure its because of my face and not me being a bit overweight. 

The asymmetricness of my face is what bothers me the most and its making me really really depressed and suicidal.. im not motivated to do anything and i just feel so gross and weird. It feels unfair that most people don’t have to worry about that. I dont give a fuck if im pretty or ugly etc, I literally just want my face to not be asymmetric. It makes me so uncomfortable. Thats all i want, give me a big fat nose and a face full of acne but just make my features a bit more normal. 

I know no one is ever going to find me attractive lol but im ok with that its not my biggest concern. I just want to like what i see for my own self, i have other goals in life, but this issue makes me so depressed that i feel so unmotivated to do anything. 
I know i can get surgery for my nose issue, but thats just one thing, even my cupids bow is uneven and tbh everything on my face looks fucked to me, so whats the point of fixing that? 

I just want to hang out with my friends like i used to without worrying so much about my face and study hard like i used to and be excited about the future and post pictures like i used to but i cant.. i feel my mental health deteriorating and my self image being shattered into pieces.. I can’t put into words how gross how i feel about myself but tbh I really dont see this ever going away.

It really feels like im stuck with this.. unless miraculously my face changes, I highly doubt i will ever stop being so insecure.. idk what happened to me.

I doubt anyones going to read this and i know I probably come off as ungrateful and annoying but i just wanted to rant and i hope someone can advice me because I still have 1 cm of hope left but overall i have given up",08Aug2020,1

My own room looks scary in the dark. This is the second night I’ve had to sleep with my led lights on so that I could go to sleep. I’m so afraid of having nightmares. I can’t even vent to my friends because i don’t want to bum everyone out. They wouldn’t even know what to do. I have things to do today. Its 12 am and i don’t want to do anything anymore. I don’t know why I feel like this. It just happened out of nowhere. I feel no physical symptoms besides being out of touch with reality when I get out of my bed and do things.

I have been talking to myself and trying to calm down during my breakdowns, it is a hard process but I work through it and after some thinking, talking, and a lot of crying I can come out on top at the other end of it. I feel good that I have been strong enough to pull myself through, although I have no reason to believe it I have good hope that I can keep myself afloat.

I am without insurance and I struggle financially, but this job I'm working will give me benefits in only a few more months now. The plan is to stay strong, I just have to power through my struggles because I know I can finally beat it. Once I get the ability I will be seeking therapy and hopefully finally getting help from the hell I've been sitting in for so long now. I'm just glad I have the light at the end of the tunnel now, I hadn't had a full grasp of what was wrong with me for so long and now I feel like I have the knowledge to find myself through to the end.

I have no one to tell this to so I thought I'd post here, I am on the road to healing and I have never felt so hopeful.

80,"I've been contemplating whether to post this or not for a while because it seems completely minor, but I just decided to get on with it. 

I [22 F] have problems when things don't go according to plan. Even on small ones like, not getting out of the house by my scheduled time or someone not showing up on a meeting/ event. I get anxious, angry, then I feel super exhausted and just lay in bed, not getting anything done. 

This is usually a problem since my line of professions includes people fitting on a schedule given and most of them show up late or don't show up at all. 

My mind usually overthinks and goes suicidal, I have self harmed for 7 years, the usual cutting stopped 2 years ago, many thanks to the people who helped me, but I still tend to self harm when things go really really bad. It feels like I am on edge then I suddenly breakdown. 

Quarantine has taken a toll on me, i was supposed to graduate this year and take my licensure exam but all of it was delayed, i felt like my dreams were taken away from me. I was paralyzed for 2 months, barely getting out of bed,  and then, binge eating. I got really fat, felt ugly, and depressed. I had just only got back on my feet last June, and slowly starting to accept things. 

I feel like i'm doing really good and coping really well for the last 2 months, i started working out and self- studying. 

Anyway, last night, my bf [22 M] mentioned a job offer 5 hours away from me. We live separately but he works just an hour away and when he has free time, we spend most times on our apartment. 

Our plan was, he starts law school this year again, while I review for my exam, and after passing, i move in with him. He'd been adjusting to me since I was the one in uni so I'll be adjusting to him once I pass. 

The job he mentioned was well paying, it would solve the problems we have for bills and tuition fees. He said he could delay law school or just enroll units and study on the weekends. It will only be for 6 months or a year. Then we'd get back to our original plan. 

Thing is, my mental state is not really in a good condition and i feel like the pressure from review and the upcoming exam will make matters worse. I need him by my side when shit goes down and he can't be on my side if he is 5 hours away. 

So, yep, i shut down again last night, first i got angry, lashed out on him, took some sleeping pills and slept till noon today. I felt like a bomb was dropped all over me and he suddenly has plans without me. 

He only just realized what happened and he says he's sorry. Assured me that whatever I was thinking isn't true and he was just asking for my insight and opinion, and the plan he proposed is just in case he accepts the job. He's always been very loving and supportive, took me to therapy and took away my insecurities. 

I don't know what to do. I want to support him, I want to cope on my own, but just thinking about what will happen, and its not according to my plan, makes it literally difficult for me to breathe. I feel like i'm holding him back from such an opportunity, but he understands that my mental health is at stake here. 

I guess I'm just asking, what should I do? Do I allow him? Can i cope with this? Will i get over this? I'm considering breaking up with him because I'm taking so much from him . I don't know. I hate myself because i'm too needy and too dependent.",08Aug2020,1

Instead I’m supposed to distract myself when I’m anxious which is most of the time. I feel the majority of our sessions are me venting and her responding with generic responses.

84,"So my grandparent (my dad’s dad) died a week ago after 7 terrible months of being ill. I’ll give more context on it because I believe is important: 


My grandpa was put into a retirement home in November 2019 because he was getting too aggressive with my grandma due to Alzheimer’s. 3 days in the home, he stopped responding at all, he couldn’t speak, eat or walk (after all this time we still believe he was heavily drugged in the home with high dosis). We got him hospitalized and we discovered he had pneumonia. He was was piped so he could breathe, and they put him a food supplier through his stomach. He then was given home hospitalization at my grandmas’. He got worse, he could move at all, could speak a single word, could eat any solid food. My dad and my grandma were there all the time trying to make his life a little better and give comfort. They changed his diapers and moved him around the day and night so he wouldn’t get rushes in his skin of being laying down in a bed all day. 

Worst of all, my grandad was conscious all the time. Looking at the ceiling, feeling pain and without the ability to move or speak. 

Now to the problem: since my grandad died, every night my dad goes to sleep he wakes up suddenly and starts wondering around the house. He goes to bed normally (slowly, with all time in the world) but then he wakes up abruptly, jumps out of the bed and go downstairs. This may repeat several times in a night. 

A very important thing to note that might be relevant (this is something that I assume is connected?) is that my grandad died at night, perhaps sleeping, and that my dad relates the dark room and sleeping with his dad or own death? 

But this is the most important thing in what I need help the most. My dad is not a very communicative person, nor touchy, and does not like talking about his feeling. He usually gets angry.

Now that he needs to talk about this, he gets even more angry, even to the slightest advice that he should get help from professionals or take some calming pills to sleep. When my mom tells him to take some pills he gets strangely angry at the idea, mumbles that they will not work and will make him stay awake all night (it doesn’t make sense, I think it’s a deflection tactic) 


I don’t know how could I  convince him to seek professional help. Surely I can not make him go unwillingly.",08Aug2020,1
85,"As a preface, I’m not suicidal, though it’ll probably seem like it.

Like the title says, I simply don’t care about myself or anything relating to me.  It’s like I somehow turned off my emotions to most things years ago and have just been coasting since then. Something related to my job? Great, I’ll do what I need to do to make sure it’s working properly. Someone needs help with something? I’m there ready to help. Something having to do with myself? Nothing. I can’t sum up any kind of caring or urgency. No motivation to do anything, and not even caring about what happens. I’ve just been trying to get into a position where I can hold steady without support from anyone and...that’s it. No plans after that except trying to extract what temporary joy I can out of any particular moment. I’ll sometimes sleep just to make the day go by faster, only to stay up at night goofing around in a game or staring at a video. If I really start to think about why or what I’m doing, I get a crushing feeling of anxiety about all the things I haven’t done or the opportunities I’ve missed. About how (ignoring COVID) I could be in a full-time college right now. I also feel selfish for worrying about any of this when there are people around me with their own issues and when I’m taking up their time with my stuff. Despite that I have fantasies of someone realizing my “plight” and magically showing me a way to fix it. I even have a therapist at this point but whenever I’m talking with them I blank on anything I wanted to talk about and end up just wasting time until the session is over. I’ve considered looking into if I might need some kind of medication but feel like I’d just be running away from the issue or be less of a person for using something to feel better instead or just willing myself to feel better.

What if I'm embarrassing myself and don't even know it? What if whatever words im listening to is what im saying at the grocery store?"" Those thoughts creep into your mind until you forget about it.

I try to focus on myself on days im not with him but its just like before we got together I cant seem to do anything I used to love to do.. He says I depend on him to much and he doesnt like it. I felt particularly worse one day and just wanted to see him... I asked and he said that I already saw him yesterday and thats it too much. That really hurt me when I needed the support but he said no and made me feel worse..

92,"So I just started my first week doing online therapy with [betterhelp.com](https://betterhelp.com).  All of the plans include once a week video sessions with your therapist on top of unlimited messaging with your therapist. But I was matched to a therapist who is deaf so she is unable to do the video sessions. She sent me a thing that explains that she will respond once a day and that usually with all the messaging we will do it will end up being about equivalent to a video session in the amount we will cover. 

Overall I like the things she has said so far and she seems really smart. But I am not sure how I feel about not being able to do the video sessions. Especially if I am investing lots of money into this it seems kind of unfair to pay for video sessions+ written messages and only get to do written messages. And she says she can only message a-synchronously not at the same time. So it seems like it will be me messaging her a long message and then once a day she will respond with some comments and questions. It won't be as interactive.

I am debating whether to keep going with her and see how it goes or if I should just outright try to switch to someone else. On the positive side, I do seem to feel more comfortable discussing some things via writing vs face to face so it could have a positives. 

Any advice or input? Has anyone tried therapy through just written messages? Should I switch therapists?",08Aug2020,1

94,"Originally was going to post this in the bipolar subreddit but it’s against the rules. 

I’ve always had really bad depressive episodes like every year since seventh grade which has caused me to miss months of school every time. 

A few months ago I finally went to a psychiatrist who prescribed Zoloft. Fast forward some time later I started acting weird(looking back on it it was insane but at the time I didn’t really notice). I was extremely EXTREMELY hypersexual and really made some bad choices because of that and made a lot of new friends and started hanging out with them a lot(Im not exaggerating when I say I was almost never home and I’m an introvert so that was definitely out of the ordinary). I also did some things that I regret and lost a lot of friends because of it. One night I even swallowed basically a whole bottle of my Zoloft (I don’t even remember why or exactly how I felt I just felt so weird that I needed to do something and it felt like my whole body and mind was on fire and I just did things I’d never do without a second thought) and somehow I didn’t overdose or anything but the aftermath definitely wasn’t pleasant. 

(Btw I’m not on Zoloft or any antidepressant anymore).

95,I need some advice. I’ve been trying (really hard) to improve my mental health. I’m clean from self harm and I started therapy. The problem is that I am constantly having suicidal thoughts. I haven’t gotten the chance to tell my therapist about them because he hasn’t brought it up (We’ve only had 3 or 4 sessions though). I haven’t told my parents either. I think I might end up doing something and I’m scared. I honestly don’t even want therapy because it’s not helping me at all. It kinda sounds naive but I’d rather just get on some meds if it will make my thoughts stop. I don’t know how I would even get meds though. Should I just keep trying in therapy? Should I tell someone what I’m thinking? If so who? I’m still a bit uncomfortable talking to my therapist and my parents aren’t very emotionally understanding. I feel like I’ve done all I can alone and I need a bit of help. Any advice is appreciated &lt;3 ty :),08Aug2020,1
96,"Hey everyone, I’d just like an outsider’s opinion if that’s okay. My mental state appears to be going downnnn and down.

In most of 2019, I didn’t have many friends (I do now), I would often just be playing with my animals and then start to imagine hurting them. Sometimes I genuinely considered acting on those thoughts. Thankfully I did not.

For a few months it was okay but in recent months it’s come back with a vengeance. I am becoming increasingly paranoid. I am convinced that the government hacked into my social media in 2018 and are now watching me. I feel like there’s two people in my body and the other is making me do bad things. I hear voices from inside my head that tell me that I am the Antichrist and that, no matter how much I try to be a good person, the good things I do will end up with me being really evil down the line. I feel like I’m on a train full speed and I’m running out of track. Like I’m watching myself just fall and there nothing I can do about it, I just have to experience it. I’ve always been increasingly negligent in my personal duties, as shameful as it is to discuss I just can not gather the energy to shower sometimes for a week or two at a time. I am constantly zoned out from reality, my friends always ask “how are you so calm” but in reality I’m just not there, disconnected, in my own thoughts.

Back in April, the authorities in Singapore had sealed off the blocks of dormitories that house thousands of migrant workers in the country, maximum of which are from South Asian countries. This led to rapid rise of Covid-19 cases among migrants living in extremely congested dormitories with poor and inhabitable conditions, raising many questions from the human rights advocates. Almost four months later the dormitories are still locked down and under quarantine. The migrants who are Covid-free now are also locked down under similar conditions. Moreover, the uncertain employment conditions and extremely low wages are also the crisis situation for these workers. 

These conditions are posing a mental health crisis among workers, say human rights activists and mental health experts. Many videos have surfaced online on social media showing them walking on rooftops and window ledges, putting mental health of workers at question and concern.

101,"Hi...I'm really hoping to get lots of responses. I'm miserable and I need help. I can't see my therapist bc insurance doesn't cover it. (I'm 16F). If you can respond or know a better subreddit to post this in, or better places to get advice, let me know! And I decided to reach out to people I don't know just for a different perspective. I've talked fairly deeply about things with my close friends and best friend. And attempts with my parents too. My dad doesn't get it and my mom simply won't listen. She just has to say what she has to say, and is always super combative and always is pissy all the time. I know, there's a lot going on right now, and I give her all the love and credit for being the mom that she is, but man, she really just does not listen at ALL. 

Okay, here we go...and let's go surface level first. Let's make this pretty relatable and simple. (this is surface level problems for me, but other people could view this more/less seriously or just with the same amount of seriousness that I do.

Okay, after a certain point of dealing with depression and anxiety, when should I just ""Accept it"" and try to ""have fun"" at social events? I came home from a suprise event for a friend's birthday. I didn't want to go, (keep in mind, I started my own ""social distancing"" with the exception of work in November 2019. I couldn't take it anymore) but felt bad if I didn't, considering that friend was the reason I had my own surprise sweet 16. I owed it to her. But I wanted to go for more than that, she's my friend, and according to my mom, it would be ""selfish"" not to go. But hold up: being selfish means to keep something from someone for yourself. I HAVE NOTHING TO GIVE....NOTHING. I have no purpose, I have a name, I have a job. When people ask how I am, all I talk about is work and school, because I made that my life to distract me from my terrible mental health. 

So I came home, feeling worse than I did before I came. Which is expected. Every time I talk to someone, see someone, go to an event, I just feel worse. I feel like absolute CRAP. I just can't put on a facade anymore. I can't pretend like I have something to give. I don't. I am not funny. I am not a good storyteller. I am not an entertainer. I am not a joy to be around. I do not make people feel at ease. I am not a person people would or should look up to. These are facts. It may not ALL of been true last year. I mean, I was some of these things. I, at one point, made people feel at ease, was the go-to person to talk to, the funny person. Never was the best at it, but I could at least have the energy to pretend and fake it till' I make it.

Not anymore. At most, I am a person filling a seat. When someone tells a joke, I laugh with the group, make eye contact, point and wheeze, do the whole ""ooh I feel that"" or ""haha she said NOPE"" kinda thing. It's the only thing I can come up with to at least participate. 

So, I came home, and my mom read my face for a second and knew I was feeling crappy. She said snakily, ""WELL, I know you diDn'T eNjoY yoUr tIme, but I'm glad you came, YOU NEED TO GET OVER IT. You're fine. Nobody cares.""

But I'm not fine. I am not fine at all. You see, all she sees is a teenager who's just self conscious and needs to socialize again. That's all she sees. But it's really not. After just a two hour event, I came home exhausted and ready to CRY. HUH? Nothing happened, nobody said anything. At least to my face anyways. I'm not crying for no reason though, I'm sincerely overwhelmed with life and am so done with myself. DONE. OVER IT.

The whole night, I just admired everyone for their traits. These people are known by something. One is known for being straight up honest and its HILARIOUS. Another is known for being competitive, and it's FUNNY. Another is a great storyteller and is always so interesting. Another has her quirks and does the most normal things and people are ROLLING just because of who is doing it. That is their reputation, so whatever they do is expected of them, are therefore acceptable, even if its weird or out of the ordinary/normally considered awkward/harsh/rude/....it's fine, because its \_\_\_\_\_ doing it.

However, I promise you this, the ONLY rep I have is (especially among my coworkers) is:

""too nice for her own, goody two shoes, innocent.....nice........yeah""

(so whenever I attempt to try something else, it always seems a much bigger deal than it is. when I'm sassy, = aggressive. when I'm sarcastic, = cynical. when I'm trying to be funny...well...it's not funny because I'm saying it! when I'm anything besides ""too nice for her own good"" (if you can imagine someone like that, they seem straightforward, quiet, awkward, and they are simply that person that let people walk alllll over them like a dirty doormat!!!!!), they simple are responding with silence or just like ""oh okaaaay""

someone actually told me ""aye Katie I thought you were supposed to be the nice one"" when I said something to the SLIGHTEST degree of sass. IT WAS LUKEWARM and I was obviously joking. BUT NO. When I say it, its just weird because I'm supposed to be this quiet, nimble little thing with nothing to say. I mean, I don't feel like I'm interesting anyways, but I like to MATCH THE ENERGY of the people around me and ""Read the room"", but it never ever ever works. I hope I'm not the only one that get's frustrated about these little things.

I promise. That's it. Among my close friends, I always blank out. I LOVE LOVE LOVE philosophical/political talk but never ever can get my thoughts out there. I hate small talk. I know most people don't love it, but I hate it. HAAATE IT. GET ME OUTTA THERE!! Lemme leave the room please! Lol...I'm not kidding, but I never leave the room. I don't wanna be rude and want to give it a chance, and must realize that not all people like to go past small talk. 

Now, before I started struggling, I'm not saying I was fantastic at this in the first place. But it went from halfway decent or pretty good with the right people, to downright incompetent"", unfocused, unaware with everyone across the board. I barely switch up how I act around my coworkers to my peers. Which, btw, is crazy, because I am so impersonal with my coworkers generally. I am too tired/incapable of giving anything, and my attempt to try are embarrassing and make the situation awkward/worse.

I am hyper aware of my surroundings, and then I overthink which cancel eachother out, so I end up being socially awkward because I'm trying so hard to please everyone in the room. One-on-one has always been my preference generally, but especially now. I can focus on what they like, what they prefer, and try to be the person that they would want as a great friend. Does that make sense? So I'm trying to think about all of their preferences, and try to become ""that"" friend for them. Basically combining all of their favorite qualities in a person. Which, in a certain angle, can be extremely toxic and dangerous. That's why, in groups of people, I freak out, because I don't know which personality to choose, because now, I have multiple people to act for. For a while, I never thought this was a big deal, but as I'm writing this, I'm like....dang...people are so different and like different things. Obviously, I want to avoid the universally bad things, or socially unacceptable things. But it goes so much farther. people vibe with different people. I know I know, there are groups of people with very diverse personalities/views/experiences, but they work well together for one reason or another. I seriously, genuinely don't know who in the world I am. NO CLUE LMAO. I have no sense of self, despite being known for being overly self conscious. I worry too much, but it almost looks like I have no clue and I might look inconsiderate.

I just don't know what to do!!! I have 9 classes and a part time job just to distract myself/excuse me from social events. It's stressful in itself to keep up the workload, but at least I have crap to do during COVID....(I've been homeschooled my whole life except for 8th grade so online school is normal for me)

Sooo reading all of this makes me feel like a middle schooler, but I warned you, I'm not getting deep, at least right away. I left out so many details, but hopefully you can get the general idea. I'm getting tired. Night!",08Aug2020,1

103,"Hey, I’ve been wondering if my bouts of worry/stress are due to quarantine and social-isolation or something I should consider seeing someone for? Ever since like April I’ve started overthinking a good amount. For example, a couple of years ago I was an asshole. I would use slurs and other parts of “dark humor” because I thought it’d make me popular in school. Luckily I’ve since changed (or atleast I think I’ve changed). I just can’t not think about those years where I was like that and I’ve sort of rationalized it to I’m a piece of shit and even though I’ve changed, the stuff I said can’t really be forgiven. There are other times I overthink and worry about getting in trouble. For example, if I’m driving I always worry if I made a light or if I’m speeding and a camera caught me.

104,"Hi, I have a need for thoughts on this/need some supportive words kind of question.

Tldr: I am doing very straneous/hard work at my job and I'm wondering if this can cause depressive symtoms or a surge in seretonin, wondering also if anyone has experienced this and how to go around it.


I am a 28y old female and I have recently started working to become a plumber. At the moment I am in a program where I work for a plumber company for free, and I survive on money from social services. The goal here is to get an apprenticeship within the company. Been doing this for 2 months.

My problem is that when I am working in building sites especially, and I am doing consequently hard physical work everyday, I get physically exhausted of course, but I seem to get some sort of depressive symtoms after just a couple of days. Atm I work on a building site where I am putting up sprinklers, and I'm in general not very strong yet, so it is atm hard on my body. I know that over time I will get stronger and it will get easier. I already have a lot of issues with high tension in my neck and back, so this work atm is making the tension worse, before it hopefully gets better. The last 2 days I've had the worst headache ever, because of tension.
But I don't understand why I get such a low mood every day, I basically feel depressed and before I go to bed at night I can start crying for no reason, just from pure exhaustion.
A few weeks ago, I was on another building site doing similar work, and I had the same problem. I was there only for 3 weeks so I have no idea if this will wear off or not.

My situation in life is bad atm because I hardly have any money and I have barely enough money for food, the bills are stacking up, and in general life is taking a toll on me. But when I have been working in service and visiting customers etc, I have not had any feeling of depressive symtoms at all, and my life situation was the same then as now. It's hard work as well, but I don't feel completely exhausted in the same way after work. 
In general, I don't feel it's the plumbing work itself that causes the horrible feeling. Its sort of a dance between the exhaustion and the depressive feelings, that is making me question the whole thing. Like, will it pass?


Is it the physical stress on my body, like overtraining? Will it surge out the seretonin in my brain? Like, what's really happening? Does anyone know, or have you experienced this before? Would love some thoughts on it and maybe some tips on how to deal with it. I read somewhere that you can overtrain and it can make you get depressive symptoms, so I was thinking maybe it's the same thing?

105,"I'm making this post because im depressed/lonely/bored/cant sleep.
I quit a high stress job two months before the pandemic forced a lot of people out of work. 
I had wanted to leave for years before working up the courage to put my mental health first. 
I knew it was dumb, I knew we couldn't afford for me to stop, but it was either keep slaving away or off myself at that point.
I've been suicidal for as long as I can remember, but I stick around for the few people I still care for.
I starve daily and have nothing because of the choice to take time out for my mental state. 
I canceled all of my bills and parked my car.
My license is now expired as well as my tags. 
I rarely leave the house unless im walking to a store with some couch lint to pay for a can of vegetables.  
I gave up on my appearance, and my SO works all day to support us. We aren't even scraping by without having to cut every corner.
I feel guilt for the stress he's under, but now I cant find work, and I don't live in an area with many options. 
No one really calls or emails me about my applications. The ones that do want to hire me for different locations/positions than I had applied. 
Or im waiting in the limbo hell of background checks and runaround calls. 
I also can't stand the idea of work anymore. I've worked and lived on my own since the age of 15. 
I've never made a living wage in my life and I've scrounged since I was born.
I made the mistake of going to college to follow my dreams. Now Im slapped with 25k in student debt.
I had to leave because I didn't want to take out loans with private companies to stay.
If I make too much they take it right out of my check. 
Same goes for tax returns every year, but they take all of that. 
I was so overstressed at my last job that I broke emotionally. I already had clinical depression and anxiety issues from an abusive childhood.
My job was essentially taking as much verbal abuse as quickly as you could for 10 hours a day while being hounded about metrics.
It paid some bills, but I physically cannot answer my phone when it rings now.
I've also struggled with dissociation for as long as I can remember. This makes it feel like Im not really in my body, sort of like being stuck on autopilot.
It makes it hard to focus, be aware of my actions/surroundings/the things I say. 
It's your bodies way of 'shutting off' when something is too much for you to bare. This is great if you're about to be unavoidably mauled to death by an animal. 
Not so great if youre just trying to get through the day. No cure for this one, treatment is just management of contributing mental health factors. 
(Like the depression/anxiety)
In general I feel like an alien in my own body. Im anxious enough to burst into tears at any moment, but also just a blank slate. 
I isolated myself from friends and family because they really never could help me at all.
The state of my brain makes it impossible to remember simple things.
Its very difficult just to wake up every day, I am terribly upset and uninterested in living. 
The more people I have to talk to the less energy I have and I need it just to survive, so I cut them all off years ago.
I was on medication for a few months that seemed like it might be working.
I can't see my doctor for a refill because of Covid - not that I can afford them anyways. 
I dread going through all that nausea again just to not want to off myself when I wake up. 
Im just sort of existing now. Im tired of being massively under-compensated for my time by some corporation. 
All I want for myself now is a simple job close to home that isn't customer service based. 
I have to renew my tags/ID, get insurance again, jump my car's battery, and somehow find gas/uniform money for the first few weeks until I get paid. 
And that's assuming I can get hired anywhere. 
I need help, but I have no one to help me.
What do I do when it's just me, and my own brain sabotages my ability to even exist or have a conversation. 
How do I explain to an employer that I just stopped in the middle of a sentence because im generally anxious today and the light was just a little too bright and it made the world feel like a simulation and now Im not sure if any of this is real? Am I real? What where we talking about? 
I feel incredibly hopeless, but it's been this way forever.
Im doomed from the start and I just don't know what to do with myself at this point.

106,"I just wanted to share something really fast. 

I (31/F) was diagnosed with Bipolar Type 2 about 8 years ago. There was some discussion about whether or not some doctors thought it could be Type 1, but off and on they treated me for Type 2 and that’s a whole story in itself.

About 6 months ago, I finally go to a different facility and they tell me that I never should have been diagnosed Bipolar anything, and that I actually have PTSD. Very interesting...

I was laying here in bed just now thinking about it. I’m still kinda bitter, ya know? If I’m being totally transparent and honest, I’m just suddenly so mad that I went through all that time being told I was something I wasn’t but I start really trying to dissect why; what’s the part that really pisses me off...

Well, it dawns on me. For a minute I was mad that I had to walk around with that label for so long. But even then, that wasn’t quite it. I can promise you, especially after these last 8 years, I don’t hold any prejudice against people with mental illnesses, regardless of what type, so why did it make me so mad when I thought that was me?

It was the *freaking* stigma. It was opening up to new partners and watching them second guess every moment I was angry, and whether or not it was valid. It was people asking if I should consider going back on meds regardless of the horrible experiences I’d had with them (well no wonder why); it was people slinging my then-diagnosis at me like it was a dirty word... It was watching people study me harder if I mentioned it. 

So then I have this moment of reopening when I find out I need to be treated for PTSD. I didn’t tell anyone except the people who judged me for being bipolar. I know that’s petty, but it’s the truth.

I just want to say something to people who have their own, valid walk with any mental illness. 

You’re not lower than other people and you don’t deserve to have people study your every emotion. You’re not inherently dangerous and you don’t deserve to be treated like you are. Your feelings are valid and it sucks when people get even you guessing if maybe they’re right. Do your work and handle your health, but remember that you’re still a very important person who is just as worthy of respect and understanding as anyone else. 

Sorry for my rant!

TL;DR: was misdiagnosed as Bipolar Type 2 and found out I have PTSD instead, 8 years later. After being treated the way I was for having bipolar, I’m just saying I’m really sorry about the way people view mental health and I’m happy we can all help break the image. You are worthy.",08Aug2020,1

my mom was staying over for the night after i had been at her's for a month, i get home and immediately she starts telling me how messy my house is, it really wasn't that bad, sure there was a few bits of paper and cardboard, but nothing like a hoarder or neck-beards nest. the way she spoke and what she said ""i can't believe you live like this"" ""i thought you could take care of yourself!"" ""this is depressing"" ""i work my arse off all week, you do nothing at all and can't pick up your rubbish, all you do is sit in bed"" and saying she wanted to cry.   
this isn't the first time me and my mom argue over things, we've argued when i tried discussing suicide, wanting to travel on my own, independence, and other things. she knows i'm on the septrum and i've told her i've had mental health problems but none of that matters, what matters is that there's a few crumbs and bits of sawdust on the floor!.  
this whole thing made me go from happy to be around her to wanting her to get the fuck out of my flat and never come back, it also made me think more about suicide again, if i'm so much of a failure...if i'm so wrong.  
i've been silently crying but have no way to take out any of my emotions, i can't cry in front of her because she'll think i'm overreacting, when i think she is for getting so upset. i'm not as much a neat freak as her but i don't have the floor covered in clothes and soda bottles. the tension is so thick in this place you could cut it with a knife.  
i was going on the list to see the psychiatrist, but since lockdown all that stopped, along with everything else that gave me structure and some motivation, the only thing left is my pets. i want to see someone professional, and i wish my mom could see my side, she thinks i'm the one denying my problems...  
i have thought about calling samaratins before, but i'm scared too, i don't always know the words, and i don't like crying in front of strangers, all that month of possitivity has been shattered and i'm now worse off mentally from when before i left.",08Aug2020,1

110,"My father have sexually assaulted me and have committed inappropriate behaviours to me growing up. He has also done this to other female babysitters we had growing up and that has always caused a lot of issues.  My mother knows all about the assault i faced and choose to ignore and and even make a joke of it. She laughs it off like it's nothing and i don't have anyone to share this too. The thing is i cannot stand my father these days ,i remember bits and bits of what happened as a kid that i didn't realize. I REALLY hate him to the point where i could really kill him off if i could. My chest burns and my muscles tightened when i hear his footsteps or his voice. It has caused literal pain and I feel this unimaginable hate towards him and apparently i look crazy. I'm not surprised i also feel crazy. I feel like i would not be at ease until something really bad happened to my father. Today he touched me in a fight and i know just what his intention is although it may look innocent. I really need to open up to someone before i really lose it today. My mother also warned me saying whatever i remember are probably false and that if i do disclose this people will be making fun of me and not him tbh i feel scared to disclose this to people i know too.

111,"I am a high functioning professional working in academia. I have never had any physically intense experience (war, accident), but nevertheless I think I am have developed and experienced pro-longed PTSD-like effects for many years. I could never get a diagnosis from a health profession because, again, I am a high-functional person (working in a high pace environment) who is able to hide my mental health issue almost 100% of the time. I have gotten curious about my condition and wish to see if anyone shares similar concerns.

**The problem is essentially this: certain memory gets stuck in my head and I have a ""bad reaction"" whenever I am reminded of it.** These memories are not ""horrible"" by themselves, and I think it is largely my interpretation of them which causes me grief. 

**Here are some examples,**

1. During an academia talk, I gave an example of model for advertisement at NY times squares. I was severely challenged by an audience, who I want to earn the respect of, over the validity of my assumptions and realism associated with my model. This memory was stuck and I was triggered when I watched John Wick 3 at the exact moment NY times square was shown in the movie (I didn't know that movie's setting was in NY). It resulting in my almost want to shout obscenity at the top of my lung in a crowded theater. I had to physically close my mouth.
2. During another academic talk, I wanted to challenge the presenter about the lack of comparison of his work with another work. However, my question was not fully formulated in my head before I asked it. It resulted in a miscommunication between both sides and some awkwardness, e.g., a silence for about 5 seconds. I felt like I am being an asshole for pointing out a problem with his work. This piece of memory stuck with me and triggered when I wanted to ask a question.
3. During a meeting with a student union organizer I wanted to ask a person about why she did not announce certain things earlier. However, in my reconstruction of the situation, I quoted something from the ""Lord of the Rings"", which resulted, again in my mind, some serious awkwardness in the room. Now I religiously avoid watching LoTR: the Twin Towers and whenever I am reminded of what happened during that meeting (for example, by seeing or hearing someone with the characteristics of LoTR actors), I gets ""knocked out"", and start shouting obscenity. 

**Common reactions:**

I know that those scenarios sound extremely silly, but nonetheless it predictably triggers severe reaction from me, most common being shouting obscenity: F\*\*\*, Motherf\*\*\*\*, Bi\*\*\*, and most embarrassing to me, I will also shout the N\*\*\*\* word if the scenario involves a black person. It absolutely crushes me as I am one of the most avid anti-racist person who has spent years arguing against white supremacy and thinking about social justice issues across a very wide spectrum (black, Asian, and Indigenous issues). These days I will frequently shout STOP IT! several times when these thoughts occur. I have also managed to train myself to clench my fist instead of shouting for some memories.

**Over time I have found pattern to these memories and my reactions:**

These memories are formed in situations where: 

1. I want to earn the respect of some people and felt that my effort had backfired.
2. The most sure way to generate these memories is when I say things without making eye contact. This results in me misinterpreting the situation or imaging other people's reaction as negative. And these memories play over and over again and I cannot stop them. 
3. I have these reactions when I am alone or feel like these reactions can be disguised. For example, I am equally likely to shout obscenity in my own room as it is in a crowded mall, as the noise disguises what I say. These thoughts and reactions are triggered more when I am alone or feel that I won't be noticed, such as in a darkened movie theater. 

I believe my mental health problem was initially triggered by severe bullying during my adolescent years or some issues fitting in due to frequent family moving. I think I had the same reactions when I remembered instances when I was embarrassed by my classmates or did something embarrassing to cope with the bullying. These memories have been ""over-wrote"" by new, ""traumatic"" memory which I have now. 

I am curious if this is some sort of PTSD or panic attack. I read some articles online and they mostly say that these things only happen once or twice and they are very intense. For me, these things can happen ten or twenty times a day and I have managed to quickly brush some of them off. Does anyone have a clue what might be happening?",08Aug2020,1
112,"There is no doubt that the concept and practice of digital minimalism has gone from being the brain-child of yoga-practicing hipsters to a popular practice where one attempts to intentionally remove digital 'clutter' for a 'better' life.

The fact of the matter is, being completely oblivious about your interactions with your digital world have pretty nasty effects on you, your family, and those around you. There have been plenty of solid, peer-reviewed studies done showing some of the truly scary effects of a completely digital life (I've included some of these stats with links to the original articles at the end of my article if you wanna skip straight to them)

So about the article I've written, it gives more than a peek into the practice of digital minimalism, scientifically-backed dangers of digital mindlessness, the life-altering effects of digital mindfulness (minimalism), identify whether you could benefit from this approach and, finally, how to actually become more digitally minimal.

114,"This is my first post ever on reddit. I have followed this space for some time now and have learned a lot! So I wanted to reach out for genuine advice or support or suggestions. Also, I apologise for a long post. I will really appreciate it if you read the whole thing and any input you may have will be of great help.

I have been battling anxiety, OCD, PTSD and major depression for a long time. Currently I am in therapy and on a cocktail of medicines. 

In the last couple of months, my work productivity has reduced substantially. I am making silly errors, missing out on information, unable to ideate or be creative with problem solving. I am just somehow getting by and of course I hear a mouthful from my bosses, almost on a daily basis. Working with this organisation has been my dream and I finally got the job (not the job I wanted, even with 7 yrs of experience but I got the junior most position) . This is a place where some of the most brilliant brains are at work from around the world. 

I have been struggling with this thought for months now - is my productivity issue related to my illnesses or am I simply lazy and don't want to put effort beyond the minimum effort required?

Does mental illness cause some sort of brain/function damage? 

Have you ever felt something similar or know of people who have felt something like this? Are there ways or techniques to help with both - that is, if it's because of the illnesses and if it's because I am lazy?

Thanks in advance for taking out the time to help and share your thoughts :)",08Aug2020,1

121,"Me and my mom was walking my dog and we were on our way back home. When we turned left to our street I saw a guy in all black from far away walking. We were on the side/beside of a house since we just turned left (idk if u get it)  and next to it is our house. At first it was nothing, you know just a person walking whatever, but then he kind of jogged to the side of the sidewalk to the grass and I just thought that maybe he’s just scared of dogs. But I did find that weird because he was moving like he was distressed or something, but I didn’t think much since I was with my mom. I then walked faster to get to my house’s driveway (we faced our backyard and driveway) and since our car wasn’t there it was an empty space. My dog isn’t the friendliest and she likes to sniff strangers so me knowing that I shorten her leash in advance so that she wouldn’t get near the person. As we get closer I noticed the guy form a fist on his left hand and I saw him looking at my dog and as we got closer his fist rose as if reaching my dog, so I thought that he might be planning on punching my dog if we got closer. So I pulled my dog to get farther from the guy and I saw his face make a “aw men I didn’t get to do it” kind of face (I don’t know what to call that kind of face sorry). My dog was pulling and wanting to get closer to the guy since she likes to sniff strangers and so I was pulling back and me and my mom was even calling my dogs name. My dog never got close enough to reach the guy tho and I never let my dog get closer to strangers and she doesn’t also bark at strangers passing by us. Then, the guy said “get the fuck away from me” and called us “evil witches” and “bitches”. This didn’t really scare but mostly stressed me out a lot and worsen my anxiety. I know it’s not the scariest thing but it made me more paranoid and want to protect my family from everything. I just wanted to write this because it really gave me bad anxiety and stress. This really just proves how people can be so bad and cruel. I also want to say to be careful out there guys and always be on your guard especially when you’re alone and outside.",08Aug2020,1
122,"Hi, my mental health is at the worst point that it has ever been. I need help and I don't know what to do. I know the way that I can heal myself, is to distance myself from everything that is even a little bit of stressful, but I also need someone to talk to for a period of 1 or more months, at least once a week - a psychiatrist or something.

124,"So I work with a group of severely mentally I'll clients. They spend the day at the building with me and we do group sessions, they eat a meal, and do other games and activities that go along with our group sessions. This is my first job out of college and i replaced a woman who was there for many many years. The first 4 weeks went so great! I had absolutely no complaints, but then a new client was added which brought the total number up to 13. This new person immediately was so demanding to the others. She expects them to do everything for her without even saying please. I have not heard her say please once. She doesnt even give them a chance to reply before demanding more things out of them. If they dont do the task like she wants them to, she yells at them for it. She acts like she is running the place and is in control of them. For example, while another client was eating she yelled at him to stop eating and go get her a cup of water when she was right by the fountain herself. Another example is that she blew up and embarrassed another client because she didn't bring her the right type of water. So my question for advice is do I need to say something to her about respecting them? I know she probably has things going on that are hurting her because she is in the program, but I do think she still has to respect the others. So what would you all do?",08Aug2020,1

126,"I (23M) am having an issue with my boyfriend (22M) not understanding my health problems. I have been bipolar since childhood and have a couple of other related disabilities. I live off disability payments and study part time. My boyfriend is a recent immigrant from a country where mental health issues are kept secret from others.

We have been together almost 6 months and recently I have been slipping into depression for the first time in our relationship. I had some minor mood elevation earlier and he was OK with that but he does not understand this at all.

He keeps asking me if I'm OK or saying ""what's wrong?"" like my depression went away after 16 hours and now I'm sad about something else. He doesn't understand why I'm not eating and why I have no energy or motivation

The most troublesome part is his reaction to me wondering if I should defer this semester. He seems to think that I can just try a bit harder and then things will be OK. He told me that approaching situations like this with a negative attitude will cause them to go badly. He doesn't understand that my part time load is like someone without a disability working 1.5 full time jobs... and that is when I am doing well. He thinks I only have to do x and y in a day so it should be easy. He doesn't see how I can do something on Tuesday but am unable to on Wednesday, neither does he get that I have significant cognitive impairment at the moment and that means I would have to study twice as much for the same result.

I put up quite a polished façade when things are OK, but I made it very clear at the start of the relationship that I am severely disabled. It's almost like he doesn't want to believe it.

Does anyone have any advice? Please don't tell me to break up with him, I love him and he is the first person I have met that is OK with my disabilities in the context of a relationship at all, and I don't want to spend my whole life alone.",08Aug2020,1

137,"I feel like I accidentally made sex and violence a trigger for myself. Ever since I was younger, I’ve been aroused by some pretty messed up stuff, but it never really bothered me since I had the rest of my life. I wasn’t constantly thinking about things like that all the time. I spent most of my time obsessing over other things. One day recently, I decided to cut back on the amount of porn I watched because of an article about how too much porn can lower your libido and it seemed I could only get it up to the really messed up stuff. Which is unfortunate because I had other fantasies like one about falling in love. After I stopped watching the messed up porn, I think I was going through a withdrawal. I could still fantasize and obsess over the usual non-sexual stuff, but I was feeling... off. I called my therapist and told him about how messed up the porn I watched was, which made me think about it even more. He said it was perfectly normal to be aroused by those things. But talking about it only made me realize just how messed up I was. It made me reevaluate my interests and see how much of myself was defined by sex and/or violence. Even violent things that had nothing to do do with my fetish started to concern me. And sex in general made me uncomfortable. An old intrusive thought/ irrational fear washed over me: “what if I’m a serial killer?” At first I was awash with anxiety and began to dissociate, but now I’m almost numb to the feeling of anxiety. I started to have depersonalization and it feels like it’s getting worse. I don’t feel like ‘me’ anymore.

143,"Hi All, 

Somewhat long post. Basically wondering if anyone else has experienced this. 

If you’ve seen Memento (great movie), you’ll get it immediately. If not - I recommend Memento! - I’ve written stuff below.

Any thoughts would be appreciated! 

—

I have been living like this for a long time, as long as I can remember.

Basically it feels like I have to restart, every day. I do not feel continuity between days/weeks/years. I’m 34 at this point.

it’s very difficult to plan ahead - which also means that I don’t really have expectations (and so don’t really experience that much enjoyment either). 

I dont really seem to reflect on the past that much either.

I’m sort of in an in-the-moment, maybe fight or flight, as a constant state.

Part of this is that I don’t let my “true personality” come out (maybe I’m too scared). Maybe because I had to sort of fend for myself emotionally growing up (family issues). 

I have felt like I’m pragmatically managing my whole life, based on what’s in front of me, not really “going for” something.

It’s depressing to think about, but it has sort of been a constant state for me.

On the medical side, I see a therapist, for depression/anxiety, and I have been treating obstructive sleep apnea since October - I honestly think that only because I’m treating that, and get real sleep, can I examine these thoughts. 

I also was diagnosed with an auditory processing disorder a few years ago - pre CPAP - , but, that’s in a pretty gray area scientifically. 

I’m resolved to think about this as a problem to solve though, because, it’s pretty draining and I feel has prevented me from developing real relationships or fulfillment in my life.

Most critically, it does not seem to be the way that people I know live their life.

Sure maybe they have other issues, but I’m focused on this one, because despite whatever happens in life, the feeling constantly starting over (and to that end, having accomplished nothing) makes life draining and more about relief from tension than achievement and fulfillment.",08Aug2020,1

I have not finished my college I was bullied in my college (not just my fellow students but the professors as well) years that I don't want to associate myself to any schools because I am afraid that experience might happen again. I just wanted a restart but the idea of going back to school is uncomfortable to me. My confidence was drained in my college days. I was once a dreamer to be a successful person someday but it looks impossible for me now. I cannot share my experience to my parents because ofcourse they won't believe me. Well the day I said to them I want to quit school and have a break I was in tears begging for them to accept my decision. Though they accept what I asked I can see in their body language  that they are disappointed to me. I am aware that until this day that im writing this letter I am still a big burden in my family. I wanted a restart, or a job maybe, something that changes the environment around me. dying is also one of my options now. I just can’t describe exactly my situation rn but its like everything around me is too late - falling down. Thank you and sorry for interrupting your time.",08Aug2020,1
146,"Feeling a lack of purpose has been the biggest struggle for me and my mental health. It’s given a big blow to my self esteem. It makes me feel not worthy or good enough. 
I guess I thought I had a purpose. Always working toward that goal made me feel great about myself. In a way it made me feel more real? I was apart of the world? I felt like I belonged to something. But covid and my anxiety changed that. Now I don’t feel like I could actually accomplish my purpose bc I suck.
It’s really only myself stopping me bc I’ve been stuck in this cycle of no motivation &amp; not believing in myself for so long.

148,"My sister, A, has always seemed a bit mature for her age. When she was about 11/12, we found out she was having cybersex with a stranger (middle-age, M) she met from FB. This repeated again last year. A was only 13 when we discovered that she was manipulated and groomed by her gym instructor (M30+) into giving him a blowjob.

In both instances, my other sister (F17), J, was the one who found out about it through snooping through her messages (without A's consent) and I was the one who 'snitched' to mom about it. I don't regret snitching in these cases because A had no idea what kind of grave danger she was in. My mom was a progressive woman who understood A's actions and helped with her recovery. Unfortunately, she was also in complete denial of the fact that our family dynamics played a huge role in A's reckless behavior. So while she doesn't really demonize A for her actions, she still believes that A is to be held solely accountable for her flawed decisions (which IMO is just wrong).

I've always felt that A had a lot of issues with our family. My parents always compared my sisters to me, telling them 'why couldn't you be more like your sister' etc. Of the two, A, who was smart academically like I was, took these comparisons to heart. A's accomplishments were always dismissed in contrast to mine (my dad once joked that while I was artistic, A was autistic). I only noticed signs of A's pain when I became mentally ill and saw eerily familiar behavior. These signs were further confirmed when J found a diary containing entries detailing A's wish to die for she will never be enough anyway. Again, my mom's position on the family factor doesn't help at all. The constant dismissal of our parents, unreasonable pressure to be 'more talented', and numerous violations of her privacy, I feel, eventually led to A's reckless search for the acknowledgment and affection she could not find in our family. 

Jump back to now. J tells me that A personally confided to her that A was no longer a virgin. A didn't tell J who she lost her virginity to, but it seemed like it was a recent development (something that happened during quarantine). J had her suspicions that it was her and A's mutual friend (M18; groped J when she was sleeping; currently still flirting with A). J also told me that A verbatim said: ""It wasn't something that I wanted to happen."" 

Given that A trusted J to keep this secret, we agreed to keep this to ourselves and to wait for A to tell me. However, I can't help but have second thoughts. Although I know that it's great that A finally feels secure enough to share a secret with us, keeping mum about this only delays A from getting the support she needs (esp if she was raped + past trauma unearthed). As sisters, it goes without saying that we keep and cover for each other's secrets from our parents (for reasons mentioned above) but there are always few and rare exceptions. 

Should this be one of those exceptions?

TLDR: My youngest sister, who has mental health issues, trust issues, family issues, and a history of past sexual abuse, has confided to our other sister that she has lost her virginity, saying ""it wasn't something she wanted to happen."" Should I tell our mother that she may have been possibly manipulated and raped so that she can receive help immediately, even though we risk losing her trust in us in the process?",08Aug2020,1

150,"Whew this is tough for me to write. On Thursday, my younger sister, my puppy and I were going to go shopping for my college apartment. When we left our apartment, I checked to make sure the coast was clear and got into the third right lane. Suddenly a car from behind us hit us on the driver side where I was and we swerved into the middle lane. By the grace of God my sister and puppy were fine. As for me, I felt a blow on my head. Getting into a car accident has always been my biggest fear and I'm still shook it actually happened to me. The cop on the scene was super nice to me and made it clear he believed my account of the story and my sister keeps insisting I did nothing wrong. But I still can't help to feel it was my fault. I keep thinking about how I could've been dead or my sister or puppy could've been dead. I've been wanting to cry all day the past two days. I already did cry and my siblings and dog gave me confort. Despite all that, I still feel incredibly shitty. In addition, I keep thinking about it. I keep trying to relax and get it off my mind but every time I do I just have a random flashback of the moment I realized I got hit. I keep hearing my sister yelling and asking if I was okay. I also keep feeling the blow to my head. I'm ready to get my car fixed (it wasn't that bad) but really I don't know how I'm gonna drive again. I was thinking about it this morning and I started shaking thinking about getting on the road again. I haven't felt good the past two days and I won't get into details but my grandmother and dad didn't make it any better (but hey that's black families for you.) I just need all the support right now.

151,"First time posting so dont really know what to expect but here goes.
A good few years ago little naive me decided to help a friend out. She was struggling to make ends meet, single mum and needed to pay her sons nursery fees off. She asked me in desperation if I could be her guarantor. Yes, I'm stupid. Yes, I should've said no. Yes, I regret it. She topped the loan up and before I knew it she had asked for 6k with a ridiculous interest rate. Eventually after about a year we agreed that she wasnt paying it off but just paying the interest so it was decreasing very quickly. I was worried that I would have to step in and pay this loan off along with the ridiculous interest. So I posed the idea that I would get a loan out myself to pay it off, low interest rate and draw up a legal document with her to pay me back. It was literally half what she was paying a month so she was really excited. So all that was put in motion and she started to pay me etc.. after just over a year she finally crushed me and told me she could not pay it, I found out that she had around 19 grand worth of debt to 9 different creditors. I immediately issued a money claim, courts, CCJ, went all legal etc. She is currently on a debt relief order and I am also currently waiting for her old employer to go to court as they failed to reply to an attachment of earnings order (September). Few years later I am still paying it off..
I have tried to be fairly positive through all of this to push it a side and say 'shit happens' it was just my learning curve in life. But recently I have been struggling bad with my anxiety so I have been filling in a journal this has come up to be a thing in life that has annoyed me. I want to get over it or at least deal with it but I dont know how. I think it has effected my mental health more than i realise.

I’ve called in sick twice in a row because I was hungover. I asked the manager to schedule me for today but because he didn’t ask the last, more important thing I asked him to do over the phone I’m not going to bother going in. He asked me to go in for my usual 9-5 shift even tho the store doesn’t even open until 9:30. I doubt they’ll be missing my absence.
I’m a cashier. This is after I was basically forced to self isolate after a fucking COLD. And they reduced my hours over it, so I thought fuck it and got way too drunk twice. Fuck covid, fuck this whole year. Fuck everything. I don’t have anywhere to go if I get fired but thinking about this..

I haven’t gone into school more than 30% of the time and my parents kept asking me how I could expect to hold a job and I just thought I would kill myself before I was 18. All my past employers had scaled my hours back after I called in sick too many times and I ended up barely surviving multiple stints of being unemployed for months at a time. I moved out at 19 and I’m 23 now and have struggled to keep my hours at work for the last two years.
I’m royally fucked as it is over a cold and now with two days hungover to add to that, now I can’t even be assed to go in and beg for the hours.

I could end up homeless and I can’t even care.

153,"When I was 12, I befriended this older boy was around 18 at the time. And our friendship continued for two to three years. The older boy was popular in our local area, and he had a relatively large following on social media, too. He was acutely aware of his popularity among others and used it to his advantage. He retained this distinct aura that made others become infatuated with him. And I, too, idolised him. I would periodically frequent his house alongside others minors. The sexual abuse was apparent from the start; however, we never perceived it as abuse. It started off as subtle, flirtatious touching. But, eventually, he would coercive the others into sexual acts like fellatio and cunnilingus. And many — if not all — lost their virginity to him. It should also be noted that were a great many times when others would naively throw themselves at him due to stated reasons above. He would also expose us to more subtle forms of sexual abuse; for example, he repeatedly showed me videos of him masturbating and others masturbating — all of whom were underage. Additionally, he would emotionally abuse by disclosing his past and mental health. I recall several incidents in which he showed me pictures of him self-harming — or the aftermath. And because of this, we all felt emotionally obliged to continue our friendship. Around this time, I would drink excessively and partake in other self-destructive activities. I just wanted to fit in; I wanted nothing but for him to like me. Presently, I can’t recall many instances of direct sexual abuse towards me. But there was this one time when I very inebriated, staggering round the house. He took me into the bathroom and laid me atop him in the bathtub. And I vaguely recall him fondling me. However, because of my state, it is quite possible I am merely imagining things. All of this went on till his arrest. For years after, I never reflected on my past. In some sense, I suppressed my past; but it unconsciously channeled into all other aspects of my life. And only now am I looking back retrospective and considering the possible trauma it all caused? I have a very skewered perception of sex, which I think is due to being prematurely exposed to sexual behaviour/abuse. A power imbalance was normal to me. Coercing others into sexual acts was normal to me. I was a mess — and I still am. Over the past four years, I have been dealing with depression, anxiety and OCD. It first took the form of intrusive thoughts: abhorrent images of me hurting others inappropriately would randomly conjure up in my mind. At first, they caused intense hurt. Which was not merely due to the images per se, but because I had no understanding of where they came from, or how I could even think of things so heinous. Eventually, I could refrain my entertaining most of the intrusive thoughts. However, the ones which caused me the most distress, I could not refrain from entertaining. And, consequently, they would manifest into ‘false memories.’ And now, I can’t distinguish between reality and figments of my imagination. Everything is a blur; plus, I feel completely detached from my former self. I’m lost — so, so lost. Everything in my life seems to be inextricably linked to the older boy. I can’t have sexual relations with someone without fearing I have molested them. I can’t look at children without fearing I’m a paedophile. The voices in my head continuously tell me that I have molested loved ones in the past, like family members and friends. I have spoken to girls online, and now I fear that they were underage, and due to this, I am a predator — just like the older boy. The worst part is, I live in constant uncertainty; and uncertainty fuels OCD. I don’t want to be like this; I want to be happy and pursue my dreams. But I don’t deserve that; for I am a bad person. A bad person who may have done unforgivable and inexcusable things. I tried therapy and counselling for the past there years now, and I’ve also been and medication. This all temporarily subdues the hurt, but in the end, I am inundated with regret, shame and disgust. I desperately want to die so badly, but I’m scared. I long for this all to be over.

159,"TLDR: Fear of certain ""bad"" numbers and obsessive thoughts about them is affecting my daily life. 

I won't go into my entire mental health history, but I have struggled with various issues depending on the time period (depression, OCD, anxiety, addiction mostly) and was in therapy up until about 5-6 years ago, when I started self-medicating with substances. Took that about as far as I could take it, got clean last year and have been going strong for about 18 months now. Also have a history of trauma. 

I try to manage most of the mental health stuff that pops up myself, but one recurring issue has been difficult to deal with. I have developed a paranoid dislike of certain numbers: namely 3, 4, and 6. Seeing these numbers or seeing things in the aforementioned quantities causes me to get distracted and think it's a ""sign"" of something bad. I also have OCD with checking things and usually have to check them 2 or 5 times. If I mess this up, I have to do it again until I hit 7 times. Just weird ritualistic stuff like this all day. It takes up time I could spend doing other things and takes up a lot of my mental space. Mostly, it's just gotten tedious and painful but I can't seem to stop. 

Recently I bought my SO 2(two) of his favorite flowers to add to our garden. That same day, I was on the phone with a friend and she mentioned offhand that gifts of flowers in even numbers are supposed to signify grief and sorrow in certain cultures. I freaked out and took this as a big sign to get rid of them, but my boyfriend (who tries to be patient with the superstition stuff but doesn't really get it) doesn't want me to get rid of them and has talked me out of it every day now since this happened last week. Yesterday at work I couldn't even focus because I was obsessively thinking about the flowers. I lost my previous boyfriend to an overdose and already have anxiety issues surrounding death of loved ones, so the last thing I want to do is bring grief and sorrow to my current partner. 

I know this all sounds pretty wacky, but I have to add that I function pretty normally on the outside and in social settings. This is mostly going on in my head. Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Should I pay for therapy?",08Aug2020,1

162,"A little background,  his parents died when he was 6 and his aunt and uncle took him and his sisters in. He tella me that they were not necessarily abusive, but they didn't seem to care about what he wanted. The aunt and uncle never wanted to be parents but took them in becasue they felt morally obligated. According to him they had them do things only they wanted them to do and if they didn't like it there was never any room for discussion. They had rules that made no sense and they rarley ever purchased anything for them. It was very minimal basic needs like shelter and food and school. Now back to our relationship, we have been together for 3 years. The first year was great he was really sweet but also he smoked Marijuana everyday which I think contributed to his ability to be patient and kind. For the past 2 years, anytime I need to talk about feelings or if he did anything that made me feel bad, and I wanted an apology, he would say I didn't deserve one, or he would tell me that those are just feelings and feelings are not based in logic. He would use tactics to not take responsibility for what he said and direct some blame at me. He avoids any conversations that regard my feelings, especially if he feels criticized which is everytime i need to bring up something negative he's doing. We broke up and he claims its "" easier to just break up bcasue there won't be any expectations on him anymore"" I tried to explain that all good things take work and work on yourself.

Or in a haunted house, or a rollercoaster. I literally don’t feel it.

Or when you are around someone you like, or you hug them or touch their hand and you get that little tingly feeling everywhere. I still fall for people, but really not even that much anymore.

164,"I barely even have enough motivation to type this but for the last (almost) 2 years, I've been on a complete downward spiral. Everything has gone to shit, or maybe I'm just noticing it more. 

(Not just the world in general, but I guess my personal/family life too)

I have no motivation to do anything now; I can't even play video games or just watch a movie - even those that I should like. It feels like there's a constant weight, dragging me down that which I'm unable to escape from. I have no confidence, in myself mostly: my body image etc. 

I like the idea of friends but I can't stand being around them, partly because I worry I'll bring down the mood and that they don't even like me. I've just pushed most of them away.

I can't bring myself to do necessary schoolwork, I don't know what to even write in essays but I guess I manage to pull through. It's not like I have any other choice, and we're told to believe it's our only option into a better future. At home, I just write a couple sentences and I can't think of anything else.

It feels like I'm just drifting through life and my brain feels so foggy, like there's nothing there. I can't bring myself to think about anything. There's no creativity, nothing. It's just a scramble of incoherent thoughts. I'm just coping, just accepting all the punches. I still do basics, like I shower etc, so maybe I am just a lazy piece of shit.

I don't know if I've even had a breakdown before. Instead, it just feels like a constant drag, and it's been deteriorating for the last 2 years and has gotten progressively worse in the last year. 

I don't know what I want. I cling to the idea of a distant goal and just hope it'll make me happy.

Maybe it's just common for teens to feel like this, I'm not sure. Everyone else just seems so... happy. The rare time I actually talk to someone or a group - though a game and they're all laughing, I just sit at my chair and feel nothing. I can still laugh, but it feels like such an effort. It takes a lot to find myself laughing, unless there's alcohol. I don't know. I don't like doing anything but I despise myself for doing nothing at the same time.

I guess not only my mental health, but also my family life in general has been really shit for so many reasons that seem like some bad luck trope out of a fucking TV show: my house was destroyed by a flood, I lived in a small hotel room for months with a family that I don't get on with, we get stuck abroad on the one holiday I have because half of our possessions get stolen etc. and as things decide to get back to normal, we're hit by a global pandemic.

I feel so guilty for feeling this way because the world in general is so shit at the moment, so many people are in so much of a worse position than me and I hate talking about this. I don't like to tell anyone in my life. I feel like crying, I just don't know what to do. I feel so drained.

When I was younger I didn’t have many friends, althought I always felt lonely I was a shy adolescent and my family didn’t ket me go out much eigther (I spent my 17th bday on cottage with my grandma, crying secretly all night).
But then, I changed a lot on Uni and I found a LOT of friends which made me really happy. I found a bf when I was 26, but he is a very introverted person and also not very advanterous. I kinda hoped a whole time I wont need so much buzz around me when I am older... but it was nit happening and I got sick off constant begging him to go out, not to spend a week end at home when it is so nice outside, planning all the trips (once per year) all alone etc... I left him. I found another guy quite soon and at the beging he seemed to be different (at least he kept promising :D) I also moved to a different city bc of him which means I had to leave majiritx of my friends. I knew people also in this new city so I thought it will be fine. 
It is not. Whitin a year most of my friends here made a baby, which is if course cimprehensible. Then covid came and everything was ruined, I still keep working from home. My bf even he didn’t seemed so, is a real homeguy.

Sometimes I have this thought if someone really tries to end their life, they believe there isn't anything that could help their lives and thus decided to end their misery and pain created from living. If you're willing to commit suicide because of that why do you still feel the need to find a method that's painless? Do you *really* want to die if you're trying to find a way to painlessly die? Is there really a painless way of dying? 

If they choose to end their life, I feel it's wrong that they try to save them, maybe even after a few times of failing to commit suicide they still save them - I don't wish them to die but it seems as if it's forcing them to keep on living and feel happy, suicide is never a joke and I doubt it's that easy to get back on the right path after being saved.

175,"Hello, I don’t know if this is the right place to post but I’ll try... When I was younger I didn’t have many friends, althought I always felt lonely I was a shy adolescent and my family didn’t ket me go out much eigther (I spent my 17th bday on cottage with my grandma, crying secretly all night). But then, I changed a lot on Uni and I found a LOT of friends which made me really happy. I found a bf when I was 26, but he is a very introverted person and also not very advanterous. I kinda hoped a whole time I wont need so much buzz around me when I am older... but it was nit happening and I got sick off constant begging him to go out, not to spend a week end at home when it is so nice outside, planning all the trips (once per year) all alone etc... I left him. I found another guy quite soon and at the beging he seemed to be different (at least he kept promising :D) I also moved to a different city bc of him which means I had to leave majiritx of my friends. I knew people also in this new city so I thought it will be fine. It is not. Whitin a year most of my friends here made a baby, which is if course cimprehensible. Then covid came and everything was ruined, I still keep working from home. My bf even he didn’t seemed so, is a real homeguy. I don’t want to exagerate I know this is serious, but really feel kind of on the edge. I am home alone almost all the time and really thinking about brakeing up with my bf. He us kind and generous guy, but I don’t know if I can “survive”this boredom. This w-e my friends went camping and I couldnt go bc of my family (babysitting) and I almost cryied like a spoiled child when I found out.. I don’t want any of this happening but I have no idea what to do. And I also feel like I should be happy with what I have, but, I am not",08Aug2020,1

Couldn't get over her. Lost job and mental well being. Didn't tell anyone anything for a few months. 
That's just how I am. Had a major breakdown a few days ago. Somehow managed to contact her, cried sincerely.
All I ask of her is to explain a few things. Why did she do things the way she did. So that it becomes a bit easier for me. I don't understand what 'I drifted apart' means.
So I started writing emails, expressing my grief and asking for her reasoning.

It's been a couple days.
Now she's telling me that she's falling due to this retribution of mine in mail. She actually isn't. She is doing well with her new guy.

Am I passing a bit of my mental illness everytime I write to her??I don't wanna do that.. 
What else can I do about it? I can't connect emotionally with anyone else..",08Aug2020,1

**tw; suicide**

**today is the day I feel like I wanted to die the most. looking back, I figured how one small action could lead to the next and me wanting suicide as a resort. my narcissistic father said something that has pushed me over the edge, and it was like my trigger button. i cried, and cried. i wallowed in self pity. and then my mom heard and she confronted me. i tried to tell her my side calmly but it escalated quickly and ended up with her slapping me real hard. i felt like my face went numb. i love my mom so much and her doing that to me aggravated what i’m feeling. i may be a bad daughter, but i’m doing my best not to be one. honestly i think ive been over the edge lately because of this pandemic and now is my go button. i dont think i can face both of them tomorrow. i want to die a quick death. i want to kill myself. i’m sorry if it will appear as if im looking for therapists in you. i just wanted someone to understand. i don’t know why i want someone to understand, but maybe because i feel like i was misunderstood for a long time. fyi, this has been dragging on for a long time. my father’s and my personalities clash each time. he doesn’t want me to do a lot of things that legally i could do already like driving, drinking, etc. he doesn’t want me to take a course that he doesn’t want. basically, i feel like he’s controlling my life and i’m just so tired of it. he’s also verbally abusive. i don’t know how to get out. and if i do, how will i afford my college tuition? much more my living expenses? all i could think of for a way out is to just die and get it over with. however, i dont know how i could do it easily. i chicken out every single time i attempt on doing it. i hurt myself a lot of times but never actually done THAT. so perhaps i don’t want to die. perhaps i want to help myself. but i don’t know where to start honestly. i am so tired. :(**",08Aug2020,1

I was given a letter that stated if i wasn't in a course in the next 15 days my EHCP would be terminated, my dad though it was a good idea to yell at me to find a new course this backfired with me yelling at him back the real kick was how he stated ""IT was just for office work, its won't make you anything"" these words have stuck in my head causing me to not think properly and things that usally cheer me up have less effect.

182,"I used to live alone for the last one year, in an apartment. I am an introvert who gets drained out when I'm around a lot of people. I have become used to a certain quiet, peace and silence. 
Recently due to health complications and covid lockdown, I had to shift to my parents house after 5 long years (4 years of University and 1 year of job, all of which were in different states away from home). It's been just two days and I'm already feeling suffocated. My parents are loving and caring, and since I suffered from a serious health blow, they are pampering me a lot. Since I was away for 5 years, my room is not set up at all, and will take a couple more days for the same (bed and desk and chair). So right now I'm staying in the common shared space with my parents, and they are always, ALWAYS around me. I don't have any space. 
But that's okay, I know it's temporary and they love me. But the worst part is I'm getting drained out and cranky. My parents are ALWAYS talking...either on the phone or to each other or to me. And when they aren't talking, the television is on. My house isn't silent except for when they are sleeping late at night. It's making me crazy!!!! I just want to tell them to shut up because I need silence. I can't possibly do that, it will hurt their feelings. They are old people, who are just extremely excited that I am home and i understand their sentiments too. 
But it's really starting to hurt me. I can't concentrate. Most of the time I'm wearing my noise cancellation headphones and putting on loud music so I can tune out their voices. But that's giving me a headache. 
How can I survive this? 
I don't have the option to go to a different room or part of the house due to constraints. I can't go outside due to covid lockdown. And they NEVER STOP TALKING! And they are suffocating me. It's always noisy and I just need some silence 😭😭

186,"My 3 week old baby was up crying all of last night and the night before, so this morning I was absolutely exhausted. My mum said she'd come and take the baby for a few hours so I could get some sleep, so whilst I was waiting for her I made up his bottles and sterilised the breastfeeding equipment on the stove, then went to bed when she left. 

My fiance and I woke up a few hours later to a really strange smell. Turns out I had left the stove on, melted all of the equipment to liquid and the house was filled with smoke. My fiance really panicked because apparently plastic is toxic when melted. 

Thank god the baby wasn't home, all I can think about is how it could have started a fire and killed my family. I feel absolutely awful and keep crying. I was just so exhausted I completely forgot the stove was on and I even left all the bottles on the side so they aren't safe for him to drink now. 
We left all of the windows open and went to my mum's house for a few hours to let our house air out, so hopefully it's safe now. But things could have gone so differently and it would have been all my fault. The thought of something happening to my baby makes me feel sick.",08Aug2020,1

190,"I work as a project manager in a notoriously high stress industry. I started out at this company 1.5 years ago in a lower position, and worked my way up to project manager at the beginning of this year. Things were going great; made more money, new title, great experience, and feeling like I was moving up.

My issues started with our weekly meetings with upper management. I already have a deep fear of public speaking to begin with, which makes these meetings very difficult for me. I get so nervous that the night before I won’t hardly sleep, my stomach gets upset, and have an intense feeling of dread and anxiety. As my turn to speak gets closer, the symptoms intensify; my heart races, my palms sweat, I start thinking I need to run out the room, etc.

If these were nice, non-confrontational meetings, maybe I could survive it. Instead, they are just brutal. They attack me for everything I’m doing, question my every move, and if it’s a really bad one, they’ll yell and scream. Because I get so nervous, I have a very hard time defending myself or my ideas. No matter what kind of preparation I do, the only thing I seem to be able to do is sit there and take it, or just babble aimlessly. 

It’s been taking a toll on me. It used to be that these meetings would only really put me out for a day. For the rest of the day, I would just be in this weird mental state, where I couldn’t think straight, couldn’t get anything done, along with intense feelings of sadness, frustration, and self loathing for not doing well in the meeting.

The last few weeks, it’s gotten to the point where I’m in a worse state than usual, and it’s all the time now. I started having moments where I was unsure if I what I was doing was real. I’d come home and talk to my girlfriend, and wonder if I was actually having a conversation with her. I started sleeping more than usual. On weekends, it seems all I can do is lounge the entire time. In conversations with friends and family, I often feel blank and can’t have a full back and forth conversation. 

At this point, I don’t feel that I have completely lost control, but I’m afraid of what’s going to happen if nothing changes. I was close to finding a new job, but my boss seemed to figure out that I’ve been unhappy/off lately and sat down with me to talk about it. It was a good talk, and he ended up bumping my salary up $10K. I’m very thankful for this, but now I feel even more pressure to just stick this out. I don’t know what to do, maybe I still try to find a new job, maybe I need to do therapy, maybe I should quit and just rest for a few months while I find a new job. Let me know what you think i should do.",08Aug2020,1
191,"Hey, I'm 22 and I am diagnosed with ptsd, bpd as well as multiple anxiety and depressive disorders. I've been in and out of mental health services since I was 12. I've had at least 5 suicide attempts tried lots of medication and if I'm not coping I will reach out. I was sexually abused when I was younger, between the ages of 6 and 8 roughly. My father is a drug addict and mostly absent and I'm starting to realise that my mother was physically abusive towards me and would manipulate and control me and still tries to now. Their relationship was violent and I witnessed a lot of that.

As a teen/adult I have struggled with no motivation and just a complete sense of apathy, I have bouts of mania, I never made plans for the future and couldn't leave my house alone. I wouldn't wash, I would drink, I'd over eat, I was not functioning. Through hard work, medication and intervention I've managed to get myself to a place where I'm a (mostly) normal person. I can keep myself and my house clean, I go shopping alone, I got my drivers license and I've even held a part time job for a couple years now! I've got a pretty good grasp on the anxiety and the depression but I feel like there's more to it but I want to know what other people think because I'm really lost and things are happening that are scaring me.

So I don't remember any of the sexual abuse that's happened to me, I remember the before and sometimes the after but I don't remember the actual acts of abuse. I don't remember HUGE chunks of my childhood, in fact probably most of it, I don't remember big events like my sister being born, birthdays or my dog dying ect. I just thought I was forgetful, it's worked in my favour not remembering the abuse so suppose you win some you lose some. But its not just my childhood where there's chunks missing, I have patches all throughout my life where I don't remember it, I don't remember my grandads funeral but I remember the wake, I don't remember most of highschool, I don't remember what I did for most of yesterday.

Over the past year or two I've been suffering so much worse with what I assume is dissociation, I haven't seen anybody about it but its probably the best way to describe how I'm feeling. It's like I'm the passenger in my own body and I'm just watching myself go about my day to day life. I lose hours where time just goes super quick and I zone out and whole hours have gone by and I've not noticed, I've just been staring at a wall. I have times where I feel like a robot and nothing feels right and its all a bit wavy and my head becomes all whispery and I can't tell which thoughts are my own and it's like I'm trying to pick out my own voice in a crowd. I really struggle to string a sentence together most of the time, my friends joke and like to say that I need to load and that I'm just running on Internet explorer but it's because I lose what I'm saying all the time or have to put a lot of effort in at times for my thoughts not to get lost. I have times where I feel like I'm in a bubble that needs to pop or like I'm underwater. I have times where I will be doing something and then just suddenly come round and I'm somewhere else doing something random. It's happened a few times where I've driven out to the house where the abuse happened, in the middle of the night and I have no recollection of how I got there. I started smoking again without realising, just felt horribly irritable for a few days without realising what was wrong and then found a pouch of tobacco in my bag. 

I was wondering what people think it could be, I've been dealing with this by myself for a while and nobodys noticed anything, I'm still functioning but I'm terrified, I'm so embarrassed and I've been working so so hard to be functional and I feel like I've just gotten to a place where I can finally enjoy my life, I don't want to speak up and end up getting sectioned, I don't want to tell my friends or my boyfriend bc it just sounds so wrong. Driving out to my abusers old house is a new thing and so is the smoking, it's scared me. I feel like depression and anxiety and ptsd and mood swings are something people can understand but this feels so alien and I'm getting to the point where I'm ready to reach out and get some help for it, I know you guys aren't medical professionals but I wanted some opinions and encouragement and maybe somebodys who's been through something similar who can tell me what to expect x",08Aug2020,1

Right now it is returning to the point where my cognition and body don‘t function. When I lay in bed to sleep my mind doesn‘t find anything to think about, I can‘t be creative at all, I can‘t think, also in social situations and conversations I‘m not finding anything to talk about.

Then there is the physiological part that every little move even moving my hand and the smallest tasks, showering, brushing teeth, making food, waking up are just a huge torture. I don‘t have any drive at the moment, nothing interests or stimulates me. Nothing makes me smile, laugh or happy.

I don‘t know what to do. I‘m on 600mg moclobemide right now and hoping for the best improvement but now nothing changed except that I‘m more emotionally numb. I tried all SS(N)RIs, that‘s why now we started my first MAOI. I also had 3 depth psychological therapies and they didn‘t do anything or even worsened my symptoms. Next month I‘m going to start a behavioral therapy.

What can I do? I abused alcohol, nicotine, kratom and phenibut for getting off this depression, anxiety and this „boredness“ and negative thoughts in life. But I want to stay off substances except for maybe one prescribed pharmaceutical including therapy.

I don't know if anyone will read this but I just need to vent.

So I have been going through a lot since a year and this ended up in me getting severely depressed and suicidal to the point where I stayed at the hospital for 10 days. I started taking medication there. It's planned that I go to another mental institution (kinda like rehab for depressed people) for three weeks starting from tuesday and there will be no wifi there.

Mind you, part of the fact i'm depressed is that I was supposed to go to Australia for an internship and it was canceled because of covid and in place of it, our teachers gave us some paper to write. The paper is due on August 20th.

I'm usually top of my class and it's really easy for me to write papers but this time, I wrote just two paragraphs and my sentences didn't make sense and I started having a huge headache. And I have to finish writing these 25 pages by tuesday.

Is that common for antidepressants to make you think less good?

Anyway, now I'm thinking about not writing the paper at all and explaining the situation to my teachers but i'm not sure they'll understand. And if they don't, it might set me a year back just because of this...

They thought I was a good kid but I was secretly taking my grandma Oxycodone and cash little by little.I totaled my truck graduation night  from taking too many Xanax. So they basically found out what Iv actually been doing to them and kicked me out ( rightfully so). 

I moved to my aunts house in 2011 after all that in a different state. I joined the army in 2012 and got out in 2015. Moved back to my aunts house and still have been here working shit jobs ( currently a manager at chick fil a) since.  Iv feel Iv been mentally Broken beyond repair. 

I have 0 energy to do anything. For some reason I’m starting to cry typing this sentence right now. Iv never been this person to cry all of a sudden. Iv always felt Iv been mentally strong and tough and the thought process of “it is what it is.” This line of thinking worked until it didn’t. I think it stopped working a year ago.

Recently I’m been struggling to breathe or feel like I’m hungry for air. My mind is racing constantly. I can’t stay on track to do fucking anything. I don’t want to “go out” anymore. I don’t want to play video games after I just built myself a $1500 PC to play on. 

I don’t like listening to music anymore ( I can’t believe this) I don’t like doing anything anymore. I just want to go to my bed right now and no leave for work in 30min. My job makes me want to cry with rage because I’m such a fuck up that I’m back at the same job ( different location) that I was working in high school. It’s like my life cane full circle already and I’m not even 30.

I’m always so tired like I’m fed up with life or something. My friends were left behind in my home state. Luckily I have 1 of them that I’ve known since I was little. Everything sounds boring to me. “Hey Tyler you want to ride jet ski’s?” *Me “no that’s boring.” ( just an example) 

I’m currently supposed to hit “apply student aid” before this Tuesday to go to school for Programming that Iv been trying to do for 2 in a half years. Now I don’t even want it anymore because I have no energy to drive 35 min to school 4 times a week then go to work full time. 

I’m not sure what to do. I have no insurance. My jobs insurance is fucked and not enrolling people until October. I’m had thoughts of not necessarily Suicide but just feeling like I don’t want to do this shit anymore. I’m tired of working these shit jobs. I’m tired of not having my own apartment. I’m tired feeling like I’m hungry for air.

I have this problem where I can't do anything simply for enjoyment. Every hobby I attempt to have ends up burning me out because I can't just let it be a hobby and be a leisure activity. I used to read all the time when I was younger, but now I feel like I only read so I can record the books on Goodreads and make my reading goal for the year. I stopped using Goodreads and I stopped reading because I felt like I wasn't accomplishing anything.

I don't really enjoy playing video games, as inevitably it becomes about collecting every achievement so they'll show up on my Steam or PSN profile. If I watch a movie I feel like I have to record it on Letterboxd and write a review, or those hours I spent will be wasted because I have nothing to show for the time I spent watching it. 

I love music, always have. I love listening to music. But recently I have felt like I need to do something to tell others about the music I love, or what music I'm listening to, or otherwise just sitting here listening to music will be a waste of time.

Why do I feel this way? I don't want to feel this way, I want to be able to enjoy things without the ever-present need to validate the time I spent doing said things. 

I'm sorry if this is a dumb question, or if it's ignorant, but honestly I'm just exhausted emotionally because this inevitably ends with me getting burned out. Thanks for taking time to read my ramblings, and of course if anyone has any insight or advice I will greatly appreciate it.",08Aug2020,1
202,"TW: s*xual abuse 

I will start this out by saying that I have an appointment booked for a psychiatric evaluation and hopefully extensive therapy. But that’s not until October so I’m posting here. I’m also on mobile so excuse any cruddy formatting. 


I think I’m having flashbacks. I recently became aware that I had been suppressing memories, and many events from my teens came flooding back. I don’t know if they are what’s causing this because they seem easy enough to handle. I had a lose grasp of what happened to me already, it has been details and gaps coming back in bursts. I can now recall various assaults and grooming I was put through and while that obviously bothers me and causes stress and pain, it’s the newer version of the flashes that worry me. The ones I can’t work through because I can’t grasp what is happening. 


I have absolutely no idea why this is happening. Everything else has been linked to at least a fragment of a memory, but this is coming out of nowhere. Yesterday at night I touched myself and it felt like I was knocked out of my body into a bright room with a stranger (I don’t know, everything was very abstract and much too bright) and when I regained control I was immediately crying and launched into a panic attack. I have issues with disassociating and feeling like I’m not present in my body and these flashes crank those issues up to the max.  


I don’t know why I’m typing this out, or if I have an actual concrete question to ask but I feel so lost and overwhelmed. I’m questioning everything, I’m suspicious of everyone and I feel like there is something wrong with me. I can’t remember what it is I’m remembering so it feels fake and I undermine myself, but when the terror sets in I know something isn’t right. There has been so many red flags in my childhood that I’m baffled no one realized what happened to me, that *I* didn’t realize. 


This feels pointless and I guess it might be. But I just wanted to get it out right now because it’s eating away at me. 

Thanks for reading!",08Aug2020,1

204,"I’ve been on meds for roughly a year now I think, and have recently stopped taking them. I didn’t mean to, it’s just that my sleep schedule got fucked up, so my routine got fucked up, and I missed a few days. I was on a pretty small dosage of Zoloft anyways so I didn’t have to deal with bad withdrawals or anything like that, and I was instructed to just take my propranolol as needed so I usually only took it before social functions which I already don’t go to tons. They both made me tired and drowsy most days, not to mention a bit apathetic at times. When I stopped taking them my lows got even lower than before, and I’m left feeling like I’ve just backtracked. I’ve gotten my emotions a bit more in check now and haven’t taken my meds in almost a month.

The problem is, I’m supposed to call to make an appointment with my psychiatrist today for a refill, but I really don’t want to and idk how to tell my mom that I just don’t want to be on meds anymore and that I haven’t been taking them. Not to mention I’ve hit a wall in therapy, and I haven’t been able to make much progress in a while, mostly due to the fact that I’m not really ready to open up and get help for a lot of things yet.

TLDR: I haven’t been taking my meds and I really don’t want them anymore but I’m supposed to call my psychiatrist for an appointment to get a refill today. How do I tell my mom I really don’t want to take them anymore?",08Aug2020,1

211,"Good afternoon everyone. First off, thank you very much for taking the time to look at my post. I really appreciate your time, effort, and comments. The fact that you would give all that to a random stranger like me means so very much.

Now, onto what's been going on. I've posted this elsewhere, I'm looking for a bit of a support net as I prepare to open a new chapter in my life. To be perfectly honest, I'm scared. I'm dealing with things I've never dealt with before (either because I have not experienced them before or because I've bottled it up). Not healthy, I know. 

Phew... This is going to be a long one. Throwaway account for reasons. 

I believe I have struggled with anxiety and depression for a good, long time. It has been undiagnosed for years as I was never able to seek help. It's finally gotten to the point where it is overwhelming. It is affecting work, home, just consuming my life. 

So for the first time in my life, I booked a consult with a therapist. I'm cautiously optimistic. I understand that there's no magic switch, no magic technique, and no simple solution. I know that a therapist can't fix me. I understand that they're there to guide me in the right direction. I've been keeping a small notebook on me and recording stuff that I feel that confuses me or overwhelms me. 

I guess the reason I'm posting right now is to get some advice from people who have gone through something similar. I'll probably dump a lot of stuff out here. So... Here goes. 

I recently went through a breakup. I think that the relationship in a lot of ways was just a bandaid for what's going on in my life. I understand that I can live without that person and I understand that I can move on. I'm not saying that ""I can't live without them, my life is over without them."" 
It was a long distance relationship and we had both been back and forth multiple times to visit each other. Recently I spent a decent amount of time with them. I got to spend time with them, their friends, and their family. It was great. I felt surrounded by supportive people. 

Unfortunately the purpose of this visit was more of a ""If neither of us can move to each other now, it's best to end it."" So... It's over. And now I'm second guessing myself. Maybe I should have moved to them. I would have had friends and a bigger family (I am an only child, no living grandparents. Just me, my mom, and my dad). And now it's too late. And that's on me. And now I'm afraid that I don't have friends and a family and any type of support system for myself.
I've found myself crying in my office with my door closed. And that makes me feel so sad and pathetic. 

I don't have any friends that I hang out with. And that's bugging me. How will I have new experiences in life? How will I meet new people? My ex has friends that they're hanging out with and that are helping them get through this. And I sit alone in my apartment after work. How do I break that cycle? How do I break that especially during this pandemic? 

I've never loved a friend. I've never been able to say to a friend that I love them. And that's bugging me. I want to have people in my life that I can share platonic love with. That's something I have not experienced. Ever. And it's on me. In my younger years, I would have been bitter and thought to myself ""What do I need to do to get love? Why won't someone love me?"" But now I understand. I need to love myself. I need to be able to work out the things in myself before I can expect to allow someone else in to love me. And I'm not strictly speaking about a relationship. As I mentioned above, I want to love people. To have friends who I would do anything for. Friends. I want people who would do the same for me, yet I cannot say that I have ever had a friend I would do the same for. How can I expect that same thing back if I have not given it? I hope that's a good way to think about this. 

I spoke to a not-so-close friend about these things that I've been experiencing. It was very good and they listened well, even as I cried and made almost no sense. I greatly appreciate what they did. They were a little glimmer of light in a very dark moment. 
However, they told me something that has been echoing around my mind since I heard it. I'm not exaggerating when I say this, but they said something to the effect of ""You come across as an asshole with people meet you"" and ""None of my other friends like you because if that"". That hurt. But I believe they said it from a place of caring. From a place of ""Hey, I think this is what's going on and why."" I've also been told I'm too judgemental. I don't see it, and that concerns me. How do I fix that? It's clearly something the others notice. And it's my own issue. 

I've also been struggling with what I believe is derealization. Again, undiagnosed (and I will bring it up with my therapist), but from what I can tell, that's what it is. I feel like my life just goes on around me, that I don't have control. Like I'm watching a TV playing my life or that there's something foggy between me (inside) and the real world. Obviously I am not out of control of myself. I am 100% in control, I have never once felt as though I've lost control of myself. 
I keep swinging from being okay with this to anger, sadness, confusion, fear, jealousy. Why does my ex have friends who love them and who can help them while I don't? I know that's such a terrible way to think but I can't help it. 

I guess... I'd like someone to discuss this all with before I see my therapist. I understand that no one can offer me professional advice besides a professional. 
So if you've taken the time to read all of this, thank you. Very much. If you take the time to reply, thank you again. I will respond to comments and DMs. I'm more than happy to begin discussions and take criticisms. I'm not looking to be in an echo chamber. I'm looking for outside perspectives. Thank you all so much. 

I would also like to stress that I am NOT in any sort of a crisis situation. I am still very much thinking rationally and I would never, ever harm myself or anyone else.",08Aug2020,1
212,"I know I don't deserve sympathy, but I need to speak somewhere or I'll go mad. 

It started yesterday and no matter how much some websites insist that it isn't the end of your dating life, let's be honest: It is. 

An actual, flesh and blood person won't care about numbers and statistics. The moment I tell a woman I have it, she will either tell me to go to Hell or politely say ""Good luck"" and be on her way.

It is impossible to make a good case, because I would have to say ""By the way, even if we take every precaution, there will always be a chance you'll get Herpes from me"".

And these support websites talk about how the disease doesn't define who you are, but in my case... it does. I'm 30 and I have been highly promiscuous during my entire youth.

I didn't care because I never experienced symptoms of any kind. But now there is a diagnosis and it feels real. I dread to imagine what else I might have.

Anyhow, today I started punching myself. It feels good if I imagine someone else is doing it. But then I stopped, because I felt so defeated that I didn't have the energy to keep hitting.

I just wish there was a way to eliminate any desire for love or sex, but the meds that can do it also mess with your hormones.

225,"Hello, I am a 30 year old ""female"" (technically agender but for medical purposes, female), and I have been suffering from mental health issues for my whole life. I do want to preface this with a few points:

-- I have a GP and some sort of Therapist (she can prescribe medicine but we don't talk much). I have been diagnosed with Major Depression and Anxiety, as well as ADHD. For these I take the generic form of Lexapro and Adderall, and honestly they work really well!! I feel great, and seriously actually happy rather than 'less depressed'. I used to have suicide ideation, self harm, and delusions, but I no longer suffer from those. I have been encouraged to do talking therapy but I just don't have the money in my budget until next year to do so.

- my husband is AMAZING. In every other way, he is incredibly supportive, and we share the same values, goals, desires for the future, and even hobbies and music taste. Even our differences compliment each other, so we have an incredibly strong partnership. 

Here's the problem: if I talk try to talk about my mental issues to him, he shuts down. I've asked him about it, and he says that hearing me talk about a suicide attempt, or a delusion I had, makes him incredibly sad, and it pains him to hear it. Also, he's afraid he'll say the wrong thing, so he chooses to say nothing. This means that, while I'm trying to reach out for support, he'll just kinda stop looking or talking to me until I give up and the conversation moves on, or he'll tell me to stop talking about it. 

I know and respect that he's not my therapist and I shouldn't use him as such... But when I started Lexapro, my doctor really grilled me on whether he could handle the kind of mental support I needed. I told her, if course he could, and even warned him of what she said and he promised he would help me if I needed it, but when the time actually came here ended up dropping the ball. Everything turned out fine, but I'm this all means that, while I'm at home, my mental health journey has to be entirely in secret. I can't tell him anything for fear that he'll get upset, then if he finds out later that I had been suffering without telling him he GETS UPSET because I ""LIED"" to him. This has driven me to be more and more secretive, a the guilt of """"""lying"""""" to him just adds onto the stress and sadness. Then, later on, he patted himself on the back because I actually did lie to tell him that he was supportive through it all, which just made me sick with myself... But when I try to ask him for more support (even just a hug when I need it!), he again gets upset because I'm making him sad.

I don't know. I know the easiest answer is to get my own or a couple's therapist, but I'm tapped out of medical money and he refuses to go to therapy himself.

TL;DR: How do I tell my husband to knock off being sad and actually listen to me when I really need him in a polite way, and how do I deal with him getting defensive about it? Thank you. 

PS: If my tone sounds a little corrosive, it's because he put on a really triggering video, and got mad when I explained why it was triggering, so I'm a little on edge right now.",08Aug2020,1

When I look in the mirror on purpose, I think I look great. I think the shape of my body and general style are attractive.


But at the same time, I feel like I know that when I'm not in front of the mirror and not paying full attention to how I present myself, I look terrible. My posture must be awful, my hair must be in a way that gives my face an ugly shape, the different lighting probably makes my acne stand out, and my facial expression probably makes me look depressed or stupid. Generally when I catch myself in a mirror or window I walk by my insecurities are confirmed. I feel like if someone who was better at being a woman was in my body they could be hot, but as long as it's just me I'm a mess.


My question is how do I overcome this? How can I convince myself that I look fine when paying attention to how I look in the mirror doesn't help because looking good doesn't convince me I actually look good away from the mirror?

236,"My boyfriend and I have been having many issues with respect to my behaviour, especially in the last 6 months. My health anxiety has been very high and I am anxious in general. He has told me that he feels stressed after speaking with me and now that I think of it, I have been emotionally dumping on him all this while without realising this. It turns out that our interactions go like this - the conversation begins, we exchange small things about our day, then I tell him how I am feeling ( I am usually either sad or anxious), he listens and shares about his day, we talk a bit about other things. What I have understood is that he is an empath and when I share something with him, it affects his emotions and mood too. This is my first significant relationship and I feel like I don't know how to change our interactions. I know anxiety and mood disorders make one self absorbed, because the person is occupied with their thoughts all the time.

I want to make it work with him. He is a beautiful partner and I want to be there for him as well. How can one be selfless or atleast maintain the right balance of give and take in a relationship? I forgot to mention, we have been in a long distance relationship for the entire period of our relationship (2 years). We do meet but occasionally. Any advice/suggestions/opinions are welcome.",08Aug2020,1

238,"I always feel anxious after saying something to people, posting something in social media or even among friends groups. As soon as I post / say something I feel no one really cares/ or is judging me/finding flaws. This has become a daily life issue and is increasing every day. After saying something I even ask others if they are offended or upset. When I introduce myself to new people I use the adjective “awkward” to describe myself. I wasn’t like this before but for the past few months this is who I’m becoming. Is there a term for my issue and have anyone else suffered from the same?",08Aug2020,1
239,"When I was little I would bite myself when I got really angry. It’s been this thing I’ve done forever...but I eventually stopped in adulthood. 

My family has a long history with mental heath. My father tried to kill himself in front of me when I was about 11. I don’t feel like it had an effect on me that bad, but it must have. 

I was in therapy all my life into my late 20s. When I was younger they put me on Ritalin for ADD but then they also put me on Prozac for depression for everything that happened with my father. My father was committed for about six months and when he came back he was on so much medication that for the remainder of my teenage years all my dad ever did was just sleep most of the time he was never really awake. He was never the same.  

I have an amazing relationship with my father. I love him more than anything in this world he and my mother really struggled when he went through his depression but they made it through and came out even closer. I’m an only child so I didn’t have anybody else to lean on or to go through it with. I feel like as an adult I’ve handled myself pretty well. In my early 20s I knew I had a really serious anger issues and I don’t know why. I went to so many therapists. I even thought I was bipolar but I’ve had so many doctors and therapist told me that I’m not bipolar. Just that I suffer from severe anxiety and depression.  

When I was 26 years old I got married to a man I’ve been dating for about four years. He moved me across country to another state away from my family and then I again suffered a severe depression being in a state with no one and no friends and no family.It got to the point were I started biting my arms again and I just wanted to go back home to be with my family. Eventually, and I’m not proud of it, but I started looking for attention from other people since my husband stopped having sex with me and stopped touching me for almost 2 years after I gained weight when I was super depressed. I never actually cheated on him I just would flirt with other guys. I know some people might consider that cheating but to each his own.   

My ex-husband and I were in therapy for almost the better part of our relationship for eight years. Finally two years ago we decided that it was time to end it. He screwed me over more than you can believe. He made at least $100,000 a year whereas I made about 18 a year.  Not to mention that we also have animals that we have to share with each other. 

The last couple years I really feel like I’ve been losing my grip on reality. I have ups and downs. And when I say ups and downs I don’t mean like manic episodes I just mean like I’ll be really really happy and OK for a couple months at a time and then something will happen and it just throws me into this insane depression. I feel like I’m a burden to all of my friends and now I’m even scared to call any of them when I have these moments because I don’t want to scare them away. When I found out that my ex-husband was now dating someone, which I found out on his Instagram story before he even told me anything and all of our friends and family found out before they even knew that we had gotten a divorce, I took about six Xanax, I called him and told him to please take care of my mom and dad and the dogs I just went to sleep. I woke up about an hour later to the cops banging on my door for a welfare check. I somehow managed to convince them that I was fine and that my ex and I just had an argument and he was trying to embarrass me. But that moment really hurt me. This man that I spent the better part of my life with instead of coming to check on me himself he called the cops because he was at his new girlfriends house. 

I ended up meeting a really nice guy (at the time) and we’ve been in a relationship for the last year and a half. He lives with me now but he really hates my dogs and that’s been the only thing that we ever really argue about. My ex-husband pretty much abandoned the dogs and left them to me to take care of. It’s three dogs and a cat. My oldest dog is 15 now and I’m having to watch her slowly dying it’s breaking my heart I’m doing everything that I can to take care of her and my now boyfriend is just really insensitive and hurtful when it comes to her.  

I don’t know why but I’m just full of so much rage right now and so much anger and so much hurt and sadness. I’m so scared to die because I don’t know what happens after we die and also because I don’t wanna leave my parents because I’m the only thing that they have and it would absolutely break their heart. But I’m not gonna lie I really just sometimes don’t wanna wake up anymore. I have a really terrible job that is so incredibly toxic. HR has come to my office twice and nothing has been done. They’re mentally and emotionally abusive at my job and nobody cares. I know you’ll just say “quit your job”  but it’s really not that easy especially in the middle of a pandemic.  

I’ve seen so many therapists on and off in the last couple years and to be completely honest they were all crap. The first one that I went to see that every time I went to see her all she wanted to do is talk about herself. So after that I stopped seeing her then I went to go see someone else and every time I went to see her it was like she would forget everything that I told her before. About the people that I mentioned or what was going on in my life. The third therapist that I went to see said the same thing, that I was just high anxiety and to try yoga. 

Last night my boyfriend and I got into a huge fight about the dogs and I basically told him that she’s been with me for 15 years and if it comes to choosing her him I’m always going to choose her and that if you want to stay here he was going to have to start being nicer to her. I’ve been suppressing my anger at him for the last couple months and ever he has an attitude with her any of the other animals and yells at them. I do everything that I can to make him comfortable and make sure that he’s happy even when I know that I’m being a shitty pet parent( FYI- he has never ever laid a hand on them, if he did, I’d throw him out) 

My plan is for me to move back home at the end of the year so I can finally be back with my friends and family and be able to take care of myself. But right now I just can’t afford to break a lease. I live in Colorado so you know rent here is really high. To break a lease would be double that. I’m taking every step I can to try to take care of myself. I’ve cut my hours down at work to about 30 hours a week but it’s still not enough. My manager keeps putting me with the mentally emotionally abusive doctor that over half of our staff has quit over. But I need a paycheck.   

I even tried calling the suicide hotline today but while I was sitting on hold I just felt like what am I gonna say? For someone looking on the inside you would think that I am lucky. I have alimony from my ex-husband for the next year and a half so I’m able to put a roof over my head, I have two parents who love me, and for the most part people always tell me how happy and how bubbly I am. But if there’s anything that anyone truly knows it’s at the happiest people are always the ones who are probably the most sad. 


I feel like I’m losing my grip on reality. I’ve never killed myself because of what happened when I was younger with my dad and I have always hated people who did that I could never understand why you would want to do that, But now here I am in my late 30s and I totally get it. Sometimes life is just too hard. The only reason I don’t do it is for my dog at my parents. But for the last couple weeks I just keep thinking how I just want to go to sleep and I don’t wanna wake up. I can’t seem to find a therapist who can properly diagnose me and tell me what’s wrong with me. I know this isn’t normal. I’m tired of being the friend that calls my friends at least once a month having this crazy episode because I got in a fight with my boyfriend are because my job is so terrible and I’m just crying hysterically and I can’t figure my life out like everybody else can.

It’s also hard to watch my ex-husband move on so easily with his new girlfriend and do everything for her that I always asked him to do for me. The only reason we’re still in contact is because he does have contact with the older dog but he pretty much abandoned the other ones and left them for me to take care of. 

I don’t know what happened today but I feel like I had a break. I got into a fight with my mom and I just started throwing things around the house and I ended up cutting myself and I bit my arm so hard that I bled. I’m so scared and I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I don’t know why I can’t just be OK with being alone and break up with my shit boyfriend who has a serious anger issue. 

I’m terrified of being alone and not having anybody. I’m terrified of dying and not knowing what happens when we die. But sometimes it just feels like anything would be better than this. The anger, the rage, the hurt, the confusion, the disappointment, the pain, it all just comes out of nowhere. 

Today I put a handful of Xanax in my mouth again,  and I almost swallowed them..but right at last minute I spit them out and that’s when I decided to come on here and beg someone for help.

241,"My uncle has been dealing with this illness ever since he and his partner broke up a couple years ago. 

He legitimately thinks he is being cyber stalked by his ex in ways not possible(I have confirmed this with specialists) stuff like the person is pausing his music over his radio and other far to understand things. I know his ex-partner and they aren’t doing this stuff. He is paranoid and had moved in with his parents. Multiple times a week he has episodes where he will scream and shout about how no one cares for him and all other stuff. The freak outs are spawned by anyone saying shut up or we don’t believe you, it’s by him just freaking out out of no where. His mother has listened and I have listened we have all listened but he won’t eat and he has the freak outs. 

The weird thing is that he was admitted by his parents to a mental facility but was quickly released. He only acts like this towards us. I have videos of the constant screaming. As I said we have confirmed with specialists that this cyber stalking is impossible to the lengths he claims. We have listened to him and his mother is housing him but it is causing so much strain.

242,"Hello, Schizoaffective Bipolar type and OCD here. I’ve had back to back stressful events since literally right after New Years and I’m trying not to let it get to me but I think I’m starting to have “magical thinking” and I’d like to nip it in the bud.

This is really hard to talk about because I feel like some higher power will know I’m acknowledging it and make it worse but I’m positive I’m cursed. I’m trying to talk myself out of this mindset but it feels impossible. Emotionally and mentally I feel like it’s true. Logically chances are I’m not cursed and just mentally ill but it’s hard to fight when everything always lined up so flawlessly to prove to me that something’s out to get me. But at the same time these illnesses make connections when there is none.

It’s hard for me to tell which illness this is coming from because my compulsions are so tied to my personality. I feel compelled to not speak to erase the fact that I have self serving thoughts, which is made worse by the fact I’m very insecure about voicing my thoughts anyways. So for example the O (obsession) would be the fact that I’m an attention whore, and the C (compulsion) would be that I need to clean the apartment as soon as I get home and make sure I don’t describe how my day went or talk about myself. 

Now I get where this gets tricky with the Schizoaffective. I’ve read that delusions feel %100 unarguably real, but I’ve browsed some subreddits here like r/Schizoaffective and r/schizophrenia and it seems like when people have enough insight and education into their illness they know logically that it’s not real, but can’t shake the behaviors and beliefs around it. So if this were a schizo issue, my delusion would be that I’m cursed and I’m behaving accordingly to it becuase I believe it in my core even though my Brain is really trying to fight it, but at the same time is viciously cautious about it because it feels so real.

Anyways, I know you guys are not psychiatrists and I’m not expecting proper medical guidance by any means, but if you’ve got an opinion please share it. I’m getting really neurotic and I’m going to try to go on meds soon but any help would be appreciated. Take care",08Aug2020,1

Like I lost hope. I loved him the most of all people. I loved him because he was a good person, very very loyal, because he was funny and wholesome, and because he was smart. I am a lot like him in some things, while in others I am very different. In these things where I was different I would be bad to him. I struggled with depression for some time already and I was angry since childhood. Sometimes I used to say harsh things to him. I was always an emotional child, and when I grew up I was a bit angry type. But in years before he died I became a bit better and more mellow. I was nicer to him too. I also hugged him before he died. I dont know if I will ever see him again, because I am not a strong believer. Only things that hold me together are antidepressants. I know if I stopped taking them I would fall apart. They somehow dull the anger, sadness, any emotion I might have. I cant leave them or I will probably rant on somebody, argue, or will just emotionally fall apart totally. I have trouble forgiving myself for being harsh to him. I always think if he would have forgiven me. Sometimes, I dream about him, and he is there. Then I wake up and I realize he is not there anymore, and biggest sadness that you can imagine overtakes at that time. I also feel that I have failed him, because I never finished my education completely. He was very fond of education, formal one, academia. He wanted me to finish it. He was also very proud of me when I was a child, and when I was best student of my generation in school. But since then for me it seems I failed him. Even before his death, when he was speaking of me, he spoke so highly, while I never saw it. I never saw what he sees in me, because I dont see it.

But I'm thinking now that if she was thinking that, she shouldn't have asked me. She should have sought professional help and got treatment for me. It seems wrong to have asked my opinion when I was not capable of making decisions at the time. 

On the other hand, I know she did her best. 25 years ago people didn't know much about mental health. 

I only got a proper diagnosis this year. I have personality disorders. But treatment now is meaningless. Because all the damage has already been done. Like a lot of people in my position, I just went from one disaster to another. 

The one positive I take is that at least now I have peace of mind that I know the reason I fucked up my life. It makes sense now.

I have always been a people pleaser. I am riddled with this need to get people to like me, it's the only way I feel validated. Yet this chase for compliments and wanting to make people laugh also grants me the sense that I am a pretty unremarkable person; that I cannot simply be content with myself and I thrive off of other's opinions of me. I have to have others like me in order to feel any kind of satisfaction with who I am. And if I don't get it? I start to think no one really likes me, that I'm okay company but nobody really looks forward to seeing my face. 

 I also have anxiety and with it comes my inability to really..talk with people? I rely on drink to properly engage with people like a normal person. Hell, I used to get drunk before Secondary school. Again, it makes me feel unremarkable. I see all these people around me who are hilarious, who are just remarkable souls that I adore being around, they can so easily elevate those around them without any effort yet I always seem to blend into the background despite trying hard to stand out when my anxiety will let me. And when people do take notice of me? Particularly boys? I feel like they only really notice me for my looks; soon as they find out my rather 'edgy' look does not reflect my personality they find someone who's much more interesting or, they stick around for the sole purpose that they might date me or sleep with me. But they don't actually care to know me so long as they get a girlfriend or fuck outta it.

So, I have this reoccuring thought. That, the only remarkable thing I could ever do is take my life. Because that will certainly turn heads; I have this selfish desire to see how people would react with me gone if they even notice. It's fucked, I know it's fucked.

It's especially bad during quarantine, because I have no motivation to get up. I spend my days on video games when everyone else is out meeting people and posting on their stories how great their lives are. Seeing that should motivate me to go outside but instead I get sadder and sadder and wonder about taking my life. It's sort of like ""It's the most exciting thing you could ever do, but you're so lazy you could never do it,""

I just...wonder if I'm alone? If this is evil of me to hurt myself for the sole intent of seeing other's reactions? I don't want to hurt people, I just want to see if people would actually fucking react.",08Aug2020,1

255,"Hello,

I (m16) am in a healthy relationship with my girlfriend (f16). I am worried about her current mental state.

This is difficult to explain, so please bear with me. My girlfriend grew up (and still lives with) abusive parents (though they haven't been physically abusive in a few years now). When she was 14, she entered a two-year long relationship with another male that became abusive very quickly.

She tends to have these episodes of complete emotional instability. They tend to be triggered by almost anything. They're usually limited to the night (but not always).

In essence, what will happen is she will begin crying and become inconsolable. Following this she will begin down a series of nihilistic tendencies. She begins talking about how nothing in her life is going right, how she misses certain things (these can be bouts of any sort of nostalgia, whether it's with her ex-boyfriend of even with parents sometimes), and how she doesn't want to continue into the future (these remarks are not necessarily suicidal, as a lot of times she is referencing her inability to continue to make an effort to better her life. However, I have not completely ruled out suicidal tendencies, as that would be ignorant).

In these ""episodes,"" she becomes very defensive. Any attempt I make to discuss what is happening will lead her to refusing to talk because she believes I will yell at her. In addition, she tends to be either belligerent or sad. If she's angry, she will try her best to throw as many hurtful remarks at me. If she's sad, she will inconsolably cry.

An issue with this is that we can only talk over the phone at night, which only serves to worsen the situation.

When these first began, I became defensive and upset. It's only over the last few months that I've learned that isn't the best route to go by. When I feel she's entered this state, I just try my best to be there. I can't do much else, and it can be difficult, but I try to just remain there and comfort her.

In the mornings, after a night of sleep, she feels horribly guilty. She repeatedly apologizes. After talking to her a few times, she's told me how these episodes are instances where she loses complete conscious control and begins to act on impulse. She's told me how these instances have happened with her ex-boyfriend, and all he would do is hang up with her. She did clarify that this was for his own personal well-being.

I am a big proponent of therapy, and she is not opposed, but her parents are adamantly against the idea of therapy (they do not believe that mental health issues exist). So, unfortunately, conventional therapy is not an option.

I'm just unsure of what to do. I want to be there for her and comfort her through this, especially since I know she feels guilty about this after the fact, but it's difficult. These episodes are so unpredictable, and it makes it hard to know whether or not I can attempt to maintain a discussion. I want to do as much as I can, but admittedly (I hate being selfish) it is taking a toll on me too. Because she's argumentative in these states, it's very difficult to get her to sleep (or even end the call) so a night that we agreed to sleep at 12 can easily turn into a 2 or 3 A.M. night. I can handle staying for a few, but when they string together across multiple days, especially since I have to wake up at 6:30 AM for work every weekday, can be very draining. In addition, I try my best to detach myself from whatever she says in these episodes (because when she's belligerent, she can say very hurtful things), and she assures me after the fact that everything she said was not true, but it can still take a mental toll on me, even if I try to remain unaffected.

If anyone could offer advice as how to go about this, I would be very thankful. I dislike seeing her so upset about having these episodes, but unfortunately outside of being there and offering comfort, there's not much I can do. Thank you.",08Aug2020,1

Why not just tell them? Because I've tried standing up for other stuff and I get told off, yelled at, and brushed off. The worst was ""I don't believe you"" when I tried to argue that I have dog allergies. As a result of that, I still haven't told them that I was sexually abused and raped by my ex for 3 years.

 Normally I don't feel down or sad but when all my friends are gone and I am all by myself I get really sad when the people around me go.
 I have nothing to get distracted by and I start to think.
 Shortly said I get sad I dont think its depression and ut could be that im a 16 year old who is always horny and only craving female affection but I just want to be happy and be loved .
Anyone knows how to deal with these kind of feelings",08Aug2020,1
