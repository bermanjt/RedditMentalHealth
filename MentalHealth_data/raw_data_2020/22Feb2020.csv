0,"But I’m a little anxious. Does it look lame/do people care? And by people I mean those who work at the theatre. I’m working on going places and doing things more on my own — I love shopping by myself and eating by myself — but going to the movies has always been seen as this thing you do with another person or a group of people.

The day I want to go on in particular is a day where I’m just by myself doing things so I thought I’d catch a movie on my way home. Have any of you gone and how did it make you feel?

ALSO: is it weird if you’re going to see a movie thats been out for a long time so the theatre has the potential of being empty? Lol. Convince me theres no reason to feel weird and that I should just fuck it and do it.",22Feb2020,1
1,"Hey,

First of all, I've been following this sub-reddit for a while now but first time poster, so if I'm posting in the wrong place or anything, let me know.

Basically, I've been feeling really s\*\*\* for a few years now, mostly related to specific bad events/interactions with people that have caused me severe issues like really low self-esteem, drifting further into introvertedness, very bad mental state and, most importantly, having an almost constant feeling of sadness, anger and every other bad emotion that makes me feel bad physically on the inside as well.

What I want to focus on this post here is that I've had loads of nightmares in the recent years, replaying the bad events/interactions or finding myself in new ones with the same people that are just as bad and they feel so realistic, but my biggest issue is that I occasionally get what I would call 'good' dreams as well, where I see my hopes&amp;wishes as a reality. 

For example, today I had a dream about a girl I've been crushing on on&amp;off in the past (but she friendzoned me very firmly) and we were together in that dream. But then I woke up, reality hit me instantly and I felt 1000x times worse than with any of the nightmares. I just don't know what to make of it, I'm in an emotional wreck and it's hard to stay on topic as I want to drift off to all the other bad s\*\*\* that is going on in my life.

I just wanted to know if any of you also get that sort of feeling where the nightmares that are scarring/reminding you for past and present events feel easier than 'good' dreams. And if so, how do you deal with it or cope with it?

Thanks.",22Feb2020,1
2,"I've been trying to figure out if she had a cluster B disorder that basically caused the breakup and which one really fits. I think she was an extremely high functioning HPD (did very well in school and had a really good job where she worked endlessly)

These are the signs that I noted. Just looking for input.

1. Talked about exes from 1st date onwards, in a nonchalant way. Almost bragging. Had several very short term 'relationships' in a row before we dated. Brought up that she snuck out to hook up a lot in high school on 2nd date. Brought it up many times after that, despite the fact that it was nearly 10 years ago.

2. Drank a lot. Nothing like abnormal for where we live though.

3. Tonnns of short flings and only one actual ""boyfriend"" before me, despite being in her mid 20s. Got the vibe that she had a lot of hookups. Seemed like she never went long without having a sexual encounter. She would always have a story about some other guy she dated briefly, and/or we would see someone she had gone out with almost any time we went out.

4. Referred to all the guys in her past as assholes/douches.

5. Had no long term friends. The few ""friends"" she did have all were kind of high status ppl and had mental issues themselves, and they had only been friends maybe a year. 

6. Her siblings have NPD and BPD 

7. She said she was afraid of being abandoned. It seemed like she would try to preempt being abandoned by telling me things that might be dealbreakers early on and without any prompting. She would often sarcastically ask are you sure you like me? Or she would say stuff like I know you hate me. It was always kinda joking, but she said it way more often than would be normal. She often brought up when I decided I hated her and would end things, then blah blah.

8. Told me she was a bad person and that I should run and not look back (definitely should have listened)

9. Was extremely irritable often. Especially when we visited her parents (who seemed relatively normal, the mother was overbearing)

10. She would say bold, outlandish things when she like first meeting my friends or with a group. 

11. She felt she had to be better than ppl. She had to dress better (designer stuff)/ had to have the best job possible, had to know all the ""important"" people in our city.

12. Openly admitted she liked attention. Her social media was very attention seeking and sometimes overly sexual. 

13. Very overt and open about sex. Was talking about how she had tried ""everything"" on our 5th or so date. Almost exclusively referred to sex as ""fucking."" 

14. Was belittling and condescending quite often. Kinda seemed like her way of being ""funny"" was to ""tease.""

15. Did not have much of a personality. Most things she said seemed to be said to be impressive or maybe elicit a reaction, or were like making fun of someone. Kinda like a snobby soririty girl stereotype personified.

16. Scars from self harm.

17. Diagnosed wi moderate/severe depression and anxiety in high school. Was on several medications (I think these stabilised her mood enough to where she seemed fairly stable and just irritable.)

18. Did not like critisicm. Would get overwhelmed with anxiety if I had a serious complaint and take a xanax and withdraw inward. 

19. Not many interests, but she was obsessive over a few things (like disney and the bachelor).

20. Was very competitive in life/status, but did not like to play games.

21. Would get angry over little things. 

22. I noticed when she met my parents and friends, she just didnt seem genuine whatsoever. Like everything she said was premediated to be impressive or something. They all noticed as well.

23. Told me I was the best boyfriend she ever had, told me she was in love with me repeatedly. Our relationship progressed a little too quickly. After about 5 months of dating, she gave me the key to her house, and then 3 days later left me for a guy she only dated for about a month, who also ghosted her before we met, because he texted her that he was interested again. Not fun.

24. Seemed to lack empathy. 

25. Self-centered. Thinking back on it, she rarely asked me questions other than how are you or how was your day. Never really tried to understand me deeply. Mostly talked about herself and told stories that werent too detailed. 

26. After her only other official relationship of 5 years, in which they had been looking at engagement rings, ended she was on online dating within like a week. 

27. Nothing was ever her fault. Very rarely apologized, and if she did, it was vague and half hearted. She barely apologized for leaving me out of the blue for some dude she hadn't even been in a relationship with. Worse, she kinda tried to make herself the victim of the situation, and she tried to rationalize her decision with logic that did not really make sense. Seemed like an impulsive, rash decision she tried to justify.

28. She would argue any criticism and throw it back at you, no matter how slight. 

29. Talked about how her sister was really mean to her (told me a few stories that sounded like abuse).

30. Would occasionally threaten to leave me when we had a moderate disagreement. I called her out on it and she just said she just  ""got scared.""

31. Extremely low self esteem.

32. Did not handle loss/failure well. Said when she broke up with her long term bf she ""had a mental breakdown."" 

33. Very concerned with her appearance. She suffered from bad skin and would cover it up with tons if makeup if we went anywhere. And again wore designer clothing despite being in grad school and always being concerned about money. Would post on social media when she looked ""hot,"" aka her acne was covered by makeup. Was extremely concerned with her weight despite being a size 00. She would belittle other women who were like a size 4 or 6.

34. Could be veryyyy immature.

35. She would often talk about growth, but I dont recall her ever really bringing up her mistakes and how she learned from them. I dont recall her really ever admitting that she made mistakes. 

36. One time, nearly 4 months in after we had been pretty serious for a while, I jokingly mentioned that I could go by my middle name. Well she got VERY upset and angrily said you know that's the name of the last guy I dated! (Should have known then).

37. She was overconfident in her abilities. She was a very good student and knew a lot, but she would always say stuff like ""oh I absolutely could be a politician."" ""I will be extremely succesful."" During a fight she said "" I can have ANYONE I want! But I chose you.""

38. Sometimes her stories would be contradictory. And they usually were not very precise. Like she said she had never gone out with anyone in her class, but then told me that a guy from her class that she ""only went on two dates with"" was texting her about some school thing. 

39. She had multiple exes that seemed to text her. She tried to make it seem like everyone she dated was still interested in her and she had to turn them down. I remember she told me her long term ex asked her if she wanted some coffee or something his family made and texted him ""um my boyfriend wouldn't like that.""

40. She was very pretentiousness and had a sense of entitlement.

I think 40 is enough although I could probably think of more. Fortunately this relationship ended after only a few months. I had some strong concerns about her behaivior the entire time we dated. I didn't think it was a PD until my friend mentioned it and kinda had a lightbulb moment. I guess I'm really just looking for some closure after she abruptly ended things and to see what others think.",22Feb2020,1
3,Sometimes I think of things I don’t actually want to think about. It’s like impulsive thoughts that are weird or violent or gross or whatever. Like if I’m holding a glass cup my mind really wants me to drop it but because I’m not going to drop it i them imagine myself dropping it. I imagine myself dropping the glass and it shattering on the floor then me stepping in it and my feet bleeding. Also if I see something really gross I imagine myself eating it even though I don’t want to think about that. Is there a way to stop this?,22Feb2020,1
4,"I am new here and this is my first post. I don't really know how this goes, so excuse any awkwardness that might happen. I recently had two friends of mine pass away, one in a situation that could have been prevented, and one from a disease that could have taken them at any time. Both were in great health, so losing both of them so quickly and so soon after the other was really rough to experience. I wanted to ask, since I am having trouble dealing with it, what are some ways to deal with the a sudden death? I don't have enough money to get a therapist and I don't want to take antidepressants, it's just not in me to rely on them. Is there anything that I can do now to help me get through their deaths or out of the funk I've been in since? People keep telling me to turn to religion, and I don't think that that would be the best course of action. I don't feel that it would be the right route for me to take. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance.",22Feb2020,1

6,"For context, I suffer a long winded history of anxiety due to my autism ( Aspergers if anyone's wondering ). I'm no stranger to nervous breakdowns after having suffered the first of many during my junior year of high school. I've learned to recognize the first signs of an episode and have learned to handle them better. 

However, I'm completely lost when it comes to the other end of the spectrum: depression.

I *think* I've suffered it once about a year prior. I can't accurately remember all the signs and symptoms but I definitely remember feeling weak all the time. I felt sad, too. I barely had any appetite to speak of and if I did manage to eat something I felt sick afterwards. But more than that, it felt like there was this destructive black hole taking residence in my head that swallowed every emotion and feeling I had until I was left feeling nothing at all. 

I'm no medical expert, nor do I claim to be. But in my opinion, I think this episode might have been triggered by my then boyfriend, now husband leaving to join the military. It makes sense, doesn't it? It took a while but eventually I did break out of my funk and started living 'normally' again. As normal as I'm used to.

Recently, my husband returned from active military. I can't tell you how happy I felt running up to him and knowing that he was here with me, that he was alive. I never wanted to let him go. There, I thought, 'We can be happy now. We can start our lives and finally be happy.'

Except...those feelings I had a year ago are coming back. Every day I worry and I stress and above all, I feel sad. I feel like nothing I do matters. I feel scared that he's going to grow tired of me and find someone who does make him happy--despite his reassurance that he won't and that he only loves me. I have no idea if this even constitutes as depression, or what else it might be. I posted something similar to this on r/relationshipadvice and some people suggested these thoughts might be originating from a bad head space, and I agree. That's definitely what it is. 

I've considered speaking to my doctor about these feelings but I'm not sure if that's the right next step. Maybe the next step should be therapy? Maybe I should try speaking to someone? I don't know. I've never seen the benefit of venting my problems to a complete stranger but I guess that's kinda what I'm doing right now, isn't it?

I'm not sure what this post is for or what I'm expecting. I don't even know if this post belongs in this subreddit (if it doesn't, please tell me and I'll remove it). But if anyone out there can offer some insight, or maybe even a suggestion on what to do next, I'd be forever grateful.",22Feb2020,1
7,"So when I get mad or frustrated by stuff to a certain point I don't do stuff like scream into a pillow or vent to ppl, I hit stuff. Mostly myself. I thought the fear of pain or even the pain itself is supposed to stop me from doing stuff but I've literally punched my leg so much I bruised it and dug my nailed into my arm I left cuts. Like this seems crazy but it's like the pain doesn't even register at the time and I don't stop. I don't break stuff or anything, I've never even thought about hitting other ppl or smashing stuff. If I throw anything it's usually like a pillow at the bed. Should I see a therapist? Or anger management. I rarely get mad, it's more out of frustration as my life has always just been one bad or frustrating failure or event after another. I used to play softball and tennis and those helped me release some of my inner turmoil but I stopped tennis after my coach said I was too aggressive with my serves and I noticed I was actually hitting him with the ball (not purposely, my aim was just shit as it would hit him instead of the court, like a freaking homing beacon or some shit).

I was wondering if anyone here has any experience with TMS, and if you could share a bit about it with me?   
What it was like? Did it help? Does it feel weird? Were there any side affects? How soon did you start feeling different? 

Feel free to PM/chat if you don't want to share publicly.

19,"So last night I had something like a seizure (or what ive heard of seizures described). And it was pretty intense for me and very scary. Basically I got really high right after doing some yoga and started shaking. Which at first was no big deal sometimes I get tremors from getting to high. Then I noticed there were times every single muscle in my body tensed up really tight and my arms and legs started getting pulled towards each other. I felt like I was fighting to hold conciousness for the duration of it which was probably about 4 or 5 minutes. But yea after that i told my mom and she said that the doctors can't do anything until I'm actually having a seizure. But shes a nurse and agrees that it sounds like I was having a seizure and told me that I'm lucky that I didn't pass out. 

Its been about 24 hours now and I felt fine all day but now I feel really weird. Almost trippy or some thing. I haven't smoked weed today but I feel like not fully here. Also seeing some minor visual hallucinations almost like I'll go into an intense day dream for a second. I dont feel like im gunna start doing what i did yesterday but theres definitely a weirdness I can't shake. Its not anxiety or anything I just feel spaced out, like im really super stoned or like a lsd headspace.

23,"This happened just a couple hours ago. I (18 M) am a High School senior applying for college, and the whole process has really turned the focus of my mental health issues towards the future. For about 8 years, I have had suicidal ideations, depression, and anxieties that have all gone undiagnosed. The only people who have ever known about these problems have been my SO’s, but I’ve been single for a while and I don’t have many close friends/ a good support group for this sort of thing. 

The process of applying to college really exacerbated all of my mental health issues, and I only really got around to seriously applying for two schools. I received a letter from one about my financial aid, which said that I was going to be receiving significantly less in scholarship than I had thought. My dad got angry with me about not paying attention to anything, and the situation kept escalating until I was rolling around sobbing on my kitchen floor while my parents panicked/ got frustrated with me. 

Eventually, we opened a calm dialogue with us all sitting in the kitchen  For the first time in my whole 18 years I opened up to them about everything. I told them that I didn’t foresee an end to my life that didn’t involve suicide, and I tried to give them details of how I felt day-to-day (which ended up with me more or less grasping at straws). 

They reassured me that they love me, and we are going to work on getting me help. But I don’t feel good about it at all. I don’t feel like I’ve lifted a weight off myself, and I feel like I’ve burdened them with the mortality of their child. I feel guilty and almost dirty: like a complete failure. I’m so embarrassed that they had to see me act like I was going crazy. I’ve never had a very intimate relationship with my parents, and I think this 0 to 60 experience will completely change my life, but not in a good way.

25,"I just started working in health care at a specialist clinic about six months ago. Many of our patients are in very bad shape, some are just finding out they have cancer, some are getting amputations, and so on.

Most patients I can work with and move on and put it out of my head. But there are some patients that I am so so sad for or scared for and I know that I need to be able to draw boundaries, but I can't seem to get to that point.

I work with trauma surgeons who will come back from a trauma to see normal office visits and just say ""yeah, he didn't make it"" or ""she's not gonna last long"". I know it's experience, and not indifference, with these statements because they are all wonderful surgeons and people.

But, like everybody else, I have my own issues in my personal life. And then I pile on all this emotion with certain patients that resonate with me in a certain way. Sometimes it takes me weeks to cope with a single visit with a patient.

Is this abnormal? Is this not the field for me or will it get easier? I'm new to health care, so I don't know if the problem is within me or there just takes some time to be able to compartmentalize my work life?

26,"I've got a litany of aliments in my brain, which has caused me to turn to alcoholism and drug abuse. What really did me in, though, is frequently realizing I can't feel nostalgia anymore. About a damn thing. I was raised in a pretty bad neighborhood, did bad things, but even in those times I used to feel nostalgic. My one shining light, though, was Star Wars. I force myself to stay interested in Star Wars to a nerd level, but I just can't feel the same way about it. I feel nothing about it. I remember every memory, the *good* ones, with dread. My brain is pretty complex, it always has been, but what was once inquisition and imagination turned into delusion. Once I overcame that delusion, it became insecurity. My brain refuses to feel good about my life, even though I had it *very* good socially, even if I didn't financially. I over-read the faces of pictures and assume they think too positively of me or too negatively of me. I can't even watch shows anymore. I just browse Reddit and YouTube (with extensions that remove all pictures) and get drunk in-between. I still play video games, but can only get drunk for games that have pictures in the splash screens. I know that my favorite game (Star Wars Battlefront II, which I am very good at) would have been God's grace if I were just a few years younger, but now I feel like it's a hex on my very existence. Maybe substances did it to me, I don't know what to do, but substances are the only thing that bring me to even enjoy those things again, even if minimally.

I used to feel genuine magic about this world, but now I overthink myself into condemnation. I don't know what to do. I'm drunk right now, but maybe someone can lighten me up with similar experiences? I chant ""pictures can't see me... pictures can't see me... pictures can't judge me..."" to myself frequently everyday. And while I wouldn't trade my lifestyle in for anything else, considering it's the only thing I know nowadays, I want these insecurities to stop. NOW.

I took a break over Christmas and am in my first week back of losing the final 20lbs, however sometimes I can become very obsessive about a certain topic, particularly during a good episode (mood swings, often lasting 10 days). I normally latch onto a specific topic, and this time it’s weight loss. 

The problem is, I’ve started dieting like I used to before, but now part of me is extremely impatient with how slow the weight came off last time and the risk-taking nature of my high-episodes has led me to start and restrict calories beyond what is considered normal for weight loss (while I’d normally sit around 1200 - 1500, I’ve been restricting to 1000). 

My body doesn’t feel hungry, so I shouldn’t eat because I don’t need it. But my head is telling me to restrict more to lose the weight faster, and I can’t stop watching and reading about weight loss, diets, EDs and all sorts. Anything to do with weight loss. I’ve become obsessed. On top of this, I feel guilty for eating the proper calorie intake as I don’t feel hungry, therefore I don’t feel as though I should eat. Part of me can’t comprehend the major problem though, because I’m still overweight. I could loose a lot of weight before I even became healthy, so it’s not like I’m going to suffer the consequences of a low BMI.

My obsessive periods only last two weeks at most, but I’m getting worried that this is something which will progress, given I intend to keep losing. How should I go about this? Should I be worried about this falling into an eating disorder?

(Side note : If I tell somebody I’m starting to restrict too much I’m worried they won’t allow me to diet at all. I need to lose weight, as I’m still currently overweight, so I’m nervous of them forcing me to eat, in turn making me stay fat)",22Feb2020,1

29,"So I’m not sure where to even ask this because I have no evidence if this is mental health related or not. But sometimes I lose my ability to speak. I’ll be mid sentence, then I won’t be able to say whatever comes next. Even if I know the words. I’ll just sit there humming or mumbling letters for a solid 30 seconds +. Sometimes I’m just silent and frustrated or I’ll give up on the sentence as a whole and walk away. 

It’s not something I ever remember experiencing as a child and have noticed it much more as I’ve gotten older. I’ll slur words, lose the ability to even say words, or become really overwhelmed while speaking that I’ll say multiple words at once (i.e. instead of saying “hey look at that cat” I’ll say CATLOOKHEYAT) 

I know this isn’t very serious but I’m just curious if it’s something I should talk to my doctor about or if it’s just normal maybe caused by stress rather than anything underlying? It’s starting to become very frustrating.

30,"Hi, I have been facing a very tricky problem for a long time now and I'm not sure how to fix it. My sister has a lot of mental instability and substance use issues and has a 12 year old daughter that is enduring psychological damage and often is being put in very risky situations. Telling all of the details of the drama she has caused would be TLDR; but basically she has been in rehab several times for alcohol, has mixed prescription drugs, makes money as a ""sugar baby"", has been diagnosed as a narcissist and manic depressive, and has been in trouble with the law multiple times. However what is more unsettling is the ""end of the world"" conspiracies she believes in and has been pushing on other people such as these: [https://www.youtube.com/user/XtremeRealityCheck/featured](https://www.youtube.com/user/XtremeRealityCheck/featured). My parents and I suspect she may be a paranoid schizophrenic, but we can't convince her to seek help. Anywho, I already had her baker acted and child services has been called numerous times. It hasn't been enough to save my niece. If anyone has any advice or ideas and has dealt with a similar situation, please let me know.

31,"I hope this is an appropriate subreddit, but I am on Fluvoxamine (Luvox) for OCD and was prescribed Vistaril as an anti-anxiety med to go a long with it, switching from buspirone that I had taken for anxiety before as I didn’t find a whole lot of relief from that. I’ve experienced insomnia and restless leg syndrome after taking visatril before bed, so I discontinued that but the insomnia has lasted for about 4 days. Yesterday I took some of my buspirone before bed to help me sleep to see if that would work, I didn’t have any problems but I still couldn’t sleep. Desperate for sleep again today I took one of my buspirones this afternoon and about 15 minutes later I felt like my head weighed 100lbs and was swirling, I couldn’t think a coherent thought. Everything was static and confusion. I remember my head rolling back while I was sitting on the couch and I was holding my eyes open super wide. Then I began to not be able to breathe, the only way I could get air was to gasp, I truly thought that I was dying. This episode probably lasted 10-15 minutes but I barely remember anything. My breathing began to go back to normal and my head lightened up, but I felt physically drained. I’m experiencing pretty bad anxiety in the hours after.

Reading about symptoms of depression online I think I might be depressed and at this point I can't stand repeating my everyday indecisiveness.

However, I am unaware about how people ask for help or even know if they are depressed. It feels strange or fake for me to diagnose myself and I doubt myself alot. How do people know when they are depressed? What do I say to the doctor?

Nobody knows this, but I had a relapse in self harm about a month ago. It’s gotten worse and I bleed for hours and somehow manage to keep it a secret. Will they check to for self harm wounds if they know I have a history of it? 

I keep my right arm harm-free so that when doctors take my vitals, I have an open and scar-free area to take blood, give IVs and get blood pressure. I have bad anxiety, so that caused me to have a safety measure. I’m really ducking nervous that they will see my legs and freak out.

My problem is motivation, I have no motivation to go out and get a job or commit to one. In fact, my only suicide attempt ever was when I had a seasonal job, I didn't want to get out of bed to go to my relatively easy job where I got along with all my coworkers but I felt too bad about quiting since I had already made the commitment and backing out would put stress the rest of the team. That was after 3 days of work, I got through it but I hated it, I'm already close to killing myself (better method this time) so how tf am I supposed to not with a bunch of added stress from a job, but I also stress myself out not having one, and realistically I have to start working eventually.

Today, nothing bad has really happened (yet) but i still feel like there is an impending doom that something bad will happen and i'll start crying.  I've deliberately avoided letting my family make plans for my birthday but I'm still anxious about what will happen.

I want to feel cared for on my special day but every time anyone says ""happy birthday"" or states anything to do with my birthday, i get extremely uncomfortable and squirmish, i get that terrible feeling in my stomach and i feel like screaming and hiding away. I'm not entirely sure on why this happens, a part of me feels like their being fake but i think there is more to it.

I don't know what to do. I want to feel special on my birthday but i just can't. I can't stand going out with my family on my birthday but i feel really depressed about hiding at home all day.

One is in high school and is out with friends as I write this, my other brother left to San Fransisco in early January without telling me anything... we weren't really talking after a fight we go into while drunk. 

It was all my fault and I probably pushed him to move there but I know im not the sole reason but only part of it.

For the past few months, and much more so in the past week and a half, I have cried more times than I  probably have in the last 3 years, over what seems like nothing. I've had **\*fleeting\*** thoughts of suicide. Not like mulling over killing myself for an hour, but like, when I'm driving for example, especially if I'm upset, it will cross my mind ""what if I just swerved into oncoming traffic?"", or ""what if I just crash into this ditch/stop sign etc"". Today I felt like I really wanted to, **but I also feel like I never actually would.** I know I'm not alone, but I feel alone. I feel like everyone is out to get me. I am in my head, way too much, all the time. I'm constantly paranoid about what people think of me. Idk what's going on, but it's like I feel like a completely different person. I don't feel comfortable in my own skin. I'm also easily irritated and envious beyond belief lately. 

What I need to know is, is it normal for people to feel this way from time to time? Is it just a phase? I made an appointment with a doctor on Tuesday, but ended up leaving before seeing the doctor due to an insurance issue. I don't know if I can be seen again anytime soon. I'm also afraid I'm just being overdramatic or that there's nothing wrong with me and it's actually all in my head and it'll pass at some point. I'm not sure.

He lives with my parents, but they have never seen these people. I have never seen anyone, either, but I only go to their house twice A week.  
He is convinced they come around as soon as it gets dark, creep around the neighborhood all night for seemingly no reason, and then taunt him in his car when he gets home really late. He has insomnia so he stays out really late and then doesn't go home until like 3 AM. or sometimes he'll be home, but he can't sleep so he'll go to the gas station for coffee in the middle of the night. But when he gets back home he sits in his car and smokes and/or texts people. This is when he supposedly saw these people- at around 3 AM one night. Now he supposedly sees them every night (idk why he still sits in his car texting when he gets home, tho). Tonight, they supposedly started early at like 8:00 PM. he got home from work and was texting us saying that he couldn't come in because the people were outside. me and my dad went to the windows that face the driveway and the side of the house, and we didn't see anything. Meanwhile my brother texted me and said that people kept popping out from behind the bushes towards him just apparently to freak him out because he knows they're around. I believed him until tonight. I'm really starting to doubt that there is a group of people trolling the neighborhood at night for the past 2+ weeks but they haven't done anything besides harassing my brother. They're supposedly professional levels of stealthy and according to him that's why he's the only one who has seen them.  
The ""photo evidence"" he's shown me is questionable. in one photo it was so dark he had to turn the contrast all the way up and you can see something that maybe looks like a distorted white face and a reflection that almost looks like this ""person"" is carrying a sword or something. Then another pic he sent me tonight was clearer because the motion light outside was on, and idk- it looks really creepy like it could be a person, but i don't actually see a face- it just looks like someone was maybe jumping at the back of his car to scare him, but like I said, I can't really see a face. It is super creepy, tho. so idk what to believe. If there really are people who are just randomly creeping around the neighborhood, when are they going to strike?

56,"I’ll try to keep this short. I’ve been dealing with severe depression, anxiety, and OCD since I was about 10 (I’m 22 now). These past two years due to many circumstances, it all became unmanageable. At my worst I literally stayed in bed for a full week, getting up only if I felt like I couldn’t hold in my need to use the restroom. But my depression usually looks like me isolating and not talking to anyone for a few weeks, and then feeling normal for 1-2 weeks. Then the cycle repeats. 

So, last year my dad ended up getting sepsis and we were told that he probably wasn’t going to make it through the night. I’m very close with my dad and have a lot of trauma and anxiety when it comes to dealing with my mom. My dad is very well educated (got his PhD at 25, worked in the FDA, worked as a manager for many medical companies, etc.) so he always understood my mental illnesses, he was always there for me. He’d take me on drives at night just to talk and check up on me. So the thought of losing my biggest support system terrified me. 

Miraculously he survived. Unfortunately though he had to get all of his limbs amputated. He was in the hospital from July-December. Now he’s bedridden and needs me to help out sometimes. But there are a lot of days where I’m so depressed I can’t get out of bed to walk two rooms down to see my dad. The guilt drives me absolutely crazy and I know I’m hurting him. That just hurts me more. I feel so selfish and like I’m a horrible daughter. My dad is literally unable to get out of bed, but there’s nothing physically wrong with me. Why the fuck can’t I be “normal”. He was always there for me and would go out of his way if it meant he could make me feel better. Why the fuck can’t I do that for him? Am I really that self absorbed? I know mental illness is an invisible illness and it’s just as valid, but I just can’t help feeling like a total piece of shit. 

This past week I’ve been feeling a lot better so I’ve been trying to spend a lot more time with him and help him with daily tasks, but I still have that fear in the back of my mind that one day I’m gonna hurt my dad so much to the point where he gives up on me. 

I guess idk what I’m looking to hear, I just wanted to get this off my chest and see if anyone has been in a similar situation.

It makes me really feel bad.
•My mom and dad always remind me how much of a screw up I am. But, I really do try, they always mention how worthless i am and how much they wished someone else came up instead of me. They always blame eachother that they're the reason i came up like this. No matter how much i change it's never enough, at this point, I dont even know how to act as myself anymore.
•My mom and I fight, ALOT and I mean alot. It's always because I get so defensive when she picks on me or gets mad at me for asking simple questions like why did she sell my dog and why is she always so mad at me. In punishment, she completely ignores me, like I dont exist. She favourites my brother when she notices I'm around and acts like I'm invisible or something.
•Never, through my whole life have I ever been 'loved' when I slept over at a close friends house her mother gave me a kiss on the head and a hug for goodnight before tucking me and my friend in. Honestly I was really shocked and confused. It was weird and all but now it brings tears to my eyes when she does it. It makes me feel so appreciative and glad that someone like me could be blessed with a friend like mine and a mother like that to care for me when I'm with them.
•my mom, dad, step dad and older sister constantly yell at me and push me around like some bullies at a school. I'm constantly picked on. My mom always comments about how fat I'm getting since she's always working out and in competitions for them. While my dad also picks on me for my weight. I'm 120 pounds, am I really that heavy for a early teen age? Also whenever I'm with my sister and she's with her friends she always, always does gross things to me like, touches me and forced me to compare breast size with her and her friends and I hate it so much. I'm really so disgusted that half of her friends know what I look like nude, just because of my sister. When I get defensive about it, I'm yelled at for it.
•my mom tried forcing me to kill my own puppy, my last source to living in this world. She wanted me to kill my pet because she thought hers got sick from mine biting hers. Because my pet didn't have vaccinations yet she was too young and my mom wouldn't bother taking me once she was of age. We found out her dog just ate her weed and that was why he was so dopey. 
•Sometimes my mom hits me, she does it usually as a joke. We were in a elevator and I was a bit grouchy because my step dad was pushing me around and my mom kicked my mouth and it bled a bit and she joked about it when I got mad at her.
•My sister always brawls me, my sister is in her mid 20s  I'm underage. At my mom's wedding I didnt want anything to do with my sister because my friends mom told me what my sister was doing is wrong. So I stayed myself away from her. My mom forced me in a car with her and her drunk friends, their brother and my brothers drunk girlfriend. My sister was making fun of me so I jumped out of the car and tried to run away. She came screaming at me and she threatened to beat me if I didnt come. I was about to come back till she roughly pulled my arm, it hurt so much it made a pop. And I bit her because she knows I hate being touched by everyone and she did it anyway despite me telling at her to stop she's hurting me. So she full on brawled me and i got a few cuts and bruises. When i told my mom she blamed it on me and said ""dont you dare blame my poor baby about this, you know she's drunk it isn't her fault. It's yours for being such a brat, you should've just taken it""
•I'm constantly worried if I anger my mom. I'll be minding my own business and sometimes she will scream at me and if I'm lucky she will just flat out ignore me.
•This may not have happened but if I got it right a close family member touched me sexually throughout the years. But for the sake of it, I always try chalcking it up to my mind playing memory games on me. Though I do remember being sexually abused by one of my dads friends at one point in my life and it went on for so many years.
•my sister always, always tries giving me alcohol when she can
•no matter what, my mom and step dad always, always avoid bringing me medical attention. I was coughing up blood for a whole month and they ignored me, it got so bad my online friend threatened a letter to them that if they didnt they would come down and try their best to bring me to one. My mom wouldn't bring me to a dentist for a cavity I had for 4 years, my cousin had to force her to bring me. She told my mom that she would do it if my mom didnt.
That's a bit of what they do in my daily life, atleast three of the things I listed happen every week. If it's normal please ignore this. Apparently my friends mom chalks this upto abuse and I searched on it a bit but dotn have much of the chance but I think I should list my relationship with my parents and how I really think of them.
°My mom°
She was really never there for me through my childhood, she stayed for a year or three and left. Then I moved with her when I was five for daycare and she always avoided me. She isolated herself in her room and smoke weed with my older siblings. My mom constantly ignored me and left me to make food for myself. Every time I was injured I was expected to tend to it myself, when my sister broke her bong and I stepped on the glass, not knowing she broke it in the bathroom (I couldn't see the small shards) I cried and she, for once helped me. My relationship with my mom is dead to me. At first I loved her and always wanted her attention I constantly made her gifts that she threw away. As I grew older she hated me more and so I began to hold a grudge against her. By the way, after daycare my dad immediately took me back into his care. Then as I grew older she told everyone she raised me, she did not. She also constantly talked shit about my father. And i began to despise her, not to the point i hated her i still liked her somewhat but now. Now that I know she only cares about herself. She shows that by always going out to fancy restaurants with her husband and never brings food back for us, she expects me to cook for my younger sibling and family while she's out almost every week. She constantly goes on holidays and dumps me behind. She takes everything I love away and keeps it for herself. If it makes me happy it goes. That's why she forced me to move so I cant see my friend anymore, she took the last thing I loved, my dog.
I absolutely hate her, she plays victim when I tell my doctor I'm suicidal and she's doing nothing to help. Everytime I'm sad she makes fun of me killing myself again and her husband chimes in. She's dead to me.

My sister° 
I hate her, simple as that. She makes me do things I dont want to do, like drink alcohol puff a smoke, give her my belongings, my clothes. Show my breasts to her friends. She used to lock me in a closet because she didnt want to see me. She hates me because my dad loves me (she's my half sister, my dad isn't hers) she complains how that my birth affected her and my father's relationship.

My dad•
It's ok. I dont love him, I don't hate him. Atleast he made sure to bring me to a doctor when I was sick. Though he hit me alot and was the cause of my self harm and suicidal tendencies for constantly yelling, hitting, and making me feel humiliated by comparing me to his friends daughters  confront of everyone. But my dad is the one who got me my puppy because my sister threatened to fight me again with her friend. So since I was feeling sad he went to show me puppies and turns out I bonded with one really well and always felt happy around her so he let me keep her. My mom took her away from me, just as always.

And that's it, the rest isn't worth your time. If you read through this I really personally want to thank you so much for doing so. And please do give advice!",22Feb2020,1
60,"I have no-one to talk to and no-one to lean on. I have been rejected by my family since I was young. I can't remember the last time I was happy. Everything I do has to be done by me but I have nothing to try and get the help I need. Anyone ""close"" to me says I gotta figure it out and that they do not need to help me figure anything out. I have no money. I have no job. I live with my mother (over 18). I do not know my dad nor his side of the family. My mom stripped me from the right to know that side of the family and that side of the family has told me to my face they are disgusted by me and that they feel nauseous just thinking about me... I have no drive to go out and fix anything (depression). I know I need whatever it is I need but I have no drive to accomplish what I know I need to accomplish... I have almost given up completely. I live with family but I lock myself in my room so I never interact with them. When I do it's very short and uninteresting... I just do not care anymore. I have since the age of 8 asked my mom the point of me being here and told her on multiple occasions I wanted to kill myself (She never tried to get me help)... I feel there is no use for me and that I am just a dulled light in a bright world. The little hints I throw are never noticed. The only person I can talk to is only able to be done through the internet. I am not near her by any means in terms of distance. She is the only person that will sit there quietly and listen to what I have to say while trying to give the advice that she used to help herself when she was in bad times. We have sat in calls for hours just talking... crying... and her trying to find a way to help me... which I am very grateful for. She is the only person I truly think of when I am in a bad state of mind and nothing else matters besides her and my depression that's what keeps me going because even though we are far away from each other now... I do know she cares. I know she cares but knowing she cares I fear may not be enough when I do become worse... I have yet to become better.

A story I always think about that has happened to me at the age of 4 by my mother that really has affected me... not only because this story... but because it was the start of much worse: When I was four years old me, my mother and my two brothers were about to get ready for a trip. This trip I was greatly looking forward to because I loved the lake and boating. I was super excited and my mom and siblings were also excited.

So we all got ready and packed our stuff since we were going to be out for a few days... with what I thought was going to be fun... but before we set off we had to get the car loaded and to do so (since it was locked) my mother needed the keys. Her boyfriend at the time said he did not know where the keys were. I remember her getting mad at him for ""losing the keys"" and I was used to this because it happened all the time. My parents would always punch each other and throw things at each other in front of us literally whenever they got into fights they had no filter in front of us. There were times I had glass narrowly miss my face, legs, etc and cut my legs from exploding on impact from hitting the wall behind me and my feet for stepping on it for wanting to leave the room. Now that they are mad at each other because they lost the keys the attention turned to me... a 4-year-old innocent little boy playing with his toys wishing his parents would not be fighting with each other. The attention that was directed at me was pretty aggressive. My mom was bent down looking down on me pointing her finger at me which at the time was terrifying me because not only was she yelling at me for something I knew I did not have a part in... she was also hovering over me which was intimidating to a 4-year-old little boy... especially by his mother. She starts screaming in my face telling me how much of a this and that I am (usually how much of a piece of crap I am... and that I am not the child she had hoped for... or even beating me with race wheel tracks... those hot wheels ones... and at times making fun of me for the lisp I used to have or my weight). I try holding back my tears because it is something that really made me feel like I was at fault and that I should have been better. She made me feel like everything that's ever happened was my fault because anything that went wrong would be directed to me (and sometimes my siblings). She had her own problems as a child and this is probably why... she was abused and raped... but as a kid, I did not understand what was going on and why the person who said she loved me would then blame me for everything.

I would every night just lay in my room replaying all the shit she ever told me while crying. I would feel like everything she told me was my fault and I would apologize for things I should not be apologizing for... I thought it was normal. I thought every parent was like this... all I did know is I did not like it. I know its not as bad as others have it but it still affected me always being brought down at school then coming home and being brought down more by my own parents.

As I got older I allowed my depression to get the best of me and I basically just gave up on anything school-related from 5'th till about 11'th grade since I dropped out before 12th. The only grade I ever passed in that time frame has been 8'th. I tried to play football to take out my anger on the field but was shot down because ""my grades"" but was never questioned as to why I had bad grades and as to why I was always the guy in the back alone never talking. never trying. and never participating in anything anyone else ever did or never hanging out with anyone besides my own backpack... the only thing that would not talk negatively about me...

I never got therapy because no-one ever tried helping me and I cared less about helping myself... I had no drive to do so. I cried out for help hoping others would help me when I could not help myself... but my cries lead to nothing. I had a girlfriend from 5'th until 10'th and it went really well at the beginning but ultimately my depression killed the relationship. You cant have a healthy relationship if you can't even love yourself... that's what everyone has always ever told me. and that is what I now go by. I am trying to love myself but I just can't... I do not know-how. I feel numb and empty. I feel as if I am nothing and worth no value.

I tried and tried and tried to get help ever since I was 8 but all my cries for help were seen as being a ""young boy"" who just wanted ""attention"" or nothing but ""growing up"" and going through ""hormones""...

HOW DO I GET HELP? I can't figure it out and need advice before I really do give up. I do not know how much longer I can continue and all I ever wanted was to be happy. I have been dealing with sadness and depression for 80+% of my life and just can't keep going like this... everything is getting worse, not better. I just do not know how to do it... or how to go about it... or if I can pick myself up enough to go about it.

I have no-one physically to talk to and the one person I do talk to has helped me more than she could have ever imagined. It's just not enough... I still feel lost and empty and do not know what to do about it. I want to be able to love and be loved... but if I am lost how will I be able to be loved? I just want someone who actually shows they care and fights to help me in any way possible... but I have never had that. I need it. I want it. but I can't get it because I am not willing to even leave my bed to look for it.

62,I have struggled with living with a disabled parent since I was around 5. I've taken on major responsibility and it made me independent and easy to take care of for it but I lacked a childhood and went through much emotional trauma due to my parent being disabled. I went to therapy partly for this reason years ago and still do but it is always looked over and blown off and I don't understand why. It's like medical professionals don't believe that a person can be affected by these types of things. It's very stressful and is more common than most think but still is taken less serious and I've always wondered why. The professional will put off my situation as if I have no reason to feel the way I do from it. It's a natural response to feel like you've lost a part of yourself and from being burned out from doing it for so many years. It's an odd question and I want to know if anyone understands what I mean or can relate in some way. It would be extremely helpful. (:,22Feb2020,1

65," Whenever I open Instagram, I am reminded of all the social relationships people have built and how close they seem to each other. How they hangout/have fun on the weekends. How they always go to each other’s houses. How they all seem so close. I always wonder why I seem so lonely in comparison, why my social circle is relatively nonexistent. My close confidant (who is hundreds of miles away from me) told me I should be myself and that it’s fine not to have many friends. I know it’s unhealthy to keep comparing myself to others and how much happier/sociable they are but I can’t stop myself. I can’t help but feel as if I am boring/too introverted hence I only have acquaintances but not friendships. I can’t stop wondering why I am not included.

66,"A little bit of background. And sorry for the long post but i want to give as much info as i can.

About a year ago my wife(24) had this severe anxiety attack that was brought on by a THC mouth spray. She woke up in the middle of the night saying she thought she was in hell and satan was trying to get to her. She was in and out of the panic and told me she mustve taken way too much of the spray, i tried to calm her down as much as i could but i started to freak out myself. Eventually we both calmed down and passed out. 

The day after she said that jesus was the one who had saved her from satan and that it was a sign that she must turn to christianity. I tried to explain to her in a logical way what i thought had occured but she said it was definately a sign. She started to learn more about christianity and seemed to be getting back to normal as time went by. I was supportive through her being baptized and going to church because it seemed it was helping with her anxiety, making her happy and part of me has always thought ""what if.""

As time went on she started to be more and more into christianity and in the last month or so is when i began to feel worried. She would spend most of her time reading the bible and saying how the world was going to end soon, then her behaviour started to be more euphoric and would say that her and i are a big part of the story. In the last few days i started to notice a change in her diet and sleep, she had little by little started to eat less and sleep less. She said she no longer needs those things because she will live forever. She works in a restaurant and comes home late at night already fed so we really dont eat together and at night i have always fallen asleep before her.  

Just this past wednesday night, she completely lost touch with most of reality. I called her parents to let them know what was happening and that i planned on taking her to the hospital but they didnt answrr. She began saying how jesus was on the way and that i was god and satan at the same time, that yes meant no and no meant yes, among many other things. She had a few hours of sleep and the very next morning i called her mom again and picked up. Her family came over and they spoke with her and agreed she needed help. We took her to the nearest mental hospital that her insurance had provided and asked some basic questions. Next thing we know they have taken her in. We asked the front desk for more information but literally said ""i dont know"" and gave us a pamphlet with numbers to call. The most info we got was that she was gonna have an evaluation later at 6pm. They said that unless she signs a release of information form they cant tell us anything since she came in voluntarily. We got to speak with her on the phone after 6 and said she signed the form but no one has seen her yet, one nurse said we could come in tofay at 10am to visit her and we did but when we got there they said no ones allowed to visit and they dont have more info on her. After 6 hours of just waiting a nurse came out to say we could come in for 10mins to see her but it only made us feel more worried seeing her in that state of mind with no help yet. We are freaking out, none of us have had any sort of experience with this, they barely give us any info on the process, its been almost 48 hours since she was admitted, and she hasnt seen any doctors. 

Is this normal?? We feel like we abandoned her in the worst place!
What sort of mental illness could she be going through?? Did i take her to the hospital too late?? Is she getting the proper care??
What should we expect in the days to come?? 
I feel like i should have seen the signs earlier and we wouldnt be in this scenario, i feel like i let her down and i cant be there to help her. I dont know what to do and its killing me.",22Feb2020,1
67,"It’s getting hard to survive in social life day by day. It’s getting hard to communicate in a right and healthy way with people day by day. I have a weird tendency to think I am the only person in the world who makes life complexer, harder for its own sake. Just think, everyday, you create meaningless (yes, you sense that meaningless) scenarios about people around you. Everyone, even your close friends are dangerous for you. Just think, you have always jitters that kill you inside as time goes on. Just think, being on the alert, even for the random people and situations, everytime. Except for making sure sockets, doors, ovens, windows are ok or not for 2737272 times a day, lack of social skills drives me mad. Social networking sites like Instagram just increase my anxieties. To my sick brain, if someone doesn’t like my latest posts, he/she has a problem with me, talk behind me, or just hates me. If someone saw my latest stories on the Instagram, and if she/he is someone that I don’t know well, probably he/she is mocking me.  Yes, these are my inner worries I keep like a secret in my daily life. I camouflage them with my best charachter traits that I developed over the years. 

From an external perspective I am an easy person. Easy in mind, easy in life, easy in dealing with problems... but definetely not. Every day is a surviving for me around people. I still have fear about going to campus after a long semestr. I still have fear that people in school will mocking me, talking behind me, despite all of that therapies I attended, medications I took for many years. I am a complete social media stalker, because I have great fears. Checking if people talk behind me badly, etc... 

Because, yes. I have been bullied in primary school like many others. All that physical and psychological violence from my own family, from the school, just gave me scars that I can’t cure. I am sorry to say but they formed this sick charachter. I believe life isn’t for everybody. To people like me, it’s miserable, it’s agonising as hell. I’m 21. Still trying to heal my scars, trying to believe that life is full of hope if you see it like toy vending maschine (what the hell is that?) that you can pick up toys, but sometimes you can’t.

I do this constantly but I have no motivation to fix it. I want to do so much but I can't ever have enough of that feeling to want.

I feel like absolute garbage. I see other people do amazing things like learn an instrument or another language or study what they want independently, but when I attempt it I immediately give up.

It's just when I'm around others I act as if I don't have a care in the world, but when I'm alone or sometimes even still when I'm with others my depressed and anxious thoughts come clawing up my throat. I've been told by my more mellow friends it can be annoying to deal with, which makes me feel worse. I don't mean to act so happy, but it's like I can't help it. At this point it's kind of a coping mechanism; if I pretend I'm happy, then maybe I can be. Not to say it's worked but it has helped. I honestly feel as if I don't act ""happy"" then my depression will be too much to handle. When I'm alone it's all I can do to keep thinking and crying and thinking and crying.

71,"I'm 22, unemployed, and in the center of watching my life fall to crap.
Let's start with the fact I have had clinical depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember, I know because I was diagnosed.
As of the end of last year I had to quit my job before i either got fired or killed myself. The ladder was the more likely as I had already sliced up my arm and been caught by some body when I tried to fall in front a a moving bus. I even had a new will and 12+ pages of a suicide not in my backpack every day. 

Now that I'm jobless I feel useless and like I'm a weight on everybody around me. I can't go a day without wanting to kill myself yet somehow I manage to pull through. Today for instance I lost 100+ karma here on reddit for simply stating some fact about a artist I don't like as a person do to stuff the have done. While I stand by what I said I also regret it at the same time.

My relationship with my SO is also under crazy strain all the time right now as they are back in college while working (which makes me feel like trash seeing how well they are doing). I feel like all I ever do is annoy my friends whenever I'm around them and it hurts.

To be honest I don't know how much more of this I can take at this point. I'm scared to get a new job but also hate myself for not having one. I feel like a nuisance on my friends and family, I don't have the money to seek professional help, and to be honest as I write this I honestly kind of just want to go to my balcony and jump over the edge.

80,"I met this girl recently, and I seemed to have gotten interested in her, but I feel disturbed/disgusted in myself for having said interest, i've never been interested in a person like this or even a thing like this. I haven't been able to stop thinking about how I'm reacting to this whole situation and it's caused me to start drinking more heavily... It's been about a week since I met the person. 

Is this a normal reaction? And should I bring it up with my psychiatrist? I brought it up with my case manager and they encouraged me to continue on my path of interest, but all the negatives are seeming to out weight the positives. 

To make it clear, I haven't been around people my age in quite awhile (7 years about) and the case manager seems ""excited"" that i'm interested in something/someone when I've never been ever. I'm completely lost on what to do...",22Feb2020,1
81,"I'll admit, I used to claim I was a realist but came off kind of negatively. Now, I'm still a realist, but I have hope and am learning to think positively. 

Yesterday, I was talking to my brother about the clever plotline of a show and I said, ""I can't wait to be a screenwriter."" In response, my brother got all serious and talked about how low the possibilities of such a thing are, for various reasons. I've always been creative and my family is well aware of this. Though they're more supportive now, they used to get on my case about how little money people can make in creative fields and it used to make me really sad. The same thing happened, to an extent, with my brother's comments. 

I'm not foolish. I understand the risks of being in a creative field but if everyone doubted themself and didn't try as a result, we'd lose out on so much greatness. I just wish my brother hadn't done that instead of being more supportive while acknowledging the facts in a better way than just shooting it down. He even said, ""I'm just a realist,"" but no.

84,"Hi! I know it sounds crazy but I have this really upsetting OCD lately. See last April I made a university film project (I’m a filmmaker) and it was meant to be a horror / surrealism film. In the film I dressed up as the joker and I cut a lamb heart into quarters and served it to the other actors. I then washed the face paint off my face to represent ‘new beginnings’. Like there was meant to be a metaphor about letting go of bad parts of yourself and becoming a better person, also about relationships and how you give your heart to different people over and over again. Anyway it wasn’t meant to be witchcraft or anything like that, just a cool freaky film with some metaphors about what I was going through at the time ( a hard time with a break up and something else traumatic). Anyway I had a bit of a hard time after I made the film but I got over it quickly then I met my beautiful fiancé whom has made me so happy and feel loved and calm etc. Anyway for the last 2 /3 weeks I’ve been incredibly depressed and anxious - it started by me thinking I was an awful person who didn’t deserve to live because i cut up an animals heart (bare in mind animal was Dead and I bought this organ from a butcher ). Then the OCD escalated into convincing myself I’ve sold my soul to the devil and that’s why I feel this crippling anxiety (as punishment) - and that this anxiety is never going to go away or end and I’m never going to feel love again, happy again, horny again or anything. All I’m going to feel is anxious and empty for the rest of my life. Can anyone help calm my thoughts? Like I’ve Actually convinced myself this is true. Deleted loads of versions and original copies of the film, took it down from my Vimeo. Checked with other actors that they didn’t feel possessed. Sorry I know this is obscure.

85,"I was a decent student in my undergrad. Graduated with 3.6 GPA. After completing my undergrad from a tier-2 university in India, I joined the top university in India for my master's degree. Got 3.8 GPA. I always wanted to go for a PhD, but I did not secure a position right after my master's. So, I looked for a job and made a mistake of not choosing the right company. The company was small, paid less but was near to my university.

 I made an hasty decision of joining the company so that I can regularly continue with the research work in the university. However, after 4 months, I had to leave the organization as work culture was miserable. Soon after, I fell ill (got severe jaundice) and had to rest at home for 3 months. 

I got a PhD admit in the Canada soon after and joined it after 6 months as the visa process took a long time. But now, I have 9 months of gap in my resume after my master's degree and the job.

I am a 3rd year PhD in mechanical engineering and would be completing soon. But, the ghost of bad decisions made after my master's degree (bad job selection, gap year) is making me regret my life.

Whenever I talk with my colleagues, they discuss about their experiences in great companies and organizations. While, I don't reveal the organization I have worked for after my master's. I feel so incompetent due to my gap year. That has affected my PhD studies too. 

I dread my future career due to my past career mistakes. I don't know how to look past the regrets? I am panicking about this and feel miserable.

I came down for breakfast one spring morning, and I was freaking the absolute hell out. To this day, it remains a mystery as to what spurred it, but it resembled a psychotic break.

  The episode only lasted for a few minutes, I'm supposing it was frontal and temporal involvement, given the fact that I was hysterically crying though not scared. I had hemiparesis of the left side of my body, vomiting, mild disorientation (to what degree specifically, I cannot say, but I do know I never lost consciousness), arm-drop was positive, though I was alert and semi-oriented, which I would consider quite good for being postictal after an isolated event.

89,"20/F/USA Hey. I kind of just want to rant but I feel like some of this information needs to get out there. 

For the past year I’ve been dealing with an unknown illness that has made me horribly sick. It just suddenly kicked in one night in March. I’d be fine for a few days to weeks, and then suddenly I’d just start throwing up anything and everything I tried to ingest for a few days to weeks, and then I’d be okay again, and so on. I went to the emergency room over and over again because I knew I couldn’t survive like that. I lost 70 pounds (2/3 of my body weight) in a few months. I knew something was very wrong. I did scans and x rays and gastric emptying studies, and nothing was being found. 

The emergency room I had been going to started to take me less and less seriously every time I’d show up. I think they thought I was drug seeking since I’d come in several times a week writhing in pain. Eventually they just wrote it off as my anxiety. Thing is, I’ve had anxiety my whole life and I know how it works and how it feels. I knew it didn’t line up with the timing of the vomiting. But nobody trusted my word on that. “Oh, you’re just not aware that you’re anxious.” 

I was locked in the psych unit for three days over the weekend. The psychiatrist that works on the unit (who happens to be like the only one within reasonable driving range) seems to have some issue with me. He’d tell me I was too young to be depressed, I take myself too seriously, and he’d also constantly insist my depression and anxiety came from my parents’ divorce 8 years ago, and that I need to let go of that. Even though both of my parents are much happier now and have moved on, and I have as well. I begged and begged to see my family on Easter and I think I got out either the day before or the day after. I had gotten to the point of not throwing up, and I assumed something had somehow worked. 

I got sick again right after Easter dinner. I was back on the unit for another weekend. More talk of anxiety and being too serious. I kept saying I knew it wasn’t my anxiety, and that I am a person that deserves to be taken seriously. I’d ask the psychiatrist about side effects of anything he would put me on and he’d say “I give the medicine to you for the main effects, not the side effects, so the side effects shouldn’t matter.” Pressing the issue wouldn’t help. I hated that unit so much, and I could tell more stories about that place, but I won’t get into it now. Just know that it’s miserable and doesn’t help me. After yet another bout of sickness someone FINALLY decides to check physical stuff again and orders tests on my gall bladder. No stones, but it’s not functioning. I get it removed right before my 20th birthday in May. And then I was okay..... for about a week and a half. It came back even worse. More ER visits where I’d be asked if I wanted to go up to the unit again, and if I didn’t they couldn’t help me. 

I went back to that ER for the last time on the night of July 4. I knew it was gonna be a long wait. People are really stupid with fireworks. While I was in the waiting room I started feeling my toes go numb. It traveled up my legs, through my fingers, my arms, and half of my face. I got really scared and started checking my facial muscles with my phone camera to make sure I wasn’t having a stroke. I begged and begged for the receptionist to let me in. I have nothing against him, I know he can’t really do much if there isn’t an empty bed, but I was terrified. After at least an hour of this they finally brought me in. I laid down on the bed, knees curled up to my chest, still numb all over. The doctor came in. “You’ve been to this emergency room about 15 times in the past two months.” “Yes. I know.” “And youve had your gall bladder removed.” “Yes.” “So you should be fine then.” “But I’m not...” and I was told to go home. They might have given me one Zofran pill but that’s all that was done. I drove home being pretty much completely numb everywhere at like 1 am. 

I switched hospitals at this point (there are only two here) and started going to that one’s ER. they were a lot better to me, but still not finding anything. Scan after scan after blood test after urine test after x ray revealed nothing. I was started on Reglan at one point, only being told that it’s a medicine that makes your stomach move better. (At this point it was suspected to be gastroparesis.) I kept taking it for a while and one day just decided to look up the side effects, since, you know, people tend to not tell me. The big one that I saw was Tardive Dyskinesia. Uncontrollable muscle movements that might not ever stop, even if I got off of it. That scared the hell out of me. I have a passion for art and for miniature making. If I lost control of my hands I’d be devastated. I tried expressing this to many people and was told that risk was so tiny, they’d put hundreds of people on reglan and never seen anyone get it. I had nothing to worry about. It was all my anxiety again. 

Eventually I got really sick again and I was taken to a different hospital’s ER much further away. They asked me to take Haldol for my stomach. And of course, I looked that up later too and it had an even bigger risk of TD. At this point I was desperate and took it anyway. I’d take my dose of haldol and try not to think about it. And after about a month I started noticing that I was clenching my teeth over and over again, and it hurt, and I wanted to stop it but I couldn’t. I’d put my tongue between my teeth to give it a rest for a bit, but sleeping was a nightmare. I just couldn’t stop. I got off the haldol and it still didn’t stop. In fact it may have gotten worse. My whole mouth would make exaggerated expressions especially when I was trying to focus on something. 

I was admitted to the psych unit of that hospital in October. It was thought that I really needed to get my anxiety under control so I’d stop throwing up, despite me knowing that wasn’t what was going on. This unit was a lot better to me, however, one day I got handed a permission slip for a medication that the nurse thought the doctors had already talked to me about. They hadn’t mentioned a new medication, so I started reading. It was for an antipsychotic, similar to Haldol, with the same side effects. For “anxiety and sleep.” Once again I was reassured that the side effect was super uncommon and that I wouldn’t get it, despite the fact that I was already having involuntary movements in my face. I refused to sign it despite their reassurance, and they pretty mush asked me to every day until I was discharged. 

Eventually, around January, some more sickness stuff happened and my doctor decided that I needed to go to an eating disorder ward in the next state. But this was not said directly to me. They called my dad who then told me. May I remind you I am 20 years old and legally an adult. Whatever, I guess. I tried to tell everyone involved that I didn’t have an eating disorder. I wasn’t trying to lose weight. At this point I’d have done anything to get my weight back up. But, of course, nobody believed me.

I showed up on that unit in early January. I do not do well when I’m locked in somewhere and I do even worse with constant rules and cameras all over me. This is something that my anxiety *actually* affects. The rules on this unit drove me absolutely insane. You had to eat EVERYTHING you were given regardless of taste or quality. Don’t like peppers? Either you eat every last bite or you can drink Boost. Want salt for your really bland soup? Well you should have asked your dietician for it yesterday. No bathroom privacy, you get changed under the watch of a camera. And you have to take like 6 vitamins daily regardless of why you were there. Because of past experiences I don’t like just randomly throwing pills down my throat but that doesn’t seem to matter. 

They tried to teach me the “exchange system.” I tried my best to ignore it. I’m a person that can be very analytical, and if I learned how to count carbs and fat and such, I knew it would stick and I wouldnt be able to stop. It’s an effect of a different mental condition I have. After some persuasion I was allowed to go without having to count carbs and fat and such in everything I ate before I ate it. Some nurses weren’t aware of this and tried to get me to do it and I’d just refuse. 

To their credit, they DID seem to figure out what was going on. Cyclic vomiting. Cycles of healthy and sick. I started taking a pill for it, and I was told side effects (no tardive dyskinesia, which was the only one I cared a lot about.) it did affect my blood pressure, but they helped me regulate that. I left that unit with, finally, a proper idea of what was going on. 

Right now I’m back to working, I haven’t gotten horribly sick in about 5 weeks, and the TD symptoms are all but gone. Sorry for the long rant. It’s been a really rough year. I’m just so sick of not being taken seriously. Sometimes I wonder if there’s something on my record I’m not aware of. Something that would make them not tell me side effects and also not believe me when I said anything, even telling my dad something without ever telling me. I know I’m only 20 but I’m a person with the right to know things about my treatment, I think. I don’t really know what I wanted to accomplish by typing this all out. I guess I’m just fed up with the way I’ve been treated.",22Feb2020,1
90,"Hi guys, I have just posted the same question in r/mentalillness but I figured I would get some responses here as well. I am really desperate and frustrated... Ok here it goes:

&amp;#x200B;

I think my mother suffers from mental illnesses. A couple of years ago she was diagnosed with bipolar disease. However, something different, something peculiar stood out to me again this morning.

Yesterday she had too much to drink. While she was drunk, she told me yet again that she wants me to go to a particular school to study although I am on a different career path at the moment. She has been telling me to apply since many years, so yesterday I finally had enough and told her ""yes, ok, mom, I will apply to that school tomorrow"". (I told her no many times but she would go on and on for years so I gave in, I have no strength to argue anymore).

Now the kicker: This morning she swears up and down, even on the life of my child, that it was MY idea to apply and that she was surprised that I wanted to get in to that particular school.

Guys.... I am baffled. I KNOW that she was the one who kept going on and on about me applying. Now she claims the exact opposite happened.

This is not the first time that this happened. I KNOW that something took place in a certain way, but then she comes along and swears that it happened differently. She is not faking it, she really is convinced that she is right. When I try to prove her wrong, she gets extremely aggressive and accuses me of gaslighting her! I am so exhausted... I am starting to believe I AM the crazy one.

94,"First things first, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 months after my high school graduation. That was two years ago, I am now in my second year of college. During these two years I have tried several medications and none of them seem to work (I eventually told my psychiatrist I was feeling better because I was tired of constantly having to go through symptom phases of a med just to get off it in two weeks, go through withdrawal, and start the cycle again) and I have attended counseling regularly (twice a month). I have awful thoughts that keep me up all hours of the day. The only way I can sleep is if I smoke enough weed so that I can't think.

 I've hurt myself, I've tried to kill myself (Xanax overdose, a friend found me unresponsive and sent me to the hospital), I've been to psychiatric hospitals. The worst thing is I really cant talk to anyone about how I feel. I don't want to talk about it to my S/O because I don't want her to worry more than she already does about me. I cant talk to my parents because last time I did they threatened to call the cops on me and get me taken back to a psych hospital (I will never go back to one, I would rather do the job and do it right before ever stepping foot into one again). I don't want to talk to my friends because mental health is a serious burden and they shouldn't have to worry about me either. That being said, there is nothing wrong with having a solid group of friends as a support group. Sadly, all my close friends are hours away at other universities. I talk to my therapist to an extent, but I don't say everything (I'm afraid he would send me back to the hospital too. I mean it kinda is his job). 

I wish things got better like everyone says it does. They tell me to have some hope and one day things will get better. I've learned to hate the word ""hope"" because hoping for things only led me to disappointment.

96,"Massive tw for suicide

When I was a teen i was very depressed. I still am, but i have treatment now. I go to therapy, take medicine. It's still a struggle but I'm winning each battle.

When I was a teen I said shitty things. I really have no excuse. Yeah, they were cries of help I guess, but I didnt have to be so blunt.

I'd straight up tell my parents I wanted to kill myself. I would tell them I felt horrible and wanted to be dead.

I cant remember what happened. It was an argument. I was going to a dance with a fellow that I had been crushing on for a while. I was excited. My dad said something discouraging and mean that made me feel like shit. I don't know. I told him I wanted to kill myself or something to that effect. I remember that in response he got loud. He yelled at me, told me to do it. He told me how to do it and how to do it right.

I felt emotionally numb for months after that. I never attempted anything. I've never attempted anything ever. But it really really hurt.

Its been over a decade since he said that, but I still can't shake it. I get in my lowest of lows and remember it, like he's feeding my bad thoughts and telling me to do it. I want to forget it, but I also don't. It's a reminder to me how fucking shitty he is, that the small mean things he says now arent new.

But with how divided my emotions seem to be between my ""good"" and ""bad"" moods lately I'm kinda scared it's gonna happen more cause it has some nasty consequences. 

Is it a sign of anything? My body tenses up like crazy too during those times, caused some vomiting before too. I guess I don't handle stress that well.

100,"A maladaptive daydreamer is someone who daydreams to the point that they live in two worlds every day; reality and their fantasy world. To fully explain the term I suggest you research it. For as long as I could remember my incessant daydreaming disassociated me from my reality. I was always there physically but hardly fully aware of my surroundings. I can't control it. I would be in class listening to the teacher then I would slip into a daydream. I think it is triggered by random memories  or situations I wish I could have been handled differently. It also distorts my memories so sometimes I can't tell the difference between what I daydreamed and what was a memory. I don't have many memories of parts of my life because they were spent in a daydream. Sometimes I would be doing an active task like cleaning, slip into a daydream and be done my task by time I am out of the daydream. I would have no recollection of me cleaning or how I cleaned. It is strange. It went away for a little while, actually it was quite a few months. Suddenly it is back and more vicious than ever. It is hard for me to stay focused on tasks and observe my surroundings. It scares me because I feel like I am broken. A gadget with a glitch.",22Feb2020,1

I came to this conclusion after watching a documentary on Israel murdering palesteninians and I asked myself what I can do about this and what the most correct political position is. This began what has been nearly a year now of increased intelligence which has caused me severe psychosis and depression. At the beginning however, I simply tried to solve the biggest problem in the world: unnecessary global suffering. I realised that political disagreement was the largest factor and that it actually can be solved. When I realised this I reached out to virtually everyone I know and without fail all of them mysteriously stopped replying after a couple messages. It was very ominous and led me to conclude that everyone else must be fake and that the world must remain divided for psychological reasons. Every time I’ve tried to talk to someone about this they are suddenly busy and have to go or they change subject dramatically etc. I’ve been trying to get up the courage to talk to someone directly, in person, about it, but it’s quite scary, and even more so when I consider how hard it seems the world is trying to prevent me from doing so. I even tried to use Omegle video and every time i tried, my laptop camera stopped working, with perfect timing - for everything else the camera did work.

104,"Hi guys! I decided to share a little something that made me feel very good yesterday. I commented on a reddit post, after hearing the story and relating to it. I was very hesitant because I usually feel like nobody cares about what I have to say and I have this inner critic voice basically telling me that what I feel and think doesn't matter and I shouldn't express it. I keep my opinions to myself for this reason and rarely share anything I feel like has no value. Usually when I share something with other people I feel like they only tolerate it/me to be nice. I always feel like if I express myself I will get ridiculed or make everything awkward. 

But after writing that comment yesterday, I got some upvotes ( 10 I think) and I felt so good! 10 people actually read what I had to say and thought it was valuable! Wow! That was so big to me. I still don't really have the confidence to share myself in this way very often, but seeing that people that don't know me and have no intention to flatter me actually care what I have to say made me feel really good. 

I've been dealing with depressed mood and suicidal thoughts for a bit and that makes me shut down even more. Just a few days ago I felt like giving up on everything and stop trying. But maybe I shouldn't do that, as I have a voice and people care to hear it.

So this might be me overreacting but I feel like I’m trapped because a couple of days ago I went to a doctor to talk about the possibility of me having inattentive ADHD. While there I described my symptoms and while there was a possibility that I have it, they can’t diagnose me because I get good grades at school. It’s not that my ADHD switches of at school, I still have the symptoms at school but since I get good grades they really can’t do anything. This may sound petty as I know there are people out there who struggle with school because of ADHD and I’m thankful that I don’t have to endure that but I still am very frustrated with my school time because I constantly forget work, have a hard time concentrating on assignments and rushing through the and daydream but since I still get good grades I guess I’m just fine.

This guy I owe like 35 bucks to is sending threats and shit to my family. I have a one year old daughter and a fiancé. This guy I owe money too has sold me an ounce of hemp flower to me trying to fuck me over. But since he was my friend I let it go. But now he’s getting all obsessed over 35 bucks. The money was for drugs, and now he’s going around telling people I’ll steal from them, snitch on them etc. blatant lies. I get money is money, but this dude has fucked us over big time, and since he was our friend, we let it go.

I told him to come to my house and see what happens. Sent him the address and no show🤷‍♀️ then he threatens to come to where my girl works. I said do it man, I fucking dare you.

108,"Trigger warnings in flair, if you think any more are appropriate lemme know

In need of some advice. So, I tried to kill myself earlier this week. It already feels like a lifetime ago. Luckily, I have friends that care about me a lot more than I care about myself and I was okay. I haven’t been back home since because I’m scared of being alone, but that’s another story. I’m also fortunate to work for a business that’s incredibly compassionate and understanding and I can’t praise them enough for how they’ve supported me in helping me outside of work. My worry is when I go back, that I know that everyone will know what happened (because the friends who helped me worked there, mgmt have been very professional and not spoken to anyone about it from what I’ve heard), but I’ve received a couple of well wishes from people who weren’t involved so I know that it’s been talked about. It’s expected, I suppose, and I’m not angry, I’m just feeling very guilty and ashamed and embarrassed. And I appreciated all the messages. When I eventually return, I don’t know how to approach everything. How to get past feeling like everyone will be treating me like bone China, pretending nothing happened and awkwardly skirting around the situation, building those bridges back with my colleagues. And then my line manager wants to have a meeting with me when I get back to discuss how they can aid me in my recovery and I genuinely don’t know how they can because of a couple of reasons. Firstly, this isn’t my first time on the suicide attempt rodeo, and my depression and anxiety has been a part of my life for 16 years, with very few bright spots in between, I’ve been through every attempt at recovery (therapy, meds, more therapy, more meds, AA, hospital stays) and nothing helps, it’s 1) very hard to be consistent with any of it and 2) exhausting times the point that I just get mentally drained from it all which makes the cycle repeat. Secondly, I’m in a position that requires me to work in all positions of the business at any time, dependent on business needs. Which is fine, I love my job, but I don’t know what to ask them for that can help me because it’ll require me to say: I can’t work between these times, or these positions, or for this long, because I have a minimum amount of hours I have to work contractually and I’m already on an extended probation from a promotion so I just feel like I’m just waiting to be demoted. And I’ll be demoted not to the position below me, because that got filled after I got promoted, but I’ll be sent right to the bottom of the pack to start all over again when I worked so hard to get to where I was. I’m probably overthinking this part, to be quite honest, but again, I don’t know what support I can ask for. I know they will be behind me 100%, because they helped me through hospitalisation after a psychotic episode, but I’m scared they’ll reach a point when they think my illness means I’m incapable of doing my job.

I’ll be having a shitty time but somehow thinking of all the ways in which I could die and how relieving that would be, becomes like a distraction from all the downward spiral. 

Spontaneously combusting, a bullet to my head, being hit by a car, even getting some immediate health issue that results in my death, are some of the thoughts I *continue* to entertain once or gets in my brain instead of stopping it. 

Obviously, I’m feeling terrible, tortured even, when thoughts of dying surface in my mind, but dwelling a bit on the actual dying part eases the pain a little.

Much concern has been brought up about taking Ambien and I am wondering what the mental health community thinks. 

Below is a post that sparked the conversation about Ambien. 


I take ambien every night before we sleep. When I’m on Ambien I lose memory of what happened during the duration of the medicine. Apparently, when we sleep, my husband initiates sex. He says we do the whole thing together and I seem awake (but I’m not really). Then we both fall back asleep. 

I wake up not knowing sex occurred. To me, I had a good nights sleep with no interruptions. 

Later during the day, husband mentions the sex we had and how great it was. Then I ask if we had sex when we were supposed to be sleeping. My husband says yes, you really wanted it so we did it. 

Now I don’t recall any of that. At this point, I feel violated while I sleep even if he is my husband. I don’t remember any of it. 

So I said “no more sex overnight. You do not have consent” 

He seems a little annoyed now. 

What can I do moving forward?",22Feb2020,1
113,"Hello, 

First of all, thank you for this support group.  

Community is so important because suffering alone is hard.  

Apologies if this is kind of a mess.  I'm trying my best to keep it together right now.  

  
I've been on Wellbutrin XL 450mg a day for the past few months as a treatment for depression / ADHD.  It has been useful in some ways.  It gives an energy boost that overcomes some of the inattentive / depressive issues.  However, there are some problems that seem to have arisen.  

Early on, I was having a ton of nightmares and my energy was very manic.  Spoke to my psych about that , they said be patient.  That faded and things got better.  However the past two weeks I've been having these episodes.  There were some thought loops that were kind of concerning but I figured it would pass.  Everything is rushing by so fast but not in a clear ""Limitless"" way.  Right now it feels like all the sounds of the past hour are going at once in my brain.  Constantly shaking my feet , hands, etc.  It almost felt like a panic attack at first, but there are these layers of thoughts on different textures of thoughts, if that makes any sense.  My heart might be beating fast, but I am having trouble keeping track of time.  I've been drinking chamomile tea and trying to meditate but there's so much intense stuff inside I can't sit still.  It's really late at night but I feel beyond awake.  I feel like screaming.  Not in an angry way , but everything is too much.  

I just moved to a new country , got a new job, and new housemates.  Some of the stuff that I've gone through in the past wasn't so good, but my friends kind of knew that things weren't stable.  My housemates are wonderful.  There is no context for them to work with.  They are empathetic people, but this would be difficult for anyone to have to deal with.  Over the years, I've lived with people who had schizophrenic breaks.  It was heartbreaking but unreal how intense.  This isn't the same, but it's got shades of those episodes.  

This is not the first time that I've gone to live in a new country , etc.  It's stressful and there's anxiety but this feels different.  It's almost like a bad acid trip or something.  Right now it's an acute episode, but day to day I've been feeling like something isn't right.  

This is kind of a bit much as is, but especially now it's not welcome.  I was really trying to build up confidence and try to go on a date again, but I feel like I'm losing my grip on reality.  It feels like the walls are closing in on me. 

I have an appointment with a new psych and counselor in two weeks.  Until then I'm going to do my best.  

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone experienced anything like this?   Any  ideas about what worked for you if you had an episode like this?  Do you think Wellbutrin just exposes stuff that was subconscious and makes it easier to try and process it as opposed to repressing things?  

I've read up on Wellbutrin and like anything there are side effects.  They seem to effect everyone with different severity or not at all.  Some people seem to feel perfectly adjusted with it.  Very, very happy for those who have found solace in things!  

Peace!",22Feb2020,1

I have been telling people since age 9 that I want to become a doctor. I would be the first doctor in my family, and all my relatives are looking forward to me becoming a doctor. However, I really messed up in school because I was constantly depressed,  I was sick for a while, and I did poorly on my MCAT, twice! Now i have really mediocre GPA and MCAT, and I'm now not even sure I would get into DO school. If I don't get in this cycle I will be two years behind and would have wasted my gap year. Not to mention the extreme guilt of wasting my parents money who have been supporting me this whole time, upsetting all my relatives, and just the sheer depression that will follow after not attaining my goal of 10+ years. All my friends have already gotten in, and I'm here so embarrassed that I'm probably even going to avoid going to graduation.

Also, My brother is special needs and has many medical conditions. Over the years, I have naturally have felt that I need to conceal my struggles because my parents already have enough to deal with with my brother. I have also felt that I need to be perfect and overcompensate, which I am definitely not and that leads to my undoing any time I mess up. Its shitty and I know it but thats the mindset that I grew up with. 

On top of that, the constant negativity online about medical school, physicians leaving the field and horrible work conditions I saw while working in the hospital is really making re-think medical school. So not only am I scared of not getting in, Im scared that even if I go Im entering a 10 year prison of extreme debt and long hours. I'm not averse to hard work but I don't want to put in all this time and effort just to continue being miserable at the end of it. 

Also, on top of that,  I am getting minor in education and have started my student teaching semester. I thought this would be a good way to enjoy my interest of teaching and be unique for applications. I have NEVER BEEN MORE MISERABLE. I grew up in a good area and took all AP classes in high school. These kids that I am teaching are inner-city many with an unstable family life and are even in actual gangs. They don't listen to me, and one kid started cussing at me in class. I can't control the students and I am being evaluated almost every week with poor results. I have so much anxiety about going everyday and cry every night. I won't let myself quit but I seriously can't take it anymore, and my mental health is seriously fragile as it is. 

I'm so mentally exhausted and tired that every second of my life feels so painfully long and unnecessary.

116,"Preface:
I have already been diagnosed with Bipolar Depression, Severe Anxiety, and PTSD.
Ever since I was a little kid, I never wanted to be alive. It is a constant feeling that I have. It is not necessarily a suicide-related thing, just the simple feeling of wishing I was never born. It plagues me every day. I feel tired of struggling to be alive for a life I never wanted to live.
When I was a teenager, I figured that I would not survive past highschool. Not because I hated it, but because I simply had no will to live. I have tried to kill myself before, but it did not work, somehow I stopped myself. I don't know how or why I stopped myself self but I guess I am happy that I did.
I punch myself in the head all of the time. I rarely cut myself but when I do it it is on the surface level on the skin; just enough to leave a scratch.
I don't want to kill myself, but I don't want to be alive.

I wondered at times if death was a better option, but I don't want to die. A part of me is hopeful and I want to live. I simply cannot end it since I know there's more to life. Everything is hard, I want to give up. Although I'm a freshman in high school, my courses and classes I take aren't regular classes, they're harder classes.

I feel fine most of the time, but when I stop and think about my life : I am so fucking lonely it hurts.

Sometimes I hate this so much, this “being alive” thing. I want help but I don’t wanna get any better, I want to stay miserable forever. 

I either feel great/fine or feel so miserable that it literally feels like I’m dying, there’s a fatal wound on my chest and I’m bleeding out (obviously I am exaggerating, there is no way I could know how horrible that actually feels since I’ve never had such a wound) But it changes very quickly. Up and down and up and down. But usually my moods will range from, somewhat well to feeling just the worst. 

Then there’s the in between, I feel both (fine and sickly) at the same time but neither as well. I can’t tell if I’m upset or if I’m feeling okay. 

Recently I haven’t been eating properly as some weird coping mechanism. I just get too tired to be sad or complain, or maybe it’s just some sick self punishment for being who I am. I don’t really know. But one time I ate just a Girl Scout cookie and two cups of green tea for one day and I woke up the next morning feeling the absolute worst. I couldn’t walk without feeling lightheaded. Then the next day I ate half a bag of chips and I felt so guilty I wanted to throw up. But thankfully I don’t like the feeling of vomiting. 

I feel horrible for constantly complaining to my friends about how horrible I feel all the time, especially to my s/o. I feel like I’m just bothering him or making him worry when he shouldn’t be. Or maybe I’m doing it on purpose so he can show me that he cares about me. Or maybe I want to make him feel guilty for being okay while I’m miserable. Or maybe I’m lying to get attention. I can’t tell I’m always confused. I feel like I’m just using my—whatever what I’m going through is called— to prod at him to see when he’ll just break.

133,"Hi everyone. I’ve struggled with panic disorder and agoraphobia for about 3 years. When I was initially diagnosed I was prescribed prozac and referred for CBT. After about almost 2 years I felt ready to discontinue seeing my therapist and October last year after talking to my doctor, I decided to stop taking medication as well. 

Everything has seemed fine and good, but my boyfriend is worried that I am not myself. Since towards the end of January, panic attacks have suddenly become more random and frequent (i’ve been waking up in the middle of the night having them sometimes), having generally anxious/paranoid thoughts, sore stomach and feeling nauseous, tense muscles, feeling of guilt and lack of faith and confidence in myself. I am unsure if this is something that I can manage myself through coping strategies or need to see my doctor again for. I’ve still been able to attend school and continue normal every day for the most part. Part of me feels like I am overreacting, but I’m not sure if thats the anxiety speaking. I thought maybe an outside opinion might provide some clarity or insight as to what I should look into. Thank you.",22Feb2020,1

Hello Folks

I am just curious if any of the members have had success in using homeopathy for psychiatric illness.

I have heard of many cases in India where patients were able to stop their medication or reduce it substantially using [homeopathy.](https://homeopathy.one/)

One of the successful psychiatrist is Dr.Mahesh Gandhi,who left allopathy and became homeopath as he felt the medications were drugging his patients.

It would be great to know about the experiences in the west.",22Feb2020,1

I try, to the point where I give myself a sore throat, but it doesn’t work. It’s incredibly frustrating.

It can last from being minutes long to hours. 

Usually I just use a text to speech app to communicate, but lately I’ve been trying to teach myself the basics of ASL.

I went on full rampage about everything

The worse is, she didn't listen, she just was taking out parts that made her feel good

Kept me for 10 months in school that I was bullied in and saying for 7 months that no other school wanted to take me in.

Your father was threatening to kill himself when you were 9 and it was Christmas Eve, so you didn't want to sit with us this year?

But you didn't sit! That hurt us


Father crushed your dreams, coz he didn't like that he had to go with you put in papers?

But I didn't hear it! Then it didn't happen


Father took you somewhere and when you tried to find way home he was yelling at you and when you came back and told everything he threatened to kill you and I was yelling at you coz you told me to be quiet at church?

But it isn't nice to tell people to be quiet!

It’s truly beautiful to have someone by your side who does everything they can to understand you. 
When things are rough and I’m in my head, especially before work, I do everything I can to not go. I do not like my job. I LOVED my job for two years before my promotion. Now I dread going to work sometimes. I used to be praised for my work, and now I don’t feel like I’m doing a good job at all. I have called twice this year for a mental health day. I know that may not seem like a lot but to my job, that’s probably a lot. Absences are not something people are fired for so I don’t fear getting fired...but I fear that my mental health gets in the way of bettering myself at my job.

I’ve only acted on the piercing feeling, getting my second holes. I have such a guilty conscience that these acts will tear me apart but there are times that the need for it is stronger than what the consequences could/would be.

The thing is I didn't talk to her that much before, I have a Personality disorder, PPD, that makes me very suspicious at peoples motives and whatnot, and she came on so strong it put me off, it was a red flag so to speak. Altough, right now I am 28. I haven't been in a relationship more than three days max, I get paranoid, I freak out, and I drive them away by acting like a somewhat of a lunatic, I probably comes of as someone who used them, or they might think that. So it's been a very lonely existence for these years but this girl has always had love and interest in me, I just never reciprocated taking for granted what a valuable thing that is to seek in any person (I think)  


So I kinda decided I would want to try and get into a relationship with her.. but she is very messed up.   
I called her because she told me she had been raped a week ago, so I just wanted to give her support. I don't know if I'm doing a good job, like at all, I want her to get into a detox, I want her to get proffessional help, but I think that might not be the kind of encouragment she needs right now.. she needs someone to listen, I suppose, just be there. So I tried to do that. The thing is I get scared.. it's like berrying myself so deep in someone who is so low I am scared of being dragged down, but I also deep down believe I can make a good woman out of her again, and the reason I'm willing to give that effort is because she has always loved me, no matter what, unchanging for 18 years.

I am also very confused about my sexuality. I want to be with a boy. I cant really imagine being with a girl, I had a few crushes, so I guess I just have a very specific taste personality wise in women. Sex with a woman seem really nice to me (except when it involves the vagina, I hate it). The idea of me making love makes me happy, but I am also not sure, because I am scared of it. I don't want to be gay, I am scared of the concept (hard to explain)

My friends at school don't show any dislike towards me, yet, I still think they hate me. Mentioning friends, no one ever wants to talk with me. I am rarely the last choice, because I am never being chosen to talk or hang out with (except with my best friend Gideon, who I assume chooses me as a alternative when he's bored). No one wants to talk with me in general, I normally need to text my friends first and start a conversation. This is especially bad because I always need someone to talk with, that's just me.

Rarely introverted, mostly extroverted (depends on the person). In school, I am very extroverted, which is why no one likes me.

 I want someone to go to me and ask if I am alright, not that one time asking thing where you go ""You alright?"" and after I say yes, they leave. NO, I want someone to straight up ask If I have any problems right now. 

I had a friend who did that, she  is now gone. I changed schools because I want to get my higher education, and she got a job. We regularly talk, but I am normally the one to talk with her, but its hard for me to approach anyone about this topic.

I have definitely spent longer than I want to editing captions because I got caught up in wondering “what if this sounds dumb?” or something along those lines.

I want to be able to post things and express myself without caring as much about validation. I will probably continue to only log on 1-2x/week since I finally stopped the habit of mindlessly logging on to scroll or obsessively check notifications. I’ve managed to log on just to check pages to research or learn things, and to check on how long distance friends or friends I haven’t seen in a while are doing. 

I have noticed that I still occasionally check previous posts of mine to see if certain people have “liked” them.

169,"I don’t wanna go into detail cause it’s a lot to explain, but I have issues with HIGH serotonin and getting the electrical brain shock sensations a lot. I already take an anti psychotic and cannot raise the dose, does anybody know of any natural ways to lower serotonin? So far I’ve heard of raw carrots, Shilijat, and lavender . 

Any help would be very much appreciated.

I’m absolutely miserable.",22Feb2020,1

171,"Hi everyone, completely new here as I just need help after today. I was coordinating for a boat trip today when a crazy wave hit us head on. I was in the captains deck but the impact busted all the windows open and completely doused all of us. Inside cabin had water, there wasn’t a dry spot on me. Also ended up getting a cut on my
hand from some of the glass. We had to call EMS for some people and I’m newer to the job so have never had any kind of emergency happen to me. I handled it the best I could but feel like I could have done more. People were hurt but not life threatening. I was cold hours afterward, my muscles are stiff and my heart is still beating too fast to be relaxed even though I’ve been home for hours now. Time is moving incredibly quickly and I don’t know how to process everything in my head. I was partly responsible for the safety of our guests and I feel like we failed them. I plan on speaking to my supervisor about what help is provided onsite but wondering if there is anything else I could be doing in the meantime to help settle my nerves. I’m sincerely hoping this doesn’t prevent me from ever going out to sea again.",22Feb2020,1
172,"I want to die
I’m going to die
I’ve only got a bit over a week left
I yearn for the end 
Feeling it in my bones
Looking forward to seeing the light
Feeling the water in my lungs
Embracing the darkness

Today has been better
Like, I want to tell
But if I tell;
I’ll take away my favourite option
If I tell how serious I am
I’ll be committed
They’ll take away my passport
I’ll be forced to recover

I’m excited about my future
The future being, being gone
I can’t wait till I’m at the airport
Till I’m where it has to end
Till I can say my final goodbye
Close my eyes, and take one last breath
Never to return
Be forever gone, and forgotten

This hell, these feelings
Have been going on forever
Ever since I was a wee child
Lying awake at night
Trying to choke myself
In my pillows
I’m good, glad it’ll be over soon
I’m fine, mostly relieved

Everyone said
It started with my parents divorce
I don’t believe it
They just didn’t know
Before the scars was on my skin
The marks were on my neck
Till I couldn’t hide it anymore
Till they had to open their eyes


It’s not just the past
Not just the memories
That makes me want to die
That pressures me to give up
It’s the realistics, the truths
That finally opened my eyes
I’ll never make good choices
And I’ll never succeed at life

I’ll feel empty, and impure
I’ll feel like a mistake
I live a life in hell on earth
I’m surrounded by love
But it’s not enough
All the love in the world
Will never be enough
As long as I hate and loathe myself

I use to have confidence
I use to believe in myself
Until one day I woke up
I realized it was all lies
Every compliment I had ever gotten
From parents, friends and strangers
None of it was true
It was nothing but a ruse

In my heart
In my soul
In my core
Deep down
I only see darkness
Hate, pity, loathing and judgments
Only towards myself, though
Everyone else is better than me


Life. Live. Why?
Is it really worth it?
For anyone.
I’ve heard this:
“I’d rather live with all the bad,
Than be without all the good”
I can’t understand
Does anyone really mean this for real?

“Our goal is, to give her back
The will to live”
That’s eleven years ago
I can’t even see
That anyone has tried
And kept trying
People just give up
Whenever it gets to hard

I maybe shouldn’t say this
Makes me a bit of a hypocrite
If everyone else can give up
I can too
It hasn’t just gotten hard
It’s always been hard
I always wanted to give up
And now, I haven’t got a reason not to

There’s nothing I want to try
Nothing a have to see
No one to make a difference for
There’ll always be someone better
Someone more competent
Someone stronger
And I’m fine with that
‘Cause it takes away the remorse from me",22Feb2020,1
173,"It's incredibly difficult for me to keep on going after i screw up. most of the time its unintentional and thats when it feels like there is sth wrong with me, how could i have done that. The worst part is the rummination over my actions,it doesnt stop until i have sth new to worry about.
 I know you cant really help me,because the problem lies within me..its the way i think, the way i have programmed myself to think i have to be perfect in order to be enough.",22Feb2020,1
174,"Hey, so I'm new to this thread and just kind of wanted to ask a question. If you're willing to share, how did you realize something was wrong or that you needed help? What led you to realize that what you were thinking or feeling wasn't normal? 
I'm in this spot where I feel like I can't control anything or control my emotions, yet almost as though I feel nothing at all. I can never seem to focus for long periods of time or focus on one task. I just feel so distracted and incapable of doing anything productive, which is kind of being reflected in my school work. 
I have never been diagnosed with any sort of mental illness, nor has there ever been any thought that I might have one. But being in college has kind of made it seem like something might be wrong and I'm not sure if anyone else has dealt with a similar situation. 
Sorry if this seems like it is all over the place; I just can't seem to focus my questions any more than they currently are.",22Feb2020,1
175,"Hi!
I'm a young teenage male from Canada and I am insecure with about every aspect of my body and personality. I have been for the longest time and it's only getting worse. It got to a point where I don't wear short sleeves anymore because I'm insecure about the way my arms look, same with my legs, I dont talk to anyone irl anymore who isnt in my family because I'll think of some way to mess  it up and for a while I guess I kind of accepted the way things were but now I'm realizing that it can't work out if I continue having this mindset and its worrying my parents and family and idk what to do about it so here I am asking reddit for advices.",22Feb2020,1
