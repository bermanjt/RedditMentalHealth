0,"Hi, I've been struggling with my mental health since u was a child, specifically depression with panic and anxiety appearing in the last 5 ish years. 

I also am pretty sure I have ADHD and CPTSD and maybe ASD, I feel silly typing this because it is obviously not diagnosed but I'm sure I will never be able to get or afford an actual diagnosis.

I'm currently taking 200 mg of sertraline a day, I think it might have helped a little but I'm still not sleeping or eating well and the only thing I want to do is sleep.
Because of corona my doctors have a form that you fill in online and it asks you to rate things about anxiety/depression, whenever I do it it tells me to contact 111 but I know they can't do anything either, so I change my answers so I can see a GP.

I'm in my last year of uni and I really don't know how I got hear, I've barely put any work in, not for lack of trying, and I feel like a failure, I'm probably going to graduate with a 2:2 and I don't know of I'm going to be able to do anything with that, which would make the last 4 years of struggling pointless.

My parents were emotionally abusive, my dad wasn't very affectionate and I'm sure he has ASD and PTSD (from the army), also my birth mum died when I was 1 and he never really spoke to me about her. My mum (stepmum) has BPD, which i diagnosed her with (confirmed by her doctors) and is extremely hard to deal with because she gets angry at the smallest of things but she has literally no friends and I have basically been her therapist since I was 6 years old, so I feel responsible for her.

I went ""no contact"" ish with my parents last year and it was horrendous, so many manipulative abusive texts and I knew that there was a high chance of my mum committing suicide. We are talking now but it takes a huge toll on me.


Also both of my parents are disabled, my mum broke her back and is on a lot of painkillers and my dad has very severe fibromialgia. This upsets me because I can't do anything to help them, and although I have a lot of issues with them, I still love them.


I know I need therapy and help, but whenever I try to get it, they really don't offer much or really listen to me. I know it would take being suicidal to get help but by the time it gets that bad (it has gotten this bad many times) I know I won't be able to get help because I will feel hopeless.

I can't help but feel like I'm weak for not just getting on with it because I know I am able to do what I absolutely have to, but I just want to be able to get out of bed to do something for me. Like I want to go on a walk for no reason or be able to read like I used to, and I have no idea how to get there.


Sorry for the long ramble, I'm not sure that anyone will get this far. If you comment or message me don't be worried if I don't respond, I can get quite stressed responding to things like that. If you have any ideas of what I should do, please let me know. I hope this made sense.

Thank you.",19Oct2020,1
2,"I’ve been crying for so long. Well my mom just basically told me she doesn’t care about me and that she favorites my brother. I already knew but it hurt to hear her say it. 

I’ve struggled for a long time. 

My mom went on this whole speech in the car about how she doesn’t care what I do anymore and how she’s given up on me on me and that she doesn’t care anymore. She said that my brother was more important and 3 seconds later said she never said my brother  was more important but she did and she knows she did. 

She told me she doesn’t think I’m going to go anywhere in life. I always thought I was going to do something good for myself in life but maybe not. She said my art was just coloring as if I didn’t put hours and hours into it. I thought I was getting good but idk anymore. I just don’t. 

I just want her support but she’s made it really clear that I don’t have it Because She said it as if she was giving me advice as if she was helping me out. 

I was in the car sobbing trying not to make a sound because of she told me. I feel like I’m nothing. I’ll never be what she wants so what’s the point. Honestly what’s the point. I was getting my motivation back after months of wanting to do nothing but I can’t anymore. I can’t stop crying and I just feel so lost. I have no way to get this out. I don’t know what to do.",19Oct2020,1
3,"I haven’t been diagnosed (I don’t know if you even need to be diagnosed for it), but it feels pretty clear to me that something is wrong. Specifically the sounds of chewing bothers me. More specifically, someone very very very close to me has chewing that I can’t tolerate. This person is one of the most well mannered eaters I know, but I can’t even tolerate their chewing. Just thinking about them eating makes me mad or anxious. Even when I hear them scraping a bowl, I have to cover my ears because I know that means they’re eating. And if I’m with them when they’re eating (even if it’s just a small thing like a nut), I have to leave the room. Today, I actually left the room and cried because of it. This has been going on for a few years, but it’s only gotten worse and has affected our relationship a lot. Is there anything I can do?",19Oct2020,1
4,"throwaway because this is a disaster and i'm kind of ashamed of my position. big ol vent ahead so sorry for lack of clarity or anything else. im not going back to edit it. 

i dont know how to do school anymore. i simply cannot handle it. i'm a senior (that will be taking an extra year) who has had a very troubled school experience. i have gone part time and taken medical leave in the past because of being hospitalized and getting treated for my depression, anxiety, and eating disorder. now i'm recovered from my eating disorder since that's what my treatment focused on but my depression and anxiety have never left me and i'm struggling to keep up in life again. 

first i was enrolled in 2 of my major classes and one minor elective. i dropped the minor elective (and the minor, for now) because the course difficulty was off the charts and i was completely unprepared. so i swapped it for some ""easy"" GE full of freshman so it couldnt be that bad, right? well wrong, i was a week and a half behind when i got in and i missed 220 points worth of assignments and attendance. so even if i got 100% in everything, i'd still only be able to get a 78% and let's be real, there's no fucking way i'd be able to get 100% in everything. the course material is mostly physics which i have never taken because my shitty high school never offered it which i didnt know when i enrolled because it was never mentioned in the syllabus or course description. then suddenly, on all the homeworks, i had to know physics to complete it. 

so i'm trying to get the documentation to go part time again, but since my therapist dropped me over summer because she felt like i wasnt getting any better and i have not been able to find another therapist, my documentation that the school had was voided. so all of my disability accommodations and qualification for part time is gone and i have to get new documents. the deadline to sumbit for part time is wednesday and it's sunday. i have an appointment to see someone from my schools health center on monday but they failed to inform me that this person is an intern and is virtually powerless in my situation. so i dont know what the fuck im going to do. i already changed my enrollment in the class to pass/fail but i cant do the work to even get a pass at this point. i have 2 jobs and before anyone asks, i tried to qualify for part time using the fact that i work 30 hours a week as an excuse but they wouldnt take it because i work 15 hours a week at each job which is less than their ""minimum"" of 25. so i need to get it based on my health instead. 

i feel so hopeless. this school is going to be the death of me. i think about dropping out every time i open my books or my laptop to work. on top of everything i am prone to chronic migraines so sometimes i wont even get 30 minutes into a lecture before staring at the screen causes me to be in complete agony for hours or even days. I had to watch 4 hours of lectures (2 2 hour classes) this past thursday and i was involuntarily crying the whole time because my head hurt so bad. when i ended the day it was the worst pain of my life. i took excedrin but i was still in so much pain i thought i might puke or pass out. im usually never on the computer for this long and ive tried the glasses, the screen dimmers/filters etc and nothing works. if i use it for more than an hour im guaranteed a headache at bare minimum. so im kind of fucking myself right now because i can feel the pressure building in my head but i just need to get this out.

ive tried to talk to the disability people at my school. i was on the phone with them for 45 minutes on friday but everybody says their fucking hands are tied. i tried to go to my professors and ask for anything, any extension, any possibility that i can handwrite/upload, have extra time to do quizzes, literally anything but they all say their hands are all tied. it makes me feel like im drowning, i feel like i have weights on my feet dragging me down and im SCREAMING for anything, any help, just someone to care, please at the very least just fucking NOTICE me and ACKNOWLEDGE that i am suffering right now and cut the shit they theres totally nothing that can be done for me. its like everyone would rather see me drown. one less email in their inbox, one less uncomfortable phone call where you have to pretend to care, one less person in the class asking questions when everyone else seems to understand. 

i dont know what im going to do. we are only on week 3 and this is the worst academic stress i have ever faced. not to repeat what everyone already knows but WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. expectations of us have not changed and we are forced to do it all online. everyone says its so easy! canvas is so easy, zoom is so easy and intuitive! it's fun! it's different! we make it work! but ITS NOT WORKING. ITS NOT WORKING. I REPEAT IT IS NOT FUCKING WORKING. just to stay on top of my assignments, i have to check my email, my spam sometimes, canvas files, canvas assignments, canvas modules, canvas announcements, zoom, yuja, piazza, gradescope, m-h connect, google drive, google classroom, hypothesis, and 4 online textbooks. this is absolutely absurd, i dont care how tech savvy you are. please understand that it is unacceptable to not have a single common platform from which to view and submit work. i can't keep up and i cant handle it. 

i cant take a leave because im already going to have to take a 5th year to make up for my past missed coursework. i cant imaging having to stay at this godforsaken school for fucking 6TH YEAR. and im not crazy intelligent so i cant drop out and start a business or whatever. at this point i honestly think i might just not be meant to be alive. i feel like a constant burden to everything and everyone and i'll never be fully self sufficient. it makes me feel like a fucking idiot. i dont know what to do anymore. i sometimes get stuck in loops of thinking i should just kill myself but im not gonna fucking do that. honestly? i like who i am. i believe that school aside i am a pretty smart person. i have great common sense, i am empathetic, i am emotionally intelligent and kind. other than the chronic migraines i am healthy and it took me so long to get here. i went from starving myself to the point of near death to binging uncontrollably but with time and consistent effort despite the discomfort i have reached a point where i am fit, active, strong, and healthy, no longer plagued by thoughts of food and my body, or compulsive exercise or purging. and for all that im grateful. i've worked too hard to give up now. i have so much going for me right now and the only thing weighing me down is school. 

the thing is school just has a way of defining your whole life. i need it to get a career, i need a career to make money, i need money to afford the cost of living, etc etc. it all comes down to having to just suck it up and do well in school for 2 more years. but i dont know if i can. school wasnt meant for people like me. i know other students are stressed but they don't get so anxious they become paralyzed. they dont get headaches so bad they puke. they dont get so depressed that they have to live another day just to spend it on zoom that they fantasize about killing themselves the whole 8 hours they should be catching up on sleep. when im not in school i actually pass as a functional person! i go to work, i do my chores, i run my errands, i engage with others and in my hobbies. school just turns me into a fucking wreck and a sad excuse for a human being. it's so sad because i actually love learning. i was always the most curious kid growing up and still, even now i just have an unshakeable curiosity for everything. i want to learn. so i dont know what to do. i dont know if ill get approved for part time. im probably going to fail one or more of my classes this semester. maybe that will be a relief though. it's gonna be confusing for me to throw this in at the last minute but i've made the deans list every quarter since i came to school for every semester i've taken a full course load. maybe i need to fail just to know i still can and it won't be the end of the world for me. when grades get published im not going to suddenly combust if i see an NP on my record. i'll see it and move the fuck on. i'll take another round of classes next semester and try again. repeat as long as it takes to get my degree and get out. and if any future employers or schools want to know, man what the fuck happened to you in 2020? how do you explain how bad you did? then i have no words. it speaks for itself. 2020 has been a shitshow of a year. 2020 doesnt encapsulate who i am as a student and as a person. 2020 doesnt mean shit. 2020 can suck my ass because i'm going to show up to 2021 in spite of it all ready to keep on going whether that means success or failure. i'll keep failing for the rest of my life if i have to but im not giving up, and thats a promise. 

but right now my fucking head hurts. it's a sunday night so im giving myself a tiny break but tomorrow morning im going to get back on the phone, write those emails, whatever the fuck i need to do to get the support i need right now. because i deserve it or something like that. and if i don't get it? fuck them. fuck the admin, fuck professors, fuck em all. it's not the end of the world if/when i fail and imma still be the same great person. none of my achievements and successes will go away from one dumb failure.

love you guys, if you made it this far then damn im sorry i guess lol. take it easy and if you're in school right now and feeling the stress you're not alone. im right there with you and we are gonna get through this shit no matter what.",19Oct2020,1
5,"I’ve struggled with mental health my entire life. I’m unsure if I should talk to my doctor about it and worried about gaining more weight on medication again.

Age 5: struggled with anxiety, disordered eating, trichotillomania 
Age 9: suicidal thoughts, balding eyebrows and bald spots on crown from trichotillomania 
Age 16: binge eating but in shape due to sports, trichotillomania is now a hidden issue (picking only in random spots instead of specific spots) in therapy (did not discuss trich or binge eating)
Age 20: Went on Zoloft, gained 20 lbs. 
Age 23: Got off Zoloft and binge eating and trich resume (trich not as intense)
Current age 27: struggling with binge eating/compulsive behavior (checking the kitchen 20 times before leaving my apartment for a long weekend or even a day trip). Trich is not as bad but that’s because I noticed stress related hair loss lately and worried about it.

My grandmother, who I never met, struggled with mental illness until she took her life in her 50s. She was morbidly obese, artistic like myself and struggled with anxiety. My mother struggled with trichotillomania until her 30s but is petite and runs 10 miles a day, she still struggles with anxiety but uses exercise as “her medicine”. 

I want to be healthy, happy and not let myself become my grandmother. I feel so bad for her for not getting help but I feel like I’m sidelining myself because I’m afraid of gaining more weight and becoming more depressed over my appearance. I’m not obese for my 5 ft frame but I’m worried I can’t control my compulsive behavior anymore. Any suggestions? I’m going to talk to my doctor about something unrelated Wednesday.",19Oct2020,1
6,"Sorry. I’m on mobile. 

I am a 19 y/o male college student with high functioning Autism. I have a fear of showing my emotions in front of other people. I don’t like being seen as a burden. I also don’t like grabbing attention like that. 

Because of all this, overvthe years i’ve supressed my emotions. I’ve seen it as the safest thing. For everyone else, out of site out of mind. I can be what I want people to see me as: a happy person who likes to love on people. I want people to be happy when interacting with me. If they are not, then my brain translates to “I did something wrong this is my fault they probably hate me now. Logically I know this is false, but who actually thinks logically when your an anxious hot mess. 

Despite these fears, what i’ve wanted for a really long time is to be able to cry in someone’s arms. I want someone to hold me and let me be weak. But not only am i afraid to do that, but i’ve hidden my emotions so long that I have trouble releasing them when i’m by myself. It took me around 30 minutes. I wrapped myself in blankets. It would not come out. I tried sad thoughts, but i’m already sad. I’ve even tried hitting myself. I slapped myself pretty hard. No damage that anyone would notice, just enough to move the process along. I was close but no tears. I finally got the idea to watch a try not to cry challenge. I was already on the verge. I just needed a push. The first video got me and I bawled my eyes out like a baby. The only thing missing was someone else to help me while I cried. I took a shower afterwards and now I can feel better till the next time. I know I should ask for help, but again I don’t want people to stress over me like that. There shouldn’t be a reason for these feelings anyways. I have a good life with good friends and good family. Whatever is happening to me is my fault.",19Oct2020,1

But what’s the point? The trauma and issues in my head aren’t going anywhere and I get no enjoyment out of being alive at this point. I don’t want to continue this and I don’t care if I fail this exam but I also think what if later I feel better and wish I tried harder?

12,"Since I was a child I’ve always been really unsettled when leaving friends or family behind. But to add to that, I have recurring scenes of the worst possible scenario and it raises my anxiety through the roof. When my SO leaves for work, I’m fighting the temptation to call him every 20 minutes because a recurring scene of him getting into a horrible crash cycles through my head until I hear his voice again. If we spend a lot of time apart, despite being transparent and trustworthy for the 4 year span of our relationship, I (unintentionally) imagine him cheating on me in the most vile of ways. Two weeks ago, I drove an hour back home just to stop myself from thinking that some unknown mistress was in our house with him. Only to come home and see him doing his usual work, it’s exhausting but I wouldn’t have stopped thinking about it otherwise. These feelings all go away when he’s present, they’re often just triggered by me being left alone. I can even laugh it off and acknowledge how irrational my fears get. But when I’m alone, my thoughts plague my mind and I don’t know how to ignore them without positively reinforcing this behavior. I think that giving in to calling and texting my family when I get like this will only make me more of a burden or nuisance to them..

It isn’t only with my SO, it’s with my younger brother also and it mainly revolved around my parents in the past, despite the relentless abuse.  I also ask my friends to text me when they get home after they’ve left my house. Does anyone else deal with this daily? How does one cope with it without being like a traumatized dog to their loved ones? 

TL;DR: I have vivid images of my family dying and being hurt in ways that make working and functioning day to day pretty debilitating for me unless I call and make sure they’re okay. Is this separation anxiety or just part of being depressed? Is this normal? How do I cope?",19Oct2020,1

14,"This post may be a bit rambly but I’ll keep it as concise as possible. For context I wanted to post this here due to the heavy mental health implications rather than on relationship advice based subreddits.

I’ve been with my partner for 5 years, we’re both nearly 30 and live together. He has been working from home while I’ve been working outwith. His behaviour has drained me, not just over lockdown but our entire relationship. I explain that he’s doing something that upsets me or dredges up old traumas and he will apologise and claim he won’t do it again. Then it happens again I’m left a wreck and the cycle continues. I’m noticing a lot of other things that don’t add up either, I believe he is being unfaithful due to certain things he’s doing. Things like hiding his phone screen from me and never giving me a straight answer for things, but also expecting to know everything I’m doing. All of these issues combined are causing me unbelievable stress and anxiety. I’d even go as far to say I’m becoming paranoid. I tell him this and nothing changes. That’s the issue.

I’ve been with him for five years and he still does things that I’ve told him hurt very deeply, I figured relationship counselling was the last resort because five years of talking clearly hasn’t helped. I told him that this was my last ditch attempt to fix things and I think that scared him, so much so he was uncooperative in arranging a day where we could go to the session, eventually we got to a session and we have another session planned for a week and a half from now. I don’t know if I’m just beating a dead horse at this point.

Additional context: the last couple of times I’ve tried to bring up the effect his actions have on me he claimed he has been depressed and feeling suicidal. Of course this was hugely concerning to me because he had not mentioned anything of the sort before, and we ended up discussing his mental health instead. Though his mental health may be contextual, it does not excuse his actions; but I worry about the implications this will have on the possible future of the relationship.

Fact is after years of constant disregard to my mental well-being while I’m expected to be the golden girlfriend I just feel so worn down by it all. I don’t know if it’ll improve but the effect it’s having on me is making me want to self harm again I feel so worthless. I don’t know if I should see the counselling through or if I should cut my losses and try to rebuild myself. Am I perhaps not emotionally dealing with this effectively? I have also considered the option of getting him to move out, and give us some distance. Does anyone have any similar experiences or thoughts on this?",19Oct2020,1

17,"I’ll go straight to the point. I suffer from severe ADHD. Because of that, I have anxiety, depression, etc. . It was always noticeable bad and even drew me to near suicide in 2014. However, until 2020, things were going fine. Then everything shut down. My adhd medication always made me anxious but just taking it with nothing else to do or go turned it against me. It’s now almost 2021 and I’m a shell of my former self. I suffer from Pure O/obsessive behavior, crippling social anxiety, near suicidal depression, paranoia delusions, intense RSD (rejection sensitivity disorder), etc. I’m truly in an terrible place and even though I switched my medication, the damage is already done. I’m never going to be mentally restored. The person I was leading up to this year is gone. That brings me to my current problem. Music. I’ve done music my entire life. It’s been a heathy and safe way for me to get my emotions out there. I love it. Music is where most of my social interactions are from now too. Everything should be good right? It’s not. As I stated earlier, I’m dealing with a lot of mental burdens right now. This has extended to music. My brain is driving me crazy and music isn’t helping me anymore. My RSD is so bad I read into everything and it’s catastrophic. Because of this, if I even lose followers I start to panic and get emotionally hurt. I’m confused on what to do. I’ve already realized I’m in an mental health danger zone. I’ve honestly thought about ending it countless times. Everything—including the things I used to love— have become pressure cookers.

I constantly think about large concepts like death, purpose, etc, not in a dwelling way just more of an intrigue. I’m ok with the idea of death. Not that I actively want to die right now, but I’m just alright with it in general. Didn’t know I could find a way to ramble on reddit but I did. Oh well. Anyone feel any of this??",19Oct2020,1
23,"This is a really heartbreaking topic. My grandma is such an accomplished, intelligent, and resilient woman. She was born just months before WWII began in Warsaw, she her entire childhood and early adulthood caused a slew of trauma for her. While she worked, she could generally distract herself enough to not feel severely depressed or anxious (I doubt this is 100% true, but this is what she has told me.)

She retired 7 years ago, and there was definitely a change in her happiness. Now it has taken a turn for the worst. Because of COVID not only is she more isolated than before, but she has also lost her younger sister (not because of COVID) and couldn’t travel to lay her to rest. She has become very fixated on her mortality, and I suspect a lot of fear of the unknown that she grew up with as a child because of her wartime trauma comes flooding back every time she loses “control.”

Tonight she told me she’s considering taking sleeping pills so she can die in her sleep, and it’s a really alarming and heartbreaking admission from her. 

I’d really like to hear what others’ experiences have been with similar issues. Obviously my family and myself have talked about what we can do to “keep her busy,” but I would also like to know what we can set her up with so she can feel happy when we aren’t with her.

Hey everyone, long time lurker first time poster here. I (16M) have lost pretty much all motivation towards school. I used to be an A grade student two years ago but now I’m getting C’s and D’s. I’m not motivated to try and I don’t know why. Subjects I used to love now have absolutely no meaning to me, apart from one. I want to drop out of school as well, because I just feel like I can’t get any better. If it means anything I suffer from anxiety and my self confidence is sub-par. Do any of you have any advice? How can I get my motivation back?
Thanks,

27,"So I’ve finally realized that all of the bad feelings and negative thoughts I’ve had are tied to this mental fog I have. I’ve had thyroid issues for years now and due to this, I have trouble remembering things and handling my emotions and feelings. In the last few months it’s gotten a lot worse. I no longer feel grounded or connected because I can’t remember things day to day and the past all feels like a giant blur.

I've had this for a while on and off and but not commonly and only occasionally but last night I had a really disturbing dream where all the children in my place were being taken by eagles and the parents were terrorised ... And I was just there watching ... As If it was entertaining and part of me thought it was good since the kids in my society were pricks anyway.... Followed by a part in the dream where I remembered killing people with guns ... And it felt like all the memories were real so I decided to visit a psych in my dream then I woke up now I only remember a part of that dream and I'm not familiar with any location there. And I tried to remember everything over the years but I don't think I remembered anything like it but I do have cases of ""false memories"" but the fact that I don't know if those are false memories or not are equally scary.  As for that eagles taking children part , I'm scared it says something about my subconscious ... 

Has anyone experienced anything similar ?",19Oct2020,1
34,"I have been dreading posting about this to an online discussion forum for the longest time, however no doctors, medication, or even imaging has helped shed light on this terrible disease that has progressively been getting worse these past few months. 

I’m going to start off by saying that this started cropping up a few years ago, and since then it has progressively been getting worse to the point where I dread going out or making relationships as I cannot form a coherent sentence, breathe properly or even eat in public. I work in a retail pharmacy, and my ‘tics’ as I call them sound like coughing or sneezing which upset many people, causing me to explain my issue. Working in a retail pharmacy however, I’m mostly just spat on and given a bad review for “spreading disease to the general public.” Yeah, that’s on my review sheet, apparently this brain-thing whatever it is that’s out of my control is the “corona virus.” It’s not, and I feel like it’s something much more serious than even I personally think. When I’m at home doing school work, I’ll suddenly erupt into a fit of “deep/short breathing” my eyes roll back, and I lift my chin up and breath with my “throat”. It is a loud and obnoxious sound, and can sometimes cause me to make a pressurized “pop” that can send my nose into a severe bleeding frenzy. When it’s not my breathing, it’s my speech, I stutter like jimmy from South Park but much more severe, I can’t control it and I end up exhaling while doing it too which in turn causes me to pass out or feel like I am suffocating. It won’t stop, and I’ve tried everything even with my doctors and they don’t have any clue what it could be. It just started one day, and like a hiccup it comes and goes. Medication helped for a little bit but it always comes back stronger than the first time I started taking the meds. 

MRI imaging showed my left lateral ventricle being more prominent in side than the right of “uncertain clinical significance” and the neurologist in professional UHC fashion said my case wasn’t “worth [his] time” and he had “more important things to do.” Yes, a neurologist actually told their MA to tell me this over the phone, while I was at work. So, I took this as an “I’m fine, maybe I need to just relax.” Even while relaxing I have an attack, where I pressurize the interior of my skull, like ‘flexing’ my brain and having a “breathing fit.” My family thinks I’m on drugs, because I cannot form a coherent sentence. What is even scarier now is that I’m changing personality wise, I used to be so kind and helping, now I lash out at people who treat me like shit, it’s like a bug takes control of me. I yell, scream, and cut people off instead of reasoning with them. I justify this behavior as “they treat me like shit, time to return the favor.” But that’s NOT me. I end up crying, and the pressure inside my head when I cry is so extremely painful it’s unbearable and I almost collapse from pain-induced shock. I feel like I have no emotion, no product of care anymore, I’m mentally deteriorating like I’m glitching out of reality, comically ‘glitching’ is a near PERFECT analogy for what I am going through. 

Please mods, don’t delete this. This is my last resort. No one seems to be going through this, no one that I’ve talked to locally has answers. I’m begging for help at this point, I can’t take this anymore.

Tl,dr: I developed a ‘tic’ a few years ago, and now it’s turned into a destructive mental-overload of some sort. No one knows what it is, or what’s truly causing it. I’m otherwords: internal-hemorrhaging hiccups that cause my brain to ‘jolt’ and my breathing to ‘suffocate’ me.",19Oct2020,1
35,"I feel detached from reality right now. It doesn't happen all the time, but it happens a lot. I don't notice the shift right away, but after a while I'll notice it.

I feel like I'm not in control, like I'm watching from the back of my mind. I feel numb, tired, slow, and detached. It'll still laugh and joke, but I don't feel happy. It's like a feeling of numbing calmness all the time.

I don't hate feeling like this, it's comforting. I don't like feeling like this either though, it's lonely. It's almost as if I'm not entirely there. It's been happening for about five years.

I'll get random periods of numbness. When I first got them, they were short. Maybe about an hour or so, but now they last days, sometimes a week, at a time. It'll happen maybe once a month, last varrying times, and then leave.

Time becomes cloudy, memories feel like dreams, my body feels sluggish, my reaction time feels slow, but it's peaceful, calm. I don't feel a lot during these periods.

Most of the time it feels like a marky grey, it's unclear and numb. I know I've been using the word ""numb"" a lot, but that's the best way I can describe the feeling. I guess numb wouldn't be right though.

I still feel things, but there's still a numbness in the back brain. I don't know what is happening, based on the very limitted research I've done it sounds like depersonalization (don't know if I spelled that right)

I don't want to self diagnose, or even go see someone if this is normal. So, what do you guys think?",19Oct2020,1

A random user reached out to me and started helping out, by giving me advice and opened up to me about her own problems. She gave me a place to vent and someone to reach out to. 

Now I haven't been bulimic for the last 2 years (20 now), I did it solely from education and will which I'm proud of, because proper therapy is not accessible here. I started exercising, and educated myself alot about nutrition and physical health, I sometimes relapse, but very rarely (once a day every couple of months or so). And she definetly helped me alot. And I want to thank her, and talk to her. Oh Boi do I have alot of stories to tell her about (unfortunately not all are good).

42,"I’m a sophomore in High School, and I used to have a really good friend group. It consisted of probably 6-7 people, and we were best friends for about 7-8 years. One of the people in the group, who we’ll call G, was the Alpha. We didn’t work out as friends and he ended up basically socially bullying me out of my other friendships. He would invite every person in our group over to his house to sleepover every other week and he wouldn’t include me. I felt so upset because they were my only friends, and any time I invited those same people to sleepover at my place, they would deny it to go see him instead. It sent me to a bad depressed state, and I knew it was time to make new friends.

I’ve made some acquaintances at school, but none that I would consider an actual friend. It’s just sad because there isn’t a single person I know that would go out of their way to contact me and talk to me, as I would do for them or my old friends. 

Any activity I like to do, I have to do by myself. I used to paintball a lot with my older friends, but now I go by myself. I play video games, but no one I reach out to will play anything multiplayer with me. It’s just very disappointing. 

I’m a very very social person, and I like to get to know people and let them know I care, because helping others brings joy to my life, and not having that ability to spend time with others in conversation or just hanging out is making me really sad. 

I suffer from Anxiety and Depression, and sometimes I get very nervous and sad because I feel like no one wants to talk to me or be around me, even though I really try my best to be kind and thoughtful towards others.

51,"  My parents are great. I love them very much, they’re all I have besides my sibling— they care for me and treat me and my sibling well but,, I can’t help but worry this is a delusion...

  I’ve been touched and had my privacy invaded (more times than I can count) and humiliated a couple times by them.. My sibling has too, and they have sleep/darkness related anxiety and I’ve caught them hyperventilating because of fear when I’m not there to sleep in their bed. I fear they did something really bad to them and they have PTSD. 

  I did ask them abt it— they said it was from scary vids on YT + kid me jumping out to scare them a bunch. I’m scared they are lying.

Here is some more stuff I have been experiencing lately:

  I also experience some emotional numbness, saying “I love you” and being upfront abt fears and being vulnerable are things that I cannot stand. 

  I can’t be around people for too long either or it becomes too stressful (esp. men) and I have nightmares frequently. Most are violent or of sexual nature (breaching privacy, to actual assault), the last one I was choked out twice. 

I also feel very disconnected from reality and other people as well as myself.

  I get weird spikes of worry/fear/dread. Especially if I had seen something abt r*pe or sex, something of that sort.

  I have intrusive thoughts about harming myself and others, bashing someone’s head into a wall or desk, or a violent daydream where I get hurt really bad.

  I struggle with motivation and I feel tired and sluggish all the time, I feel unable and unworthy of feeling happiness at times.

  
  I wish I knew more about what my sibling struggled with, but I can’t get anything out of them. I’m so so worried— sometimes I’d rather abandon this reality in exchange to not perceive and exist. Nothing feels real.

She refused to listen when I said I was losing my eyesight, even went far enough to call me a liar. Come to find out I had swelling in my optic nerves (paps) due to Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension. Anyways. Then I got pregnant. Things were rocky but fine. Her new boyfriend started coming around and he was very aggressive (has threatened to shoot both me and my partner. He also stole my painkillers after I had brain surgery while pregnant) and when my daughter was born I had a falling out with her over him. I didn't want my newborn child around that for obvious reasons. 
Now, she comes over fairly frequently, and we have even offered to let her stay here (the only issue we had was with her boyfriend) and I still feel like she has control of my life. I panic when I know she is coming over (clean house, coffee ready, everybody act perfect), she makes comments regularly about my weight and exercising (not outright insults but still) even though I can barely move without getting dizzy and I'm on weight loss medicine and not even earing much, if she wants to go do something with me I HAVE to unless I want her to make me feel bad (example of this is a week after surgery i had to go to her birthday party and when I tried not to she threw a fit). I am always on edge because I feel like she's going to judge my life. No matter how hard I try. It all really hit me this morning when I tried to open up to her about my mental health and she acted like I don't have a reason to feel the way I do. I've never gotten that maternal warmth or whatever it's called from her. She acts surprised when I don't ask her to babysit but she's never available. I actually didn't even realize that she puts me down until it was pointed out to me because to me that's just her. And she's all the biological family I have close enough to see. Am I over reacting? I don't know if I explained this well. I'm very tired and my brain is being dumb.",19Oct2020,1
56,Hi. I'm a 21 year old dude from the Uk. Still never had a gf besides an online thing for 2 and a half years that didn't work out. I have no real experience with any girls or any confidence at all to approach any. I feel utterly hopeless as my life is just one bad thing to the next. I recently lost some of my closest friends due to an argument i tried to stay neutral in but I ended being shunned by my other friends for not going against another friend cause i didn't want to pick a side. My family often argue and fight and things get really scary sometimes. And I have so much anxiety that is really difficult to manage sometimes and holds me back alot. I'm incredibly lonely but at this point don't really feel like I deserve a gf because I would only hold them back with my anxieties.  I feel my phobia of planes makes it harder because most people want to go traveling and yet as  much as I wish I could I can't even do that. I've achieved very little. Completely failed school and only just managed to finally keep a part time job at a store at the start of this year and I don't know what the hell I want to do jobwise cause I just hate everything and I've tried so many and my anxiety makes things hard. The only real dreams I have would be to be an Internet personality and I'd like to try my hand at making music but I have no motivation to try and actually achieve my dreams cause I just always feel so hopeless.  I just feel like what am I even living for. I'm so utterly hopeless.  Nobody will ever love me cause I'm not worth anything.  I just play games and watch anime and that's it. I just wish I had a girl that would be there for me. I just wish that  I wasn't so afraid of everything and that I could travel the world with the person I love. But because I'm too afraid I'll just never amount to anything. I'll never achieve anything. Nobody will ever care for me. And one day the loneliness is just gonna become too much. I just don't know what to do. I don't expect any solution to this fat wall of text either. I just felt I wanted to express how I felt. Despite every problem I have if I just had that special someone to support me I feel I could somehow pull through. But I just have no hope it will ever happen. I think I'm fairly ok lookswise and I try my best to be a good guy.  But since there's nothing else going for me they just isn't any hope really.  I'm just a sad loser that only finds brief happiness in games and anime. I've truly had such a horrible year and I just don't things are gonna get better.,19Oct2020,1
57,"hi, i’ve never posted to reddit before but feel kinda at my end of people to talk to.

trigger warning: talk of self harm

i’m a man in his early 30s, my whole life i struggled with ptsd and depression and eventually later in life was diagnosed rapid cycle bipolar, for which i am on medication for. still i get these bouts of just worry, anxiety, and dread that just overcome me. it starts slow thinking people are upset with me then builds to this point i’m convinced everyone including my partner of 5 years hates me. then i feel just trapped by everyone’s hate, nowhere to go, and several times in my life i’ve just run off to be found wondering around aimlessly. 

it builds up and i start to think everyone hates me and i shake my arms if i’m walking, my whole body if i’m sitting. and the tension of the shaking and my body and the thoughts all just endlessly rev each other on, and always in these moments i’ve found the best way to kind of snap out of it is to self harm. in the past i use to cut myself a lot or punch myself which i still do often now.

and i guess, i just don’t know if other people
have anxiety/ptsd attacks like that where they just lose control and how they deal with it if they do. i feel my behavior like this, when i shake, seems so scary to others that it always pushes people away more and i’m so ashamed of it. i just don’t know how to stop it without more destructive paths.

i was seeing a therapist before covid hit then that fell to trying to do video calls which didn’t really work for me and then with work and stuff slowing down cause if it i couldn’t even really afford it anymore.

um, i don’t know what i expect, just want to know if anyone else deals with this too and how they manage.

thanks",19Oct2020,1

59,I’m pretty sure this issue to mental health but is it just me who can’t handle silence at all? Like my heart rate goes up and I hate every second of it so i’m always watching or having something in the background. I don’t know if it’s thoughts coming in or what but I can’t stand it,19Oct2020,1
60,"I don't know what to do. I don't know if I have a mental health disorder or not. But I cannot seek help from a professional because I don't want my parents to know and I can't afford it by myself because I'm still a student.

I just want to know if I need to seek professional help or if I'm just thinking too much. This is how I feel.

1. I have thoughts about physically hurting people. I feel always on edge because I don't want to snap and do something bad.
2. I don't feel anything, literally nothing. I can only feel intense emotions, like anger, sadness, excitement.
3. I had episodes (few) of extreme sadness. They come out of nowhere. I'm alone in my room then I'll start to get really, really, really sad. Then i'll start crying in the corner. But I can't point out the ""source"" of my sadness.
4. It's hard for me to meditate because I get scared, of what I don't really know... but sometimes I'm scared that if I open my eyes a ghost is in front of my face, sometimes I'm scared that I might go to another dimension or might not wake up.
5. I have thoughts about killing my self. But I have dreams and ambitions and I want to achieve them, so I might not actually kill my self but the thought is there. I have acted on the thought oftentimes but I stop at the last minute. I think I might not actually kill my self but I always think about it more than once a week.
6. I self-harmed when I was a teenager. But I only did it because it made me feel something. Puberty is a difficult for everybody, so I self-harmed because I couldn't handle how difficult it was.
7. I used drugs and I drank too much. Not anymore though. When I met my current boyfriend (of 5 years), I stopped doing drugs and drinking too much.
8. It's hard for me to fall asleep. The darkness and the silence terrify me. I have to turn the lights on and funny videos to take my mind off things.
9. I get a very bad headache when I am angry or sad.
10. I feel like I'm choking. Like my neck is literally choking me. Sometimes I feel like something is trapped in my neck. It's weird.
11. It's hard for me to maintain deep friendship. I feel like all friendship I have are very shallow. They don't really know me... not one of them. I can be a very social person if I want to. I know so many people and I have ""neutral"" relationships. But it's hard for me to really connect with them emotionally.
12. Although I can be social when I want to, I sometimes just go off the grid because I find it hard to deal with people. I just don't have the energy for it. I don't want to deal with anybody, I don't want to talk to anybody, I don't want to hear from anybody. I don't want to respond to any text or email. Basically a subtle ""fuck off"".
13. I sometimes feel like my heart is going to explode. I know how to calm my self but I feel like it's going to explode. Once I had that episode when my sister was around, I made her put her hand over my chest and she was terrified because she thought I was palpitating too much, she wanted to call an ambulance. But like I said, I am able to calm my self down with water and Advil.
14. I get overwhelmed sometimes. It happens rarely but I had my worst episode last year. I was walking out of the mall. It was 2 weeks before Christmas so there were so many people and I felt overwhelmed. I couldn't breath, I started feeling faint, and I literally lost my way. It was a mall I frequent. I couldn't get a ride. The buses looked full to me. It was a scary experience. I was confused. I sat down the sidewalk for almost an hour til I was able to gather myself.
15. I can't focus or concentrate, unless what I'm doing is a repetitive task or something that does not require advance cognitive processes. I actually have good grades, from a good school, the girl who's ""on to something great""... but it's actually very hard for me to focus and concentrate. My mind is everywhere. Random thoughts intrude my mind. I have to try really hard to concentrate.

I don't know if what I'm feeling is normal. I'm worried but I don't know what to do.

I hope you can help me how to manage what I'm going through.",19Oct2020,1

62,"in my childhood...

I have been involved in many car crashes, 

almost drowned and died 3 times, 

fell off a skateboard going 25 miles an hour holding on to my friends car and fell super hard on the back of my head, 

I also lived in a warzone and been close to over 40 explosions. Car bombs, air strikes, rockets, rpgs, tank attacks. saw people severely hurt by explosions, bleeding, missing arms and legs, stacked one on top of the other in the back of pickup trucks being rushed to the hospitals, 

I’ve been stuck in an exchange of fire between marines in humvees with mounted machine guns and insurgents with ak47s .The marines didn’t know where the insurgents were so they were shooting anything that moved.

witnessed a rocket hit our neighbors apartment and their middle aged mother came out screaming and crying her heart out because her son died in a very traumatic incident where a rocket landed in their living room killing her son, 

saw a homeless man I knew laying dead in the corner of the street we lived on as we were driving out,

I also had many frightening experiences being super high on marijuana with a group of ghetto high school kids being stuck with them while they were driving super fast and me panicking feeling like we were gonna crash and die

Been jumped by a group of ghetto kids and getting my nose broken,

When I was 5 years old I was at my moms friends house and I opened the kitchen door and went out in their garden and their guard dog which they used to abuse, saw me, barking and running towards me. I froze in my place and started crying thinking I’m gonna die and at the last second my moms friend ran and lifted me up before the dog was able to get to me,

When I was also about 5 years old I went to get circumcised and I woke up from anesthesia shortly after the operation was done and remember feeling excruciating pain and I was screaming

When I was in high school my friend came to my house not feeling well and almost died from an overdose on 2 strips of suboxon and plenty of Xanax. He fell on the ground unconscious and I ran to him slapping him on the face screaming “wake up!” then He opened his eyes. My mom came to the house and was yelling at me because of the mess and I was in shock then I told her that my friend is very sick and about to die. I kicked a hole in the wall and I started crying. Then she called an ambulance and he was treated.

I was in a GMC car traveling on the highway when a convoy of marines started shooting at the car.

On one day in Iraq, me and my cousin went to play and my little brother followed us then a big loud explosion happened nearby and cars started to panic and he got hit by a car. A kid came up to me and said “your brother got hit by a car. He’s at the nearby hospital.” so me and my cousin ran to the hospital and saw him in the operation room with his face bleeding and we started crying. He got hit in the face and lost his front tooth.

I have many more traumatic incidents happen in my life but I don’t want this post to be too long.

All the stuff in the warzone was between when I was 7 to 10 years old in Baghdad, Iraq. The other stuff was during high school in the US.

65,"I have a shitty memory, plain and simple. 

I’ll ask my boyfriend something 2-3 times in a day and not remember his answer, or often even asking in the first place. He’ll sometimes say things like “dude were you even listening” when I was and just can’t remember what he said. I try and listen, I try and remember, but my brain is just fucking dumb I guess. I also repeat stories a lot because I’ll have no idea if I’ve told them before.

We built a small Minecraft village together with only about 5 buildings, a small wheat farm, and a cow area. I’ve been playing on it for hours everyday for about a week, and I still get lost and have trouble finding certain places each time. Chests also fuck me up because we have like 8 throughout the world, and it’s hard to know what goes where.

I wish I could remember things easier so I could be a better listener and a less obnoxious person.  I can tell after 9 months of dealing with my memory shenanigans that my boyfriend is starting to seem pretty annoyed. 

I get enough sleep at night and I don’t have any known health issues that affect memory in any major way. If it helps I’m 16M, diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder, and currently taking Lexapro. I’ve experimented with marijuana and alcohol in the past but only a couple occasions.

68,"So for context I probably have OCD (the bad/clinical kind) and get intrusive thoughts, but I also get intrusive memories. These memories are usually of something bad or stupid (or both) I did at some point in my life, and if things went differently, I probably could have ended up dead or maimed or suffered a blow to my reputation (i.e. could have resulted in disappointing a ton of people close to me). To give an example:

A few months ago, I was trying to fix a toaster with a **metal** fork while it was plugged into the outlet (long story). I quickly realized what I was doing was dumb and gave up. For a fair amount of the rest of the day I was thinking ""hoo boy that was DUMB I could have gotten roasted etc."" but (eventually) got back into my normal routine. Today I heard from someone that their friend was doing something dumb with a toaster and I was immediately brought back to the feelings of fear that I felt that day (even going so far to search online if I could have survived a current arc if my fork hit a crucial part of it, as well as posting here).

The thing is it's not like I have an irrational fear of toasters (my roommate was using one just today and I didn't run away), and for other memories it's not like I was worried at the moment I was doing said stupid thing (I've been fine, maybe even happy, in the moment, and it's sometimes taken months, perhaps even years for the sheer stupidity to register). One could argue that this is some form of PTSD but it's not like I was in a warzone or a car accident for any of these feelings to register, so does it even count as trauma if I'm at least a couple of degrees removed from immediate danger? Does anyone go through anything similar and/or have tips to deal with this?",19Oct2020,1
69,"I was not a normal child.

I had an extremely rare condition that made me grow a lot faster than other kids, which made me look older than I was. This caused people to constantly get frustrated with me and start yelling at me to, ""act your age!!!""

My father abused me. I won't sugarcoat it. He hit, screamed, swore, harassed- everything. This made interactions with adults extremely hard. This also turned me into a goody two-shoes that apologized all the time in order to prevent myself from being hurt. 

I also made attachments to objects. Erasers, nail polish bottles, dice- just the weirdest things that would somehow make me feel safe. I didn't have many friends, so these were like my friends to me.




I started liking certain toys and cartoons way too late to be socially acceptable.




I started watching My Little Pony when I was seven, and kind of... aged in reverse? I don't know what to call it. I bought a crap ton of toys, memorized every song, animatic, fan video, toy review, bought all of the comics, watched every episode, and I still did that up until it ended.

The Shopkins craze? I was a part of that too.

I became invested in Monster High dolls at, maybe 12, up until the reboot. 

I became invested in Pokémon.

I just recently started watching Avatar: The Last Airbender, and am just about ready to start buying merch.

But, I just realized something. I'm as old as Suki and Sokka, and act like I'm still seven.

TW/ suicidal thoughts 

I am a 17 y/o senior in high school. I’ve never really been super good at keeping up with my grades. My GPA is really low. (last i checked it was a 2.6 and that was at the beginning of my junior year—i’m too scared to look now.) however, i was doing fairly well for the first few weeks of school this year. it was pretty easy since it’s all online now due to covid stuff. but now it’s fall, and i’m failing multiple classes at a time just like i always used to. it’s all because of missing work. all it takes is one late assignment and then i’m just STUCK. i don’t know where to start and so i just procrastinate...and then all of the assignments build up. 

to make matters worse, all of my friends have been posting their college acceptance letters on their instagram stories, and it makes me feel really bad about myself. I’m already so awful at school, and i really don’t think i want to go to college. it just seems too hard. i don’t want to pay thousands of dollars just to do more school. i’m already so stressed nowadays, i cry myself to sleep like 3-4 times a week thinking about all of the assignments that i’ve yet to do. i’m actually typing this up after my worst cry session yet. 

i’m just so, so, so very scared. i don’t know what i want in my life and i don’t feel like i’m ready to be an adult yet. i feel so stupid compared to all of my friends, who have perfect grades &amp; are involved in sports and theatre and whatever. they have interests and extracurriculars and the ability to produce perfect essays before a deadline. i feel like i can’t do anything. i feel like i’m a waste of a human. i just feel so incredibly fucking stupid. 

i don’t see myself living as an adult. i don’t know how i could exist as any version of myself other than this sad, stupid, scared little high schooler. why don’t i just do my fucking work? why am i so lazy? what if i don’t graduate? what if i don’t go to college? 

sometimes i think to myself, “just suck it up! stop being so whiny and just DO your WORK!” but then i open up my school app thing and i just...can’t. it’s too overwhelming. i give up and have a whole crying session every. single. time. i’m so frustrated with myself! this is why i feel like i’m too stupid to exist. 

so yeah, what if i don’t go to college? i don’t want to end up a bum, depending on my parents for the rest of my life. so i have to. i absolutely have to go to college and that FACT makes me have suicidal thoughts. i have no choice. i HAVE to go to college. i HAVE to spend thousands of dollars just stressing myself out even more than i already am. if i don’t go, i will be a failure of a human. even though i’ve heard people say that’s not true, it’s still so ingrained in my mind. it’s what all of my friends say, it’s what my s/o says, it’s what their parents say, it’s what my parents say, the idea just SURROUNDS me. but i don’t want to go. i have no choice. when i think about this, i sometimes think about how i would rather die. (i’ve been having a lot of these thoughts lately. i know it’s not good but i’m too scared to tell my parents because my dad is currently out of a job so asking for a doctor/counselor seems wrong)

everything just seems so hard. i don’t want the responsibilities of being an adult yet. i don’t think i’m ready. i just wish i had more time. but i don’t, and it’s coming, and i’m fucking terrified.",19Oct2020,1

86,"(Long post)

I have several mental illnesses, so it’s hard for me to differentiate between new/worsening symptoms at times, but lately it’s been very bizarre...

By the way, for some context, I’m in the US. Important to mention since I’ll be discussing the pandemic. At the beginning of the pandemic, my anxiety was pretty high. At first, in February, I was terrified. I then got angry at the constant news stories about it, and eventually decided to tell everyone not to mention coronavirus to me at all: no jokes, mentions, news articles, nothing. But one of my friends slipped up and sent me an article about how the first “presumed positive” case had made its way into my state. I panicked.

March 9th was my last day at college. I refused to go back after this day, and just days later it was announced that the college would be closing anyway and classes would now be online. But I still remember that day. I was on my phone after class, waiting for a friend to meet me so we could hang out. I stupidly looked up updates on the person who was in my state that fell ill with COVID. I started to panic. It suddenly felt like the room was closing in on me. The noise became overwhelming. I felt really hot. I wanted my parents. I wanted to go home. A horrible, intense wave of pure and utter hopelessness, helplessness, uncertainty and horror washed over me. I tensed up. I felt like I needed to run. I felt the urge to pace back and forth, so I got up and decided to walk around the student store; nobody would notice I was pacing if I was just walking around the store, they’d just assume I was looking around.

I actually came down with COVID-like symptoms just days later. Let me tell you, it was a horrible experience. If I did have it and that was a mild case, I can’t even begin to imagine what a severe case would feel like.

My fears were inconsolable, and I’d pace back and forth in my house asking my parents questions nobody could answer. “When is it gonna end?” “This is only gonna be for a few days, right? It’s gonna just go away right?” “When can we go out again?” 
Even ridiculous questions like “Is this gonna wipe out humanity?”

I’d ask for updates every day. I was afraid to look at the numbers myself. I also experienced some denial. Let me make this very clear: I have a DEEP, INTENSE hatred for anti-maskers and other “covidiots” who believe it’s a hoax or downplay it. At no point did I ever vocalize my denial. My denial wasn’t like “yeah, it doesn’t exist, screw quarantine.” Quite the opposite, actually. My denial came in the form of “this can’t be happening, and it ISN’T happening. It’ll go away within a few days. It’ll be fine.” I consciously lied to myself in an attempt to make myself feel better.

And then I got angry. Well, not just angry. I experienced pure, unadulterated RAGE. But who was to blame? My mind desperately searched for someone to blame. And I did come up with someone to blame: the person who brought it to the US. I wasn’t thinking clearly, so I thought what happened was someone went to China and then came back carrying the virus, intentional or not. It’s much more straightforward to be mad at a single person than it is to be mad at the world in general. Whenever I heard bad news about covid, I’d yell, “who the FUCK brought it to the US?!?! Who fucking did it?!?!?! I fucking hate them so much!!! Fuck them!!!!”

(Oh yeah, maybe I should also mention one of my mental illnesses is Borderline Personality Disorder, sooo my emotions are heightened. One of my many challenges is managing my anger.)

The anger is still there. So is the fear. I’ve experienced so many weird things since the pandemic began: sadness, anger, guilt, denial, confusion, fear, irritability, paranoia, hypervigilance, tension, frustration, restlessness, hopelessness, helplessness, dissociation, avoidance, numbness, disbelief, fatigue, apathy, particularly extreme angry outbursts, inability to cry but eventually having random inconsolable crying fits, and others.

I began to have nightmares every night. Every time I fell asleep, I’d have a nightmare. Sometimes they were just random nightmares, but usually they revolves around the virus itself (being exposed to it, coming down with it, losing someone to it, forgetting to wear a mask, etc), medical things, death and destruction. To this day I experience nightmares pretty much every time I go to sleep.

I’ve developed severe agoraphobia. I refuse to go anywhere unless absolutely necessary such as required doctor visits. Other than that, I refuse to go anywhere. Before the pandemic, I was always hanging out with my friends. Not anymore! I haven’t seen them in person since the beginning of the pandemic. My parents encouraged me to hang out with my friends, even if we both wore masks and social distanced, but I flatly refused. All of a sudden, the world became an especially scary place with no good at all whatsoever in my mind. I felt like something terrible would happen the second I left the house. I’m still mentally in March/April when it was complete lockdown except for grocery trips, doctor visits, essential jobs, etc. and it’s weird seeing people on social media seeming to go about their lives. I’ve been in quarantine since March 11th. Over 7 months. It’s so bad that I had a dream where I was at a restaurant, but I considered that to be a nightmare rather than a random dream because of the possible health consequences of going to a restaurant right now.

Not only have I been refusing to see people, but I’ve also been psychologically distancing myself. I don’t really text anyone unless they text first. I’m isolating in every sense of the word and pushing people away.

Just a few weeks ago, my parents were watching mass (church) on TV. I saw that the people there were wearing masks and social distancing, and that’s absolutely fantastic but the imagery got to me for some reason. I excused myself because I found it to be...I dunno, heartbreaking? It’s heartbreaking that we have to social distance and wear masks because this virus is going around fucking killing everyone. Like I said, I hate everyone who refuses to comply or downplays the seriousness, but actually seeing people doing that is such a foreign concept to me (another reason why I don’t wanna go out, because I don’t wanna see my loved ones in face masks because I guess there’s still some denial going on in my head and I suppose seeing loved ones in masks would pop that little bubble of denial). I rushed out of the room and ran to the bathroom, where I burst into tears. It just all hit me hard. I can’t explain it. I literally cried over seeing people doing what they’re supposed to. I guess my mind still didn’t wanna accept the situation.

The images of healthcare workers in hazmat suits, people lining up around grocery stores at the beginning of the pandemic when everyone was panic-buying toilet paper and stuff, images of dead bodies in hospitals, clips of covid patients twitching/struggling to breathe/falling and suddenly dying, descriptions of how covid patients die scared and alone feeling like they’re drowning - and nobody can do anything to help - and/or experiencing ICU delirium, and patients on stretchers surrounded by workers in hazmat suits are all burned into my mind. Whenever I hear a certain word, all those images come rushing back: words like coronavirus, covid19, pandemic, quarantine, etc etc etc.

Now I’m dealing with brain fog and other things. I feel really stressed. I don’t know what the hell is going on with my head.

Sorry this was so long. I highly doubt anyone actually read this, but if you did, thank you so much. I don’t even know how to do a tl;dr on this, lol",19Oct2020,1
87,"Most of the time I can pretend to feel ok and I even fool myself, but right now I just need to get it all off my chest. I can’t even express everything in enough detail to do it justice, but here it is.

Me. Selfish, uncaring, a wolf in very innocent sheep’s clothing. A taker. Someone who acts charming, weak and innocent just to get attention from others without having to do anything in return.

I’m a very quiet person. Too quiet. When I was little I was labeled as shy and people said I would grow out of it. I didn’t. If anything it’s worse. If I went to a psychologist, they would probably say I have social anxiety. That’s fine. But I feel like it’s more complicated than that.

I really have a problem with avoidance. I avoid talking to people more than necessary, I really dislike signing birthday cards etc., I dislike buying gifts. I don’t do nice things for people. I don’t always text people back. I’m awful at staying in touch. I procrastinate on paperwork and adult business. There are many things I should do that I don’t. How can I accept kindness when I give so little? How can I be in society when I’m such a poor participant? I have emotionally isolated myself even though I’m around people every day. 

The shame I feel for being this way is made worse by the fact that I am so much like my dad. He’s an awful selfish sh*t (even though he’s charming to people who don’t know him well), very quiet, has a nasty skeleton in his closet and is the reason my parents marriage has been a disaster for more than 25 years. My parents have always fought and I had to listen to my mom talk about all his faults. I feel like I’m looking at my future. I imagine that people will someday feel about me the way they do him, if they don’t already. 

I just feel like a very flawed person. I put on a happy face, but my mind can be very negative. And I am the most negative about the person I’m closest to. I live with my mom, and she loves me so much. But our personalities are so different. She talks too much for me, and it’s a daily point of friction. She’s more tidy and also more organized with time than me and I get annoyed. But she’s not doing anything wrong. I end up being snappy with her when she doesn’t deserve it. It’s like I’m trying to push her away like I do everyone else.

I wish I could either not need people, or want to be better. But it’s always a battle. I do need people. I get lonely and want affection. But honestly I don’t want to learn to do all the things that make me so deeply uncomfortable. It doesn’t help that I don’t know how. I don’t share my emotions, and they all swirl around until they ooze or explode out. I feel anger, guilt, shame, sadness and pain but I don’t know how to live any other way. I feel like a special kind of “invisible” bad person that no one should love. I wish I wasn’t born as me.

91,"Hi there,

I've been wondering what people's thoughts were regarding mental health in academia and specifically if there's really a chance for it to improve. 

About myself: I study and teach mathematics and I struggle with bipolar II. I find this hard in two ways. As a student, I feel like having a personality or mood disorder is almost romanticized/glorified and that I should embrace who I am, when that can be really destructive. As a teacher, I feel like it's not okay to be unstable---like I have to make extra sure I present to my students someone who can and will be focused on their success, which just adds a terrible pressure on me to pretend.

But this is just me. But I know also that many people in academia who struggle with their mental health experience similar things or feel stuck in the way I do or in different ways, whatever and however, and I'd really appreciate it if anybody was willing to share their thoughts, opinions, experiences, references, hopes for the future of academia, etc. Do people see change to come? Are there forms of strengthening mental health in academia?",19Oct2020,1

I'm an 18 year old guy from London who's suffering with Anxiety and Depression and often feel like I wish I had more people to talk about this with so I thought it'd be nice to make a group chat on Snapchat for teens (14-20) to discuss mental health problems like Anxiety, Depression, Eating Disorders. It'll also just be a nice support network where we can help each other, make friends and be there for one another. Just thought it would be nice to have somewhere we can all talk, instead of having to post on this Reddit where replies can be a bit hit and miss. If you don't want to talk about your problems, it'd also be nice to have some members that just want to listen and talk to the others and help.

It'll be English speaking only for ease of conversation. Trolling/harmful jokes won't be tolerated.

Please DM me with some information about you (such as age, location, your MH issues) and your Snapchat and I'll begin making the group.

I don't have sweat flashes , anger issues, or hand shaken ( except when I'm playing battle royal games 😄 ) , sometimes I have difficulty controlling my anxiety and I try to use logical thinking and it helps (most) of the time and I have insomnia but I'm on week two of sleeping schedule and I'm doing fine. I tend to worry about things. What worries me a LOT is whether if I'm going to sleep tonight easy or not , and health issues like my scoliosis or for ex when I stepped on barnacles and I checked the internet if its toxic or not and even that it not toxic , I was still worried.
Sometimes I worry -but not much- about the future since I'm not optimistic about it, will I'm going to find a lovely wife soon for example or financials issues mine is bad. Most of worries disappear when I'm busy working or playing video games. But every time I think what if I have GAD and I didn't know it? What I will do? How it will effects me? bla bla bla my anxiety increases and I have troubles enjoying life , so I want to settle this once and hopefully for all .... Can you please help me ?",19Oct2020,1

I don't know WHY it's like this; but, it seems creative endeavors are riddled with difficult days. I run a small YouTube [channel](http://amanbansil.com) (personal finance) and my videos don't usually do that well (so far)...but today's upload really got to me because I work on these videos pretty long (sometimes working through the night...); it takes a while to come up with ideas, to script them out, to record, edit...etc...and having it land on deaf ears (i.e. a very low play count) is hard sometimes.

I'm trying to think like Gary Vee who says ""publish and forget it"" - It's really really tough to do. Especially because part of the job is to go back and look at your videos and see where people are dropping off and make improvements.

&amp;#x200B;

I also make music and I've seen similar situations in that field where you'll spend so much time on a song and it lands but has almost no plays.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that this is how it is and that there is a ton of content and exposure is difficult to get...but, it is hard as heck to deal with the struggle. Also, if you aren't a person who makes content like this - pls give your fav content creator a nice comment here and there. We can all use some more positivity

95,"My partner of 5+ years has lots of behavioral and mental idiosyncrasies. She hides them very well, and is able to suppress or ignore them for the most part around other people.

They rarely escalate beyond minor irritation - a discomfort I'd equate to ""finger nails on a chalkboard"" - but I can tell it's makes some every day situations exhausting.

For context - it's stuff like symmetry of touch, 'invisible threading' of movement around her, incomplete patterns or disruption of routine.

Again, almost never intrusive to be inhibiting. She'll need to spin back around the ""correct"" way, or need me to touch the other hand when I brush one on accident.

I don't know if it's being in lockdown with less time for her to reset and recharge - or if it's just me being in proximity with her that's made me notice - but it seems like it's an exhausting burden.

(FWIW She recent took a self admin YBOCS diagnostic because we've discussed it a bit and scored a 16.)

96,"I'm a woman in my mid, almost late twenties. I've done literally nothing with my life. I know everyone says this but it actually would be easier for people after the inital sadness if I was gone. My parents have enough to worry about with my disabled brother. My partner wouldn't be stuck in a job he hates because he has to financially support me. I feel like he hates my guts. We rarely have good days anymore. He's so down that even he wants to die but if I was out of the picture all of his big stresses would go. He doesn't want to break up, I've already brought up that idea. I'm sure he just feels stuck and responsible for me because we've been together for almost 9 years.

I have very little friends and they all have people they consider best friends. The person I would consider mine doesn't even live in the same state as me, we've never met. So I mean her life really wouldn't change much. My dog would be sad. My dog is the biggest reason I'm still around. At the end of the day, it's a dog not a child though. It's really not going to notice after some time. I would go to friends or family about my thoughts but I'm tired of hearing the same things. Like it get's better or they're here for me. It does nothing, it means nothing. And no, my mental illnesses have gotten worse with age.
I guess I came here for the anonymity and I'm not sure what I'm asking for. Obviously no one is going to give me advice on ending my life, that would be ridiculous and I don't even have the energy for that anymore. I used to when I was younger but the nerve just isn't there I guess. I have been thinking about just leaving. Like walking out my door and just crossing my fingers something happens. Like maybe someone hits me with their car. But I kinda don't want to even be that burden. I'd rather have not existed.

97,"Hi, My name is L and I decided to hop on here since I don’t think anybody else will help. I am in fact a 12 year old who....isn’t entirely like most kids, I am mentally mature to the point I almost forget how old I am. Life is tough for most, and so is it for me. So why not vent, and get some advice in return.

The start.
I don’t remember much of when I was younger, I have some memories but all were bad, I don’t try to remember anymore, it’s not like I’ll know what happened months later. 
A lot of my mental problems are caused by my family, a lot of my family is racist and almost all are trump supporters. But that’s just extra info I guess. I love my parents but recently I just stopped thinking they do, all I do is waste their money. My mom is stressed and my dad is in debt. I’ve stopped feeling like I belong here. It’s not like what we do will change anything. I can feel sad a lot but I don’t ever tell anyone, I don’t want to be a burden to anyone. Every once in a while I’ll feel normal, basically every day. But then I just feel sad again, I feel paranoid and useless. I know I shouldn’t feel this way but I do, I’m a kid but I don’t really have much to do. I constantly feel guilt, like I mentioned before, my mother is stressed. But even if I feel such bad guilt for her, she cheated on my dad and acted like nothing was wrong, hell, I still see that guy since she’s still  dating him. But I know she probably doesn’t like me anyway, it’s hard to love someone when you feel like they caused the issues. I try to hug her and tell her that I love her but I feel this thought at the back of my mind telling me to just tell her how many problems she caused me. If I don’t text her back she’ll say that I don’t like her, and that I don’t wanna be with her. But I also have some problems with my dad too, not as much though since our bond has become stronger due to the divorce. A year ago when my mom told us it wasn’t going to work out I was supposed to be sad. But I just didn’t feel anything, I didn’t feel sad, I just felt normal. Like she was telling me the time of  day or something.

Anyway, on to the more personal mental problems, there’s been times where I’ve even thought of myself as a phsycopath, I don’t experience many emotions but when I do they last hours at most, I’ll feel sad at some point no matter what i do. Besides, I often like talking about killing people, it often makes me laugh or I often feel happy bringing other people’s emotions down, I am aware that I do things like that so I often force myself to feel what others to feel. But quite honestly, I don’t feel sad when I should, normally I would just find it funny. And sometimes I talk to myself, well, kinda... it’s more like I talk to a made up person in my mind, I think he has a British accent but it could be wrong, I call him Daniel. He’s like my rhyme and reason, kinda like my therapist almost. But rather than that, that’s pretty much as I want to share unless I HAVE to share more, but I kinda doubt it. 

Sorry if this makes no sense, I’ve been contemplating doing this for a while but I often times don’t know how to put my thoughts on paper, or write it down
Btw, I identify as a boy if that may help I guess..

98,"Hey there, I recently was on here for my twin sister who I was worried about. Well I wrote something in my Diary and thought I should put it on her as a way to vent.

WARNING: WILL MENTION ABUSE AND BRIEF MENTION OF BEING USED SEXUALLY!

   When I was younger my brother used me sexually. He was around 12...I was 5. He would play sex fantasies with me like house and doctor. He once made me dress in a pink skirt with no bottom so we could ""have a better time"". I have had a sex drive since the age of 7. I don't see him much anymore, when me and my sisters told our parents they said it sounded coached. I have also been abused by my twin sister. She would beat me with the broken end of a red broom and lock me in a dark closet until I promised not to tell. She is better now. I thought it was normal, as long as it made them happy, I was happy. We have moved a lot and I was being bullied more and more whether it was for my skin color (I am native), or my family's income, or cause I was different. Until the 3rd grade I wet the bed every night and was forced to wear pull-ups. My sister told everyone at school and my family picked on me for it. Sometimes I pretend to be younger than I actually am, I wrap myself up in blankets and pretend to be held and bottle fed. It brings me comfort.

   Lately, I have been feeling myself slip away. I think the worst in situations, I leave my body for a few seconds. One time I was outside and I froze in place, next thing I knew a man (sometimes when this happens the man has white face) shoots my dog and tries stabbing me, I screamed. I snapped out of it to see I was standing in the same spot, I hadn't screamed, there was no man, my dog was fine, no one even knew anything had happened to me. I recently have been having minor hallucinations, like faces watching me through windows. I have become paranoid, thunder and loud booming sounds scare me cause I think The world is ending. I am scared of the dark,small spaces,car rides, random dogs, new people, loud noises, going places, and some other stuff. Sometimes i feel numb, it's like I don't have emotions. Sometimes my dad might be mad at me and is giving me a lecture, suddenly everything except for him is black, it's like he has an outline, his voice sounds odd to me and I have this weird sensation in my body. 

   When I was 11 we were moving and my parents had left me with my older sister, her friend and my other sister. She was mad and I said something she didn't like, next thing I know I am slammed into a storage locker and I hit the door, she then hit me really hard. Afterwards she apologized and said she couldn't help it. I ended up forgiving her soon after, because she had an excuse...her mental health. Around a year ago my family was living with my grandparents, I tried on some boys clothes in a goodwill that matched my masculinity. She embarrassed me in front of everyone by saying I was a girl and that I looked like a boy, she screamed about how she refused to buy me boys clothes. When I went home she gave me another lecture. The next day I came back from my first day of school and to have my grandpa say to me and I quote ""if you ever think about wanting a dick between your legs, i will shoot you in the head, you understand?"" I lost my hope of them ever respecting me in that way.

   I am scared everyday, for me and my family's safety. My mom is just getting worse (chronic illnesses and cancer) and I am not ready to lose her. My sister just turned 18 and wants to start her own family now, she wants a lot of children with her husband. I don't want to have to get rid of my dog, or change the way I am. I am only 13 years old and still have a long road ahead of me. Maybe someday I will find closure, or maybe get better mental health resources like therapy.

100,"To give some context, I'm a college student with a dual major in physics and mechanical engineering, this entire semester has been online for us and the absence of people around was crushing me, I tried to keep it out of my mind and focus on getting better grades, I tried really hard, I gave my best effort and yet I came up at just average and I have been led to understand that 85% of the class is cheating, yeah you heard me right 85%, they made a discord server to discuss the answers, it's a class of 212 and 185 of them are on the server. 

The admin decided that since they don't want students slacking off they'd increase our workload, the mechanical engineering department decided to take it one step further and put a test for each day of the week from Monday to Saturday. 

If it isn't obvious enough already this workload is over-whelming, I have trouble sleeping, I have trouble waking up. To at least stay at average I have to work my butt off, which means almost 14-16 hours of screen time a day. My parents aren't helpful, they want me to get 'full' marks in everything, typical Asian parent for you there, and since I don't get full very often they always end up disappointed in me, I was ok with their reactions when I was 600km away from them, since I had other people around me, but recently these comments are taking a toll on me, the same way it used to before I left for college. 

When I hear the same thing from them over and over again, it slowly starts to make me think that maybe it's true, maybe I'm not doing enough, and it kills me to think that way, I'm constantly tired no matter what day of the week it is and I can't even think straight anymore. I think I caught a fever about 3 times in the last 2 months, I didn't want to take rest or sleep early, so I got some paracetamol and kept going.

I have one other issue unrelated to all this, I struggle with my body-image, I hate how I look, I get fat so fast, I just have to eat 3 small meals a day and not exercise for at least an hour a day, I gain weight. My first semester on campus I starved myself for weeks with just one meal a day late at night, I was about 10 kgs overweight, and I lost 20 kgs by starving, I was horribly tired all day, my mental health deteriorated a lot but my parents thought I looked good when I came back. Since then I found a good friend who makes sure I don't harm my self this way, she kept me on track with a healthy diet and a healthy weight and was a proper friend to me, unfortunately the online semester is keeping us apart and the loneliness is making me hate myself a lot, I talk to her over a video call everyday but it doesn't help as much, rest assured I would've spiraled much faster if she wasn't there.",19Oct2020,1
101,She doesn't care I told her I'd probably be dead by now but I'm scared of death she says I'm fakeing it and I need to stop being over dramatic she thinks just cause we're finachally stable I have no reason to be sad but I don't wanna tell her I feel this way because I feel alone and like nobody cares about me cause it's pretty much true and she keeps saying everything is her fault I mean sometimes it kind of is but I don't want to tell her cause it would probably make her more mad at me or something.and I literally keep telling her I want help and I wanna see a therapist and she won't take me like I don't like feeling this way and it comes and goes and I just want it to go and I've researched depression and anxiety and I have all the sighs of both I just want someone to tell me I'm not crazy or over dramatic.but I might just be over dramatic who knows,19Oct2020,1
102,"I’ll start this by saying I’ve dealt with hallucinations of all sorts in the past. I’ve had a visit with a psychiatrist and they said they’re related to my anxiety or something like that. But today I had one of the most vivid hallucinations I’ve had. I was just scrolling through memes on Instagram and I start hearing what sounds like a neighborhood barbecue. Like a lot of people talking, and pretty loud, it sounded as if they are outside of my house. I kept listening and I heard a distinct “I know right” followed by a laugh. The voice sounded like a drunk middle aged white lady. This went on for maybe 5 minutes. When it stopped I went to my window and saw nobody outside in the neighborhood, there’s no way they could have cleaned up in the mere seconds it took for me to get to the window. I’ve been freaking out about it because my hallucinations went away for months and I’m afraid they’re returning way worse.",19Oct2020,1

I get so anxious about the most irrational and impossible things, yet I’m convinced that whatever I’m anxious about is going to happen.

Lately I’ve been looking at pictures of myself from a year ago and crying because I look so fat and ugly and I’m mad nobody told me how ugly and fat I was and I’m ashamed of myself for even thinking I looked good at that time. That’s when my depression was at its lowest for me and it’s been still low since then. And I have to do things a certain way or I’m convinced I’ll die. For example, I have to lock my car three times. I have to pump the soap three times. I have to wiggle the locked door knob three times. And if I don’t then I’m genuinely convinced that I’ll either die or something bad will happen to me.

107,"I was just pretty deep in thought and I had a question that I wondered was even answerable. It’s clear to me that everybody on the planet has a purpose, and everybody can do something or be something great if they just try. Making your own name go down in history is something that can be achieved by anybody if they put the work and effort in. But that leads me to the question, what’s the point? No doubt there are people who will never be forgotten, but someday the human race will tear itself apart and nobody will be left to remember you. Nothing happens after you die, and most people who are on the brink feel peace because they know they made some sort of impact and will have people in their life to carry their story with them. But what does it matter to find peace in death this way if you will ultimately cease to exist in any way at some point. Working to make an impact in a world just seems pointless if that impact won’t have any permanent effect. So why even try?

Issues keep piling up and I can’t keep going on like this. I’m only eighteen and life has just been trauma after trauma after trauma. I know I’m being a brat and other people have it worse, but it sucks. It really sucks.

How do I even begin to start? I’m just gonna list some of what’s been going on. 

Chronic illness and all the issues that come with it, including being at home for two years, being isolated from my peers, losing years of memory, pain, doctors not taking me seriously, etc. Then there’s being trans, rocky relationship with parents (partially due to being sick), sexual harassment, repressed memories combining with facts about the past that paint the not so pretty picture that I might be a victim of CSA, the aftermath of being groomed by a trusted friend, having to drop out of high school because I’m so sick.... I just want to live a decent life. Please. Let me be a kid.

I don’t know where to go or what to do. I have a therapist, I’ve tried *multiple* therapists, but they haven’t been helpful. It’s hard to find a therapist who specializes in even three of my main issues, let alone all of them. I’ve tried coping mechanisms. Distraction techniques. Venting to friends. Expressing things through art. None of it has really helped, and I can’t go a single night without a horrifying nightmare that makes me wake up in a cold sweat. I’m at a loss.

113,"Hi all! Hope everyone is doing well.  
As the title implies, I have hysterical laughter ""attacks"" from time to time. I've been having this issue for a long time, but it never was a big problem for me. I spend most of my time alone, I'm always muted when VC, and I don't attend any family/friends gatherings. So it's been pretty easy to deal with.  
I am planning on going unmuted to chat with one of my internet friends more easily though.  
I would like to keep the issue private and not to tell him, but I'm afraid of an sudden attack hitting me while we are in VC. We have already slightly covered the topic without me telling what the exact problem is, and it resulted in a heavy attack in the middle of the night. I'm worried it might happen again.  
My attacks are usually random and not triggered by anything (except for the time we talked about it a bit), uncontrollable and can last from 5 minutes to 40\~ at worse. After them I have trouble talking because of throat pain. I did a small research already, I have not had any brain trauma, I do not suffer from depression and overall I have no major issues that can be the cause of it.  
But I have an emotion surpression issue, especially when it comes to anger. Plus insomnia.   
Here where I live, an attempt to seek professional will raise eyebrows, plus covid is still a big problem. So, I would like to solve this issue myself if possible.  
Has anyone here had a familiar experience? What did you do to calm yourself down or prevent the attack?

125,"I finished middle school in 2015 and I started high school the following fall. However, my mental health had gone south the last couple of years and my anxiety and depression had gotten so bad that being around people felt impossible and I didn't know what else to do than to take a year off. I had so many bad experiences connected to school that the thought of going for at least 3 more years made me sick. I was working part time so I thought it would be good for me to focus on getting better with therapy while doing something I really loved doing. I worked in a pet store at the time so it was a lot of animal therapy. 

I don't know how much therapy helped me that year. I have the worst memory ever (probably due to depression tbh) and I honestly can't recall how my mental state changed. I applied to school again the following fall and managed to get through 6 months before I realised that I had so much absence that I wouldn't be able to graduate anyways, so I quit. I tried another year but circumstances again made me give up.

I honeslty gave up on ever getting further in my education after that. I always had pretty good grades in school, so it felt like such a punch in the gut, but I honestly didn't think I'd ever be in a mental state where I could handle it. 

Fast forward to this year, I've been home for 2 and a half years barely getting outside. I've been in and out of therapy seeing multiple different therapists, some more helpful than others. I've been working some part time, and doing some temp jobs just to have something to do, but it was all because someone else was telling me to. Mainly social workers. I never actually wanted to do anything. I just wanted to stay in bed all day where I felt safe.

I've been diagnosed with depression and generalised anxiety. I've also been in a binge, restrict cycle for years, which therapists always just told me was a by-product of my anxiety. I had a mental breakdown 2 years ago which led me to be in a mental state where I didn't recognise anyone most of the time, including my parents and boyfriend who I live with and see every day. I was also completely apathic for about a year. Thinking about that still scares me so much.  

About 8-ish months ago I woke up and realised I wanted to study physics. It was like I had kept this thought buried deep in my subconsious for years and finally it surfaced. But first I had to finish high school.

I'm now in a class with a bunch of 16 year olds trying to remember all the shit I learned so long ago whilst also trying to not have constant panic attacks and also avoiding just bursting into tears. I dissociate a lot thanks to my anxiety and I never have the guts or energy to iniciate a conversation with anyone so I'm always on my own. I get really depressed whenever I feel overwhelmed and I rarely have energy to do homework as I'm usually so tired I just pass out as soon as I get home. So I fall even more behind and I get even more depressed and so on...

My depression has gotten worse since I started school again as I'm constantly reminded of the fact that I'm so far behind people of my own age, and also super rusty in every single subject. Group projects scare the living shit out of me and I had to have a counselor let all me teachers know that I couldn't do them or I'd be too scared to even show up. I've skipped a bunch of classes because I've had a panic attack and had to run away and wasn't able to go back into the class room or I just felt like I had to go home. 

I feel really lost and alone. This is something that everyone should be able to do and it's just so difficult. It's painful and draining and I don't want to do it. But I have to.

127,"Hello,

So I'm a mom who rarely gets any time for herself, I feel like a slave in all honesty. I haven't been to a salon in two years, as I dont have the time for upkeep so I just get the old box dye out and do it at home. I dont get to dress up and have a date night, it's been a year and a half and I could do with those little things to make me feel human again. If I even attempt making plans or a appointment I have to rearrange constantly so I tend to give up now.

I want something to look forward to on the weekend, my partner goes out every sunday all day while I'm always stuck in the house on my own. Saturday is his lazy day so no chance going out together or anything then either and even if hes not on a lazy day he will be in the garage doing bike stuff.

Thing is, his attention to his bike and car is becoming too much for me, I automatically switch off soon as he talks about these things as it's all the time. And our son is getting BIG TIME ANGRY when he has no time with his dad which means I handle the outbursts on my own, my son has asked to go the beach as his dad goes every weekend with his mates and it's making a bad effect on our son now as hes missing time with him. And it's making my mental health go through the roof as I dont get to do anything I enjoy at all. I dont want him to cut off his hobbie but to just consider maybe I would like to indulge in my hobbies aswell as they keep me sane!

I'm sort of the art/nature type, I'd honestly feel so much better if I could have a camping weekend and just do some hiking and have some real in life moments. My only social outlet is my phone, I see my one friend around the corner for coffee every so often as I can take the kids and feel SO much better after that! 

I also work with having two children and will do parts of education at home when I can as I know the career route I'd enjoy when my youngest child is full time in school. So I'm up from 5.30 and on the go until 7.30 odd at night, cleaning, cooking, doing DIY, working, trying to entertain the children, dealing with any Bill's or kids appointments, school run, food shops etc. 

I also get abit depressed near my birthday as I never get to enjoy it or anything.

128,"what’s up fellow miserable bags of blood. i’ve recently found out i was prescribed a bunch of shitty meds for my brain that made me probably more depressed and scared of treatment. how i am feeling rn is probably the side effect of going cold turkey on meds i’ve been taking for at least 10 months consistently for like 2 weeks i think. broke up with my boyfriend of a year and a bit a couple days since i cut all that out that i still believe was the best to come for me.

he was understanding despite not being fucked up himself. and encouraging and genuine but i guess nothings enough for me. 

he was the only only one i completely opened up to. i overshare with a lot of people about how i hate myself and whatnot but even still nobody knows me. i try to open up in a non joking not validation seeking way but i feel pathetic and weak. i have a friend or two that i share quite a bit to but when i know no one can help i feel bad going to people because i know no matter how much people say i’m not a burden i know i let them down. they let me cry on their shoulder or just ramble on about how everything hurts and i’m still not ok. but i feel like i owe them a little bit of closure for being there for me so i act like i feel a little better and feel like too much when i need them again soon after. i was really able to see that i should continue to not be complete open because of this ex. he loved me. he knew everything that i was and he still loved me. but it hurt him that he couldn’t make me happy. he made me happier but he knew i’d never be.. ok. and a part of me felt like i was doing him a favour by letting him go and i know he sees that too.

i got tinder recently. not really to rebound or be all risky and fuck everything which would be smart cause now i have a fucking iud wasting away but mostly just cause i thought it would help my self esteem and it did. but i found this other dude. that seems like everything my ex was and more. a part of me knows this isn’t going to work and i want it to and not want it to at the same time. he seems like a great person but that’s speaking from talking to him for maybe three days. but even if i don’t let this spiral i know i’m so desperate for affection and attention that soon enough i’ll find another person to do that to.

people find me interesting, and likeable bu that’s because i only open up to a point where it’s relatable. nobody knows me. i want to be loved for all that i am but i don’t want anyone to have to know and deal with all that i am. there are people that want to be there for me. and i know i can text any of them right now and say i’m ok but i can’t. i always end up going online and find temporary solutions that will fade over time. 

i’m fine. but it just comes crashing to me when i catch myself wasting my life away with distractions that worked too well. i’ve accepted that person that i am. i will always be disappointing and people will always disappoint me. and that’s ok. 

i just want to be loved unconditionally but deep down i know that isn’t real. love isn’t real. unconditionally giving isn’t real. people say love yourself because nobody can love you like you need to be loved but i can’t and don’t want to.
i feel like a horrible person despite trying to constantly improving myself. i know how cruel people get when they stop trying to see they are flawed and try to live their life like they are the main character and no matter the shitty things they do they’ll always be good because that’s just who they are deep down. and as a person who’s been hurt by some one like that, that was made to seem like it’s my fault and i’m shitty for even suggesting that they did bad things for no reason o her than they’re kinda shitty, i don’t think i can knowingly change myself into someone that unconditionally loves themselves.

i don’t know what the point of this post was nor do i remember what i even typed so far. i write poems and essays to try to figure my shit out but i end having to have people to read it and hear what i have to say but at the same time not? i don’t really know what i’m going on about. i just needed to let some steam out and i don’t know how else.",19Oct2020,1

133,"Lately I've been indulging in laxatives to combat how grossly I've been consuming food in the last few weeks. 

I routinely, year to year, gain 30 pounds from the fall all the way to spring due to stress of school, finding myself uncontrollably binging. (I then lose 30 pounds in the summer  just by sleeping in till noon and not really doing anything, and my appetite reduces substantially). 

Its that time of year again where I lose control and start gaining weight, except this time its way worse. 2 months ago I started eating healthy and keeping active, and I was losing weight in a healthy, well paced, controlled manner (something I had lacked my whole life) and that was due to the fact that I moved into my own apartment and could literally control what I have in the house. What I do. Etc. 

But when I'm home with family, I've noticed im completely out of control, and these past 2 months its been the worst. I will do well and not binge and eat whole foods, be full, ajd be satisfied. I'll walk after a meal. I'll have a sweet when I want it, but I'm not craving it 24/7. I'm balanced. But as soon as I get home (which is a pool of carbs and snacks ajd sweets) I just eat anything and everything in sight. Even if I'm not hungry, i'll still be eating.

My parents constantly want me home to keep them company, and so the last 2 weeks I've spent most of my time at home. And the last 2 weeks, I've gained 10 pounds from binging. 

I've literally felt sick these last couple of days with how much I eat. (I'm full, and yet still finding myself eating). Last night, I came home from work late at night, Still full from all the food  I had that day (which was a LOT) And my parents asked if I was hungry and for whatever reason, I said sure (despite my stomach bursting) and I ate 3 slices of chicken bacon pizza, feeling sick, and then ate half a container of edible cookie dough. Like. I was sick BEFORE the cookie dough and yet still could not resist eating all of it. 

I just got back to the apartment and still felt full, but still felt like I wanted to eat. I'm not even HUNGRY im just. I don't even know. Its been really bad lately.  

I've been taking laxatives because I dont know how else to curb it.  And yes, I already know laxatives don't magically get rid of excess food so your body doesn't absorb it. It just starts a bowel movement and most of what is excreted is liquid/water (which is why you become dehydrated) but God. Just a month ago I was almost flat stomached and starting to see abs, and now my stomach is bulging again like it has been for 10 years. I'm right back at where I started. 

Going home is decisively bad, but my family feels like I dont spend enough time with them. I find myself having to go home every week (and then staying half the week anyway because they want me home). I literally spent the last 5 days there, and today I went back to my apartment for the first time since and my family called and asked when I'll be coming home again next (ie, expectantly this week). 

I cant just flat out not go see them because of eating, but I also dont know how or why my binging worsens when I'm there. (I can control what foods are in my apartment so usually I won't crave something that I know isn't here). 

I just remembered when I was like 11, and I was overweight. And my parents freaking out about it and trying to make me watch my food intake. I was 11 and didn't know Jack shit about dieting. I remember one time we went to a restaurant when I was 12.  I ordered a fish sandwich. My dad told me I couldn't eat the bun, only the fish. The bun was too many excess calories. (I straight up love bread and wanted that fucking bun) and he said either bun or milkshake, not both. I went with milkshake

Then later we got home and he gave me laxatives because I ate too much to begin with. 

Which is why I always thought laxatives were for combating the guilt of an unnecessarily large meal, not for occasional  constipation. 
Oh well. (I've tried to make myself throw up once but honestly couldn't, it hurt my throat, and just couldn't do it. Plus, just doesn't sound appealing enough.)

I dont even want to look at the scale. I think I'm just going to admit defeat and relapse for my yearly weight gain. Except its going to be like 50 pounds this winter for sure. I'm already tired of crying and feeling guilt and hating myself for this and not knowing why I cant control it.",19Oct2020,1
134,"So, just a heads up I have had clinical depression in the past which I moved away from with medication and counseling. Recently in the past week I noticed my mood has been quite poor, I feel depressed. Knowing that life happens and sometimes you can go through small bouts of depression how can I work through this? I exercise daily and keep active as well as socialise. So is it just a buck up until it's over scenario? When I had clinical depression I was fortunate enough to medicate my way out of it but this isn't an option for me since I'm only going through a small phase. Any ideas? I do see a psychologist every two weeks but due to a scheduling conflict I have to wait another two weeks to talk to her. 

P.S: I can't say if I'm falling back into depression so for now I'm just going to say that it's just a short term issue. If it is a bigger issue I'll deal with it then but for now I just want to deal with this as a temporary problem.",19Oct2020,1

136,"I dont know if it is just me or if others feel this way, but whenever you disclose what's going on (and your thoughts, feelings, reactions to it that would indicate a mental illness) i often times hear 'you need help' and quite frankly, thats not very helpful. 

I've talked about my thoughts of suicide to ""friends"" and I often hear 'Jesus fucking Christ you need to get help. Seriously' and honestly, saying it like that is just gonna dissuade me even more.

I understand that listening to someone else talk about why killing themselves is a good idea is traumatizing in itself and overwhelming. (Nobody knows how to respond to that). But at the same time, if I'm telling you about it, its not because I'm looking for a solution, hoping you'll present it to me. 

If I'm telling you, its because I trust you, and I just want someone to understand what's going on in my mind. I dont want your advice, I dont want your solution, I just want someone to listen. And I think a lot of people become too alarmed by the concept of suicide or harm or just exceedingly harmful and pessimistic views on life that they want to push it off as something drastic and crazy, psychotic and toxic. 

Please, dont. Hearing ""Jesus fucking Christ you need help"" from someone I considered my close friend is heartbreaking, especially when I can't even recognize if I need help. For the longest period of time I thought these things I felt were normal, and I was annoyed when people told me to ""go get help"" what does that even mean? Did it occur to you that talking to you is help? That knowing you are here listening is help? Then I get hit with ""im not a therapist"" no, you're not. You're my friend, though. And yes, this is a topic that not even a great ""friend' should be expected to handle. 

But PLEASE don't tell me I need to get help and dismiss it as such just because you don't want to listen to it. It hurts to hear, I know. It hurts and its terrifying to listen to someone speak so calmly and so surely about killing themselves being a good thing. Nobody wants to listen to that and have it on their conscious. 

But if they are still here, and they are talking to you about it, listen. They might not be ready or even know where to begin to seek professional care, but its not your place to tell them. You are not the answer solver. Even if you tell them ""get help"" they aren't going to just ""get help"" the next day. You'll get frustrated over and over again and start building this wall of resentment. 

Being friends with someone who is struggling with mental illness is hard, but constantly telling them ""go get help"" might make it worse.",19Oct2020,1

140,"Hey guys! So I have had a massive issue ever since I discovered Animal Crossing New Leaf. Whenever I start a game I have to do EVERYTHING ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! If I, for example, walk into a tree or don't position myself just right in front of a mailbox or item to interact with it I get a horrible feeling and if other things go 'wrong' after that I have to restart my entire game. The worst is when I walk into a villager and 'push' them on accident. If I make a mistake the whole 'save data' is ruined and the only way to keep playing is to clean my switch, delete my save and all the pictures I took and restart. I have played New Leaf thousands of times but didn't manage to keep a town for longer than 2 weeks at most. I'm a huge AC fan and got New Horizons when it came out and have restarted 300 times at least. Im suffering extremely bad because of this. I don't have OCD in my normal day to day life but once I start a game of any kind I face this problem. I just don't know what to do, I just want to enjoy a town for more than a few hours/days.. I really hope some of you have any tips or maybe know why this happens to me. Please don't tell me to just enjoy it and don't worry about it, I know, I've tried. If I try to ignore the 'mistake' it gets worse in my head and eventually I have to restart because all the joy of playing vanishes. This really affects my mental health as well. If I manage to keep a town for 2 or 3 days Im ecstatic and can play for hours at a time, then when the inevitable happens I'm heartbroken.. Any tips are more than welcome !!! &lt;3",19Oct2020,1
141,"Whenever my friends or family say they miss me, after not seeing them for months etc. I say it back but I don't ever mean it? I could not see my family for years and it wouldn't bother me, the same with friends. I could never see my best friend again and I don't think I would really care. When I get into arguments with friends, I'm not too bothered about making up, unless it will make things awkward (e.g I have to see them places, or in group settings) and could have an argument and not speak to them in months and not care. But I care about them, and I enjoy spending time with them and talking to them, it's not like those people mean nothing to me. 
I think if all my friends dropped off the face of the earth, I would miss having people, not having 'those' people. I would miss having people to chill with and spend all my time with and have fun with, but not necessarily them. They are important to me though, and if anything happened to them I would be there if they needed me straight away. 
I think I need my family just as a solid structure in my life, of people I'll always have. They can't be replaced, but if I didn't see them for years I don't think it would matter too much to me. 
However, with my bf, if I don't see him for a day I miss him, I can't see anyone ever replacing him. If we ever argue I want to sort it out straight away because I get so anxious about it. I didn't see him for 4 months during lockdown and it was hard, I missed him every day, but at the same time, not to the point where I couldn't do long distance. He is above everyone else in my life, but we have been together only nearly a year.

But I know I care for them and want them in my life. And I know im not a complete psycho because I love and miss my bf so much, but isn't it just so weird? Like one extreme to the other?

153,"Come to think of it the best years of my life that I can actually remember were from 2011-2015 when I was 8-11, when I had actual irl friends. Besides that being lonely for years without friends. Like literally… As a young kid I had a best friend and a few other friends in the neighborhood. My at the time best friend eventually moved away just like all the other kids in the neighborhood leaving me lonely. Infact, I had an opportunity like 2 years ago to see him again and I turned down the offer for video games. Like wth was I thinking. One of my many regrets. Before that when they're were still others kids in the neighborhood I couldn't actually be like the others. I wasn't trusted out of the fenced yard cause I was too young. I mean shit, I was 8-9 years old and could look out for myself yet wasn't trusted out of the yard. Had to talk to them tru a fence. Even had rock fights at times throwing rocks at each other above the fence. Luckily none of us were ever hit, that could have resulted in death due to the some of the sizes of the stones. Another regret. I wish I had disregard what my mom thought and just left the yard to play with the others. Then I moved with my mother to her boyfriend's house where I got new friends alongside my old ones back at my house during the time. But in 2014 I lost all my school/neighbor friends there as we moved back permanently to our house. Then what. School… I got a few new friends there and was soon expelled by a fucked up bully who till this day I want to beat the shit out of him. And I still swore to myself till this day if I ever see him again, he will pay hell. He got me to disciplinary school which after entering the point where you don't work and just break rules, I actually enjoyed it which I used not to. Because of that I stopped working and eventually was expelled from there as well which caused great shit between me and my mom (not like it hasn't happened like for the majority of my life) which fucked up my mental. Then what. I had no friends till 2019 when internet returned to the house. But I only have internet friends now. Which is good. But I feel it's not enough. At least I can vc with online friends, but no. My mom thinks I'm not ""normal"" or capable of having a conversation. Them what. Ah yes. I had the opportunity to go to school a few years ago where I could get actual friends. But no, I had to say no, but deep inside I wanted to. Now days I'm lonely just like I've always been. Despite having virtual friends I'm still lonely. My dad passed away when I was 3. Which is affecting me now days more than ever. I was going to get a job in March of 2020 but no. A fuckup virus had to take over the world and my only chance to get out. Yep, I have no reason to go out so stay isolated indoors which has made me extremely shy and have minor social anxiety. Infact maybe more than minor. Now days I'm just regretting my teenage years. I feel like I daydreamed away my teenage years living in a fantasy world to keep me company. I'm 17 and don't even have a girlfriend either. I'm afraid of the future and now developing a poor mentalhealth as the time pass. Now days I have depression, I cut to keep me stable. I have anxiety. I get panic attacks due to excessive pinging on Discord as it brings back raid memories on my server along side those I moderated. I even question if I have DID. I'm literally dead inside. Better yet. My phone service expires a few days before Halloween. And my mom can't refill it due to financial issues. Meaning I'll loose contact with all my friends which will totally kill my mental to the point I'll probably sucide a few days later.

My mom once found out about my self harm and she yelled at me and hit me so I don't want something like it to happen again that's why I'm considering not going to the school counselor since it's almost their job to tell the parents and it's also very easy for them to do so since they can get the contact information of my parents directly from the school.

158," I am seeking advice in behalf of a friend. She is an American young woman, from Ohio. She has several health and mental health issues (depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder and she also takes antipsychotics), plus in the recent times she has been dabbling in drugs. She is at risk of becoming homeless, and she has no friends or family she can turn to. I feel like her mental health has been declining since the pandemy started, and it is also when she began taking drugs. She is feeling suicidal, and I don't know how I could help her as we don't live in the same country (I am from Europe).

With the imminent risk of homelessness and the fact that she hasn't been taking any meds recently, she feels unable to seek aid on her own and has no strength to inform herself, so she gave me permission to search for possible help in her stead. In the past I suggested her to go to a women's shelter, but truthfully I have little knowledge of where she could go seek help since I'm not American. She has little to no money, so ideally it should be a place that offered aid free of charge.

I'm asking to any Americans here, do you know what options are there for someone in her situation? Any organizations? I'm not sure if there are any social security/welfare programs that work around those issues. I am a first-timer on reddit and I don't know how to move on this site, so if I'm in the wrong place to ask or there have been similar posts before I'd be grateful to know as well!

I have this deep hatred for my parents and brother, which probably is due to how aggressive and dismissive of my feelings they were, but sometimes I think this hatred is excessive. I really, really, really, hate them. When I'm around them, I feel like killing them. I imagine myself beating them up with a metal vase, a knife - I have many different fantasies. I've never been aggressive in my entire life: I've actually always hated fights and did everything I could to avoid them. I'm not motivated or looking forward to anything. It's not like I hate myself, though I wouldn't say I love myself. I feel just plain nothing, I guess? Nah, I think I do feel something. This has been my normal for a long time (except my anger). I think I'd like to know how you guys feel day to day, so I know if what I'm feeling is normal.

She has her own issues as well due to ab*se in the household, betrayal etc but it's been rubbing off on me so much. She is so so sensitive and has invisible criteria that she upholds all of her friends to. You don't know when she will get mad and when she does it's not pretty. She will hurl the worse insults (she admits she does it in order to release the anger), the worse part is that her anger is often not justified. eg. she overthinks things to the point where my other friends and i all agree that it's ridiculously petty. She accuses us of being morally inferior because of extremely minuscule incidents. She will get mad if i text her and the message's length is not satisfactory. I have dreaded every day earlier this year because of her. It's strange, i feel guilt if i mistreat her or cut her off completely because her behaviour is due to her past. Plus i'm a student, and i cannot avoid her due to her being in my class. Anyway, i dread every interaction with her, and going to school/working on projects with her brings me an insurmountable amount of dread and anxiety. She has demonstrated other toxic behaviours as well, which makes her so fragile yet condescending. If she were to transfer out of my school, and if i just had her out of my life, i'd feel a deep sense of relief.

167,"Long Post Warning!

From the past 2 years, I don't think I have ever been 'happy' for more than 5 minutes. I have always been a very shy person and have severe complex when it comes to communicating with people. Hence I have lost all contact whatsoever with everyone whom I once used to consider close.

So I want to share my story but I am in no condition to formulate it properly. But I will try to do it and see how it goes.

Basically, I have always been a totally shy person and a total introvert. I had severe complex while talking to people. Like really bad. Hence I always had trouble understanding people, and thus I never figured out how to act in what situation and I could never connect closely with anyone. 

Due to this, somewhere along the way, I inculcated a habit of just avoiding people as much as possible. I used to lie all the time; and use any kind of ridiculous excuses just to avoid meeting someone. This increased so much that I never even tried bonding properly with people. I just made up some excuse all the time and stayed alone.  

This obviously created an image in head of everyone about me; that I just avoid people for some reason. And people maybe made up their own explanations on why I would do this. But I never cared what someone thinks of me. I just kept this going.

As a result, apart from 2-3 people, I cannot openly to anyone still. And on top of that everyone has a image of me being like just a rude person who doesn't want to talk to them, when actually it always was that I could never find the courage to start even the simplest of conversations, leave aside bonding with the person. Hence no one really got to ""know"" me and I did not get to really ""know"" anyone.

And also, I mentioned before that I developed this habit of constantly lying. It also increased and increased and it became like; I used to make up things just to continue conversations; or say something with certainty even if I am not so certain about it. 

All this also did not help me in my job as you would have guessed. I stayed at my first job for 2 years; and it was the most horrible time of my life. Basically, when I joined in 2017 in order to make a ""good first impression"" I just started to show excitement and enthusiasm all the time and just talk with everyone in the office. Of course this did not last long. And combine this with the usual office politics; and I literally ran away from this job after 2 years. I now work as a part time; as a freelancer. 

In between all this, I started drinking heavily. I used to socially drink before. But during my job; I just could not contain myself without drinking. So it led to heavier and heavier consumption. And it has only increased in the last year; especially after covid lockdown.

I consume a lot alcohol now than before. Everyday. Or at the max every other day. Because only when I am drunk I feel like I am ""happy"" ( Although I don't even know what happiness is any longer. ). This has not only taken a toll on my mental health, but also on my pocket! I have heavy credit card bills pending, and the lockdown has already limited my freelancing opportunities.

And worst part is; I can't talk to anyone about this! Therapy is out of question because it is just sooo expensive. I have one best friend; but he himself has so much tragedy in his personal life; I don't even want to burden him about this. And no one knows I am like this. Because first is no one really talks to me regularly, and second is whenever someone talks I just have this mask on just pretending to be okay. I was raised by a single parent, my mum. I can't talk to her about this; because consumption is such a frowned upon thing in our place; she will not ever recover if I tell her about my consumption habit.

Everything is so dark. It just seems impossible to come out of this darkness.

I am a believer in human life and I want to live my life to fullest. I don't want to give up and I never have thought of ending things because I think this can be fixed.   
But I just don't know how. And it seems more and more impossible with each passing day.

Please advice me fellow redditors on what I can do!!",19Oct2020,1

169,"Let’s just go right in, I have unwanted sexual feelings for somebody. No this isn’t a sexuality issue I’m comfortable with where I am, and it is with an adult of a similar age, just to clear that up. It stems more from how abrupt these thoughts occurred and how impossible and hopeless the whole thing is.
 
I’ve had a group of friends for a while and through them I met this person. Despite not knowing them for long we quickly became good friends, finding common ground in mental health issues, hobbies we share and a similar sense of humor. We both conceded in each other issues pertaining to our sexuality, and mental illness . Everything was fine until a few weeks ago, where I found myself having these sudden strong feelings.

The worst part of all of this is that this person isn’t even attracted to my gender identity. The possibility of a relationship is something that I not only don’t want at all but is entirely impossible. 

All I want is a good friend, and that I have, but I fear what these thoughts will do to me going forward. I would daydream of my future and in those I have a spouse of the same face as this person and I would be aroused at the thought of getting with them. I’m disgusted with myself more than I have ever been. This is putting not only my relationship with them on the line but all of my friends, and has been destroying my focus on my life as of late.

I’ve been in a few relationships in the past, I’ve always considered myself mentally stable. But these intrusive thoughts as of late are having me reconsider. 

And no, I will never confront them about it, or any other friend who knows them. This isn’t me asking for help getting with them, I want to keep my friends and make these thoughts stop, what should I do?",19Oct2020,1
170,"TL;DR: I have had two not great experiences with counselling, does it actually work for everyone or do some people do better by just figuring out ways to cope on their own?


I (25f) have struggled with my mental health ever since puberty hit. Whenever I tried talk to my parents when I was younger, I was ignored or told to just get over it.

When I was a bit older and tried to bring it up my doc, it was basically the same. I admit I probably wasn't voicing my concerns properly, but one example was telling her that I was so stressed I wasn't sleeping properly, hair was falling out way more than usual, and stomach was in bits, and she told me ""a little bit of stress is good for everyone"".

Then when I got to college, (free counselling, whoo) I had some awful personal stuff going on and tried counselling for the first time. The college had an online CBT course that I worked through, and I had a few meetings with a counsellor. But gave up pretty quickly because I just ended up sobbing in every session and dreading the sessions.

Now I'm in grad school (different university), and I'm struggling. Again tried the online CBT course, but honestly CBT just does not work for me. I met up with a counsellor regularly there for about 6 months, and while bits of it were useful, I gave up when after I opened up about how anxious I get on public transport (this was before covid), he told me to, and I quote, ""grow up"".

I've had limited success with mindfulness, evening primrose oil tablets, and keeping on top of my fitness to keep my mental health in check, but it's just a constant struggle, it's something that I always have to fight against, like my default setting is to be down and stressed constantly.

So have I just been unlucky so far with my experiences in counselling, or is this feeling normal, or do I actually just need to ""grow up""?",19Oct2020,1
171," 28M, active lifestyle, moderately successful. For the first time in my life I had discussed focus and mental health issues with my doctor, and was prescribed adderall. The effects were mind blowing, similar to the movie ""Limitless"" as far as the clarity, focus, and successes I had. I was on it for 4 months until my job changed where I can no longer be on amphetamines. I'm able to function well enough without it, but what is most concerning is the perspective I now have of how loud and disorganized my brain normally is.

I have always struggled to focus at school, work, or with things I’m not particularly interested in, but though it was normal. The much bigger issue I see now is that my mind is constantly churning thoughts, every minute of every day. The best way I can describe my mind is a bunch of different TV's on at the same time, constantly flipping channels. Not so much pictures but sounds, monologues, music, and rabbit holes of thought played through a loudspeaker. Its constantly there, and I’ve come to consciously recognize it at an alarming magnitude. For example, the noise starts before my body even wakes up in the morning. Its anywhere from 30-minutes to an hour of being trapped before my eyes open and my brain and body actually wake up. I also find myself fiddling with something in my hand, humming/whistling, and walking around a bit.

I’m not distracted with time waiting things perse, but with like functional ideas. I don’t have any social media and don’t do much scrolling through online feeds. It’s more of just ideas or concepts like projects I could work on that I will just dive down the rabbit hole on researching or thinking about. The only time this doesn’t occur is if I’m actively and methodically engaged in an activity. Like working on my cars/motorcycles, doing yard work or any physical labor, or working through well organized workflow process at work. I’m also a pretty introverted and mellow person on the exterior, and have the skills and training as a leader to remain calm and execute in a stressful or demanding environment. I tend to do my best work when under the gun.

What I’m now looking for is the best method for understanding this issue, and coping with it to better perform at work. I believe this is more about turning the subconscious noise level down, than my ability to singularly focus on a task. I’ve tried a myriad of solutions, but the ritual I’ve developed is not sustainable. Passively, I’ve painted and designed my office with calming colors and natural textures. I use soft lighting with a beautiful view of the forest behind my house. Actively, I play focus-based music like beta waves, classical, low-fi, nature sounds. I’ll burn incents or smoke my pipe tobacco. I’ll exercise and make sure I’ve eaten well and healthy for the day. I use blue light glasses. I’ll have coffee or tea. If things are really bad, I’ll use my fisher wallace stimulator I have for treating depression, but it’s cumbersome and not practical if I have to go into work.

What is my best course of action for dealing with this issue or at least simplifying my routine to help mitigate the mind distractions. Second to that, it would be nice to just simply relax sometimes in my off time without anxiety kicking in to go do something. 

TLDR: I took Adderall for the first time and now struggle without it realizing how loud my brain is. How serious is my issue and is there a better way to deal with it without having to coordinate things like music, diet, exercise, and environment almost religiously?",19Oct2020,1
172,"Hey folks, I've been reflecting on my own journey with binge eating and the quirky behaviours I've picked up. I've shared the top 6 which seem surprisingly common in men and could be indicative of something deeper.

Do you do any of them?

1. lots of zero calorie foods e.g. sugar-free jelly, celery, gum
2. extreme restriction e.g. keto, intense daily fasting
3. stealing food from others
4. eating from bins
5. hiding food wrapping
6. regular body checking e.g. pinching stomach

I talk about them in more detail here: [https://youtu.be/9-X4TgaTG0E](https://youtu.be/9-X4TgaTG0E)

I've done all 6 a lot 👀

These are obviously only potential quirky warning signs: they are not related to the clinical definition of any eating disorders.  
That said, they could be a flag to gently check-in with someone if you notice these behaviours.

Over the past week, my friends were non-stop texting in our group chat about having a girls night this past weekend and it was honestly irritating the shit out of me. I guess I’m just overwhelmed with trying to manage 2 jobs and school that I can’t even think about anything else. Also, I’m kind of irritated with some of them just because some of them live off of their daddy’s money and don’t have to work so they have all the time in the world and I have to work all the time just to make ends meet. Anyway, every time my friends decided on a day/time to hang out, it always interfered with school or work, so I was always the bummer that couldn’t make it. Eventually we settled for Sunday night. Saturday night I texted them and lied and said that I couldn’t make it. I lied because I was just wanted a night to myself to relax. They didn’t really respond to me and the group chat kinda just went dead. I’m such a yes person so I feel bad for ruining the plans. It’s also just weird that no one really said anything about it too. It put me in an even worse mood and so I just deleted all of my social media apps. Watching everyone I followed on social media do fun things was making me feel more depressed because I don’t really have time or money to do fun things.

So let‘s start from the beginning.

About 6 weeks ago I had a full blown panic attack which sent me in an emotional dissociation for a couple of days where I just felt numb. Ever since then I can‘t stop thinking about if I feel something. I wake up in the morning, first thing that comes to my mind is the rumination and how shitty the past few weeks were and then I‘m back in the cycle. I don‘t even know how to explain it properly. I‘m not even ruminating on if I can feel but more about that I can‘t stop thinking about the topic. I‘m sure it sounds dumb. But it‘s making my life so unpleasant. I can‘t watch a movie because I can‘t concentrate on the storyline. I can‘t enjoy being with my friends because in my head there is this non-stop cycle of thinking about the emotional numbing I experienced. I just want to get out of this cycle and I would do anything to get out of my head. These thoughts are so pointless. I literally think the same thought all day. What should I do? I know it all probably sounds dumb if you never experienced it but it‘s really making my life a hell because no matter what I do, in my head it‘s the same all day. Is this OCD or just my brain being fucked? I‘m so sick of this. I just wanna move back in time and get my old head back, when I didn’t even realize that it’s possible to get lost in such a cycle and think about things that actually matter in my life. 

Please help.
