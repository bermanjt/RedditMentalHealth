0,"Maybe I just need to vent, maybe I really need help, i'm not entirely sure. 

I took quarantine pretty seriously and was fairly isolated for several months. There was an adjustment period where I had to sort of re-learn how to speak and be sociable and what have you, so i'm not sure if this is just part of that adjustment or not. 


I was chewed out a lot today by a superior for something I felt was unfair, and for some reason it's really sticking with me. I'm replaying the situation over and over in my head and I feel a pit in my stomach because  of it. I had to speak to a lot of colleagues today and I noticed I was reading more negativity into their words than I usually do. More than this I'm finding myself upset with more of my friends. I'm finding myself not wanting to speak to my friends. I want space from them even though we're just barely reconnecting from quarantine. I feel overwhelmed with workload to the point i'm actually not wanting to work at all. I'm just starting to feel out of it. I'm feeling like I just want to be alone for a little longer before doing more work or speaking to more people. Everything feels like its too much and i'm finding myself pacing a lot and pushing things off. I don't know how to describe it other than i feel like somethings wrong with me but worse than that I feel like its only the beginning.",18Aug2020,1
1,"I feel unwanted by my friends and family. I feel as if all I am is a gap. People know I’m there, but I’m easy to fill. I feel distanced and unable to talk to anyone. Everyone I turn to doesn’t take me seriously. I feel as if I’m playing a character. Who the fuck am I? I pretend to be so eccentric when I feel so alone and empty. I don’t even know if my friends even like “me” let alone the real me. But who the fuck is the real me? I don’t know. Sorry if this is scrambled and nobody can understand what I mean, I just wanted to vent.",18Aug2020,1
2,"Tldr: a counsellor told me I was copying my mums mental health issues and that I didn't have any issues myself. Still feel the same/just as low 4 years later but can't get over the possibility of the same thing happening again if I seek help now. 

I stopped going to school for a year at the end of secondary school as I couldn't bring myself to go but couldn't open up enough to anyone, so my parents and the school forced me to speak to someone from mind (mental health charity in the UK). I ended up being guilt tripped into going by being told my parents would receive a large fine if I didn't, and as money was tight, I had no choice. Two things came out of the allotted six 1hour sessions; the first being that the counsellor pushed so hard and made me feel so stupid and pathetic that I went back to school to get away from having the sessions anymore. The second being that they told me that I didn't have any mental health issues myself but instead, I was copying my mum who has depression and anxiety. She had been off of work at the time for around 2 year due to these and rarely left the house unless necessary. This all sprung from the question ""do any family members have any mental health problems"". I have been so scared ever since to get any help but my boyfriend really thinks I should and due to experiences himself, says that the system is better now and it will be fine. How do I get over this?",18Aug2020,1

4,"I was just talking to this guy who claims he has a crush on me and also says that he's bipolar. We've been talking for a while and he knows i've been struggling with mental illness bc he saw me taking pills and knows i have a psychiatrist and stuff. So he's been going on my nerves for the past month to talk to him more about my problems. I just hate talking about it. I don't mind people knowing or anything but i just hate talking about them. My psychiatrist is enough i don't need any more people. Finally i gave up and told him i have depression, social anxiety and OCD. Then he went silent for a moment and said ""oh well.. that's disappointing."" I asked what he means and he said ""nothing. I guess i was hoping you were as crazy as me.. like something more than just that you know, i like psychos and i can't help it"" oh god i lost it when he said that.. I've been going through hell and he was hoping i'm even more messed up? Why would anyone want someone else to be fucked up? What's so cool about fucking up your life and not being able to do anything about it? I don't even know who to blame. I feel so angry and oh man i wish i could slit his throat open when he said those things. Like i know i have the most ""basic"" mental illnesses and i can't be as edgy as y'all but i don't even want to be cool and edgy if that's what it is so stop trying to get me to talk about my uncool problems ffs. And it's not even the first time i've been called ""normal"" by our other edgy nutcase friends. I actually do want to be normal and I'm sick of them trying to make it seem like it's a bad thing when i'm trying my best to be as normal as i can and i wish people could appreciate my efforts instead of being disappointed in me for only having ""basic"" mental illnesses like it's a positive thing to be as fucked up as you can.",18Aug2020,1

I'm positive add is one but growing up my parents didn't believe it was real so I was never tested as a kid, but it makes a lot of sense (I cannot stay focused to save my life).

I feel like I have different personalities.. It's like I have different outfits that involuntary change. Right now the one that makes me feel depressed. Counseling in the past hasn't helped because I automatically go into a place of I must show I'm fine to win.

I want to see a counsellor or something similar but i was too anxious to go to an appointment before so i emailed asking if it was ok for me to go back next week and no response ive emailed them months later asking for help and its as if they have blocked my email.

7,"I am an average guy who has no reasons to exist.
Coming from a middle class family had always played a part in my life. Though my parents never let me feel like that way, but there are few things life that will always haunt you back.

As a person I am not talented or skillful. I haven’t achieved anything significant in life. Mediocrity has always been my abode.
I failed my parents. They always wanted me to succeed.But my mediocrity along with my stupidity is the reason behind me failing them.

I always have had this anxiety while interacting with new people. Though I got over this problem, but people back then found me weird and still treat me like as if I am a zombie among them. I don't really mind that as I have become habituated with it.
I had never dated a girl in my life until I met someone special. We became friends and from there my feelings started to grew.

I knew that I would get rejected still I tried on her with a false hope. Eventually I did get rejected that too badly.
She made fun of my feelings, didn’t stop me right way when I was hitting on her. She already had someone in her life, about which I was completely unaware of.

She made a mockery of my emotions among her friends. 
I was sad and broken but I had nothing to do like every time.
I am neither good looking nor rich. I was even made fun of for being a virgin and called an incel for staying away from women after that trauma.
I have tried to keep myself calm but it isn't just working.

I can't even afford to kill myself, as I have the responsibility to look after my parents who are ageing. My mother often remains ill and father is having tough time running the family. 
It would be very selfish of me to end my life and risking their future. 

At this point of my life, I wish I never really existed on the first place.",18Aug2020,1
9,"So I’m currently in a depression episode and doing my best to keep to a normal schedule, I also have bipolar 2 disorder. I keep pushing away friends (well what friend I do have) all because he “lost track of time and wanted to reschedule”. He doesn’t like hanging out with me when I am depressed because I’m just sad mainly and sometimes b*tchy and he wants me to just be happy all the time. So I call my Celebrate Recovery sponsor and tell her and she tells me “hey, I’ll call you right back” and that was an hour ago. I absolutely hate this feeling of pretty much being rejected and nobody is really listening. The only people who have stood my me through all the ups and downs are my parents and have lost friends over the last 3 years since my bipolar diagnosis.

10,"Let me start out by just saying that I (34M) have no intention to harm myself or anyone else.

My issue is that I have personal issues that appear to be getting worse but don't seem related. I'm currently married but my first wife committed suicide a few months after we were married (5 years ago). I went into a slump but had a lot of support from others, traveled a lot, eventually remarried and live in another country.

Over the past few years, I've noticed that I'm more afraid of certain things than before. For instance, I can't sleep without some type of light and/watching something on my phone. Also, I feel like if there's a dark window something/one might be looking at me.
My wife says I snap more often than usual, but I don't see that, personally.

13,"I am a 30 y/o American Male living in Oregon and I don't really even know where to begin...  
A little under a month ago I quit my job after my supervisor ""lost their mind"" and after a month and half long period of verbal and emotional abuse turned my buried anxieties and traumas into a full blown disorder. To say I was a wreck is an understatement, I had to deal with that trauma, all the crap it dragged up and the burgeoning disorder. I was filled with non-specific fears, about the video-conferences with my new psychologists - the first turned out to be a complete quack - about my future, my traumas, and about the my decision to quit for my mental health and the trial of finding a new science lab job in the midst of the pandemic. It wasn't fun, but I was dealing, I was sleeping, It wasn't great but livable? Probably due to my already daily doses of Sertraline (small does in the morning, big dose in the evening) and Clonadine (in the evening) as part of a long established (\~15 years) ADHD regime (though perhaps not a good thing it hasn't been overseen by a Psychiatrist in 5-6 years) - I also take Concerta in the morning. I can't say exactly how it felt back then since the present eclipses my memory of those days. Though I can say this a few weeks ago I had a really good week, things felt great, I was able to play a video game and enjoy it, I wasn't happy per-say but I was doing well, I had found a therapist who seemed like a nice guy who started me on some mindfulness and meditation in addition to helping figure out my anxieties. I had also joined a therapy group overseen by a CTB therapist specializing in Anxiety and OCD. The next week wasn't as good, but heck I figured I'd have good days and bad days and good weeks and bad weeks. Well if that was a bad week then last week was one from the depths of Hell. It started Tuesday/Wednesday with sudden feelings of generalized apprehension, pressure in my chest/over/in my heart and just a feeling of perhaps ""fight or flight""? On Thursday it had spread to most of the day and the afternoon had gotten worse. By Friday it was pretty bad in the morning - my morning calm ritual a tea tree oil bubble bath with scented candles and a documentary - wasn't working well and by that afternoon my heart was pounding even as I tried to relax and find a ""happy place"" though my sleep wasn't really disturbed much - I was able to get back to sleep. Saturday was a different story, my coping methods had lost most effect and I wasn't able to keep any food or water down, Saturday night I woke at two with a throbbing heart and just a sense of tremendous unease and flight or fight panic and could not get back to sleep. Sunday was even worse, I didn't get hardly any sleep, my heart just pounded, I wasn't keeping anything down. I went to the ER today, they checked over my heart - and didn't even consider COVID a possibility (which given my aunt and uncle are helping me out a lot and are in the 70s is a relief to me) - and it was fine 2 EKGs good no elevated enzymes, they checked my thyroid it was fine and in the end gave me a proton-pump inhibitor and suggested melatonin for sleeping. Honestly I'm both grateful that my heart is okay, and pissed that there's no quick fix to this sudden and horrible change in my already major suffering. Right now I'm praying that I at least get a decent night's sleep tonight, long and free from fear, because I'm really uncertain how many more I can take. I probably need a strong(er) anti-anxiety drug, perhaps a beta-blocker against the physical symptoms - I'm scrambling to get a Psychiatrist who can see me. My close family thinks I may have started a panic cycle or else caused myself harm by overdoing therapy last week - I attended 4 group therapy sessions, one each day, and that I might have been overall trying to move way to fast and basically injured myself. I just would love to learn that this will probably get a little better as things move along and that I won't be paralyzed waiting for psychiatrist before at least some of these horrific symptoms improve so I can at least sleep.",18Aug2020,1
14,"For some reason, the number one thing I’ve always struggled with most when it comes to my mental health, is hygiene. Specifically oral hygiene. My teeth aren’t rotted out of my head yet, but they’re not in great shape. I don’t have insurance, either, on top of it. 

I found out a while back that I need a root canal on my left side but even at my low-cost clinic, they quoted me at $2,000.I didn’t get that done bc money so I haven’t been able to eat on my left side. Now a filling came out of one of the molars on my right side, leaving a hole, and I’m pretty sure I need a root canal on that side, too. Leaving me unable to eat on both sides of my mouth.

I feel so ashamed of myself and that i’ve let this happen. My boyfriend encourages me to take better care of myself all the time (especially bc i recently overcame an infection), and i /want/ to do better. I don’t know why i don’t and i hate myself for it. 

I feel disgusting, worthless. Embarrassed. I don’t want to lose all my teeth and i’m terrified it’s going to happen, and it’s all my fault. I did this to myself. but i don’t know how to change. And part of me is scared it’s too late to change.",18Aug2020,1

28,"This school year I am a senior. My whole high school career I haven't had 1 friend, nor acquaintance. No relationships. Nothing. I didn't go to any events. I never felt like ""man i wanna be his/her friend"" but I feel like I fucked up my experience by saying ""fuck friendships"". I don't know why I did that. I go to a really small school, just under 500 students in all so everyone pretty much knows everyone. My sister (who graduated last year) and brother (sophomore this year) are very popular and I'm just known as the ""quiet"" sister. I feel like I didn't make friends because of my identity.

I'm gay with a very homophobic mother. Her fiance isn't homophobic but he doesn't like telling her how she should treat us. I guess I felt like if I made a friend, I would have to hide myself because if I told them I was gay, my siblings would find out and they might tell my mom. I doubt that they would tell her but man it would be awkward between us.

Now I'm definitely not the poster image for straight. I'm called ""young man"" a lot by old strangers. I have piercings, short hair, small stretched ears. I'm ""tall"" (taller than a lot of the boys at the school) and recently got glasses that make me look even more masculine. So I doubt that the people at school and my siblings think I'm straight but I don't think my siblings considered me being gay. At the school I go to being gay is pretty much the norm. I've had crushes and I'm pretty sure this one girl kinda liked me but I didn't do anything cause... Yeah.

I've never been at a school by myself. Except 8th grade and the beginning of elementary. For elementary my sexuality didn't matter. I knew I was gay but I wasn't trying to have girlfriends I was trying to have running and climbing contests. And for middle school, my sister was there up until she went to high school, so I was only there 8th grade by myself. It was again a small school. People found out I was gay cause I didn't log out of a computer and they went through my Hangouts messages. I was teased for it, some people may call it ""bullying"" but ew. I'll never make myself the victim and I kinda thought it was cool to be the subject of focus. After 8th grade I was back in a school with my sister. So I had to go back to quiet. 

I've had to suppress my identity for almost as long as I've been alive. I fucked up by hiding my identity and not letting myself make friends or make the most of my high school experience. Now I'm gonna do my last year of school completely online because my mother doesn't want me to go to school physically. It's sad that lost of my teen years have gon to waste.

30,"I’m 22 years old, so these guys are all around my age. I was bullied a lot throughout elementary-high school. I’ve also been extremely shy and socially awkward for as long as I can remember. I’m not sure if this is a play in who I am today, but I wouldn’t rule it out. 

Nowadays, whenever I see a group of teens or young adults, I go into panic mode. My heart starts racing, I get defensive, self conscious, and so on. I start thinking about if they’re judging me, if they’re making fun of me, and sometimes, that “if” becomes “they are.” Even if they aren’t picking on me at all, my mind tells me that as I walk past them, they’re judging my every move and hating on me. 

I can’t live like this. I don’t hang out with anyone, I’m very lonely, I have no luck with women, and feeling this way about people around my own age doesn’t help at all. Sometimes I feel like I’m going to die alone, sometimes I feel like a loser, sometimes I don’t even wanna live. Are they really judging me or is it trauma from my bullied past?

31,"For quite a few years now, I have been very open with most people about my struggles with anxiety and depression. It has helped me heal, and quite often, when I share with people, I find that most can relate to what I'm sharing. It is empowering for me and the person I am sharing with, generally. 

But I have realized that there are a few people in my life who feel that it's ok to use my struggles against me, for their own gain. I have recently recognized this as gaslighting. 

This makes me so angry. It feels like a new level of violation. One person, in particular, has also struggled with depression and has been through therapy. She frequently tries to use this shared ground as a way to manipulate me. 

The most recent example has come about because of the pandemic. My immediate family has been following government guidelines very closely, when it comes to distancing and wearing masks. Most other people in our family are not being careful, and they don't understand our decision. This particular person has been trying to convince me that I'm overreacting, that I'm paranoid, that I'm overthinking. They have gone as far as to suggest that the best way for me to combat my ""anxiety"" is to just give up on social distancing and start living my life again. 

I don't know how to handle this. It hurts. It makes me not want to share about my mental health or mental illness with anyone. I know that this person is very close with another person who has used other people's mental health struggles as a way to put them down, and she has also tried to gaslight me this way.

In recent years I've been slowly getting over that, just in pursuit to being healthier. I'm at a serious low rn, and my eating habits are so abysmal, I just wanna make it stop. If you look at webmd or other google blurbs for depression they always describe some symptoms to be either overeating or eating very little. Most times I wish I was at the other side of the spectrum, I hate doing this and I know it's no good.

Yet I'm just somewhere they can vent about every detail of their lives, 24 hours a day. If I stop replying to messages, they start calling. 

I'm exhausted. I don't have the energy to listen to what some person one of my friends doesn't like dared to say on Facebook today, or check their ex's social media page for them, or deal with whatever other bullshit is going on.

If I'm not creating these scenarios, I'll go through vivid memories of my life and try to pick out every detail, most of which are very negative.

Sometimes it's so bad I'll look at the clock and almost twenty minutes have gone by and I didn't even realize it. It's so distressing and when the scenario-building gets really intense, my body feels like it's going through fight or flight. Snapping out of it is difficult and I'll drift back into it if I don't play loud music or do something really engaging.

I'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety, currently not in therapy/on meds due to financial reasons and I'm 29F if that helps.

I just want to know if there is a term for this so I can do more research on how to stop.",18Aug2020,1

I know I need to keep hanging in there but I’m to where I wish I could sleep all day for days on end. I hate everything about me and this world. I wish I was never here.

39,"It’s been a while since I’ve had a full blown panic attack. I saw my ex move on in life. He was mentally abusive to me. While I know it’s best we’re apart. I always go down a deep rabbit hole of thinking I was never good enough for him. He was always an outgoing person, while I was more shy and reserved. I struggled with social anxiety at the time and I still do. The fact that i wouldn’t go out or party with him always made me feel like I just wasn’t good enough for him. It really dug into my insecurities, especially when I knew he’d go out partying and dancing with other women while we were together, while I stayed home  . Nothing i did was good for him. Anyway it’s a lot. But I keep thinking that he’s happier with someone else and treating them better than me because I could never live up to his expectations. He saw me at my worst with my mental health . A part of me feels like if I would’ve been different , he would’ve treated me better and we’d still be together. I saw he moved on and it made me so depressed. I’m having a panic attack as I type this. I don’t know how to come down from this. Seeing him, just triggered me and  brought me back to one of the hardest moments I’ve had In my life . I was suicidal when I was with him and he saw me at the lowest point in my life. It’s been about 4 months since we last spoke and I still feel the same way. I don’t know how to get over him. How can I get through this and move past this relationship that brought me nothing but pain.",18Aug2020,1
40,"I'm in such a horrible place mentally right now and I need someone. I'm literally typing this while sobbing in my room :'D fun times 


I'm suffering from major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety, as well as ADHD and OCD. I have bad abandonment issues and I get attached to people so easily. Recently I had been dealing with someone that'd fallen in love with me, and they have depression too. I'm not mentally ready to be in a relationship. Im afraid. It's so draining being around them because I feel like I have to be a therapist. 



Writing has been my coping mechanism. Specifically, writing with a partner. You'll see some of my other posts are in roleplay communities if you decide to look on my profile. I rely heavily on writing to cope, and I think that scares some people away. 
This writing partner, the one who has fallen in love with me, had extreme depression like I do. Their bad moods made my mood bad. They brought me down. They need a therapist and I coudlnt be that for them. I'm not equipped to deal with someone else's depression on top of my own. But they were all I have. The only person writing with me. And to cut off this toxic friend meant losing our stories. 



As a child I think I messed up and relied on fiction too much and now it's such a big part of me that I can't go without writing with someone because that makes me so happy. There's so little right now that I'm living for. I'm not suicidal but I'm not happy to wake up in the morning either. All of my hobbies? I draw, I make plushies. But they all revolve around fiction, characters I write as or write with. I can't do them without wanting a plot on the side. Nothing brings me joy anymore. It's hell. It's horrible. I can't stand it. It just keeps going on and on and there's no end in sight. There's no point in anything anymore. 
 I have no reason to get up. Nothing makes these days worth living.
It's so stupid but like, I rely so heavily on fiction to cope. It's one of the few things keeping me going. If I had someone understanding who could write with me without judging, idk. I'd be grateful. 



So I guess this post is kind of just me venting, then asking for some help or just a friend to talk to.



I really like It right now. Stephen King's It. It's like my main fandom. Strange that I find a horror movie comforting, but I love the characters. I wish they were my friends ;w; I even like Pennywise. I think he's cute. But that's enough of that, I don't want to make this post too long. But in terms of fandom I also like lots of anime, and I have cool OCs too! I'm trying my best to be positive but it's really hard.

My one request is that you keep any criticisms to yourself. I just need to heal.",18Aug2020,1
41,"My mom has dorm undiagnosed mental issues and I won’t get into every specific, but I’m wondering why she does this because it really drives me insane, and I would like to know how to talk to her and get her to be rational. 

Apart from thinking she’s literally psychic and knows things no one else can know and knows things no one else feels, she will tell me “you’re going through something I know you are, I can feel it” when I’m completely and 100% fine and happy. So when I tell her that she dismisses me, doesn’t believe me, and basically laughs at the fact that “she knows” and that I’m pretending that I’m fine and not telling her. Nothing I say convinces her. 

She’s currently living some odd states away with my sister and just texted me asking if my brother is okay. I say yes? He’s fine, and she doesn’t believe me, and when I ask her what makes her think that, she says “I just know” and she will not take reality for the truth, only her truth is the truth. She hasn’t even seen us in months and I think I would know if he was fine, I’m around him every day. Why does she do this?",18Aug2020,1
42,I have only been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and can not afford to go to a mental health professional yet. I understand how important it is to get diagnosed and treated by a professional and if my symptoms sound   concerning i’ll move around some extra money and try and get myself an appointment. I’ve been dealing with unbearable amounts of stress lately. I’ve noticed it’s taking a toll on me in ways that I’ve never experienced before. I feel detached from my body when I look in the mirror I don’t feel familiar with the reflection looking back at me. My soul and body feel like two separated units at the moment. I’m not able to form thoughts normally and my memory is increasingly getting worse. I often space out and am detached from reality for long amount of time and it takes a lot to snap me out of it. The worst new experience is whatever the hell is happening to me at night. Slipping into night terrors and presenting physical reactions. All I am aware of in these episodes is trying to verbalize and wake up trying to say “help” so that my room mate can hear me  and help me but no words will come out only a hitch in the back of my throat. She says my entire body shakes violently at night teeth chattering as well. This lasts a few minutes and I suddenly jolt awake after freaking out because I couldn’t speak.  I really just needed to vent. I don’t think anyone in my life takes my mental health seriously and I don’t feel comfortable vocalizing. Has anyone else experienced any of these things?,18Aug2020,1

So... I have been rejected each and every time i have tried to form a relationship between me and any other girl i found attractive.

I'm ugly, a bit overweight and, umm, how to say it?  Really so damn ugly that a dirty rotten shoe looks better than my face and body.
I have had some suicidal thoughts but nothing serious happened, but thats not the topic so...

Each time i look at the mirror i cry, its like a hell for me, i am so ugly and no girl would want a stupid worthless piece of {Censored} like me as a boyfriend.
It hurts me each time i see a couple walking together or spending time together, it makes me feel that something is wrong with me and i don't deserve to be alive compared to these perfect shaped, sized and mentally people i see everyday.


I never had the chance to be in a relationship or even feel what love is.

From one time to another, i imagine having a girlfriend, a normal one, she would be less than normal (ugly just like me, but nobody is as ugly as me though) and with a bit overweight body so she would fit in the role of being a girlfriend of such a loser like me.

I sometimes -when i feel really lonely- i go for a walk and imagine her with me, we speak and vent out to each other (i have even gave her a name).


I dont know whether this is good or not for my mental health, but whenever i do it it makes me want to cry as i feel bad for myself and how bad is my situation so that i had to make an imaginary girlfriend.

I wish something happens to me and i fie because of it so earth would get rid of such an ugly piece of garbage like me.",18Aug2020,1

52,"I’m the oldest cousin in my family with mental illness. I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder at 15 (20F) and I’ve managed to get into a really good college and get really good grades. I am a neuro major planning to apply to med school. A few of my younger cousins were diagnosed with depression and were also hospitalized. But they always say that they think they can still do well in life because I’m still doing well. Especially one of them who also wants to be a physician. 

It sounds great and all but it’s torture. I do it for them to show them that they can also be successful. And I haven’t attempted suicide in a few years because I don’t want to let them and everybody else down but I think about it all the time. Schizoaffective disorder is life long. The psychosis is terrifying, and the depression sucks, and when I say it will never end I’m not being pessimistic. It’s just a fact of the disorder. It won’t. I don’t want to do this anymore but I feel like I’m killing them by killing myself. 

You might not understand the mechanics of the disorder but for those who do:
I’m in a depressive cycle and it’s the worst one in years. The schizophrenia cycle is what I’m assuming is to be next because I’m already starting to show thought disorder symptoms and cognitive decline. No hallucinations or nightmares just yet. Slight delusional ideas/compulsions and some paranoia but not bad yet. If I were to guess I’d give myself another week and a half before that cycle really sets in. 

This summer I switched antipsychotics and got off two antidepressants so my doctor wants to reverse all of it because it is probably what’s making everything so bad right now. He wants to pull me out for the semester and if he hospitalizes me the school will make me leave for a whole year. Plus it will be on my adult record and not sealed like my other hospitalizations.

We focus a lot on healing and moving forward which is all really important. But I really wanted to stress how important it is to let yourself be mad. Someone hurt YOU. Someone upset YOU. Someone made YOU cry and question your worth or your importance and didn’t apologize for it. There is nothing wrong with being angry or sad about that from time to time. There’s nothing wrong with still holding onto that.

As long as you still have the intention to at some point heal and let go, you are okay. There is no rush here. Words and actions can sting, especially from those you thought could never harm you.

We’re both in medical school right now studying for an exam and it’s like I try to help her, and EACH AND EVERY FUCKING TIME, she literally shits on me. No matter what I say to help, she turns it around. 

She started off this study period saying that she didn’t want to hear about the exam from me because she didn’t have time to listen to me worry about it. This hurt a lot guys but I respected it cuz I know she’s got her own stuff to worry about. Her dad passed away last year so I know it’s been a rough year but she shares with me about it since my dad died too several years back. 

Then she doesn’t do well on an exam and texted me about it, upset. 

Then me: you can do this, we have so many weeks left. me repeatedly texting her asking her if she’s okay and what not and then saying ”I know you don’t believe in yourself l, I believe in you. And I’m here for you if you need anything just let me know! I’ll keep my phone on me.” And she never responds so I make sure to repeat my well wishes and offer to bring food or whatever she needs. I also emailed about different strategies we could maybe have her start on to do better. 

Her: would you listen to your own advice if you’re in my spot?! I wasted so many hours last year helping you and now all you said “well okay if ya need help then I guess let me know”. 

Needless to say I was shocked. I literally could not sleep cuz I was worried about her and sent her so many texts and strategies and offered to email a tutor for her. She also knows I’m going through a lot of health issues and had been suicidal just recently. It’s taken me so much to get to this point and I feel like her words are pushing me back down. 

I feel like even with all of my health issues, I would never hurt her like that. I never dump my shit on someone if I’m upset. 

I ended up driving to see her 40 mins away and talked her down and it’s fine now and I can tell she feels guilty.

68,"Today I’ll tell you my stories. I used to be somebody that was identified with negative thinking, and it would make me very anxious.

I went through a lot of pain and bad situations in the past. I was an extremely shy and introverted type of person. I was bullied at school. My communication was terrible. No one liked me at a point in life, too many enemies. I know how the feeling is. 

 I always thought about why this happened to me and continuously beat myself up about it. I was still thinking about what the person feels about me. Why didn’t she reply to my text? Am I doing something wrong? It was constantly killing me.

Someone told me. Try to control your mind and feelings ?? How do I control my thoughts or feelings ?? 

I started meditating. But none of this worked for me. I found that the more I tried to control what I was thinking, the more that it actually was me vs. me…

But fortunately, I learned how to stop overthinking. I learned this the hard way. Now I am going to share all the secrets that make you a better person.

## SECRET 1: ASK YOURSELF, WHAT’S THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN? 

📷

(Pic: After Amazon’s rejection📷)

I remember the final semester in college; constantly worrying about my placement, was overthinking. What was I going to do if I didn’t get any job? Well, surely, my life would be over; all my friends and family will laugh at me. 

That was seriously the thought process going through my 20 years’ head.

Now fast forward three years. I found my bachelor’s degree certificate in some weird place in my house, and I was thinking about my placement. I rejected the final round of amazon’s interview. But today I just thank God for that rejection 

That is the perfect example of what your brain does to you. It starts to freak out with uncertainty. If you don’t clearly define the worst things, your brain will find a way to equate you to getting “no job” to you completely ruling your life. 

Seriously those are your either conscious or subconscious thoughts. What is through? The worst thing that will happen to you is ‘You try your best, and you fail” that’s it. First of all, why should you invest so much money? 2nd you try your best and learn so many things that your friends don’t even know. 

What if someone told me right now.. Go on stage and tell the same story in front of 1000 people. I have basically no public speaking experience. So if I gave a speech right now, it would probably suck. I might be awkward, but I would never, never refuse to do that. Why?

📷

(Pic: I worked really hard for this. But now what should I do with this certificate ?)

Because what’s the worst thing that can happen? It’s not the whole world is going to make fun of me; it’s not that people are going to try to kill me everywhere I go after the speech.

 What’s the worst thing that can happen? They will never ask me for a speech, and the crowd may think that the guy is not a good speaker. That’s it.. but who cares ?? 

So.. in this chapter, you learned, you always need to ask yourself what is the worst thing that can happen? And then, try to analyze your answer, and you will understand how ridiculous most of your worries are. Follow this step if you really want to stop overthinking. 

## SECRET 2. STAYING BUSY

Staying busy is another way to stop overthinking. Now I don’t mean the average working person. Actually, the people who over-analyze things most.

The guy who worked 8h days in the SEO industry, and then started thinking, what if SEO will die or what if my company fired me or what if AI takes full control in the SEO industry? 

I am not talking about that kind of busy person. Here how I like to stay busy… 

Read a book that I like

Doing any online course

Cook something new 

Work on a project I am passionate about 

Now here’s what happens when you do that, your brain can’t think two things at one time. It just doesn’t have the capability. You can try right now. You can’t think about your new project and at the same time, think of how much you eat pizza.

69,"Will going to a therapist be beneficial for an eating disorder? I feel so unstable with food all the time and it seems I only know is extremes: starving myself or binging constantly. I feel like I know what works for me and what doesn’t but obviously I know nothing bc I still struggle so heavily with food!! I just feel like a therapist wouldn’t help but I know that it will help at the same time but ahhh.

Does anyone have any experience in therapy for eating disorders who could give me some advice?",18Aug2020,1

76,"Logically speaking, I try to be as objective and unbiased as I can be when I have moments of reflection. Right now, it just feels like social media has made humanity more tribal than it's ever been in a very long time. It just seems like you're either on one team or another and that you can't think for yourself or have views from either side.

I have to admit, it's become pretty depressing. I've done a little experiment where I've taken breaks from social media, and it does help a bit, but eventually main stream media makes its way to me via phone, TV and what not. I feel like I'll just have to use my internet for shopping and the weather, and just log out at this point. People are tribal, riots, racial tension is increasing, I just can't help but lose faith in humanity and I just stop caring so I become lazy and out of shape because I ask my self what's the point.

Have you ever taken breaks from social media? Did you recently leave social media altogether for good? How do you deal with everything that's going on right now? It just seems like nobody cares about being unbiased or truthful, they just want you to follow your narrative or you're automatically the enemy and I hate it. I thought we'd evolve past this animalistic tribal nonsense by now and find a way to colonize and reach other worlds much faster. It just feels like in some ways our technology has out evolved us and in some ways made us more tribal.",18Aug2020,1

82,"Was born 3 months early.
My mom tried to get me into mental health when I was like 3, for anger issues, they didn’t agree to see me until I was around 7. They told her I’m either bipolar or autistic.
I’m really loud as a kid and emotional and get bullied.

By the time I am 12 I develop an eating disorder and quit talking, also have a severe fear of insects and quit participating in things like gym class.
Refused to go to school more than 30% of the time. 
Self harm and depression.

Then I get sent to a social worker. She spends a year trying to say I’m autistic. The psychiatrist disagrees because I was “making eye contact” therefore just have anxiety.
Was diagnosed with anxiety, ocd and depression.
Put on anti depressants.
Was referred from the social worker to a psychologist. Psychologist spends a year trying to convince me I’m bipolar, psychiatrist disagrees because I’m not “going on shopping sprees, sleeping around, etc.”

Imo his reasons for thinking I don’t fit those diagnoses were kinda dumb. But they took me off the anti depressants because the psychologist kept telling them I was manic... ok.

Moved to a city, worked at mcdonalds(it was awful), was really weird around my roommate, got depressed, called in sick a lot, slept around, got taken advantage of, bought what I wanted, got suicidal multiple times, went to ER and got put on suicide watch, cycled through 3 different eating disorders, eventually got violent with a sibling. Had to move back in with my mom.

Now after I got into an apartment of my own I finally agreed to take meds and go to therapy again.

My dad was abusive and in therapy I was just talking about how shocked I was realizing I could have told the social worker or any psychologist because it wasn’t normal. Just really airing out everything I felt about the things he did.

I took lithium for bipolar disorder but as soon as I gained weight on it I quit. I was pretty deep in an anorexia relapse when I started taking them and two weeks later I was as heavy as I’ve ever been in the last 3 years. I was on and off lithium over the year and picked up alcohol so I haven’t been able to lose the weight, but I know I can’t make myself take them.

In the amount of time since I moved home and started seeing psychiatrists and psychologists I feel like they made my mental health worse..
I never would have started drinking if it weren’t for the lithium weight gain. And in my last visit with the psychologist she actually made me cry and when I walked out I knew I wasn’t going  back. She pissed me off and she wanted to pretend it was something else.
They made my health and motivation worse!

One of the visits with the psychiatrist he said “Oh I don’t think you’re bipolar.. I think you’re ADD with PTSD from abuse from your dad and maybe the bullying in school.. and maybe a few borderline personality traits.”

I just thought this was such a load of bullshit, that they just go “idk everything’s fucked up, you have everything.”
I got a call from mental health asking me one final time if I was going to schedule a new appointment with any member of my mental health team and I said no but I asked for my mental health file. I asked for a copy of my file. I have every right to a copy of my mental health file and it should be given to me.

I asked them if I could have a copy and they said they will close my file if I won’t see someone but that they will call me back in regards to me getting a copy of my file. I even asked them that if closing my file meant they couldn’t have a copy then not to close it.
They told me they would call and get me a copy. They haven’t called so far. 

For kicks, I decided to take one of those online screenings since I might not actually get my file. And I fit not just the borderline traits to a severe degree... but also 7 others, as in 8 of the 10 possible personality disorders.
I can understand where certian pieces of my personality point towards all 8, while I don’t believe I literally have 8 personality disorders I wonder if I could have 1. Because they all involve things I need to work on, things that might tie back to ptsd, pretty much all the reasons I can’t keep friends and have never had a boyfriend, all right there.
The reasons why I feel like my life is meaningless sometimes and I should just end it, not because I’m actively suicidal or sad but because my life might not be cut out for what I thought was my life’s purpose (to be an artist) 
I’m starting to think I’m delusional about who I really am, what I’m capable of. And whether I am far underestimating or far overestimating my potential is completely unclear to me.
All I know is that there is so much going on in my head constantly, I struggle with a bunch of different mental health issues constantly, I have fucked up self image, can’t control things I used to keep very controlled like my eating and feel extremely lonely.
I have a lot of mood swings and I feel like I need to do art/music the fact that I am not stresses me out a lot.
I also feel like I need to find a man, one who will take care of me and I don’t even care if the relationship is strictly sexual attraction as long as I feel wanted.
Anything that gets in the way of those two things just seems to make me mad.

I do love my family and enjoy being with them no that my father is out of the picture, but I can’t even express anything without feeling like everything would be better if I wasn’t there anyway. 

So it’s a lot. Everything is a lot.",18Aug2020,1

84,"so, I recently found out that a ""friend"" of mine has been involved with a group of people who, with nothing better to do, spent their time making fun of, and making up rumours about, me.  Including but no limited to: ""her clothes are so ugly"" ""a guy liked her but she turned him down. she's a jerk"" (not true btw I heard rumours but none have been confirmed and he never confronted me) and so much more.

Whenever I write stuff down I take this metal trash can I have a burn it.

But the sad truth is that they're right, I have no friends and they have the right to pity me. My mom is the only one who understands.

Logically I know nobody is actually watching me, and I don't talk to myself, but it affects the way I carry myself, my facial expressions, the music I listen to in the car. I hyperanalyze everything I do, even completely alone, because I want this nonexistent viewer of my life to think I'm cool/pretty/interesting.

A normal conversation between 2 people would go as such person 1 says something, person 2 would hear what the other person says, think about their response then say their rebuttals. While conversations for me end up like this, person 1 says something, the I say something without thinking about it whatsoever almost like it wasn’t me saying it. Ik it jus sounds like I have a lack of a filter but I know that’s not it, anyways this sensation has lead to a lack of emotions, and a lack of short term memory.

107,"So I have definitely struggled with anxiety and depression my whole life. 

But, I’ve noticed my medication (after trying a few over the last couple years) seems to be fairly ineffective on my depression, and I’m worried it’s because I’m actually undiagnosed bipolar.

My mom was apparently diagnosed bipolar when I was 2. Being the way she is, she never saw the doctor again and said they were full of shit and she was just overworked from having a new baby. 

Whether or not it was bipolar, my mother was pretty severely mentally ill with something. She was close to completely dysfunctional and only really survived because my dad was a huge enabler. 

Because of her illness and my dads denial of it, she was able to create a really controlling abusive environment for my brother and I. 

From a young age I showed signs of depression and anxiety. I would become terrified in elevators, worrying about all the things that could go wrong, like getting trapped having it fall to the ground floor etc. and sometimes I would suddenly be struck with intense sadness (like I would suddenly think about the fact that everyone I knew would one day die). 

And this was happening starting at age five or six. I often felt like I had no control over my thoughts and my brain was tormenting me. 

I would also sometimes feel very energetic and happy and other times very tired. (Which could be normal kid stuff but it always felt strange, like mild euphoria and mild exhaustion just from normal daily activities). I would also have either intense mental clarity or heavy brain fog. 

That pattern of intense anxiety, depression, energy and exhaustion continued for years until I began taking anti depressants.

Then the anxiety mostly went away, as did some of the more severe bouts of depression. Although sometimes they do still happen. But I still feel tired really frequently, and unmotivated. My brain also feels foggy still.

The thing is, I started taking medication around the same time I left home, so I don’t know how much severe mood instability is naturally me and how much it was just a result of my mother’s abuse. 

I will be discussing this with my doctor soon, but any input in the meantime is appreciated. Even alternative potential diagnoses

Note, I have multiple Lovers. Maybe that's the issue. But I just can't find anybody who is willing to commit and offer more then just casual sex. 
I'm just starting to feel like less than human, like a thing. Like I'm literally willing to do just about anything for them and I don't really get anything in return. They never even ask me how I'm doing.

111,"This lockdown has been the worse for me because I've recently started thinking that both my computer and phone are being are being remotely controlled by someone. I already reformatted, changed my password, hell even bought a different computer, and swapped to an iPhone and yet I still feel like they compromised those too. 

I never installed or downloaded shady files, never visited shady websites, always had an adblocker. Hell, even had Arch Linux with strict security controls. My Android phone barely had apps besides my favorite game and some open source apps.

I can't enjoy playing my favorite mobile game nor be able to do college work. I can't even use my phone for more than 15 minutes. I'm using my dad's computer just so I could do some work and browse the internet. 

I feel like they know my passwords, have my personal information, and all the shebang, but for some reason they aren't blackmailing me or breaching my accounts yet. I don't know the goal or purpose. I am a literal nobody with almost no money to my name. Maybe they want me to become like this because ""it's funny"" or some shit.

Just yesterday, I was deleting some emails. Initially, I only wanted to delete sensitive stuff but there was one email that I considered sensitive but changed my mind in the middle. I know I selected it but for some reason when I went to the Trash folder to delete the emails completely, my mind suddenly registered that I didn't selected said email. I then started blaming the hacker that he/she selected it remotely.

I do know that I'm becoming more forgetful but I don't know if I could link it to that because I'm not that forgetful + there are other different triggers.

Everytime I talk in real life, or on a different platform or account online, I feel like there's always a distinctly different personality in me. It's as if I'm playing a character role which is very different every time I talk but still identifies as my own name.

Like not even a small difference, it's always completely different. It's stressing me out and making me wonder if I've lost myself, or never even had a personality in the first place.

116,"Oncw your down, your down for good until you break.

It can be the smallest of things, the tone of your voice, how fast you are walking, the way you are walking, literally anything he dislikes and he'll tear you apart, same with my mum.

I've suffered years of depression because I didn't do well in school. I'm 30 now and only just addressing why I don't feel at home and feel negative when I'm at my parents.

I'm back at my parents due to COVID.

We've addressed everything and things seems like they are getting back on track, but the smallest of things can go wrong, like I'm indescisive, use my dad's toilet (through his office), forget something and come back inside - THATS IT, that's your whole day gone and you are their b*tch and nothing will stop until I break.

It's brutal. Last Friday, I stepped out the door and remembered that I left something for my brother inside so went back to get it. As soon as I did they came down on me like a tonne of bricks.

Now my dad won't drop anything and treats me like a disease.

As a result I feel very emotionally f*cked up. 

He's just gone to bed acting like a little child because I have him a 'one word answer'. He asked if I had cheese with my meal, what do you want an essay?

He basically destroys my self esteem and then complains that I don't talk.

It always turns out the same way, I basically have to beg to get his respect back. It's a vicious circle and then they complain that I'm not getting on with my life.

They NEVER admit they are wrong and it gets to such a point that I either break or get severely depressed because they deny my emotions.

When I break my mum gets involved and gaslights me saying that I need to see a psychiatrist and get counselling.

I've had years of this.

They get off on it, it gives them power and the only time o have fully addressed it was recently and it felt sooooooo good. I felt so good, so content and myself again after all these years.

But my mum didnt like it, not one but, she stayed in her room from when I addressed it until Friday when the 'incident' happend.

When I came home after my brother's on Friday she brand up a load of things that she considered 'abnormal'; the fact that I'd eaten half my chocolate bar and put the rest back in the fridge. The fact that I was indescisive and other very minor things, that looking back, aren't abnormal. Like if I cough too loud.

When I asked her to back off a little, she brang on the waterworks and said she was only.trying to help, making me feel guilty, she then locked herself in her room.

This angered my dad and gave him ammunition to continue treating me like dirt.

And so the cycle continues

118,"I’ve been having trouble with this for the past week or so ever since I saw the first one in my house. Before it was just a small fear at the back of my mind. Now all I can think about is mice. 

The first incident a week ago I saw two in my kitchen. I went to the tallest point in my house, cried, couldn’t breathe, screamed and quivered for ten minutes. I told my mom but she isn’t taking me seriously and tells me to get over it. To make me feel better she set up a couple traps and we got this sonic sound thing in the wall and that thing isn’t doing anything.

A couple days later we caught our first mouse. I was uncontrollably shaking while my mom threw it in the outside trash can. 

A couple days later right before I went to go brush my teeth before bed I saw another one scurry away in the corner of my eye. It shook me up.

About 15 minutes ago I was in my bed. I was about to fall asleep and started hearing loud scratching I immediately climbed out, took my phone with me and as I looked back I saw the end of a mouse going into my closet under the door. 

Right now I feel on the verge of throwing up, I’m super pale, crying and shaking. I feel so helpless. 

Other things I’ve been doing is every step I take I look around and make sure I can’t see mice, it takes me about a minute to get across my small kitchen. I clear out the floors of every room I go into to make sure they aren’t hiding in plain sight. 

My mom is going to take a picture of a hole we found on the foundation of my house and get the landlord to hire someone to patch it up.

124,"I don’t know. I’m trying to post these thoughts different places to find some way to get them to go away. Giving advice helps. Helping people helps. But talking to people...doesn’t help. 

Whenever someone gives me advice it’s not like,”Oh! You know what; that’s great advice! I’ve never thought of it that way before; thank you!!” It’s like, “Yes...while that may be a rational perspective on the current situation it utterly fails to encapsulate the essence of my problem...” Of course I don’t say it like that. I say thank you and politely end the conversation. 

I feel like I’m always saying thank you and politely ending the conversation. Even when I don’t really mean thank you and don’t really want to be polite. Even when your unsolicited advice both begged the question with reference to knowledge or skills you are assuming I didn’t already have. Even when your questions revealed a deep underlying ideological incompatibility with me. Even when the very words you used to ask the question were enough for me to decide I never want to voluntarily engage with you ever again in my life. 

It’s not that I’m smart. I’m not smart and I don’t really think in those terms anyway. I happen to have a fair understanding of basic formal logical arguments. Not even fancy math stuff just basic syllogisms and fallacies. But the basic knowledge, despite getting me nowhere closer to actual objective truth, really just pulls me farther away from other people because I can see the mistakes they make. And there’s always mistakes. And no matter how many times you prove other people wrong it will never convince them that you’re any more likely to be right. 

I don’t ever want to interact or engage with another human again...It’s fine when interactions are ephemeral, singular, thanks for the coffee I’ll never see you again...but the second somebody wants me to engage or god forbid be vulnerable I want to get the hell out of dodge. It benefits me fucking zero. There is absolutely no wisdom you will be able to offer me that will do anything other than ruin this day for both of us more than it already has been. 

I don’t want to be this way. I sound like an insufferable prick. But I don’t want to deal with other people...more. 

When I was 17 I took a set of vows to try to give me like a code or something. Man has to have a code. It was supposed to be about protecting life and saving the world, if it needed it. I’m satisfied with most of the work I did to try to get that to happen. But at the time, I justified it to myself with a girl I was in love with, who had ghosted me. I told myself “I’ll save the world for you. Wherever you are. Even if I never see you again. That’s enough.” 

Well, as romantic and sweet as that sounds, I eventually realized that what she had done to me was traumatic and not okay and she really wasn’t ever somebody worth sacrificing a single second of my life for. I didn’t immediately revoke my vows, because I’m better than that, but now I’m in the awkward position of having vowed to save the world for someone that never really existed. Or, alternately, trying to save it just to prove a point. Let me tell you, it is much less fulfilling than it was before.",18Aug2020,1

128,"Hello,  
I would like to learn a bit about what I'm experiencing.

There are periods of time in my life where I wake up in the middle of the night and for a couple of seconds see stuff. I'm 100% conscious during that time. I'm able to tell myself ""oh, again... boring, gotta keep looking for it to go away"" and it always vanishes in front of my eyes (not even after I blink, it just blends with the background) after about 10-15 seconds.

The things I see are mostly my phobias or stuff I'm currently (more or less) afraid of. Most of the time I'm seeing a giant spider hanging above my head (I have arachnophobia). It's always a different looking spider, most of the time they are unrealistic (have mounds of dirt on the back or are covered in webs sticking out like needles etc.). Once a smaller, normal looking spider ran through my bed next to my head and vanished, so normal ones appear as well.

When it first started happening a few years ago I actually kept jumping out of the bed with fear (especially once when I looked down at my sheets and it was all covered in black, spiky cobwebs).  
One time it got so frequent that I asked my mom to buy me a blindfold to sleep in.

I know it's not just a dream, because my girlfriend experienced my ""condition"" first hand. The weird thing is that when I'm sleeping with her I'm less conscious when it happens. I have less control.  
So I saw bugs (flies and other insects) on the ceiling of her room once. I woke up, looked at it and said unprompted: ""Look, Look at all of them, can you see them?"", it scared the sh\*t out of her of course. Next day she told me I was looking at an empty ceiling, mumbling for a while (saying the above words), then lied down and went to sleep like nothing happened (which is totally not what I used to do when that happened).

Since we're living together now, I'd like to stop scaring her.

There are many other examples. Mint saplings growing out of our bed (after I drank a bit of mojito). A lump of pine needles and moss levitating above my head. A lump of tiny, moving spiders lying next to my head. 

What may be causing this? I know it's not sleep paralysis. It happens very rarely now, but still - had it last night.

134,"OK so OBVIOUSLY there will be plenty of people in this subreddit that have had a level of psychological education, therapists, psychologists etc. 

Sorry but this is not about you guys 😉

I'm talking to the regular people out there that maybe just have a general interest in psychology or mental health. Maybe you or someone you are close to is suffering, told you the symptoms they experience and you are seeking further understanding..

Personally, mental health has played a part throughout my entire life. Whether it was my own or someone else's, I have always seemed answers.

On my journey to understand my own mind and what may or may not be contributing to my thought patterns and behaviours, I learned of these two books. Of course I wanted to find the most accurate information, so what better to use than the manual actual professionals use!! This has lead me to find several books to read through on CPTSD and childhood trauma, along with having a MINIMUM of roughly 12 separate tabs on my phone relating to mental disorders, coping mechanisms, personal experiences... 

It has reached the point that a few people in my life has told me its a slightly obsessive level of research. Particularly as I am in the process (thankfully near the end) of being screened and tested for a number of disorders, and it may be exacerbating my mental state on days im struggling more. I now make a point to not overload my brain, specifically on my lower days.

Now I freely admit that i have not read them both cover to cover, Im fairly certain that that would be too much and too complicated for me to truly understand and appreciate, but I have to admit, the more I learn, the greater the urge to delve deeper into the workings of different types of minds becomes. Having had counselling from the age of around 6(?), it is an area of work that I have long dreamed of doing and I hope to one day actually follow through with going back to education and going down that route.

So, has anyone else  NOT with an educational background in the field, gone and done research this extensive AND what were your reasons behind it??",18Aug2020,1

That sounds really insensitive to say but its something i just think about alot, right now my life doesn't have much meaning in and ive learned to go with the flow and have started really ignoring everything that once bothered me. I dont even feel like im here alot of the time. The only things i really enjoy is anime and painting. They let me ignore everything else. Ive just really detached myself for whats going on and just gone with the flow, quarantine and completing school at home has only enabled that more.

im not sad and in all honestly quarantine is helping me (?) but i know that when i have to make big decisions that pave the rest of my life, im just being sucked up into something i dont even want to do, but i have to theres no other way.

That will just spiral me into a hole of depression and i know ill be stuck and will struggle to get out, i know myself to well.

Ive had suicidal thoughts before when i was in a really dark place (i don't have depression nor have i been diagnosed, i dont want to self diagnose but earlier this year i was stuck for 3 months ) but im in a good place now because i pulled my self out of it after 3 long months because i was scared i was actually going to do something really bad that i would regret and my parents started talking about a doctor.

Its just when i think about my future im not excited and in all honesty im just going with the flow, ik that i'll fall into a pit again, its just a matter of time. And once school ends and i get sucked it this uni shit i'll most likely give in, ill try but ill give in.

What im trying to say is that i didn't plan to stay around for this long and in the back of my head ik i probably wont last very long when things start getting too real and im left to my own devices.

138,"Hi,

So I’m a 20 yr old female and I haven’t been living with either of my parents (split when I was 11) for about 3.5 years. I now live on my own with my partner and my youngest sister who I look after in a different state away from everyone. I lived with my grandparents for about a year while I was still in school. 

Being away from everything has sent me into this weird mental state. I was advised to get away if I could from mental health professionals. Putting distance in between abusive parents and yourself is a good idea if you can manage it. I totally agree, and now I find myself questioning everything. I’m so confused and so depressed. I have body pains and chronic fatigue despite doctors finding absolutely nothing wrong with me.

The pandemic hasn’t really affected me too much, however I empathise with those suffering with it. I live in Australia and was already super depressed anyway. I have GAD and major depression. I’m starting to question whether I have PTSD.

I was physically, emotionally, verbally and mentally abused as a child and especially as a young teen, not to mention being bullied at school mainly as a tween/young teen. My father pretty much only physically abused me sometimes, although his subsequent partners I’m sure were narcissistic or sociopathic. 

My mother has done some horrible things to me, she would constantly scream at me every single day all the time, swearing, calling me names, throwing things at me, etc. when I didn’t do anything wrong. I was a quiet child, shut down, hated confrontation, never dared go near drugs, alcohol, parties, etc. and yet she told everyone I was a horrible child who was out of control. I used to get strange looks walking down the street which made me afraid to go out (small country town). She then would proceed to tell me that she never did anything like that and it was all me and all my fault. This continued for years and really took a lot out of me.

I was also a high achiever at school but that went downhill in my later teens when the abuse really started to affect me physically.

I don’t even know what to do with myself. Does anyone have any suggestions? Obviously I haven’t put everything in this post because it’s long enough as it is. Anything would be much appreciated.",18Aug2020,1

143,"'ve always ignored the possibility of me having it because people have considered me as someone who is intelligent and ""book smart"" and I've always had average to great grades throughout elementary school to university. However, I do possess certain symptoms of ADHD that are of particular concern to me. These symptoms have been present ever since elementary school (I'm almost 24 now)

 • I am very forgetful. I've been locked out of my apartment 3 times in the last 5 weeks. I've been late in paying my rent often as well. When I go grocery shopping I keep finding out that I've forgotten to get some important things after I've gone home even though I've compiled a list of things to buy before I leave home. This happens quite often. I also run around in circles aimlessly a lot in the grocery store.

 • I have difficulty concentrating in conversations sometimes. I do hear what the people are saying but I fail to listen on some occasions. Instead of processing whatever they say, I might have a random song playing in my head. I space out even more whenever the conversation is about something that I have no knowledge/interest in.

 • I daydream a lot and I don't know why. People (friends, family and teachers) have often made remarks about how I am not ""present"" and that my mind is always somewhere else. My friends often think that I'm on drugs because of how ""spaced out"" I look to them. I also have some instances where I feel like I'm experiencing life in the 3rd person and I don't feel like I'm really experiencing things.

 • I'm almost 24 and I've never held a long term job. Past employers have made remarks about my lack of work ethic and initiative. I can't seem to take action unless someone orders me to do something. My tendency to daydream might have something to do with it.

 • I hate to do lists. Whenever I compile a list of things to do I start off strong for a little while before getting distracted by a certain thing/s and ignoring all the tasks that need to be done and I decide to do my own thing.

 • I have difficulty following instructions. I'm in culinary school right now and we cook meals everyday. A lot of the times when I'm given a recipe to a certain dish I forget to include a crucial ingredient, or skip over an important step of creating the dish and it has affected my performance in the kitchen. 

 • I love to fidget. Whenever I'm sitting alone in my room or even out at a restaurant i have restless leg syndrome often and love finger drumming on my table.

 • My friends, family and teachers in culinary school have all thought that I have problems with being organized with my tasks as well as time management. I generally agree with them. I'm a very messy individual and whenever I wake up in the morning I am always clueless as to what I should be doing during the day.

How do you make meditation work, if you have failed to do so on prior attempts?

How do you form therapy sessions around a work schedule?

How do you make yourself more susceptible to help, since most aid sounds impractical?",18Aug2020,1

I’ll lose 2-3 pounds a night by pure sweating. I had a whole bbq meal that sent me into a food coma and woke up drenched and back to my regular weight 😂

It’s been every night since I first started so I can’t help but think the meds do something to me at night? Or maybe that’s because that’s when I take my medicine?",18Aug2020,1

149,"I have been trying to get a job ever since I graduated in 2018 and quit my hospitality job. I got the job on Wednesday/Thursday last week and haven't really done anything for it yet. Training was online so it was easy to pass that but now they're sending me emails about clients and I haven't prepared. Its going downhill too quickly.

Also a couple of weeks ago I got referred to a psychiatrist because my GP thinks I might have bipolar, but I wasn't able to get an appointment before September 24th. So now I'm just waiting. I was diagnosed with major depression and social anxiety 3 years ago.

It feels like this is the first time my effort has really mattered, and I just can't pull through. I felt a plummet like 3 hours ago, it just feels like a spiral.

Any tips on self-meditating? Something that might work for someone with bipolar 2.

150,"Hello, this is my first post.

I am so angry. So frustrated. 

Ive been waiting to make plans with psychologists  for a year now (sometime it was my mistake bc I didnt went to psychiatrist, most of the time theirs) for appointment.

So I finally went  today  and oh my good. I dont know if I imagined but this was like not the person I remember from the last year(just went there once). I did some big test and then we talked for a bit. I felt patronized. She asked me what I want from therapy so I told her to process things from childhood  (trauma), to work on my relationship  and to be a better person. Also I added that I don't  want to just talk bc Ive been talking my whole life about traumas and It's not helping rhat much , I would rather process. 

Lol so here's  problem, she told me I have problems with authority (um?lol?),also she made some kinda jokes  that were  like she was a big joker and i felt very uncomfortable, also it looked so unprofessional  to me. 
Then she started to told me  i am smart and intelligent, i felt it was not sincere and asked her is she's  making fun of me and being sacrcastic.she said no. And I accepted that.

Just general feeling was very uncomfortable and weird  being there, I feel so small after this. I dont know if I'm  imagining  this all or if she is not my best fit. Bc I didnt sleept well so  maybe I was more irritated then usual. I will need to go few times more to see, I guess.",18Aug2020,1

154,"I (22F) wouldn’t class myself as a social person, but I love being around the people I care about. Crowded clubs? No thank you. Drive to the beach with two of my good friends? Paradise.

Obviously lockdown has made seeing people impossible, but as the restrictions in my country are lifting I’m realising that I have maybe one person near me that I could class as a good friend and she has a wide circle of friends that I don’t get invited into. 

I suffered with depression in my teenage years which mostly stemmed from anxiety and serious body issues. I managed to overcome that, but recently I’ve noticed my mental state slipping and it is terrifying me.

I live with my partner (25M) and for two years it’s worked out that if I am in a social mood I go out and see my friends as he is not a social person in the slightest, but talks to his friends constantly while playing games on Discord. 

Recently, it might be my mental state, and the fact he is still furloughed and all he does is wake up and play games while ignoring me until it’s time for us to settle into bed, it’s become really hard for me. I feel like I’m not getting the attention I deserve, and because my one good friend is always busy either working (no problem there) or with her other friends, I sit in my house and have absolutely no one to talk to. Not even on messenger or text. No one. 

I spend time with my family because we are all extremely close, but if they are busy for whatever reason I’m left alone again. And this is when my mind starts reeling.

I am so so SO lonely. My partner doesn’t have the empathy to realise just how much it hurts me, and sitting on my own hearing him have a good laugh with his friends in the office hurts even more. Because of lockdown as well, my body image issues has Claire’s up again because I’ve gained weight, and that’s just another edge of the sword that’s being stabbed into my heart on a daily basis. We haven’t been physically intimate for a month now, and while he assured me it’s because he has no sex drive because ‘he’s lazy’, he doesn’t articulate his points very well and my mind always goes back to ‘we aren’t being intimate because of me.’ 

No one texts me. No one bothers to check up on me. I have made an effort to text first and catch up but the conversation goes stale because of their lack of response. 

I feel like a nuisance because I’m always trying to hang out with my friends, but they’re always busy and end up not seeing my messages until hours later even thought they’re online. To clarify, I don’t blame them, we are adults and have adult lives etc. But when I’m in this state, it really hurts knowing that I am always the one who makes the plans. No one makes an effort to see me, or hang out with me. 

I know lockdown has affected a lot of people’s mental health, me included so I know I’m not alone. But I’ve not been this bad since I was a teenager, and being aware of that is so scary to me.",18Aug2020,1
155,Even about the smallest things. My thoughts always go towards the worst case scenario and I can't ignore or rationally think my way out of it.

156,"For most mental illnesses, doctors don't use brain scans to detect a mental illness in a patient. Rather, it is detected through psychological testing. I just want there to be a brain scan that is open to the public so I can prove to myself that it's ""not all in my head"", and also to prove to my own parents. I sometimes feel like it's all in my head and that I'm making excuses for myself to be a miserable piece of shit even though I have been diagnosed and hospitalized. Plus, my parents don't believe in mental illness and they blame me for it. I mean, I know that brain scans exist, but they aren't used because it's not always accurate. There's no brain scan that tells you ""you absolutely have this"". That's why they are only used for research purposes. I wish there was a brain scan that is used for psychiatric patients. I feel like I will never be able to come to terms with it until I see my own brain on a brain scan.",18Aug2020,1

160,"We've been together almost 2 years. I thought we were perfect. He is deeply in love with me, has been since the first month we met and has made it clear. He is a dream BF- *always* puts me first, always wants to see me, respects me, let's me use his phone/laptop whenever and willingly shared his passwords and bank details! He is a very anxious person and this became clear to me 8/9 months into dating when his mental health took a nosedive. 

It started with him obsessively confessing to any bad things he has ever done or said/thought, most of it was really stupid, like making a mean joke when he was 12 or reading weird erotic fan fiction at 13/14. Everyday for WEEKS, there was a new thing for him to confess, he couldn't relax until he cleared his conscience. Then he became overwhelmed with the fear of being in the wrong relationship and being a bad person for staying with me if he finds other women hot and sometimes wants to see his friends instead of me? Then it morphed into the fear of ""what if I'm a pedo because I can find a kid pretty/cute and what if that means I am one, even if I never thought I could be until now, unless I'm so in denial I never noticed for 19 years?!?!"". It's this *one* theme that makes me think I need to leave. He freaks out he is one in denial and looks for signs he is one, like finding Emma Watson hot despite her flat chest or  finding me hot depsite being short? I ask him to reassure me he isn't over and over again and have asked him trick questions for months. 

We are deeply unhappy- me because the perfect guy might be a p, and him because I make his OCD worse by doubting him so much when OCD is essentially ""the doubting disease"". I am consumed with guilt because Im either worsening his OCD OR I'm entertaining a p in denial? We haven't had sex in a month and we haven't been able to meet for more than an hour without me getting triggered and asking him yet again or testing him or crying? He isn't *officially* diagnosed but has been using online therapy for the last 2 months and she said he probably has OCD since the first session and has sent him resources for it and treated him as if he has it? I feel like maybe dropping it and seeing if he gets over it in 3/4 months and then catching him off guard, but it feels so dishonest to stay when I'm not 100% sure he is innocent and we'll have been together over 2 years by then, ending a 2 year relationship sounds so much worse",18Aug2020,1

162,"I have talked to countless of suicidal people. I have known people who did it. A cousin of mine just died that way. They had the same combination of diagnosis I do.

Please, reach out. And please, be someone who graps someones' hand when they reach out. So many people have been lost. Please, if you can talk to people just say it. Come here or other places sometime and talk to a suicidal person who posts about it. Mental illnesses kill. Be there and help another fighter.

These people I know were always misfits. The society couldn't see their value and they couldn't see those who valued them. I have attempted suicide and survived. I was never happy because I survived. I don't like myself. But these people are needed. I hope I have helped someone. I hope I have helped people to survive the night. I live for a girl who survived at least for a while and thanked me. J, I wish you are doing great! I wish you are out there! I think about her when I feel that way. I take it personally when someone kills themselves. Another fighter fell. The next one could be anyone. Even me. 

And just being here we are fighting. Not just with our own struggles but for others too. Others who struggle with the same thing. You always feel alone but you aren't. If you find a way out or a way to survive you can help others. A consept of a wounded healer has existed for a long time. It's not bullsh*t. It could be you. It's not something you get praised for but it saves lives. It's a silent job but you can save lives just like a firefighters can. 

One woman I kind of knew is propably dead now. She had a blog about the issues we both were dealing with. She has deleted her blog and disappeared. She never realized how important she was to the community. It is her choice if she is dead and I don't blame anyone who went that way. She struggled so much. But I don't think she ever saw her own value. She was always surprised when people came to her and thanked her. She thought they lied. She propably saved lives herself.

What connects these people who I know and who ended their own lives is being a misfit and feeling like they aren't appreciated. Most were intelligent and talented too. They didn't realize that. They never felt that way. They had weaknesses but it wasn't their fault. It was something society didn't appreciate but there are people who don't care. The greates people in our history have mostly been misfits. There is a reason why these genes have survived. 

It's always more complicated but people who survive tend to have others who see their good side. This family member of mine was artistic. Talented too. So many people could have helped. She was (mildly) authistic too (I also am). She had much more issues with finding words for things. It was difficult to help her. Please tell these people their worth! Even when it's embarrassing. Being embarrassed is a small price for someones' life. I wish I would have sent that freakin post card I thought I should. She had no friends. I should have send her many even if she never responded.

It doesn't matter if you are talented or not though. Some great painters and professional mucisians aren't. They just practiced and learned. You can fucking learn. Step by step. 

Even if you have no energy to learn you can experience. Drop everything bad society tells you. I once walked into a lake with my clothes on and all that. Ice had just melted. It was cold. The endorphine rush came and I changed that day. People are always telling you how to live your life but those rules are bogus. Made up. If you do what you need to do you are actually pretty free. People will always judge you. You might just as well have fun. 

And please, if you feel suicidal just think about everything. Make a list of your issues and divide those issues into doable parts. Start from the easiest one. And try everything. Hope is there. If you try many times the luck can strike. Come here, tall to people, talk to anyone. I wouldn't mind it if someone called me in the middle of the night if that was the case.

Think about people you care for. Would you say things you tell yourself to them? If not you are too mean to yourself. It's hard to stop. But imagine a child you once were. They are actually the one who hears those insults. That part of your brain is still there and feels like you did back then. Feelings get filtered but it's the kid who feels them. You are the adult who could be between that kid and that negative demon that's your illness. Protect that kid.

And if you are going to die anyway just go crazy. Spend your money, go to places, talk to people, have sex and all that. If you are going to die it does not matter. 

Also, if faith could save you just go for it. Let religious people try their stuff on you. It can be ok. If it saves your life just go for it. It has saved my friend.

Please help others and reach out when shit hits the fan. Good times are worth fighting for. I have lost 13 years of my adult life for mental illness. Actually 32 right now. But every good day is worth it. Every sunrise I can enjoy is worth it. Every time my cat comes to sit in my lap and I can actually feel good about it is worth it. I got nothing. But I can see the blue sky and feel the wind on my face. Fight for that. It was worth it for me. Humans weren't made for modern riches anyway.",18Aug2020,1

I'm not sure if this is the best place to post, but might as well give it a try.

I have quite a few mental issues. Some of them really get in the way of having friends I can connect with. I've found that the few people who were the exception were similar to me in this regard. Nobody can understand my bullshit unless they're living through something similar themselves.

Since I've lost the last person I could talk to about my experience of existence openly, I guess I'd like to meet someone new. Someone who's also fighting hell in their own head every day, and would like to be understood by another human.

On top of my depression, ED &amp; BDD I’ve got this a-hole of a mental health problem - trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder). We’ve been coexisting for over 15 years, with shorter periods of remission and longer periods of pulling. 

I’m pulling out only eyebrows (had to have permanent makeup done - I’m the chick with obviously drawn brows) and eyelashes (I’ve ditched the falsies about 3 years ago). Not a single therapist could figure out the triggering event which started it all in my teens.

I’ve just gone through a nasty heartbreak and boom! no more lashes for me. I’m a grown ass woman and I’m tired of drawing finger-thick wings...

I have constant panic and anxiety attacks yet I convince myself that it’s not real and i’m “faking” it. My brain works differently. While everyone around me can  handle situations and minor inconveniences I convince myself everything is the end of the world and my anxiety is spurred on by absolutely anything and everything yet I still deny my mental health. I convince myself I was wrongly diagnosed. There’s people worse off than me and THEY have anxiety and depression but for me no no I can’t possibly.

175,"Hello all. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening. Wherever you are in the world! I hope you’re all doing well and keeping safe. While we are all in a middle of the pandemic, millions of people around the world have to **listen** to strict orders. That order is lockdown, no leaving your house/apartment. I understand that some of you are struggling with this. Because of that, I will try and make your time at home a little better by suggesting you different PODCASTS you can listen to while in lockdown. :) 

Whether you’re struggling with Mental Health or trying to support someone who is in need, listening to podcasts can help you find support and a sense of community. In my opinion, podcasts are brilliant. They are relaxing and you can listen to them all day long. So, the podcasts I will recommend covers a range of different topics on Mental Health, from anxiety to bereavement. 

- **Happy Place**

This podcast is terrific for everybody, especially if you’re from the UK. It is a British based podcast. It is hosted by Fearne Cotton. Fearne has managed to get herself a range of different celebrities on her podcast over the years, with the likes of Tom Daley, Stephen Fry, Matt Haig and much more. So, what’s the purpose of this podcast? This podcast focuses on celebrities that open up about their very own Mental Health issues. The podcast series is very light-hearted and often quite moving. If you have any time during the day, I suggest you give it a listen!

- **WTF With Marc Maron**

Personally, MY favourite podcast. It has nothing to do with the fact that Marc Maron is one of my favourite actors.... Ha! WTF with Marc Maron doesn’t necessarily go deep into the world of Mental Health, but it does pop around here and there. But, Maron is very open about his upbringing with anxiety and traumas he has experienced. Maron has held many big name celebrity interviews on his podcast, from award winner actor Kristen Bell to former U.S. President Barack Obama. During these discussions, Mental Health often pops up. Highly suggest!

- **Bryony Gordon’s “Mad World”** 

The tagline for this specific podcast series goes “It’s totally normal to feel weird”. During each episode, this is what Bryony Gordon intends to do. Just like Maron, Bryony Gordon has had many big names on her show, including Mel C and Gizzi Erskine. 

- **The Dark Place**

Hosted by Joel Kutz, this podcast series aims to break the silence by talking to ordinary, normal people from all around the world about times in their life when they have felt really low and in a dark place. While listening to this podcast, expect stories about anxiety, stress, depression, trauma and of course, Mental illness. This podcast is there for anyone in the world that wants to break the silence. It’s a great concept to get YOUR story out in the open. 

- **The Hilarious World Of Depression**

Last in the list is “The Hilarious World Of Depression”, hosted by John Moe. This podcast aims at anxiety and depression. This is a series of funny and moving conversations with some of the top comedians around the world, such as Andy Ritcher, Jen Kirkman, Paul F. Tompkins and much more. The postcast goes deep by talking about the comedians about their depression and how they are dealing with it. This podcast series attempts to break the stigma and to create a sense of community through these conversations. 

These are just some of many Mental Health podcasts that are out there. If you have the time, give them a listen and let me know what you think! Cheers guys. :)",18Aug2020,1
176,So i’ve never told anyone this but i’m pretty sure my parents know of it and I start therapy in November and was planning to tell the therapist about this. In 6th grade I started to twist and play with my hair a lot but it started to get bad and it would knot up so I would pull it out. Because of this I had some bald spots so my mom took me to a barber to have him help cover them up. They’ve healed up now and I don’t really do it to my hair anymore but I know that my mom knew I did it back then. After that I started tearing off small pieces of napkins and toilet paper and I roll them up into very small balls. It’s a little gross but I would even do the same thing to my leg hair. I’m a freshman in college now and I still haven’t been able to stop. I can go periods of time without it but I still do it daily basically without even knowing. I won’t really even realize it and the next thing I know I am doing it. What would cause this? I think that I have some anxiety but would that cause this? Sometimes I think maybe adhd or autism but i’m pretty sure I have neither of those. Sometimes I even do it in public like in the cafeteria a college or at my friends house but it is basically automatic at this point. I try my best to be desecrate about it but sometimes I worry that other people have seen me doing it. I would really like to stop not only because it is really embarrassing but I also feel that it is having an adverse effect on my fingers like i’m getting early arthritis or something from balling them up so tight. I definitely feel like this isn’t normal behavior for a 19 year old but I still do it. Why? What could cause this and how could I stop it? Please help me out. I will read ever response.

179,"I have D.I.D. (formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder) and I also suffer with Bipolar disorder as well. I know where the alter personality comes from. I had a very strict, domineering mother and a few very mean abusive female teachers from Kindergarden up until 4th Grade. So, I know that all five women had influenced (created) this evil, mean abusive old bitch within my head. I had suppressed a lot of school memories and didn't start to remember that stuff until I was in my late thirties. The voice of the mean old woman didn't really come out til that time either. Psychiatrists kept telling me that Multiple Personality Disorder didn't exist. I know that's what this is though. It is not Schizophrenia, this is a second person in my brain/mind that is worse to me than ANY of the women who abused me when I was a kid. 

I have no alters that are children. Only the mean ass old bitch and her ""friend"" (another old  lady who is mean) who is there to boss me around, make fun of me, scream at me to hurry and do things, everything has to be done right and 100% perfect. And on time. There's no excuse for taking forever to do something. Everything must be done fast and perfect. No making messes in the kitchen. If there is a mess made, the two bitches scream and yell at me about how sloppy I am. I hate having this damn disorder. I have wondered why I only have the two women personalities instead of a child alter too like a lot of people do with D.I.D.? The only ones I have is those mean old bitches.

Im so frustrated every god damn night is a battle against my mind that i cant handle.
Ill have an intrusive thought then if its worrisome enough ill start believing this happend or that happened and even though its impossible,ill still think it happen until i move on to the next worry. I cant handle this all every day.

182,"For so long I’ve had such a low self worth, and the feeling that I’m no good for anyone and that people’s lives would genuinely be better if I weren’t in it is growing rapidly. I don’t know if these thoughts are causing the nonexistent self worth or the other way round buts it’s a viscous cycle. 

When I was a teenager especially around 15 I self harmed a lot, eventually I sort of grew out of it and haven’t don’t it in about a year, but recently I keep thinking about it more and more, I haven’t done anything but the thoughts are making their way back. 

I think all these thoughts are here because I genuinely feel like I’m either a burden or hard work for people. I don’t feel like anyone actually enjoys my company or wants to be around me, more just that they put up with me because of some other reason. I have this deep feeling that my SO doesn’t care for me that much and all I do is irritate and annoy him and he’s only with me to entertain his boredom.

184,"This is probably not the right place to put this but...

I have these random moments almost all the time where I just realise I exist...which I know is really strange but I don't know how else to put it. Sometimes I'll just be sat or lying down randomly thinking that I exist and it brings dread to my heart; my heart sinks and I feel light headed then begin to cry. (I just reread this and ngl it's kind of funny but in the moment it isn't)

Another thing is I think (not saying for definite) I have death anxiety. it's not really how I die that scares me but what happens after. I think about what if I go to hell (ironic since I'm not really religious) then I'm tortured for all eternity, I think what if there is nothing but I'm still conscious,...and so on. That also brings me a sinking feeling then I struggle to sleep due to that fear, my dreams where I'm dying and sometimes I stop breathing in my sleep. 

Lastly, time is so weird in my head. For example, events that just happen will immediately feel like a distant memory and one that I didn't experience at all so I question if it happened or not. Then I struggle to think about what happened in that situation or if I made up some aspects of that memory. 

So yeah...just needed to get my strange behaviour off my chest a little. Does anyone else have these same moments? Or am I just out of it? Might delete this later.

186,I keep procrastinating on the task on hand and it's seriously messing up my performance in school  My muscles are tired right now and I want to sleep but the more I take a break the more I have a tendency to lie down and do nothing but imagine instead of acting. This has been a cycle to me since the start of my school and I don't like it and now I have this constant worry of restarting the school level.

187,"Considering going in. I went once when I was 17(I’m 20 now) and it was a good experience. But I went to a kid one. As an adult, is it worth it? Do they help you?",18Aug2020,1
188," 

Full disclosure: I am on the autism spectrum, so I may say some things that may come across as rude. That is not my intention. Just as some people struggle with maths or reading, I struggle with social cues. I genuinely intend no harm.

So I am 22 and have just graduated from college. I have never kissed nor gone on a date. I have only had two sexual experiences.

My main insecurity when it comes to women is that they will find me boring and too nerdy. On more than one occasion, I have been attracted to a woman who was actually interested in more aggressive and stereotypically masculine men (muscles, tattoos, bad attitudes, etc.). These were attractive, intelligent, well-educated, women who I had good conversations with. I even know one woman (27), who has two very good degrees, is somewhat nerdy, and is pretty good looking, who risked her job by flirting with a student at a college she worked at because he was muscular and riddled with tattoos. I cannot imagine a woman risking her job for a man like me.

The reassurance I get is always along the lines of 'Oh, well women may like bad boys in college but once they get tired of them they will want to date guys like you.' The reason that is not very reassuring is that it makes me feel as if they are settling for me. It is like when I choose to have a fruit cup in lieu of some chips when I am trying to lose weight; I still want the chips, and there is something about the fruit cup that is not satisfying. So when I see women gush over say, Jason Mamoa or Billy from \*Stranger Things\*, it makes me worry that even ones who date me are just going to be settling with me just as I settle with the fruit cup.

I have been working out to lose weight and build muscle, partially in the hops that it will make me more attractive. However, I worry that even if I attract women, they will lose interest when they realize that I am actually a bookish nerd.

These feelings of self-esteem were certainly exacerbated by the toxic 'friendships' I had in college. Many people would go out of their way to be jerks to me, which I something I never actually understood.",18Aug2020,1
190,"The past few weeks have been rough to me and I haven’t gotten enough sleep for 2 weeks because of school requirements. I go to sleep at 2am, wake up at 6-7am (at first, I set alarms but the past few days, I just wake up at 6am automatically) and then, I chug a mug of coffee, do work the whole day and sleep again at 2am.

This week, I got really tired already. I feellike I couldn’t force myself to work. I became afraid of mornings or even just waking up. Yesterday, I started crying just after I woke up because I know that i’m gonna work again and write. I thought that I wish I just never woke up at all since I’m really really tired already.

191,"My mum is not a good mum, she can be emotionally and psychologically abusive. She used to have huge anger issues, she still has (as she first gets angry then thinks and never apologizes later) but it's not as bad as it used to be.

I was in an extremely dark place in highschool. I almost got expelled as I missed almost 50% days. I barely studied and then completely stopped because my depression, anxiety, and social phobia got so bad. 

I was scared of my mother then. We didn't live together but she would come every weekend and often would randomly come during the week when I missed school again. Because of that, I lived in constant fear of her bursting through the door, even when I was completely clean. I even once cut myself, very deeply, solely to avoid her anger as she would scream for the whole apartment to hear, wreck havoc in my room, and beat me. She would threaten me then with more serious beating telling me that I wouldn't be able to do anything about it because I have self-harm scars so no one would believe me. She has a good reputation. She even told me once to get a knife and butcher myself or to jump out of the window because she can't deal with me anymore.

She's a person that made me have a panic attack because I took a nap long before I started being chronically tired. She explained later that it was because she thought I could be outside meeting new people or something. To this day, it's the worst argument we ever had. It doesn't matter she didn't beat me then. I felt so cornered by her, that if I could I would have jumped out of the window just to make it stop. I was literally, and figuratively in the corner with her shouting at me, not making any sense and bringing up past stuff that was unrelated. All the while making a martyr of herself and telling me it was my fault I was bullied in elementary school. That she's not surprised they didn't like me. 

She did and said a lot of vicious things even when I was a perfect child. She always overreacted so I developed a habit of lying and denying everything without thinking. So of course, I always did everything I could to hide the truth from her. And to avoid her. 

I started going to the basement on weekends. I would sit in the darkness alone just to get away from her. I had a sleeping bag there (I used to be extremely exhausted, just like my older brother, in highschool but it subsided a lot this year) so I went there to sleep whenever I couldn't bear it anymore as she wouldn't allow me at home. I did everything to be able to spend as much time as I could there. I even pissed there just to avoid going home.

Then everything got better as I passed my exams with above-average scores and the longest vacation of every student in my country started. I chose university far away from home on purpose, so she wouldn't be able to visit and so I could make up excuses for not coming home. 

And it all magically got better. I stopped being as tired, my mental health dramatically improved and I was doing great at uni. When the first math exam rolled around and only 3 people passed in my course, I was one of them. It wasn't perfect but day by day it got better and better. I started eating better, cleaning my room more often, and studying more regularly. For the first time in years, I even got a bit outgoing. 

But then the pandemic happened. I didn't want to go home but after weeks, mum finally convinced me. I didn't go home home, but to the place, I lived in highschool as nothing in this world will be able to make me go to my hometown. And so the weekly visits started again. I got depressed again. I lost all motivation to study. I wanted to study abroad but I couldn't go because of my mental health so I chose this course as a substitution. It wasn't as international as I hoped. Half of my course dropped out even before the pandemic and more started talking about switching courses due to different reasons. 

Time passed, I cried a lot because I couldn't focus (partly because I overworked myself during exam season) and couldn't keep up. I was getting more and more behind. Then two professors wrote me particularly rude emails, I tried to salvage subjects I still had chances at but ultimately I gave up. I couldn't make myself work even with this much pressure and stress. I know I haven't tried hard enough then, but I seriously couldn't make myself study at that time. And I'm a person that can study 12 hours a day, all breaks substracted when I feel good.

My mum doesn't know about this but she's going to find out soon. I told her I wanted to resit my highschool exams and try for university abroad months ago and it wasn't going well, but now I have no hope for it to ever happen. I knew beforehand, that she doesn't want me to stay in my country and she was disappointed a year ago because she couldn't brag about my university and kept talking about her friends' kids and my past classmates and how great they are so I thought she would be more on board with the idea. 

However, she wasn't 100% against it so I persevered. It's my dream after all. Recently she made me agree to ultimatum but the next day it turns out I misunderstood her. It wasn't ultimatum but conditions. One is impossible and the other extremely difficult. One is to pass my first year of university and the other to find a job, which I've been looking for the past month and a half. COVID really made that difficult.

The issue is, she can't possibly find out that I haven't passed my first year of university. My life would go back to how it was in highschool but 10x worse. I can only imagine the stuff she would do. And I don't have confidence I'll survive that again. My life will be completely over. Could be because of what will follow or that I'll kill myself. 

Please, I need some advice.",18Aug2020,1

Friends are the bulk of my livelihood, and I KNOW I love them, but it just doesn’t feel that way. I don’t even know who I really am. I don’t feel depressed. I’m not sad.

196,"I just wanted to let all those parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, teachers, siblings, basically everyone how serious mental health issues is. 

Way too often do you push aside how your loved ones, friends when they try to seek out and show you that they are indeed suffering. It may not be physically and cannot be easily seen, but it is there. You know yourself that you’ve seen the signs they show but you chose to ignore it and pretend it doesn’t exist. All the way till the unfortunate happens and then what? You sit there dwelling in your own self pity in why they didn’t seek for help. Well maybe they did. I’m pretty sure they wanted to live much more than you wanted to, but they just wanted all the pain and suffering to stop. A hurting person will almost always try to reach out for help before ending it all. However, nobody looks. 

This hurts a lot. Especially when the ignoring comes from someone the person loves. Yes, I’m talking to you parents out there. Do you know how much your own child crave for your validation and love? You think I wanted to have these issues that make me literally hate life? I wanted to be the perfect child for you too. 
I understand that parents have their “face” to protect. Especially being in an Asian household, you mustn’t do anything that disgraces your family. Having mental health issues included. But is this really as important as your own child’s life?

198,"Firstly, to clarify I've already been checked out at the ER yesterday. 2 EKGs, Ultrasound, Chest X-rays and Heart Enzyme tests among other things and being seen by three doctors assured me that my heart is healthy and that I'm fine, and that it's almost certainly due to anxiety. The Chest tightness/Pain and the anxiety that accompanies it/comes with it can be anything from annoying to debilitating and interfere with my sleep - it's probably contributed to the insomnia that has stopped me from sleeping well - if getting any sleep at all for several days. The pain/pressure comes and goes, sometimes at a whim and sometimes due to me triggering myself/causing myself anxiety accidentally - or occasionally on purpose to test the waters. In fact right now as I type this I'm in some measurable but bearable discomfort. I have an intake appointment for a Psychiatrist the Friday after next (which is absolutely forever in my current situation) - unfortunately it's with a LSCW who has to process me before I see the Psychiatrist, which means it might be who knows how long until I can actually get medical help for this. I suspect I'll be prescribed a beta-blocker for the physical symptoms and maybe new antidepressant - I currently take Zoloft - for the mental ones, maybe even a Z-drug for sleep.

199,"I have been diagnosed with seven different things throughout my life.
Borderline personality disorder, anxiety, depression, insomnia, EDNOS, psychosis, and most recently ADHD.

My ADHD is my biggest struggle right now. It's only gotten worse and worse as i've gotten older, and now, the hyperactivity and inattention is destroying my life and makes me feel like i'm crawling out of my skin daily. 
I was finally able to start looking into therapy and medication options for my ADHD all the way back in March. It's August, and i still have not been put on medication. I did start therapy recently, and it can be helpful, but seems like she doesn't give a fuck about me most of the time. 
My treatment has been consistently put off and scheduled to a later date. Obviously, due to my mental problems i'm very impatient, so this has made it ten times worse.

I think this is my biggest flaw. I never wanted to hurt her and I feel like shit. I want to change myself and never lie to her ever again. I totally understand if I got hate for this but please help me, I don't want to hurt her again

216,"Hello everyone,

I'm sorry for my english in advance, it's not my first language...I'll try my best to be as clear as possible ! 

I am 28F living in Canada. I have a weird rollercoaster of a journey in terms of navigating my mental health, but to put it briefly: I was misdiagnosed with BPD at 19, which was reevaluated recently to SdPD, OCD and Generalized Anxiety ; with indications that there might be a neurodevelopmental issue (to which order I am unsure...I need to meet with a neuropsychologist soon to confirm this diagnosis or establish if there is something else).  I was always very iffy about the diagnosis of BPD, and felt like my concerns were often brushed aside or twisted to fit some sort of narrative I could not relate to. However, I was adamant to get better and thought maybe she was seeing something I wasn't. But after a bad accidental poisoning with my prescribed medications, I thought it was time to adress this with a new doctor, which explains the gap in between this diagnosis and the new one.

To my knowledge, I have no issues regarding psychosis or any of the sort. But I am feeling constantly confused and I have a hard time decoding social situations, my own emotions and those of people around. So, I'm very happy with the fact that I have very few relationships, and my main source of socialization consist of my parents, my brother and my significant other.

Now, to my concern : My family is a weird bunch...My parents had my brother and I very young, and we grew up in an household where respecting your parents was required, affection was earned and where punishments could be issued for the smallest mistake (Didn't score a goal at your soccer game today ? Here is a punch in the knee kind of things). They always repeated to us that it wasn't abuse, just discipline and that they would ""show us what abuse is"" if we continued to disrespect them. However, I do have a few good memories, which makes it hard for me, even to this day, to really figure out what happened in my childhood.

I wouldconsider my relationship with them today as good, if only in small dosage.

Their humor mostly consist in making fun of each others, which can be very surprising to outsiders. Most often, I don't understand they are joking and end up feeling very bad about myself (my SO also pointed out that their jokes were sometimes a bit cruel). My parents and brother, despite being well aware of my mental health issues, also have this game together which mostly consist in making me believe things (Im very naive) and telling me years later that it was a joke, or to make me doubt my own memories by saying it never happened.

 I am really not proud to say this, but to use as an example that came back recently, I punched my brother in the face once years ago : a classmate lent me an instrument for pictures in high school, only to find him in my room basically mistreating that instrument. He had an habit to go into my room to find things I could be punished for and I guess it was the final straw when he decided to mess with it, even after telling him time and time again to not do that. My mother and brother were reminiscing this ""funny"" moment last Saturday in front of my SO and his new girlfriend, but everything out of the story was changed : there never was any instrument (despite me having pictures with it), I was never in the possession of said instrument, and it apparently didn't happen this way . My action was described as totally free and out of nowhere because I was mad I could not have this new gaming console (?). Now, i had an interest in video games, but not that much... But funny, right ? 

So, when I came back home after this visit, I had a panic attack : What if my memories are fake ? Did anything that ever happen to me was just taken out of proportions ? Was I just attention seeking or clingy ? Why can't I understand these jokes ? Am I just dumb ? 

I'm so lucky to have such a supportive person as a partner, but he wasn't in the picture back then so he can't say for sure. After all, there is 3 persons backing this story...

So, I thought about having an outside perspective, to try and to look at it with a bit of distance and  find a logical explaination. I'm scared I might be losing it... 

Thank you for your help and perspective.",18Aug2020,1
217,"""You're not entitled to love."" Easy for you to say knowing you will be having sex with your SO later today.  Why are you entitled to love?  I guess you are just superior to me.  I'm sorry I had the audacity to be born into your world.

I’m scared about what’s going to happen and don’t know if this is the right thing. I cry and shake when I think about what happened, but I keep worrying about what’s going to happen to my parents. I’m scared to tell people about what’s going on and don’t feel like I can deal with any of this. All I want is a new start. I don’t like getting in trouble and I feel like reaching out for help will do that. I don’t really know my minds so messed up right now. I bite my fingers whenever I start to cry and scratch my neck when I can’t bite them anymore. I’m so scared of everything. I don’t know what’s going to happen. I don’t know what we’ll do. I’m worried about not being able to do the stuff I wanted to do. I’m too scared I keep overthinking, all the things they’ve said and what going to happen. Everything’s such a blur. Is our situation even bad? I feel like my heart won’t stop racing, I just want to stop worrying. My parents aren’t the worst, but my mind becomes so foggy with them.

Not being able to cry is also very relatable to depression. I’ve been able to cry on command since 7th grade (I’m going to be a freshman in high school this year) but it just isn’t the same.

221,"I feel like whenever I look back at my past there are certain moments in my life that are more prominent than others. I feel like there are moments that made me realize that something was truly wrong with me. I don't mean that in a bad way, I'm using the word wrong because that's just how I felt when I first experienced some of those things and to some extent I still believe that. 

There is a particular incident in my life that I consider to be one of the most significant moments that made me realize that I seriously needed to get some help. It was a few years ago, somewhere around the time when I'd first realized that I was depressed. I had called a national helpline because I didn't know what to do about these feelings that I'd been having for quite a while, they told me to take a test and asked me about my score on that test. They told me that I was depressed and needed to talk to someone about getting some help so I went to my mom. I told her that I thought I was depressed and she was surprisingly supportive.

During that time I was undergoing some treatment and she told me to tell that doctor about this so that he could maybe help me with what to do about this or how I could get some help but when I told the doctor he told me to delete that test from my phone and that there was nothing wrong with me. He told me not to look at such things and not to contact that helpline again because these people would find a way to get some money out of me. Of course I didn't believe any of it and tried to argue with him but my mom believed him completely. 

After that day my mom started treating me differently as if there was something wrong with me and the smallest  thing could make me explode. This lasted for a few weeks before things went back to normal but a few days after everything went back to normal, me, my mom and my best friend were talking and my mom kind of broke down about me being a bit distant and not talking to her about the things that bothered me.(Now what I did next might sound shitty but I have a reason for doing that.) I walked out of the room and let my best friend handle her. I didn't do it because of some petty reason but I did that because seeing my mom cry made me feel uncomfortable. This is where the part about me realizing how fucked up I'm comes up. I didn't feel uncomfortable because my mom rarely shows such strong emotions or because I'm generally uncomfortable when people cry (which are both true statements). I mostly felt uncomfortable because I didn't feel anything, I know this sounds contradictory but the thing is that when I saw my mom cry I was supposed to feel some sort of empathy but I didn't feel anything I didn't feel even remotely sad or bad for being the reason that my mom cried. I didn't feel any empathy towards her and I freaked out which led to me walking out of the room. A while later my best friend calmed my mom down and she came to me and asked me if everything was okay and I said I didn't feel anything. She was obviously confused by this and asked me what I meant and I told her what I was feeling or not feeling really.

This is one of my most vivid memories because to this day I remember every emotion I felt. After that day my mom and I grew more and more distant. Now I'm at a point in my life where I can't stand any sort of physical contact with her, granted I don't like physical contact with anyone but with her it's ten times worse.",18Aug2020,1
222,"I've recently ended a relationship because my bf got somebody else pregnant in a one night stand when we broke up last year. He chose the baby and decided to erase me in his life completely.

225,"Hi! I'm here looking for some advice regarding my mental health.

I have an awful habbit of planning certain events or things in my life very far ahead to every last detail. I always presume things to go exactly the way I imagined (my dreams are unrealistic and almost impossible to achieve in reality) but that is never the case. Once some detail gets out of place and the rest of the plan starts suffering because of this is freak out. I don't lash out at others or anything like. I  lose all my motivation to carry on and have a break down.

My life in general is all over the place and I am awful at planning but very chill about everything. The only things fixed my life are these dumb dreams about certain events and once the only fixed things in my life aren't so fixed I freak out.

I am talking about some dumb details like my mother setting my appointment onto another day and to another place or the fact that some piece of clothing can't be worn to the event I wanted to.

I can't shake the feeling that whatever is going on, whatever caused them to be unreachable, is my fault, that they have both seen through to my core and decided to no longer put up with me. It would be fair, as I've ghosted one of them out of pure anxiety. The other person is one I'm deeply attached to, who you could say I love. We've had a very intense friendship.

Since we were unable to meet for camp this year, due to COVID, I decided to develop a Minecraft server that the campers can log onto, despite camp being closed. We haven't been doing too well the passed couple months. Campers are not logging in. So, we decided to create a re-launch video.

So, I'm on the server, recording our staff playing. And there's this one person whose killing the mood. I've had issues with them in the past, and it's clear that they are still resentful towards me. They are very rude when I'm around and they avoid talking to me. We were still trying to get everything set up; I had some bad internet and couldn't figure out how to work my recording program. This person kept rushing us to begin and rushing me to tell them what to do. They said that they weren't on board with the script I had created, and stated they created videos before our campers liked. I guess that was their language for saying my script sucked and they could do better? Not really sure. But this comment bothered me. This interacted was half a week ago.

Right now I'm working on another project, and this popped into my head. I kept trying to figure out why, and I really can't. Then, I had realized something. I had thought of all the projects I had done at camp previously, like creating carnival games and hosting a carnival at camp. I had gotten such good feedback. Some campers had said that it was the best night of the whole camp. It wasn't until I had thought of this that my insecurity had subsided. But why?

I guess what's bothering me is that it took effort to consider another context where I had performed well, in order to defeat someone else's nasty comment. Is it normal to think this way?

237,"Meditation definitely helps a lot of people. It has anecdotal reports and science backed evidence to back it up. It can help w many different problems from anxiety to depression. 

Some people act like it’s a cure all. Buddhist monks and meditation masters tell people they just need to mediate and all your problems will start to seem less important. 

I believe meditation can be very helpful but it’s just one tool among many. 
There are other tools, like journaling, exercise, reading, learning, therapy, relationship building, creative arts, CBT, biofeedback, and so much more. I think a balance of different tools is more beneficial than being a meditation master. 

If someone has PTSD then they should focus on working on that. If someone has anxiety they can focus on a daily meditation practice. 
If someone has ADHD, they could focus on exercise and mindful walking.

248,"Okay so first of all thank you for your attention and any potential input! 

Here's my story. I'm 24 year old doing an internship as the last project of my course. I was heavily bullied throughout the first few years of highschool (I had been bullied before but not to that extent), which included being bullied regularly by 5-6 groups inside school and about six independent incidents with strangers outside of school. I'm including teachers in the first group; at the time the school's therapist got wind of it and I stood quiet for some dumb reason, if I could go back in time now I'd make sure those teachers would get absolutely destroyed and do my best to guarantee they wouldn't see another kid again, but whatever, all I can do now is hope that the next kid will do what I couldn't. Anyway, the bullying was never physical, but at its height it included a bunch of classmates urinating in my shoe while I was showering in PE.

The reason behind the bullying was my appearance. I have a weak chin, somewhat of an open bite, big lips and big ears. Perpetuators were pretty much always male, I don't remember an instance of being directly attacked or insulted by a girl or group of girls (though I remember a couple of instances of insultive comments being made behind my back in a whispering voice). All this together got me into a suicidal depression, went to a psychologist who did more harm than good, but eventually managed to force myself to climb out of it and believe that one day things would get better. Finding a group of friends helped a lot at the time.

Fun part is, the bullying did not stop after high school. At all. It continued in college. It got way less intense, no more uraniting in shoes or people directly insulting me, and instead it turned into offensive or offhand jokes. So for example, being in a class meeting with every student of the course, one guy telling me ""Hey mate you should really consider posting a picture on Facebook, you're the only one here without one and it would help people memorize your name"", then another guy I barely knew jumping in with ""Yea but don't post one of your face"".

Another tremendous experience in college including me and a guy I considered to be a friend going to a barbecue party, a friend of my friend approaching him and pointing to me and going ""Hey so is this your cousin?"" and my friend replying ""It looks more like your cousin"" and his friend going ""Nah he looks more like yours"". That was fun.

Left a few experiences and stories out but I think you get the point. Right now I feel I'm chronically depressed, there's a constant loop going through my mind 24/7 repeating these events, and that loop has been with me for 10 years now. Now, there were some good things too. Right now I have a few (extremely few, like \~4-5) close friends from both genders that I know enjoy my company and never did me any wrong. I've also had fantastic interactions with lots of people. I've had a few girls interested in me (I'm counting 4; and I know this because they told a mutual friend and asked him/her for help). Two of them were very attractive, and my bullies at the time once followed me into a date because they couldn't believe she had set a date with me. Still never took a chance on any of them because I felt underserving of their attention.

The thing is, I've managed to live with my depression by having ambition and learning and trying to make the world a better place. Believing I have something to contribute to the world as a whole and learning to reach that goal is what keeps me going. So despite my feelings I'm able to reach a point and say ""OK, enough self-pitying for the day, let's get some work done"". HOWEVER, when a trigger hits, it hits hard. It's devastating. It's the feelings of hopelessness, rejection, loneliness, frustration, anger, worthlessness, being alone, not being able to find companionship, etc. All at once.

I have lots of hits. A rejection by a girl is actually not that big of a trigger, but it's still one. A rejection by a group of guys is also a similar trigger (so for example, a former group of friends would never ask me where I wanted to go, they would decide it among themselves and inform me afterwards, never giving me a choice. Or they would just not invite me until I asked if they wanted to hang out, then they'd tell me where to meet them).

The reason I'm writing this today is because I went through a massive trigger in my internship (which I also hate because I hate my course and I think it's useless but that's another point entirely). And all that happened was a woman working there, amidst conversation with a man working there, asking me ""You don't have a girlfriend, do you? Great, because this guy is giving bad advice"". And that, that was a huge trigger for some reason. The fact that she phrased that question that way instead of ""Do you have a girlfriend"", as if assuming a negative response, was enough to trigger me. 

And here's how I respond to big triggers like these: I use my car as a weapon. I'm usually a very calm, attentive, proactive driver. But when something like this happens, I actively look for ways to make accidents happen. If I predict a mistake, I don't brake, I accelarate as much as I can and steer my car to guarantee an accident if the person keeps going. Right of way stops existing, I will let the other car come close and then violently steer directly into them. The only reason I'm capable to be writing this right now was because 6 people were paying enough attention to dodge me.

The thing is, right now I'm stable. I look back and it's like I'm not the same person that was driving that car. And I will be stable tomorrow, and I will be stable until the next trigger. And then my brain will shut down and act on pure self-destructive instint again. It has happened before and it will most likely happen again. And the thing that scares me, is that maybe next time one of those drivers will not be paying attention. And then what? My plan has been ""Just wait a few more months and save enough money to get help"", but I feel like being forced to go to this internship daily and being exposed to these triggers make this more urgent.

So, what should do I do? Where should I seek help? Tried my college therapist, but she is specialized on family relationships and over the course of 12 sessions did nothing for me. Don't have enough money to pay for more than 1-2 appointments myself. My parents are also professionally diagnosed as being depressive and they don't believe in psychologists and tell me to just get my shit together when I talk to them. I could call an ambulance or go to the Hospital but a) I'm no longer in crisis, my crisis last for 10-20 minutes only although they are extremely dangerous in those 10-20 minutes; b) I'm scared I'll get put on medication and subsequently lose my ambition and will to work, which is the only thing that allows me to fight suicidal thoughts. 

My only option I can see is calling my country's non-emergency medical number since they provide psychological support and see what they have to say. They also have the power to contact emergency services if needed. The thing is, every time I'm in a crisis I don't feel like calling the number, and when I'm not (like right now) I don't see the point of calling them lol. Anyone has any idea? Any input? I'd appreciate the hell out of it. Thank you a lot :)",18Aug2020,1
249,"One of the things that I learned in wrestling is that ""wherever the head goes, the body follows"". If you want to shift your opponent to the left, just push the head to left, and their weight will be shifted. However that quote also applies to the mental side too. If all you think is negative thoughts and down all the time, that's how you're gonna feel too. When you thinking down all the time, you sleep more and seem to just want to be alone or asleep. When you start thinking up or positive is when you start to feel like going out and about.",18Aug2020,1

251,"I am a coward and quite weak but I don't know if I'm not overreacting. I've seen other kids on tv scared of their parents when they got in trouble too. 

My mum isn't a vicious beater but if she gets angry enough; she'll beat me with something or at very least grab me painfully by whatever's convenient for her and push me against a wall or into a corner. More than that and the words she says when she's angry (she told me some stuff no mother should ever tell a kid, no matter how angry they are) I'm scared of what she's gonna do when her anger cools off. The rules and conditions she's gonna make me follow. Physical pain doesn't last long, my room can be cleaned up and I'm fairly used to what she says but it's what happens later that makes me really uncomfortable. Still, I somehow can't give any examples. What I can say is that like pushing a person who can't swim into deep water. That's how she makes me feel. And she thinks it's for the better.

So the following  are the things I did because of that fear:
1. I lied, many times. About anything and everything.
2. I took advantage of the fact that I self-harm to avoid punishment. I cut myself, deeply and deliberately. Then I designed a whole act where I pretended to try to hide it but made sure she'll find out, so she won't be as angry. 
3. I tried to stop her many times from visiting me on the weekends but failed each time. 
4. When she visits I go 7 flors down, to a basement thingy for several hours to sleep when I can't endure anymore, cry myself out or to get some peace. I have sleeping bag there and jars if I need to relieve myself. 
5. I didn't let her into the house when she randomly visted so she took away they key to lower lock. I tried to not let her in anyway by holding  in place rim latch lock as hard as I could until she went away.
6. When my mental health got really bad I started spending my whole days under my bed. She came to visit me one time when I was under my bed. I never came out. It was late and she was both worried and livid. To this day I have no idea how she didn't notice because I swear I heard her looking under my bed. It was thanks to the darkness I guess.
7. I chose university far away enough for her to be unable to visit me often.
8. Ghosted my father because she somehow found out I met him after many years of not seeing him.

I'm flawed and not perfect, in fact I'm terrible daughter but even when I was just a kid I remember being scared of her eyes. They reminded me of wolf eyes and wolves appeared in my nightmares almost everyday until I turned 11/12. She was the type of person to open the door to living room in the evenings because she thought I was being ridiculous for being scared that a wolf may hide under the table which was perfectly visible from the hall. She would push me in there when she was mad and force me to look there. She was the type of person to push me onto a barking dog (rather small one) in a narrow hallway when I was crying from fear to prove me the dog's harmless.

Am I right for being scared of her? Is it weird that despite all of that I still hug her often?",18Aug2020,1
252,"I don’t know where it started, but I guess it was when I was young. I don’t know how and why it happened, but it did. What I am talking about is that I choose the choice that makes everyone happy, except me.

Like when I was younger and some girls were teasing one of the boys, I would join in so I could feel like a part of the group. I felt horrible, that I made him cry just so I could be recognized as a member of the class. 

Then I realized my feelings, I guess and wanted to take another route. I started hanging out with the boys instead, and they were much funnier to hang out with. I guess you could say that I took the other path than the other girls. I was satisfied for a while, then my mom stepped in. She said something like: “you don’t have to take the other path, you could go with the others.” Basically, she didn’t want me to stand out, as I understood it. I guess this is where my rebellious side grew and my anxiety I guess.

I still hung out with the boys a lot, but I stopped doing that as I grew older. As I entered the teenage years I became more aware of what the world thought about me, us, the girls, and the boys. I started out the years happy and playful, but as I grew I started to pull back and turn more anti-social with everyone.

Now, when I’m in high school I don’t know what to do anymore. I still feel like I’m just living to make others happy, and yes. You could probably say I do because when I’m alive they’re happy. But what I meant is the choices and decisions I make. I’m mostly influenced by my mom, she wants me to go to a school at a certain place and to either become: a doctor or lawyer. And that’s not my dream. But since I’m always heavily influenced I don’t know what my dreams are anymore, like the stars of my dreams in early childhood either got swallowed by black holes or they just stopped shining.

I’ve started to “calculate” what to say when I’m having a conversation. Based on the person I’m talking to (their body language, their personality, their habits, etc) the different my personality and reply. I calculate what they probably would say to one of my responses, and I try to make them happy. Even if I lie.

I feel like my mom has high expectations of me, but I just can’t. And I don’t want to disappoint her, so I just swallow my feelings and nod as I smile. You will probably tell me to talk to someone or my dad or an adult I trust, the thing is: I don’t trust adults. I just don’t, I think I developed that in my childhood as well. But that’s a story for another time, thanks for just reading this stupid and random rant.

And I still don’t know what to do with myself.",18Aug2020,1
254,"I’m here again, as a pt. 2 to when I asked for advice to give my best friend that texted in a groupchat she’s having feelings of wanting to starve herself again. I told her previously that she can call me whenever she needs and I will be there to listen, because I struggle with sobriety and previously self harm. But she called me after those texts saying “I just tried to kill myself but it didn’t work”, then proceeded to cut herself while I asked her to stop. She listened and I asked if she had consumed any pills- she said no. Then I convinced her to tell her mom, but when her mom entered the room (me still on the phone), my friend told her Mom about her suicide attempt, then her mom asked her why, which I know my friend was dreading, and demanded she hang up the phone with me. I told her I love her and we hung up, then she recently (like 10 minutes later) texted me saying she appreciates my patience and support 100%, and left it at that. I called our other best friend while waiting for her to call me back and asked for advice (she had the words that our other friend needed to hear, but I had the calm voice so she spoke through me). Is there anything else I can do???? She needs therapy and to be taken off Zoloft but I don’t think her mom listens to her. I’m at a loss. Please give me some guidance.",18Aug2020,1
255,"I've  been dealing with some strange behavior in myself over the past few  years. Thoughts from my  past, regrets from the past, moments of  embarrassment from my life, moments when I wish I had reacted  differently or wish I had said something different -- these keep jumping  into my head at random moments during the day. I could be working,  reading, eating, watching TV, anything. And bam, a thought pops into my  head - e.g. Why did I let that guy at work treat me like that 8 years  (!!!) ago? Why did I say that to that girl in college 15 years ago  (jesus, that long ago)?? Why did I embarrass myself like that in front  of those people??

I find myself  yelling at myself out loud to ""Come on!"" until the thoughts go away. So  far I only do this when I am alone, and not in public like a crazy  person. I feel so self-conscious about the yelling at myself that THAT  emotion starts to crowd out the original thought itself. I'm telling  myself to snap out of it, to come on, you're better than this, to let it  go. I feel the anger directed at myself. A brief moment of self-hatred.  And then I shout it down. And then shame at the whole episode.

On  the flip side, there are moments when I feel an intense anger at the  other person in some of those episodes of anger. And instead of yelling  at myself, I find myself practicing out loud what I wish I had said or  had done. I'm practicing cutting down another person, even a friend.  I'll even find myself moving through a list of people (the usual  suspects) and practicing what I wish I had said to them. Earlier this  week, I caught myself doing this for over a few hours. Jesus. WTH. I  write this and I feel shame. What is going on in my head that I react this way.

I know the silliness of  feeling this way, of reliving the past, of this type of anger toward  myself &amp; towards others. It's silly and unhelpful. It's a sign of me  regretting so much, or wishing that I could be different, or wishing  that I had been a better person.

I've thought about talking to a therapist or someone to help my figure out why I'm reacting this, and to help me get it under control.",18Aug2020,1

i don’t know if i have depression. i fit all the symptoms, but i don’t want to completely self diagnose. every time i go to the doctor and they give me one of those mental health sheets i have to lie on it.

i lie about everything i’m feeling because my mom would give me shit for feeling that way, even if i have no control over it.

260,"My mum is in a horrible relationship and has been for years (on and off). There has been some physical abuse and a huge amount of mental abuse. I am one of four (sister 30, me 29, Brothers 16 and 13), my brothers are with the bloke she is with. 

The problems stem from the fact that he doesn't work, spends money on stupid things, lies, cheats, lazy and refuses to do anything about any of it. One of the hardest things is if you were to meet him, you would say he is charming and nice. But there is a darker side, he has thrown plates, he pushed her once and broke her rib, left her while she was pregnant with my youngest brother. There is loads of things like this that have been happening for the last 17/18 years. 

I love my mum dearly, she is an incredible person immensely practical and fun, but she does drink and when she does she gets sad (or the sadness just shows more). We are quite similar in temperament and personality as such she likes to talk to me. But the problem is, these conversations have been getting darker and heaver over the last few years. She constantly says she is a failure that she should have stayed with my Dad, that she has fucked my life up and the lives of my other siblings, that she doesn't see anything bringing her happiness any more. On a few occasions (including tonight) saying that she wanted to hang herself, but in a semi serious/Joking way. 

She has been to the doctor and was prescribed some anti-depressants but she had a bad reaction and was given anti-anxiety medication instead. She was also told to phone a councillor to setup some sessions. No matter how much I encouraged her, she never did, even tonight I said that she should and she refuses syaing ""It wont fix anything, it doesn't work, they are all going to ask me if I'm ok and just tell me to leave X"" I keep telling her that's not the point and they won't do that and that they are there to give you the tools to help manage your feelings emotions and life. But this all falls on deaf ears.  (She was drunk tonight).

I moved away to Europe some time ago for work and I really started feeling more free and light (I had been there of around a year), but because of the pandemic I came back home. 

I feel awful saying this, but I want to listen to her, I want to be there for her and I know I'm nearly 30 so should be able to handle this but, I just can't. I can't help, I can't listen to her pain any more, but at the same time I don't want to stop talking to her as I am one of the only people she opens up to and I couldn't live with myself if she killed herself because I didn't listen.

261,"I'm getting close to a point where I will be returning to work and society after a pretty major breakdown. Only my supervisor at work knows what happened, and I doubt she has an idea of how bad it was. In fact, she might think I'm faking, but it's hard to know if that's just my insecurities or how she really feels. She's a pretty toxic boss so I am going to need to be prepared for the worst and for her to use this against me. Regardless, I have to transition back (and then find a new nontoxic job). I don't know if I'm ready, but I also don't know what ready feels like. 

Additionally, I should probably tell the people in my life why I dropped off the face of the planet. It's not really that rare for me to be out of communication, but it's been a long time and I feel like a pretty different person after all of this.

266,"for context, my dad died in December - that's not what's effected me, i've already grieved and feel better about it now.

what happened was in March i decided ""alright, this is a sign that life is too short and i put it off any longer"" and decided i wanted to medically transition from female to male since i'm 18.

i was talking with my sister about it, the person i came out to in my family first, because i trusted her and y'know, i just needed to talk it out with someone close to me. our mom has never been the most accepting but she'd never kick me out or disown me for being trans so i felt okay about this - however any trans issues i had that i wanted to bring up to her, i did so through a note or text because i can't handle having stressful conversations face-to-face...

my sister knew this so she brought up the point that i hadn't had a ""real"" conversation with mom yet - which i don't think is accurate, i had, just not in the most conventional sense. i tried to explain that and that i physically could not talk about something like that (where i didn't really know what kind of reaction i'd get) in person.

and... she accuses me of not caring about our mom's mental health. that i didn't care that she was depressed. that i was taking something away from her. that she couldn't handle losing both her husband and daughter.

and that's completely traumatized me. it's been five months and despite my mental health rapidly declining, i haven't said anything because i don't want to make my mom's mental health worse. i don't want her to know about how bad it's gotten, about how up and down my moods are and how overwhelming it is to the point where i desperately need help but can't receive that help because of the pandemic (i have a very weak immune system so i can't go to therapy yet without risking getting sick)

and as much as i want to inform my sister of how much she's fucked up my mental health, i won't. because i don't want to cause tension in our family and make our mom upset.

so if there's a way to more subtly let her know how much she's effected me, please let me know.",18Aug2020,1
267,"Basically I graduated a few years ago now with a BA in English and History, however I immediately relapsed on my mental health so couldn't compete in the graduate job market. In that time I got an autism (high functioning ASD/Aspergers) diagnosis and I've been doing a lot of volunteering to compensate. One of those was volunteering in a primary school, since I wanted to be a teacher at the time, but I had a confidence crisis after being sacked for being late a few times due to my mental health, and this put me off thinking I could cut being in a school for several years. As far as local autism support services go, I was on an employment gateway scheme in 2017 but the funding for the charity got cut due to it being EU funded/Brexit. So I got discharged early and not much came of it job-wise, nor did I get to keep in touch with most of the programme leaders.

Last year I did a TEFL, thinking of starting fresh by travelling abroad to China at the start of this year to teach English there and see the world. Obviously I didn't go due to COVID, but I was afraid of going anyway. Currently I'm doing online distance learning of CACHE's NVQ Level 3 teaching assistant training. Although I did look at it for open days late last year, I don't feel mentally well enough to handle the PGCE, which I understand is one of the most intensive degrees out there. It would mean a lot of debt for nothing for that to happen-so I thought I should see whether being a TA was right for me first, or if even that would lead me into panic attacks.

My main problem is that a bit of me feels ashamed that I'm not doing an MA or even PhD by now. I'm fine reading lit and philosophy etc., but I panic whenever reading corporate, finance or business including plain old job vacancy listings. I said that I started looking at open days for PGCE but didn't feel confident to pursue. I did feel confident pursuing an MA in English or History, but my mum (loving, but a helicopter parent who is part of my anxiety disorder's pereptuation) convinced me out of it by saying ""how are you going to pay for it."" Which is true. I have disability benefit (but it was supposed to be reassessed before the lockdown) but it would be a big gamble, and I live in social housing which for any sort of student experience I'd have to give up.

I missed out on a social life the first time during my degree since I was a home student, this means I have no student debt but my social skills feel behind everyone else (they already were because of ASD and social anxiety), and I didn't make many friends which also is a cause of insecurity. To be honest, while I've got some close friends from high school who've stuck with me throughout, a lot of old classmates have well moved on and out of the area, and most of my new friends the past few years have been made through Facebook, and while I care for a lot of them, this has posed two problems really. One, I go through phases of thinking they're better than me (because more Friends, job/career, Masters/PhD family or partner, house, car, travelled and so on) and on the flipside, some of them have tried politically grooming/radicalising me to positions I don't agree with tbqh.

To top things off, I am struggling more with the NVQ3 training than I thought I would, which makes me feel stupid because ""isn't this an A Level course? Am I smarter than a 16 year old?"" It's not impossible but I have had to put time into it. I've also had to redo a couple of assignments, which as a perfectionist is essentially signalling I'm stupid. I've had enough therapy to not relapse over this sort of thing but not got far enough to not berate myself over it. My friends say that I'm really clever but I don't feel like it, I feel like an impostor waiting to be found out, and struggling with 'just' a Level 3 NVQ is proof of that when I 'should' be at Level 7 or 8 now.

I'm not sure whether I need advice or support, maybe a smack to my ego? Lol, thank you anyway",18Aug2020,1

I still have issues with panic attacks, emotional outbursts/moodswings, self harm and depression. I explained to my therapist I want more therapy because I feel like this isn’t ‘enough’ for me and I need more intense therapy instead of just 10 minute ‘me’ time in the group. Individual sessions aren’t always helpful because we have to do imagery rescripting and that doesn’t always help because I have to dig for traumatic memories from the past, but I need more help for situations I find very difficult now also. 

I have explained all this and she is convinced I don’t need any more therapy which I think is weird?? They only see me very shortly and in a different mood which doesn’t show how I am outside of the group and what i have to cope with... 

Do I have to listen to them and try to handle my life with what I’ve learned or listen to my gut; ask for more/explain or go search somewhere else? Idk what to do... because if I could be better out of sheer will I would but I can’t do this alone...",18Aug2020,1
269,"I need mental health help in the San Marcos or Austin TX area. I need a support group a therapist or a physiatrist, preferably all free I can go to. My bipolar and adhd are untreated and I’d like to be in focus for school and work.",18Aug2020,1
270,"I have to get this off my chest so here goes, I always feel like I am worth nothing and there is nothing I can do to change it, and that i cant pursue my dreams. 

For context, I am an immigrant in the us from India that is living on my parents work Visa, what this means is that a lot of things that people normally do in the us, I cant, for example i cant get a job, get scholarships, and there is the constant fear of the government telling us to get out

This makes it feel like I wont be able to do what I want to pursue, game developer, even though I get good grades. This has really led to a spiral of despair in my life, which has led me to wanting to kill myself a lot of the time, and to go as far to put a knife to my neck and just at the last moment backing out many times.

I want it talk to someone about this, and while I feel like my family would be supportive, my sister has an eating disorder and I dont want my family to go through something like that again, and while I hope my friends would understand, I dont want to be seen differently for telling them how I feel. 

I dont know what to do and I'm hoping someone here might be able to help.",18Aug2020,1
271,"I really have been struggling lately with increasing periods of dissociation. The only official Diagnoses are Bpd, depression and Anxiety mental health wise... I’ve been advised to seek more help with my mental health as i am part of a system, but honestly terrified of official help and diagnosis. At the same time it could help long term. Family have been low key aware of something for decades. 
And yet it still feels weird... faking being a single unit is just normal so allowing each one to exist outside of the rest seems alien but we have separate identities and species etc. System is something that was vaguely bought up by a therapist years ago and we had mentioned stuff prior to that even. Just terrified of being committed as we have never been held in a mental unit and pride ourselves on the fact we kept things together throughout everything. 

How do you get close ones. Loved ones to believe you???",18Aug2020,1
273,"Hi everyone

I recently lost my dog and feel guilt at the fact he had to be put to sleep. He was my best friend. I only had 3 years with him but loved him so much. He slept in my bed and I went everywhere with him. Life just feels so much worse without him in it and I just want to end it all. He was a senior dog when I rescued him and he was my first dog. I can't eat or sleep. I feel sick. Will the pain ever end?",18Aug2020,1
274,"I've been struggling to fight off, yet again, another low. I get bouts of pure bliss then something insignificant happens, such as chipping my already shitty teeth, and I sink back down. I don't want to continuously depend on my family for support. I know it can feel like a burden, and I don't want that. 

Today's been rough. My SO is out of town and we got into it over the phone, thanks to good ole Facebook. And it's just really bringing me down. I don't feel like I can confront him about my issues without it turning into reasons I have no room to feel the way I do because of past mistakes. Which I've made a lot of. And it's just hard to keep myself together when I'm reminded of my mistakes when I try to bring up the things that bother me here and now.... Just some words of encouragement would be nice. I know this isn't as serious as others... I'm just feeling down today... And don't feel like I have anywhere else I can go to confide in myself about.",18Aug2020,1
276,"Hey all

Ive created a discord server hoping to find and help people that are struggling with mental health and life in general.

Im aiming to build a community of kind and caring people to help care for and support each other in a safe, discrimination free enviroment.

Im not aiming to build an edgy meme server or an NSFW content server (although there are channels set aside for them). 

The goal is for people of all ages to have somewhere to come and express their feelings and learn about themselves and the world around them in a safe and healthy way.

Some of the topics we aim to cover are:
Mental health
Faith and religion
Love and relationships
Spirituality and enlightenment

Everyone is welcome to join so feel free to come and say hello.

277,"(sorry if my english is bad) okay so i(18m) have an history with self harm, eating disorders, anxiety, etc. but it has been more than half a year since i've gotten better, i mean the are still some things u know but in terms of self harm nothing. lately i have been feelin down a lot, which isn't weird for me, but i have also had a lot of intrusive thoughts like at first they were just like ""cut yourselve you know you want to blah blah"" but now  they have been scalating like ""smash your head on the wall let's see what happens, bite your hand really hard maybe you can take out some skin, what if you stabbed yourselev mutiple time?"" and such. of course i haven't done any of these things but idk i just wanted to ask if this is normal or not?",18Aug2020,1
278,I just keep having thoughts in my head that all of my friends secretly hate me and.just put up with me. I have to constantly ask/tell my best friend if I am being annoying or a nuisance because I'm afraid that they'll abandon me and they keep reassuring me that I'm not being a nuisance and such.,18Aug2020,1
279,"Like the title says I'm not really sure, it's just about alot of things. I spose it stems most recently from my leaving my second job to go full-time in my trade, which I graduated from my schooling for during covid after having gone back to school at 25. My anxiety has been slowly climbing everytime my kitchen manager asked me when I was gonna be able to work full. Despite then asking me to work more I can't help but feel they don't have any real faith I my work ability, which in turn has been making my anxiety grow even more. I had confidence in my abilities while I was my final year of school after completing my workterm.  But between my anxiety and overthinking of how people around me are acting I'm beginning to wonder if I'm really cut out for it. On-top of that I have been asked by friends to put thought into moving into a new apartment with them which makes me question if I should really quit my other job. Which raises my worries about the fact I can never tell if I have genuine friends or no.  I'm aware that this post is a block of undirected venting.

 I wanted to add I have ADHD, the more mental where I have trouble focusing or get far too focused.

It took me the better part of an hour to get this outta my head and onto text. So sorry again for the block of text.",18Aug2020,1
