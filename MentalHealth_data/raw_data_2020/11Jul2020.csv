0,"TRIGGER WARNING (?)
(MENTION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SHOOTING)
Hi, I'm and 18 y/o female who was sexually assaulted a few times. I am diagnosed with PTSD (and many other things to be honest) And I also was at a mall shooting which caused my PTSD to get worse.  
I've noticed that since the shooting last November, I've adopted this characteristic (I'm not sure if that's the right term) where I cannot get my hands dirty whatsoever. For example, I was helping my cousin with car stuff and was simply holding the flashlight. She had set her phone down next to the engine and it got dust or whatever it's called on her phone case. I hadn't realized that it was dirty and picked it up, saw my hands, and almost had a panic attack because it makes me so uneasy and uncomfortable. It makes me feel like I physically cannot being myself to do anything until I wash it. I ended up scrubbing my hands until I felt better. This happens a lot now. I can't even eat finger food with my hands because it causes so much anxiety and panic. It's very frustrating because I used to be able to get my hands messy easily but now I physically can't and mentally can't deal with it. 
Is that a normal thing with survivors of trauma? I'm not sure what I would call that or if that would be tied to OCD? I've been trying to do research but I can't really find anything specifically on that. 
I guess what I'm asking is does anybody else do this? Is it normal? 
Feel free to ask question's. I'd like to understand. 
Thanks in advance (:",11Jul2020,1
1,"So I considered suicide for a long while, I felt lonely and there is alot of stuff going on in my home life which I don't want to get into.

Then I met my girlfriend, and things are going amazing between us, she calls me her smol bean. We are extremely happy together.

But I have a huge problem. I love her so much, and I see her as so perfect, that I think she would be better off if I killed myself so she could find someone even better. So I am right back where I started.

Can anyone help or tell me what I am feeling?",11Jul2020,1
2,"How does one go about getting a diagnosis for anxiety? Im located in Ontario, Canada (about an hour north from Toronto) 

I suspect I have General Anxiety Disorder. Ive suspected this for over a year now, but I'm thinking I really should get it checked out, I just dont know how...

I've been beyond worried and stressed for what feels like ALL THE TIME. No matter what, i always find something to worry about and im so tired of it. Its been affecting a lot of relationships people and im pretty sure its taking a toll on my physical health (Ive been having chest pains, heart palpitations and unexplained digestive problems). 

These past few months its gotten really bad. Im usually a person that likes to go out, whether it be hiking, shopping or socializing. With covid, i find im scared to go hiking or shopping (even for groceries). I find people have been meaner and more aggressive at stores and I'm really stressed the whole time and after. (Im not too scared of the virus moreso the people). My friends havent really been helpful and I find most of the internet is super toxic right now. 

Normally I found traveling helped ease my mind, but becuase I cant do that, i feel really trapped and stressed every single day. I'm so tired and I have no energy. I always feel like im going to cry. Its just becoming worse, and I dont want to feel this way anymore. I want to get help but i dont even know where to go or how to do it. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.",11Jul2020,1
3,"Sorry but I need to rant. Hopefully I don’t offend anyone. I’m just upset about some things. 


My sister suffers from bipolar disorder. Her mood changes with the seasons. She falls into extreme depression in the fall, and enters a manic state during spring. It’s been an endless cycle for the past 10 years. She is unable to work/study because of her illness. She is pushing 30 years old and has no education, huge loans, no income and this curse of a disorder. 

The word depression is being thrown around like a synonym for sad. It’s losing it’s meaning. I hate this because I want to be able to have an open discussion about mental health. It should be as easy as possible to talk about these issues. My problem is that (imo) the abuse of the word ‘depression’ is making it harder for actually ill people to get help. 

The truth is that being sad is not depression. By calling our sadness depression, we minimize the severity of the illness. My sister isn’t just struggling with phsychological issues, her disorder is very much physical. A disease. 

Again, I dont want to doubt anyones mental health problems, or gatekeep depression. I just want to differentiate sadness from illness. 

Also, I hate the ‘romanticization’ of mental health issues. It’s almost like its become a part of pop culture. Trust me, there is nothing cool about being 30 years old and being too scared to leave the house.


TLDR: I want us to continue destigmatizing the discussion of mental health, but not let everyone self diagnose with depression.",11Jul2020,1

5,"So I'm 20 but I don't really have more than a few friends and they have thier own things going on so I try to not lean on them. So with that my only current support is my dad. But he's so toxic and painful to talk to. Passive agressive, angry at everything, he even intentionally does things I've asked him not to so many times. The worst of them is comparing me to my abusive mom. That one is probably obvious enough as to why I hate it. I'm working on trauma processing so I've been off these past few weeks and all he can muster to do is repeatedly bug me on if I should even do this, buy alchohol, yell at me about politics, and act like I'm lazy and tired by my own choice. I'm just trying to work on staying grounded and okay but it's so hard when I'm painting to calm down and he comes in all passive agressive about me not playing with my cat at that exact second as if him or the cat asked me to. And yes the cat will come and ask me. But he doesn't acknowledged that I spend all day with the cat playing and petting her and that occasionally im not gonna be right with her cause she already is overly attached to the extent of having seperation anxiety. Sorry about the cat ranting. I'm just so tired cause I'm trying to keep myself from randomly crying and he knows this but he still has to come in and treat me like shit. Like sorry I'm sensitive because I suddenly have to go through trauma processing cause my abuser might be dying in the next few years. I'm just tired of his shit. I wish I could move out but I don't want to get a job until I'm further along in the process cause I'm at the constant nausea and wanting to cry part right now and I don't think that's the best place to start a job.",11Jul2020,1

8,"I can't believe things have gotten this bad in life within a matter of months. Every fucking month I get my hopes up, just for something to completely diminish them. I wish I was in a coma or something so I didn't have to deal with this. It feel so hopeless, everyone says things will get better, but we've been saying that for the past 7 months, the phrase means nothing to me by this point. I want to check the news to stay informed, but why bother, I'm just gonna get bad news after bad news. Everything i enjoyed doing feels more like a distraction. I don't even wanna go back to school if that even happens for my junior year. Everything just feels like an irreversible mess.",11Jul2020,1
9,"It seems like everyday that something I enjoy and rely on as a source of entertainment or as a way to calm me down or relieve my bad moods and depressive bouts is ""outed"" (true or not) as being problematic in one way or another, whether this be a TV series, movie, musical, video game, or a group/person. It has ramped up severely since the pandemic started, and especially so in the wake of George Floyd's death, but has been going on for years. 

I'm not a very active person socially, so I'm always finding out about such things after the fact, just being awash in all the evidence and discourse about what happened (if it did happen at all!) and is it OK to enjoy it. I feel like I have to devote a huge amount of emotional and mental energy to justify enjoying such media, or crushing my impulse to enjoy it. It's strange to say, but the feeling reminds me of when I realized that my childhood 'friend' was abusive. I keep reminiscing on my experiences and over analyzing everything in order to understand where I went wrong and what warning signs I ignored. I feel betrayed and duped. Lost really. I often get entrenched in things often, so having to break away feels like I'm losing a piece of myself; something that I've really enjoyed turned out to be wrong and harmful. Or someone's claiming that it is, and then I have to sort through so much information to find out it really wasn't. 

I've tried my hardest to remove the art from the artist but that's difficult, especially if the person is still alive. But it's just isolating and painful. I often feel like I can't enjoy things anymore without a huge backlog of context to consider (which, yes is just how things are in life, but shit it sucks when I'm trying to have fun and enjoy myself). 

Is it wrong to just want to enjoy things without having to consider the socio-/economic-/political implications/connotations every single time I interact with it? Is it wrong to not want to read/watch a damn essay everytime I read/watch/listen to something? I feel this pressure immensely, especially as a QTPOC. It's been mentally exhausting and I don't know what to think about anything anymore. I feel like I'm setting myself up to be betrayed.",11Jul2020,1
10,"I need some help or advice with my response to negative feelings when they come up within my relationship. Whenever we have a falling out or I get upset I find it really hard to process that sensation, even if the issue is minor or my partner has moved on from the issue already. I feel trapped by the feeling of disconnect, sometimes causing me to spiral onto a panic attack, even if the problem was my fault in the first place. My partner is lovely and will look after me regardless, but I hate her having to do so, as I don't want to cause any more issues or be the ""victim"". Especially when it's my fault and she shouldn't be having to comfort me. It's like I can't help the response I'm having, but don't want attention from it, and it fills me with shame. I try to remove myself from the situation, but the feelings of stress linger until we're together again anyway. I'm embarrassed to be looked after when I know she's upset with me. I just wish I could process my emotions properly without intervention. I am on the spectrum and may have ADHD, which I suspect are contributing factors in the response I have to emotional stress. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I might be doing wrong? What's a mature way to process intense feelings alone, so that I don't need ""help""?",11Jul2020,1

I feel like a lot of things in my life have been ruined by incompetent adults around me but I feel like I’ve been gaslighted since I don’t know whether I’m just being selfish or not.

12,"I (18F) recently broke up with my boyfriend of 7 months and he was madly in love with me, so it devestated him at first, but then his sadness turned into anger and he started calling me names, sending me very rude messages and saying really hurtful things (even though we had ended the relationship on good terms) I'm trying to be gentle with him but I'm at my breaking point. ever since we broke up, he joined this really disgusting friend group which he knows I hate, and I believe these new ""friends"" of his are encouraging him to treat me this way.
I'm honestly so tired of all this drama. I just don't want to see any of them ever again but we all go to the same school... The fact that I will see him and his friends at school gives me anxiety, although I have done absolutely nothing wrong. I feel like I've been subjected to emotional abuse.

on top of that, I'm constantly arguing with my parents over every single thing because they are kind of 'too conservative', I guess? and they are displeased with every single thing I do or say or want and I literally can't take it anymore. whenever we're having dinner together on the same table, I'm just waiting for them to attack me, to say something mean to me, and I wait for it to happen so that I can get it over with and go to my room and sleep. it feels so fucking awful to feel like you don't have anyone to turn to when something bad happens to you. I wish I had a family I could count on and I wish they were understanding people. instead of a normal childhood all i witnessed because of this family was physical and emotional abuse. there were times when I repeatedly told them that I wanted to get help, to see a therapist or a psychologist and each time, they said no. they literally did not allow me to get help.

and, this school year will be filled with lots and lots of important exams that I need to work reaally hard for, but I can't even focus on schoolwork anymore, I'm so tired of everything. I'm constantly on the verge of crying, and I'm always extremely stressed and it makes my heart hurt physically (I've seen cardiologists many times for this) I just wanna go to someplace where nobody knows me and and nobody will disturb me so that I can just fucking relax and be myself. I want to go far away from here and start a new life. so far I have always been optimistic about my life and been constantly telling myself that it eventually will get better. but I'm losing hope. I'm falling apart",11Jul2020,1
13,"Hello everyone. 

My mom passed away in February unexpectedly. She was the rock of my family. My brother and I are both adults in our 20’s and independent but my father was incredibly dependent on her and is completely lost in adult life without her.

He relies on me to help him with everything. Taxes, paying bills, appointments, etc. I am taking my moms place and it’s too much for me (I’m only 22). I live three hours away from him and I can’t always be there but my dad can’t do things on his own and he doesn’t ask other family for help. 

I think he has a mental disability that is undiagnosed. I feel as though he needs a professional to help him with his life but I don’t know if such a thing exists or what even his condition is? He is dyslexic but has extreme problems with learning new things,reading, writing, anger issues and outbursts, impulse control, and memory. My boyfriend thinks he may have had some kind of brain injury in his past that may have led him to be like this. 

Any advice? What kind of help could be out there for someone like my dad? Is it worth bringing him to get a diagnosis?

Thank you all.",11Jul2020,1
14,"Hey guys well I finally decide to look for help on this subreddit because I think I’m not strong enough to tell my problems to my friends, 


here’s my story, I’m 19, 6.3ft and very heavy around 300 pounds, my mum died when I was 10 and my dad wasn’t with us because he runs our family farm and also because I look a lot like my mum (he started to cry whenever he saw me like for 3 months) I have dark blond hair and my skin is really white like a raw chicken (that’s how kids used to call me) which is pretty rare or at least not so common where our farm is located, when I was 13 I was struggling in German (I’m a native Spanish speaker but my school teaches German, English, Spanish and Italian) so I looked for help and found a German teacher that helped me whit some extra lessons, the think is that I never liked her and for some reason my dad started dating her, so just when my dad started to be more involved in my life she took it from me, he just looked for a baby sitter and only came to our house to eat, have a shower and change clothes and then he just vanished the rest of the day, after 2 years he decide she should live with us and my brothers and I moved all her shit to ur house, she didn’t even pack her clothes, we moved almost everything, the think is that she is a vegan a hippie and a weirdo and the day she came to our house she changed everything we knew, our babysitter quit the next month because she couldn’t take her bullshit any more (we really loved her and till today we are still in touch with her) 6 months later she was pregnant and one year later my dad married her, her wedding was a mess the brides mom came 2 hours late, lost the rings and blamed my brother for that, that day was 107 degrees (42 Celsius) the hottest day since 2005, her sisters toast was literally “we never thought anyone would marry her so we are very happy” and my godfather’s was “well I’m here only because you asked me because I told you that I wouldn’t come to your second marriage and I still don’t want to” (he was veeeeery drunk) also my dad was angry at me because I didn’t made the toast he wrote for me which said how awesome his bride was. a few months later he told us we couldn’t spend Christmas or any festivities with my mums family anymore because “now this is our family and we should spend all festivities together”, so when I was 18 I moved out to my grandma (my family’s farm) and just lived, there’s a rule in my family (I forgot to mention that I’m half German) that says that when you turn 14 you should start working on the farm the whole summer, so till today I’m still working here and I spend everything I earn on food because my uncles don’t give any money to my grandma and my dad just gives her barely enough to live so I have to spend everything on us, but whenever I have some extra money I give it to my brothers so the can buy something they like, lately I’m feeling really bad I really hate myself I hate the way I am, I hate how I look and I hate how I live, I feel empty, I never show or tell people how I feel, if I’m sad people call me gay, if I’m tired they call me a fat looser and when I’m angry the say I’m a bad worker because I shouldn’t show that I have problems to the other workers, basically I need to be the example of the perfect worker so I usually just act happy and relaxed even though sometimes I’m so stressed my mind just stops working I start breathing heavily and just stare to nothing, there are some times I just start crying because of how stressed I am or was that day, so I’m looking for help because I don’t know what to do or how to feel, I’m so fucked mentally that I don’t even remember how to feel sometimes, all I had to make me feel good is food and driving my truck and now I just have food, I cried while writing this whole post because I remembered all the shit that has happened to me and I don’t know how to put myself together, is it even worth it tho keep whit this ? I’ve just told a few of the most light things that happened to me because nobody would believe all the shit I’ve been throw and I don’t feel comfortable telling everything to some strangers at least for now
Just so you know being mistreated and overworked is something that has always affected my life and the reason I don’t want to live it any more",11Jul2020,1
15,"Hi guys. I am sorry this is going to be lenghty, but I need help. 

A bit of background info about me: ever since I was young, I have never felt enough. My mom tells me my dad didn't show up for when I was being born, but showed up for my brothers. My dad denies it, and even if my mom made it up (because they were in a middle of a fight when she told me this), it is still messed up she used my feelings as a weapon against my dad. They treated my brother better; he was excused fasted, understood, and treated better. Yes, I am south Asian if anyone of you is wondering. I was molested by several adults, one who is a distant family member, from a very young age to when I turned 13ish.   

Recently I got into a relationship, and he ( British white man) is a wonderful person, but he watches porn and looks at other girls longingly, wants a threesome, etc. I once told him why him watching porn, and following those 'e-thots' bother me. He unfollowed them, and tells me he stopped watching porn, but I am not sure about that. Even if he did those, now what bothers me to my core is that he feels attracted to other girls. I am demisexual, and I just want to be treated like the only girl in the world. None of my friends or co-workers understand me and say stuff like, ""he's a man, it's normal for him to look at other girls like that, as long as he doesn't act upon it, etc."" I am scared of being alone again, but I am also tired of not being understood and treated the way I want to be.

16,"Today I got a chance to visit with my mother (71) and older sister (52), they have lived together for the past decade since my sister has a couple of issues that require assistance (nothing too difficult as long as she takes her medication). My sister was telling me how mom got sick at the grocery (possible heat stroke) and for whatever reason my mother got very angry and yelled at my sister, this vividly reminded me of how my mother was growing up. She had tons of anger and resentment issues, it was alarming! 

I asked mom if she had made an appointment to see her doctor about getting in a mood stabilizer and she hadn’t. She told me last year that she always wakes up angry and she truly believes this is normal, it’s not and that’s the issue. How do I get her to understand that she needs help, how she feels isn’t just something that she has to endure? 

My sister and I are both on mood stabilizers, you would think she of all people would understand that she needs help in some way since her daughters have both gone through the same thing. I left messages with 2 doctors and have an appointment Monday to speak with one, I’m going to take my mother and be in the same room so I can hear what she tells them. My plan right now is to let her speak and then address any discrepancies if she doesn’t tell them everything.

22,"I think I mentioned her before, but last February I met this girl, this wonderful girl... We both were a mess and had build walls but we smashed them pretty fast. 

During exam studying we came across the idea to call so that we both were more preasured to study, but as social awkward people we never really spoke we say there and studied in silence and oh, was she pretty. We chatted while on the call, and we had a good time.

During these times we started trusting eachother more and more and we kept on being more and more comfortable. We grew togheter as they say, the exams ended, the calls didn't we would occasionally speak during the calls and it was beautiful.

Then teasing began and nicknames and talking about love and affection ofcourse it was all ""platinicaly"" oh we were naive.

She opened up about the past, her dreams her goals and her inside, I did the same, we then didn't talk for a few days because we were afraid of becoming too attached as we were ""addicted"" to each other and it was getting in the way of our lives and responsibilities. It helped us giving eachother more space and it brought us so much closer togheter.

Now she has been having exams again, more calls are happening, we now really talk for so long during calls we have inside jokes we feel good. Ofcourse there are rough patches especially lately with all the stress from studying we got torn apart a bit. But we worked through it togheter.

And even weeks or moths ago I feared falling in love with her or she with me, and tonight it happened, a ""confession"". We were talking half asleep, so we were really open. And she made a joke ""watch out, you'll fall in love with me"" and I said that i was joking, or that I thought I was.

As I said late night falling alseep very open, I confessed her that I fear that i am falling in love or will fall in love, and she said the same. We both agreed that we are afraid because we think we will hurt eachother or destroy what we have in case it goes wrong.

And i don't know her opinion, but I've told myself not to get into ldr's (long distance relationships) again, and that they don't work out and are nothing for me

Now I also want to say that I usually don’t let my mental health issues get to me and that I am in high school.

With that being said I want some advice. It’s been a while since I’ve been with my friends and now that I won’t be going to school for another year, I’m starting to really think of everything negatively and I can’t take things seriously anymore. 
Usually to deal with the extreme boredom, I play video games with friends or I play single player story driven games. But for the past few weeks I just haven’t been enjoying that anymore. My energy is WAY down and I’ve been finding myself waking up at strange times. 
I just got off a game session with my friend and I 
realized it’s becoming more than just a bad week. 

I’ve found myself wanting to eat more than usual but I’ve mostly been able to resist.

Most of these issues don’t bother me that much but I’m afraid that my mental condition is only getting worse and worse and I’m afraid of developing some kind of depression. 

Any advice would be appreciated.

One of my suicide plans has been death by train and I sometimes think about going to the tracks just to watch the train go by, I guess to prepare myself? I don’t know. I was out running this morning and heard the train coming and made my way to the tracks and watched it go by. I felt very sad, but then went on my way. The other thing I did was tell my son (he’s 20) that I have thought about suicide before. It wasn’t totally out of the blue, he brought up a twitch streamer he follows that committed suicide. I let him know that I wouldn’t do it because I wouldn’t want him to suffer which is the main thing that stops me. But I’ve also thought at times about telling him so if I did do it it might be a little less unexpected. I’m just a bit freaked out right now that both of these things happened in the same day.

There’s not much to it, I just like watching people/animals get hurt, tortured, die, scream in pain, etc. Not in movies but in real life, or more accurately, on my computer screen. I especially love seeing a variety of animals use their unique capabilities to kill their prey, wether that’s another animal or a human. I’m aware humans are animals, but you know what I mean.

My mom always says that when I was a child, she was convinced I was bipolar and would grow-up to be a serial killer, but as I aged, she was less worried because of my more empathetic nature. I know I don’t sound empathetic because of the whole gore thing, but I can get very attached to others and would die for them in a heartbeat.

I'm anti-social i recently broke up with my girlfriend, mostly because she deserves better and I know that I'm not just saying that for sympathy I invested no time and effort towards the end of that 1-year relationship.

 I always have things from my past replaying in my mind. When I was with my girlfriend i pushed all my friends away because when I wasn't on the phone to heor or at her house she'd be in a mood with me, my best friend from 2 years ago messaged me and I haven't replied 10 weeks later because I don't know what or how I would respond to him. I'm afraid if I message him and we go out again he'll be different and we won't get along.

39,"I just feel kind of shit about myself rn, and idk who to rant to about it. I'm currently living at home with my parents after having a mental breakdown while I was at uni. The recovery period from this led to me not handing in all my work. I have ADHD and was recovering from a suicide attempt, but I feel like I'm really just being lazy. I'm sitting in my parents house with all the time in the world, I should have gotten it done. Now I'm doing resits, and they're already late. If I don't pass the resits I think I'll have to resit the entire year, and idk if I can afford to pay for a year (In Scotland, so the government pays for 4 years of higher education, but no more than that). I would feel guilty asking my parents for money, despite the fact that we're middle class, so could probably afford it? But they've got my siblings to worry about as well, and they wanna move back to France later in life, so I worry if they had to pay for my uni fees they wouldn't manage to do that.

So I just feel kind of lost. I feel like I'm the archetypal shitty 20 year old that abuses his parent's good nature and is just a lazy, good for nothing cunt who has no future prospects.

I'm just a disappointment to everyone I've met, I'm a shitty kid, a shitty friend, I've been a shitty partner to everyone I've ever dated. This is why I have suicidal thoughts, I feel like I just exist to drain other people's resources like a leech and disappoint them.

I wish I had the motivation to get things done. Maybe it's because I'm a white, middle-class, amab person. My privilege has stagnated my drive, I've never had to work that hard. Sure, I guess getting into uni was tough because I'm bad at studying thanks to my ADHD, but half the time I doubt that I actually have it, I'm probably just lazy.

Long story short i [M24] broke trust in my relationship [F23] and i think we ended things? They said they were unsure where their head was at but still wants to be really close with me. Idk what to make of anything anymore, it feels like my life has shattered.

I broke trust by snooping. We were together for about a year. She didn’t know about me snooping until I told her, I told her because I wanted to have more communication between us but ultimately it ended (obviously i don’t blame her). 

I think i’m really codependent and have manipulative and obsessive tendencies, I think about her all the time. I have bad insecurity issues too. it was probably for the best but even I still desperately want her back and I want this pain to go away.

I keep saying that I only want her to be happy, but is that even true? I feel like if she was happy without me I would still be upset. My head is fucked up and I want to know how to get help.

We are best friends and still want to be close. Is it possible that we can both be happy and still close but apart? I really need to find some inner peace here and would really appreciate if anyone knows what direction I should move. I’m starting therapy but i’m new to it and have no idea what i’d even say to a therapist. Do i need closure? is it even possible to get over her while still being close friends?

42,"I've never posted something like this before but I kinda just need to like... spill, get it out somewhere. I've been manipulating my friends with some cheap emotional tactics and I can't stop it, I think it may be a result of bottling things up? Anyway that's kinda why I'm just gonna make this... nonsensical rant. I don't wanna upset my friends, but I also don't want to rant to them about stuff that might not be real, so maybe this can do something to ease that.

Uh... I'm just confused. This is definitely not the worst I've ever felt, but as a result I feel like everything I've ever felt in the past never actually happened. Some of it might be exaggerated, straight up lies I'm telling myself as excuses for my behavior, ect. I want answers, or anything really. I hope this isn't too much to say but I used to self harm, and back when I did it felt like... proof, and validation that I was feeling something and it was serious. I don't anymore, haven't in probably 2 years which is great. But now there's no solid ""proof"" of my feelings or experiences, and anything I try to remember feels foggy, so maybe I'm exaggerating or lying or whatever.

Might as well say these things, mostly just to get it down. Again this is more of a rant cause I'd rather not bother anyone I'm close to, there's too much going on right now and there's just no room to add this weird stuff to it.

Uhm.. I guess my first two years of highschool, even the year leading up to it, were weird. The worst of it I remember was freshman year(of course lol), where I felt super anxious all the time like the air I was breathing was made of lead. Then I had a lot of paranoia, weekly at least if I remember correctly. Anytime I was out of the house I would pinpoint one or two people and keep my eye on them cause I thought they were trying to hurt my family and I. Then often at home I would check outside of windows and such cause I thought people were coming to rob our house. (I might be exaggerating this, it's been awhile and I didn't write it down for myself). Uh... all of my grades were shit that year, I couldn't bring myself to do anything. Then suddenly a small handful of times I had like, mania or something. One week in particular I was doing so much shit; exercising everyday, writing motivational words on a poster next to my bed, planning 3 long term stories and reworking another I had been working on for 2-3 years already, going out most days, the last day of that week or so I didn't sleep at all and spent all night drawing several pages to a comic for one of those stories. Then the next few days I just couldn't move at all haha...

This is super scattered, sorry about that, I got more random stuff to jot down. Maybe I'm saying too much but aaaaggghhhh... my brain is full man.

Uh... one time I was home alone at night. I thought robbers were coming to break in again, and started pacing the house and checking all the windows until I was out of breath. Then suddenly something kinda like... idk, a switch was flipped, and it wasn't robbers on their way anymore. It was like- my brain said there were demons and they were already in my house..? I grabbed a knife and ran to the furthesr corner I could, and sat there for awhile to hide. Well, not really, I could 'see' them, kind of, and had an invisible force field/bubble that I barely fit in protecting me. Well, obviously not but that's what it felt like in the moment. These 'demons' I felt, I couldn't see them but I knew exactly where they were and what they looked like and I was thinking their thoughts or whatever. They looked like the aliens from alien(which is kinda funny looking back on it), and I remember they taunting me and smiling at me, teeth and claws just a few inches from my face- I swear I didn't see or hear anything, I just knew it was happening. 

Gaaaahhwfu9w so much nonsense rant, idk what I'm even talking about anymore. I don't even want to proof read all of this, it'll prolly keep me from posting it if I do. So sorry if I'm sounding like an idiot, or if I'm making any light of people with real issues, I'm just really tired and need to say SOMETHING before my head and chest explode.

I'm fine right now, I haven't experienced anything like this in years. I've had intrusive thoughts(throwing glasses at people, gorey shit I don't want to see playing in my head, premonitions of car crashes, ect.) In recent times, and last summer had a real bad moment of paranoia. But other than that it hasn't been so bad. My head has been fairly quiet, I'm not paranoid like I used to be, I don't have freaky premonitions... 

idk, I've just been feeling bad, but it's not 'bad' in the way I was used to before. I'm used to hearing my thoughts argue in my head, kind of like when you trying shouting wuth your internal voice but two of them and they're yelling at each other and not me. Now it's just my voice... complaining and whining quietly. Now I'm sad and unmotivated, but I'm not always feeling like I'm drowning or like I'm floatinf 6 feet above my body. It's weird... and it makes me doubt I ever felt those things in the first place.

Gooddsmsjfw so sorry for the rant, I'm really sorry if this makes no sense, I just gotta post it. Sorry if they're any spelling errors and for the staggeringly bad structure/organization, I honestly can't proofread this without convincing myself to not post it. Also please don't worry this is NOT the worst I've been, if anything I'm feeling okay. Not my best either, but I've made it through worse and I have people who care about me. I just- don't understand any of this myself, and I can't work through it with anyone. I'm not in danger, my family knows about the past self harm thing, this is just a rant.",11Jul2020,1

44,"I'm starting to fall apart. I just spent the last two hours sitting, doing literally nothing, right after deletingFacebook and Instagram. Dark thoughts have been running through my head, including suicide. I try to brush them away as not being serious, but something felt different this time. 

I hate asking for help. Particularly real help. I have it in my head that I'm the one who helps, I shouldn't be the one who needs it. Most of my friends know I'm going through a rough patch right now, but who isn't with everything going on in the world. But the virus has taken what little routine I had and thrown it out the window. I don't think any of them realize how bad I'm at right now. But I know some of them have been have their own problems from anxiety, stress from job loss, etc. I don't want to burden them with my shit too. Let alone, how do I even tell them ""hey, I was considering researching how much tylenol I'd need to take to end it."" 

My parents are divorced. My dad is a good guy but he's a bit obtuse sometimes and would be terrible at dealing with this. My mom is dealing with potential job loss too, plus she's admitted to me she has depression herself. She knows I'm struggling,  but again doesn't know how bad. My sister is a nightmare. I try to avoid her at all costs. She hasn't spoken to my dad in almost 2 years. She has anger issues that she's never dealt with and just the thought of having to be around her stresses me out. Her birthday is in two weeks, my aunt and uncle are coming in from out of town, and of course mom wants to do cake. I haven't had the guts to say I don't want to. My birthday is another 2 weeks after hers, and again I don't have the guts to say I'd rather she not be involved. 

Last Christmas I had it really rough mentally. Finally admitted to my mom. I always suffer that time of year. I hate Christmas, as it brings up all the family shit, plus the lack of sunlight gets to me (self-diagnosed s.a.d.). But I made it through. Things were looking up. Went on vacation to Costa Rica for two weeks. Was taking my pottery classes which I've been in for the last year. Lost 20 lbs and was going to the gym regularly. And then rhe virus hit and it all went to shit. Classes are canceled. Any plans I was making for future travel are nothing but a pipe dream now. Gained back 10 lbs, and even though the gyms are open, I struggle to get myself in a routine. But it's the fact that my thoughts have gotten so dark as of late. I've never truly dealt with them before, and I'm afraid if I don't,  I might not make it through this coming Christmas if things go sideways again in my head.

I hate asking for help, as I said. But I'm afraid of what might happen if I don't.  I don't even know where to start. I just needed to vent this somewhere, where someone might read it",11Jul2020,1

He feels that he is the only logical person in the entire world and that everyone else around him is always wrong and illogical.  Even when he is clearly wrong it is like his brain will refuse to understand any logic on why he is wrong.  He feels that any authority figure is a corrupt person who should not be able to boss him around and control him.  He controls everything that his girlfriend does and she never argues with him.  I am the only person that argues with him solely because I want to help him.  He thinks that he is always right to a fault and I fear that he will not be able to make it through life if he feels alone because he cannot understand anyone else’s emotions or reasoning behind their actions.

I'm worried about how much further I'll regress if I continue to act like this, but whenever I practice I get sad about my regression and want to stop.

55,"I mean obviously I know the quarantine is a big factor in this. But, ever since I graduated high school, I haven’t felt excited about life. When I transferred to a university I felt a bit better because I was so busy but I graduated university in December. I have OCD and depression, so that may be a factor too. 

I don’t feel that I have a bad life. My family is fine, I’m not struggling financially, I have pets, I have a few true friends (but once of my insecurities is the amount of friends I have, no matter the quality), and all, but still, I feel my life has no direction. 

I got my bachelor’s degree is psychology but have no idea what I want to do as a career. After graduating, I went back to a previous retail job I had held while being in community college just to have job stability. I worked there for around two months then got let go because of covid back in April. 

I just feel like my life is going nowhere. I know I have the power to drive my life, but I just don’t know where to go. It may be my OCD overthinking it, but I have nothing that I’m passionate about. Whenever I do an activity, I think “am I really enjoying this? Am I having fun?” and I think that takes the joy out of it. I’ve picked up painting and painting rocks which I enjoy, but it’s hard to muster the energy to get started so I haven’t done it in a while. I’ve tried knitting/crocheting, coloring, etc. I grew up playing tennis and I’ve been picking that back up a bit lately but I don’t have a ton of friends who play. I want to meet people in my community but my insecurities/covid kinda hold me back. Plus, there’s not a lot going on right now and of course I want to be safe. 

I just feel like almost every day when I’m not busy doing something (hanging out with friends, running errands, etc) I’m just doing things to pass the time until it’s time to go to bed. 

I’m overweight and started eating healthier and I want to exercise but I’ve only gotten the energy to actively do it twice this week. 

I definitely think I need to see a therapist (I haven’t had great experiences in the past) but I’m willing to try again. I just don’t have a ton of money and my copays are pretty high. I know there’s like sliding scales and stuff but they’re either too high or don’t feel right. And then, covid makes it hard to start therapy.

She refused getting help and said ""Ill get help once my bmi is like 10 because the patients at the facility are like 8 and below and i know if i go there bow it wont actually help me""

I guess what Im trying to ask everyone is how do I help without making her feel worse about the issue?",11Jul2020,1

61,"Hi! I have a weird phobia of staying home alone in silence and hearing paranormal breathing when there is no one around. Or should I say phobia of invisible ghost that I can hear but can’t see? It all started when I was 12 and I stayed home alone and I clearly heard heavy (even deadly) breathing RIGHT IN my ear when there was no one around. I was so frightened that I couldn’t even move. Then after several months it happened once again when I was celebrating Halloween with my cousin. She told me she heard this heavy breathing too and even now after so many years she says she clearly heard it when we were kids. And from now on I have this phobia that prevents me from living like a normal person. When I stay home alone I always wear my headphones with relaxing music and I can’t live without headphones even when TVs are on. I did not observe any more hallucinations (or maybe not hallucinations?) since then but this phobia haunts me everyday and I can’t live with this. I want to add that my mom committed suicide when I was 11 and right after this situation I heard this heavy breathing and gained phobia. I researched almost every forums to find people that heard that too and I could find only several users with this problems and they all don’t know what was that. I’m now 21 and I plan to move to the new apartment where I will always be alone and this phobia ruins everything. Should I seek professional help and if yes, will it really help me?

62,"Hey everyone, I posted on here a couple days ago excited about my first therapy appointment having been booked, but now I'm getting really nervous about it. It's in 2 weeks (ish) and I definitely still want to go despite the nerves. I generally do really poorly with new situations and because of corona it has to be over Zoom which I also have a hard time with. I have a list on my phone of things that I would want to bring up and I have some questions written down too but I'm not really sure if I would be expected to start talking about all of that at the first appointment or if that's the kind of thing to save to start dissecting in later sessions. I guess what I'm asking is this: what will I be expected to talk about at the first appointment? For reference, the therapist in question is a psychologist and I'm 15F.

Thanks so much, lots of love &lt;3",11Jul2020,1
63,"I have been diagnosed with quiet BPD, depression, and anxiety. I posted this to r/bpd first but haven’t gotten much feedback with it, so I’m doubting now if that’s the reason for these memory blocks.

For example, within a few months of moving from primary to middle school I couldn’t remember why I was friends with my best friend of 4 years. I couldn’t remember what we did together, what it was like to hang out with her, what she sounded like, why we were BFFs, the good things about her or the bad things about her. 

In middle school, I had a best friend for the entirety of grade 6 and moved on in grade 7. The same thing happened. She texted me in grade eight about going on a trip together and I couldn’t remember anything we did as friends. I panicked, said “no, sorry,” and blocked her.

I had a best friend from grade 7 to 10. I realized she was toxic for me and began to cut her off. Rinse and repeat — within a few months I couldn’t remember anything about her. The only memories I kept were formative in some way: I learned how to stand up for myself, learned a new coping mechanism, or developed a new fear. 

I can’t remember the group of people I hung out with in first year of university. We spent at least one day a week together for hours at a time. I don’t remember their personality quirks, the things we did together, etc. unless they were formative memories. I remember their names and what they look like, and that’s it.

What worries me is that this issue bleeds into people I really love and cherish; family members who mean way more to me than friends. 

I spent the majority of my youngest years with my grandparents. They continued to take care of us for days at a time until I was 12. We stayed in contact and visited often after that. My grandfather died when I was 17. Within a month or so, the same thing happened. I felt extremely dissociated at his funeral because I couldn’t identify with him being my grandfather. I couldn’t remember him being my grandfather. I didn’t cry, and still haven’t. The only time I cried was before he died and was suffering with dementia. Afterwards, nothing. The feelings I have towards him seem to be behind a wall in my brain. I have kept maybe 5 memories with him, all of which were formative. I wish I remembered him. I can’t have this happen with my other grandparents.

This definitely lends itself to my lack of identity. I can’t remember the majority of my life because of these lost relationships. I can’t identify with my past anymore. I think it’s definitely a coping mechanism for abandonment, but what do I do??? 

Has anyone else experienced this??? Has anyone found a way to stop it from happening?",11Jul2020,1

77,"hi all, i am hoping to seek some perspective on what i found to be a really off-putting first therapy appt. i am in nyc and i've been in therapy in the past for issues of disordered eating, but only with one therapist who had a private practice. i had to stop seeing them bc it got too expensive. 

this time around, i tried to find a clinic that took my insurance for issues related to an abusive relationship and self esteem issues. i've been shopping around and noticed that w this clinic, they took my insurance but didn't have me fill out much prior paperwork. i joined my session and my therapist seemed to be immediately hostile, rude, and bored. we went down a checklist of things and she repeatedly cut me off, rolled her eyes, and made faces. we weren't off to a great start, but i tried to be comprehensive and honest. 

then, when we got to a q about substance abuse, i admitted that i've been using weed to deal with stress from my job. she kept repeating questions about when the last time i used was and how frequently i used even though i kept trying to explain that it wasn't regular enough a use for me to be sure. i finally just gave an estimate that i had last ""used"" last monday, wednesday, and friday after work. at that point she told me she couldn't see me as i had to work with a substance abuse counselor before we could continue. i immediately felt relieved i wouldn't have to see her again and asked if she had any resources to help find one. she refused and then began scheduling another appointment between me and her. alarmed, i asked why and she said she wanted to follow up. i tried to say that i didn't want to see her again and she began peppering me with questions about when i would make time to find a substance abuse counselor. i finally had to admit i was lying and had no interest in seeking substance abuse issues, though i didn't tell her i had lied primarily bc i did not feel comfortable with her. it doesn't feel great to admit that i lied, but i really did feel like i was in some kind of police interrogation and i just wanted OUT.

she said i could call the clinic to make an appointment with another therapist, and then seemed to rethink and said that all patients are required to be sober for at least a year before they seek therapy at that clinic. i found nothing on their website about this policy—including on downloadable forms and pamphlets—and no one mentioned this to me when i made my appointment or discussed insurance and payment, but i also didn't sign extensive paperwork, so i don't know if there's something i may have missed. however, the whole thing feels bizarre to me. i did a site-wide search for the words ""substance abuse"" after our session to double-check their policy and actually found that a bunch of their therapists actually advertise themselves as substance abuse specialists. i want to call the office to confirm this policy before i get too in my feelings about this, but she was so aggressive, i don't know that i feel entirely safe calling them. is this a normal policy? how is something like this usually advertised? will she find out if i call the office to ask? i really don't want to deal with her again, but i do want to understand what i did wrong and why this played out the way it did!",11Jul2020,1

I'm feeling real low about myself at the minute. Never had very high self esteem but it has been on the upward trend in the last 2 years and suddenly crashing. 

I ride and maintain older mountain bikes, its my hobby. Recently however it feels like everything I touch literally turns to shit and it's really affecting my mental health. 

I honestly feel very despairing.

Reasons:

\- My 3 most expensive bikes had accidents within the space of 3 days. Don't worry, I'm fine, only road rash on one and wasn't on my bike in the other two. Not serious and definitely not mechanically affected, but the scratches are really cutting deep. Bike and car fans out there will know that scratches hurt on your beloved machine but I have felt so stressed about it that I've turned to drink. And I've stayed pretty much sober for a year (drank &lt;10 times last 12 months) due to issues with drinking. It really bugs me that the nice collectable bikes are getting scratched up and the shitty ones that I bum around town in are fine. Like it makes me undescribably angry.

\- Another bike that I am doing up (all original etc) seems to have a little bit of paint come off every time I touch it. It's really bugging me that I am damaging it. I don't know if it is my OCD which seems to come out when I am stressed.

\- This morning, 3 tubes blown trying to change one tire! This one is getting to me the most. It feels like everything I touch turns to shit.

All of those things together make it difficult to find someone new, let alone leave the house. I go out to party when I can but only really go to see my two only real pals in life, except one of my best friends has a crush on her. Everywhere I go I see her.

 There's other issues behind the scenes that I have trouble with but this is the most simple issue at the time to get off of my plate. I appreciate anybody that will give me the time of day. Honestly, I feel more comfortable in a private message. If you can shoot me one, it would mean the world.

101,"Give me strength to continue working,  when the path is unclear,  when the hope for success is bleak, when making any decision is hard and indecision will ultimately make me weaker and weaker.  I know I may regret my wrong decisions in future. I just want to continue moving and not reach a point of stagnancy.

 At every situation in life so far, I have faced 2 decisions. I've mostly chosen the 'road less taken'. In spite of people around me telling me otherwise. And that has got me where I am today. On the surface,  I seem like a failure but my past mistakes have taught me alot and gave me alot of wisdom. Hence, those mistakes were actually worth making.

I guess I need more information about a few things , where my knowledge is limited,  that can impact my decisions. But it takes time to find and filter out valuable hidden deep info from the vast pool of internet.

Also, my lack of motivation is a problem. A person can only be self-motivated to a limited extent. If I had someone to love, someone by my side, my drive would have been much higher. 

I wish I had more passions that would have driven me automatically. But I have very few. I have only reason and logic that says it's important I live and do something worthwhile and not just exist or survive like a living corpse.

104,I’m a 20 year old CKD patient who also has a history of depression. Every day I wake up knowing that my kidneys are slowly failing me. I can feel my body struggling and I know that my condition will progressively get worse. Sometimes I wonder if death is better than losing my dignity and autonomy.

106," Smart Phone distancing can prolong your life. In the world where social distancing is being preached and prescribed by the government and medical fraternity alike, what we really need to focus on is Smart phone distancing.  


Social-distancing has connotations of anti-social and anti-human behavior. Social distancing may or may not save your life but mobile phone distancing certainly can save your life. Because, we have been spellbound and mesmerized by this magical device.  


We can’t go any length of time without checking our smart phones. It is as if our entire life revolves around this device. In the past It was TV and now it is this small portable device that has become our source of joy, happiness and information.  


We are unable to part with mobile phones for even a few minutes, it seems we are wired to it. But studies are increasingly showing the harmful effects of smart phones on our lives. These mobiles interfere with our relationships, memory, sleep and our productivity.  


There is growing evidence that our addiction to smart phones are raising our stress levels and shortening our life span in the process. Earlier, the scientist focused their research on the triggering of dopamine levels by the use of mobile phone. Dopamine is a chemical that causes us to form habits. It’s a feel good hormone that is usually released in colossal amount during drug use and other such activities.  


But more concerning than constant rush of dopamine is the elevated cortisol levels that are triggered by prolonged mobile phone use. Cortisol is a stress hormone which causes spike in heart rate, blood sugar and blood pressure, our compulsive use of smart phones are raising our cortisol levels and causing serious harm to our health.  


According to studies, An average American uses mobile phone at least 4 hours a day, even Google has reported that “mobile devices loaded with social media, email and news apps create a constant sense of obligation, generating unintended personal stress.”  


Whenever you hear the vibration and sound of [**Whatsapp**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp) notification you feel compelled to check your phone, it makes you feel better. This is how cortisol hormone works, it creates addictions.  


These days you mostly hear bad news on your mobile phone and TV sets which further aggravate the already elevated cortisol levels. And these chronically elevated cortisol levels are linked serious ailments such as depression, Diabetes, high blood pressure, strokes and even heart attacks.  


We are living under constant state of stress and anxiety which is taking serious toll on our health and well-being. Whenever we read an outrageous and offending remark on Social media our cortisol shoots up. Everything we do has an effect on our health and physiology and these days we are so under the spell of technology and gadgets such as TV, mobile, internet and movies that we are not getting enough sleep which is further exacerbating our stress levels.  


We are also wasting our precious time and damaging our relationships with our loved ones by being constantly glued to our smart phones. We are becoming socially distant through mobile phones as well.

107,"I’ve attempted college education 7 different times. I have Fs, I have withdrawals. I used select transcripts where I was successful and got into Brigham Young University, and I quit going there twice, with Fs and withdrawals. Also quit being Mormon thankfully. During my 7 attempts to go to school I have racked up 60 grand in debt. With only 73 semester credits (of the transcripts I choose to show) as my reward.

I am now 37 years old. I have worked as a behavioral specialist for 15 years, stuck at 50k salary for the longest time, because I don’t have bachelors or masters degree. I have terrible debt, terrible credit, and my partner of 10 years left me so she can transition to something gender fluid and date women. This happened 5 weeks ago.

Before that, I struggled with depression and anger during the relationship. Which intensified after she cheated on me 3 years ago. Only 5 months of separations and I took her back. I did it to be with her son, who I see as my own. And to give in to my depression I come to understand. My family never forgave me. I lost several of my closest people with that decision. My partner and I stayed rocky, despite my return. I cheated on her a year later. Something I never thought I’d do. It was disgusting of me. Especially because I was too cowardly to leave her. All this increased my depression.

My partner got pregnant out of the blue. We thought we couldn’t have children. Our beautiful daughter was born a year ago.

After daughter’s birth we moved into a house. It was nice between us for a couple months. Before slowly getting sour again. She yelled and threw things, and I drank and avoided her. Communication was non existent after a while. We became roommates who fucked each other. Sex being the only thing in common between us.

My partner’s friend Susan came into our lives at the start of COVID-19. After several visits my partner asked if we could sex with her. However intriguing the idea was, I said no. She pushed and pushed, while promising it wouldn’t hurt our relationship, so I eventually said yes. My partner quickly fell in love with Susan. She told me she wanted to leave me. Week later she took it back. Week after that she wanted out again. This happened three times. I finally said no take backs and moved out. That’s when my relationship of 10 years ended. Four weeks ago. Susan and Sara now spend everyday together. 

I have no one. I lost my closest people by returning to my ex after she cheated on me. I still haven’t told them of our separation. I’m frankly embarrassed.

I weirdly chose this moment to inform my job that I need a raise. They said returning to school is the only way I can receive a promotion. I am living alone, seeing my partner happy with someone else, getting fatter, in dead end job, without a close community of people, and then something happened to me. I said FUCK THIS! 

Fuck this life. Fuck this anxiety, and fuck my finances, and especially fuck my past relationship. I am making a change.

I started lifting weights a month ago. I got on testosterone  intravenously through my doctor. I started seeing a counselor. I put 6 grand into savings. And I refuse to give in to a shitty life. 

Scariest thing of all, I am returning to school for the 8th time and final time. I am Done being defeated, depressed and worthless. 

I intend to conquer instead of hide. I choose to thrive instead of languish. Today at this moment; I am happy. This is my time. Thank you.",11Jul2020,1
108,"Hi all, 

I've been struggling with some issues lately that I'm not really sure how to handle or where to start resolving them. Due to a circumstance I feel as though I can't go to headspace anymore and I don't think I can afford therapy at this stage.

A bit of backstory about myself before I get into it, I am currently early 20s, am happily married with my first child expected in the next few weeks and I couldn't be more excited. I have struggled with what my doctor believes to be depression for roughly 7 years on and off, I'm not sure how accurate that is though as I've only had 2 sessions with headspace and my doctor based his diagnosis almost solely on that. My biological father was mentally and physically abuse to me between the age of 0 and 4 and my step father was a substance abuser who wasn't around often. 

I have been ""stable"" for roughly 2 years now, I haven't needed medication to feel ""normal"" and haven't had a lengthy depressive episode until recently. 

The first major issue is I have made an incredibly strong friendship with one of my wife's friends, to the point that I would consider her my best friend currently. Several weeks back she became distant (or at least I thought she had, she was literally just busy) and I completely withdrew from everyone around me including my wife, it felt like I couldn't think about anything except what I could have done to upset her and what I could do to get her to talk to me again, I barely spoke to work colleagues or even my wife for practically a week. It also reminded me of another time I had experienced the same thing in high school, a close friend told me they no longer wanted to be friends with me and I selfishly threatened to self harm so she would stay friends with me. I have heard others describe this as an abandonment issue, if anyone has experience with this, I'd really appreciate your input.

The second issue which honestly is probably part of the first issue is I am really struggling to deal with is when my friends are busy or cancel plans, even with good reason. I have never been a social person and have always had a friend circle of max 2 people. I have recently had the urge to start making more friends and have begun walking socially with 3 or 4 new people and have realised that I don't handle when they don't want to spend time with me well, I become what I would consider to be irrationally upset and tend to jump to a ""why would they want to hang out with me anyway"" mentality. 

The last issue is I am sometimes unable to gauge how close I am with other people and have major concerns that friends will leave me at the drop of a hat, even when I've expressed these concerns and they've literally responded with ""You'd have to do something unbelievably awful for me to consider not talking to you"". Sometimes even when I'm with a friend and we're having a great time, I feel disconnected from them or the situation.

The worst part is my inability to focus on anything, even if I put myself to a task that requires my full attention I have thoughts racing in my head and I simply can't do it. I start doing things and then forget that I'm doing it and walk away. I start sentences and not finish them, walk to the kitchen and not remember what I wanted. I'm also finding myself doing weird things for no reason. For example yesterday I was in the bath and on the phone with my best friend because I need constant company as things are right now, and she asked my why I'm shaving my arms. I didn't even realise I was doing that. I never shaved my arms and it was just so weird, it didn't make sense.

I have a Best friend who I am currently avoiding due to this and other toxic things.  Let's call her Jessie.

Now Jessie and I have been friends for 4 years and I have noticed alot and memorized the things she said before.

Things she say about depression


- she dragged me into the restroom stall cut her wrist infront of me.

-then bragging it to everyone including the teachers and guidance counselors

-brags to everyone she got r*ped by her cousin and going into details no one asked for

-when we called her out about her showing off her cuts and making me and my other friend (who has depression) uncomfortable then the next time she went to school with a bandage like what Arc (my friend) did before but this time she makes it obvious to people like she's wearing a fucking jacket and she's using her jacket to cover up the bandage so ""no one will notice"" but she doesn't even use the FUCKING SLEEVES AND JUST COVERING IT UP OBVIOUSLY EVERYTIME SHE WALKS INFRONT OF THE CLASS. (sorry I got pissed there) 

-she says shes depressed all the time and when we do confront about her toxic behaviour she'll say word for word ""I don't really care it's my life"" or gets really offended and goes ""JUST GIVE ME A KNIFE AND LET ME KILL MYSELF, I'M BEING ATTACKED, I FEEL. LIKE SHIT, I'M À FAKE I'M ETC."" 


- there are ALOT of things she did but that's not the only mental illness she says she has

Things she said about Anxiety

-saying she's having a anxiety attack and told me she's thinking about what if's but never has one unless we're going to present infront of the class. (she also describes anxiety attack as crying with a faster heart beat. That's it. Nothing else.)

- literally uses ""I have anxiety"" when I get excused for the reason (I am diagnosed with anxiety, social anxiety to be exact, also I didn't ask to be excused if anyone is asking)

- saying she has medication for anxiety, then when I asked about it she says its sleeping pills.

-then when asked how come she doesn't know the name of the sleeping pills she explains that her parents doesn't want her to know the name so she can't buy in a pharmacy, even though you need a letter of a doctor to buy medicine

-then when asked about the medication and telling her that sleeping pills are not for anxiety (atleast for what my psychologist said) she says that the sleeping pills is for nightmares. And changing what she said before.

-when I confronted her about the fact that and anxiety disorder is not like what she said, she got angry and said DO YOU EVEN KNOW ABOUT ANXIETY like I was the one without anxiety.

126,"Hi all,

I have diagnosed aspergers and depression - and have always had a load of anxiety on top. In the last 6 months I have also now developed OCD and paranoia and it's getting worse with each passing day. I have to check all the electrical sockets in my house at least 4-5x before leaving the house, then when I go out I'm convinced I've left something on and it'll burn the place down so I'm a wreck while out. My clothes get soaked through with sweat everytime I go outside and I'm hyperfixated on the idea people are staring and judging me. I get tongue tied trying to talk to people. My fingers are always clammy and sweaty and I have to pick at my nails. My heart is often racing for no real reason. I have to check all my pet cages are shut properly at least 10x a day even when I have just checked and KNOW they are shut my brain goes mad until I go check. I have to check the door is locked repeatedly at least once an hour. I feel absolutely miserable most of the time. The paranoia has extended to my friends I mistrust them and believe they're up to no good but luckily there's a part of my brain screaming at me still that this is nonsense, so I'm able to rationalize my way back to reality.

I was working in retail throughout the pandemic so I have not been locked up inside like many others but I am currently off sick due to the stress of this all (was also finishing off my degree at the same time). My manager has shown no consideration toward the situation (though she does not know any of my conditions) and is constantly harassing me to know when I'll be back in. When I was at work it was constant rumour mongering and gossiping (typical retail) that impacted my mental health too.

The doctors here (Britain - so NHS) are useless with mental health and throw pills at you. I am currently on 120mg of propanolol. It worked for 2 days abating the symptoms and in turn gave me insomnia. Now it's not working at all and I still have insomnia. 

I don't know what the hell to do. I'm terrified of discussing it because I have a past history of suicide attempts and if I say one wrong thing they'll lock me up again. But the medication isn't working, my OCD, Paranoia and anxiety are spiralling out of control and I can't just quit my work because then I will be punished by the government here and 'sanctioned' meaning they will not pay me any benefits to survive on.

I have struggled with shame and social anxiety for a long time. Between 2016 and now I have been in bad romantic and sexual relationships. I'm taking a break from that now. 

I have suddenly become obsessed with my body type and compare myself a lot, based on the preferences of my last partner. I have improved socially but sometimes assume people see me as this quiet, weird, ""different"" person. I mix up words a lot when I'm nervous. I went apeshit at that partner (over messages) after things were over and I regret it so much. No dignity or care for how it would make him feel. Totally desperate, aggressive, pain and ego driven rambling. There was truth in what I said but it wasn't good. He was sexually pretty coercive and disrespectful. I gaslit myself so much. Since that relationship I have started insulting people in my head more. Maybe because I feel isolated or socially rejected or just plain unhappy with myself. I really don't like it. It's like, misplaced frustration and rage, me against the world shit. Attacking others out of insecurity, sometimes based on things I judge myself for. I'm more competitive than before. I don't know how to address this, maybe another phone note with some reminders to repeat. It is uncomfortable because I know how silly it is. Gotta loosen up.

I did things as a young adult that reflected the lack of self respect I had at the time. When I feel ashamed of more recent things, I will think about the past and it builds. My alcohol use has been bad. I live in a smallish city and several people I have deeply embarrassed myself with are in similar circles. Of course they don't care and it's unlikely I'd ever come up, but people knowing vulnerable information is worrying. Sometimes I wanna delete my social media and almost feel like I don't wanna go out. I have no close friends and I wonder if there is something ""wrong"" with me that drives people away. I can be pretty normal and fine to be around but idk. I know I've been ""a lot"" in the past, especially when I was drinking heavily all the time. I have been looking into spirituality and stoicism, different kinds of meditation and I do maintain decent routines. I type and repeat affirmations and gratitude lists. In some ways, I'm the best I have ever been. I'm working towards future things and pretty aware of the areas I need to improve in. I'm off meds and doing ok. I know I have ego issues and feel ashamed of myself and yeah. Hobbies and interests help to make life feel less empty but lacking friends hurts. I rarely experience myself as strongly happy and laughing with others. Reading about growth mindset gives me hope.

139,"So I posted 5 days ago about how I was being overwhelmed by things that have happened recently. I'm going to have to go into a little more detail about some things that have happened over the last couple of days that are just adding to the pile.

I've had my younger brother staying with me for the night to get a break from my mums place because he's been trapped in there the whole of lockdown. My mum has been worried about him and asked me to try and talk to him so I did. Im a tutor so I gave him some help sheets for school he could use whether he was struggling or not (he has been struggling but won't tell us) and he literally scrunched it up and threw it at my face and didn't talk to me for the rest of the night. After I ordered him a pizza with tonnes of toppings (I don't eat pizza), made his coffee in a special way for him to like it, and he broke my console (by accident but it still frustrated me a bit). 

This bit below is more 18+

So I'm part of the ""kink community"" I don't really hide it from certain friend groups, the community I am in, and obviously reddit but I do hide it from a different friend group and my family etc.

Yeah I know it's not for everyone, especially the more hard core stuff like m/s and d/s lifestyles etc but I'm happy doing it, I'm fairly experienced and know what I'm doing.

However when I decided to open up about this side of me to my best friend, the person I've known a really long time and thought I could trust because usually we can talk about anything, he told me it was wrong and that I'm going to regret it all in the future (despite the fact that it is who I am not just a one off decision) and it sounded dodgy and he was considering reporting it. He's not used to kink in any way and even light Bondage sounds extreme to him so I understand why he'd think it was extreme but the things he said were horrible.",11Jul2020,1

144,"There are no psychologists/therapist in my town, and I can't seem to find one online(im from a small european country). I am not diagnosed,nor I ever went to someone for that,my mother thinks it will bring shame to our family.
I am female,17. Im from a small conservative town where mental issues don't exist, I am just ""bummed out"". I will talk about some of my ""issues"" and would appreciate if someone can tell me do these have a name and how can I fix myself.(i apologise if i came to the wrong place for this!)

● i was a very cheerful,outgoing child. I had no sense of shame,i did everything i wanted to and was nice to everyone. I was a fat kid who didn't come from a very wealthy family,and didn't dress as nice as other kids did. But I was okay,I still had many friends. I opened up to my friend about that, and ranted as a child would rant. I even confessed to her that I like a boy from our class. My friend mocked me right there in my face and went around and told everyone how lame I was. She said I wanted everyone to be jealous of me and told my crush I liked him to which he laughed. I was like 7 and all of that hurt my feelings so bad. It was a start of all my problems. I felt shame for the first time of my life,I couldn't even tell my parents about it. I don't know what was wrong with me,but I wanted to take revenge on that girl,so I made a big club for girls where we could show our talents or smth silly like that,and didn't invite her. The club became a huge thing and had like 30+ members from our school. The girl told her mom how I was excluding her and being mean to her, and I didn't even get a change to defend myself. I never apologised to her,to this day. My teacher made me wear a badge on my shirt everyday that said ""bully"" and being the first girl to get that,everyone was shaming me. 
●Since then, I become much more reserved. I felt shame in everything I did. I had friends still. I was still one of the most popular girls,despite being uglier than them. They were nice to me,but I couldn't trust them. I felt they didn't like me and talked about me behind my back so I cut them off. I become reserved,talked less,cynical,sarcastic.. i was borderline mean to others. I became ""less popular"" over the years,had only one friend.
●that one friend used me and abused me in every way she could. She talked behind my back,told everyone my secrets I was preparing for days to tell her. And i couldn't cut her off,because I had no one else left. The boy she had a crush on,had a crush on me. I didn't like him,his personality and vibes were giving me warning flags ,but my friend was obsessed with him. She spread lies and rumours how I hated that boy and I hoped he would break his arms or dumb stuff like that. Those who forgot I was a bully,remembered now. People were talking to me only to copy my homework or similiar. But I was trying to be nice and make them believe I was a good person and I ended up being a slave to anyone who said ""please"" to me.
●Now in my freshmen year of highschool,I met completely new kids who didn't know me much from before. They know what I did in 3rd grade(that girl lied about it a lot more,she said she started cutting cause of me,attempted suicide, and that I was telling her to do it,WHICH IS ALL FALSE). Luckily,they know that girl and know how she was and still is a drama queen so they had my back. I felt amazing then. However,soon i got the feeling they were nice to me out of pity.
● the summer before highschool,my dad died. It was very sudden,I was at countryside when it happened. I know it's insanely fked up,but after hearing those news,I was in denial for only a few moments and then I felt relief. I loved my dad and he loved me but he was someone I feared. He was strict and had high expectations of me,so each time I messed up in school or smth, i was punished. I will never forget how dissapointed he was in me,i could see it from the way he looked at me. How unhealthy i looked.(my bmi was always in a healthy range,i was never obese, just chubby). He had  a stressful job,he neglected our mom and my sister and me,how he came almost every night home drunk and would yell at us. Once he almost hit mom in front of me and i will never forget the fear in her eyes. He didn't care for his health,he was smoking 2-3 packs of cigarettes a day,no matter how much me and my mom begged him to take care of himself. I wasn't much suprised when I heard he died of heart attack. I still miss him and wished things had been different,but sometimes I feel way easier.
●because of that I thought my classmates had pity in me. Everything they did ,they did cause of that. And it was true. I was nice and tried to talk to them,but they had limits. No one ever accepted my offer to go hang out,everyone was always busy. However,i was never too busy to do their homework. Since quarantine started,i had talked to no one besides when they needed something from me. My only friend who I mentioned earlier is in another class and she barely talks to me. I asked her if I could hang out with her friend group,and she let me once. Around 10 of us went to a basketball game,and according to my friend ""was getting along too well with her new crush,so it's best I don't come anymore."" Her new crush even messaged me but i felt bad for my friend and told him we can only be friends. I liked him too,but didn't want no drama. Later I found out my friend was talking about me with him A LOT. She tried to make him  hate me like she did the last time her crush liked me,and told me how i was insanely arrogant and only care about my grades,and how i was always depressed cause my dad died. Just bestie things ♡
● the truth is ,i was not depressed. At least no one could notice. Never,ever,since 3rd grade,had I shown any weakness in front of others. In middle school i was too reserved and pretty emotionless,and now in highschool im constantly happy. Even tho im constantly not. I feel their eyes on me,how they expect me to make a sad face or cry sometimes,but i always smile and crack a joke. At my dads funeral i smiled and was polite to everyone who came,i didn't want them to see me cry ,to see me vulnerable. When someone directly insults me,my first instinct is to smile and shrug it off.
●okay,next is fat shaming. My mom never fat shamed me,but my grandma did it. I swear she invented fat shaming.i was 6 when she started and she still does that. When i visit her,she cries cause im so ugly and will never find a husband. That damages me pretty well. The rest is typical,haha ur so fat,omg r fat and other stuff. When quarantine started i was home for the whole day so i didn't eat much. I got obsessed with weighing myself and so far i lost 50lbs and i still feel the same. I feel huge and i cant look at my face in the mirror,don't even mention photographs. Gym class was a hell as well,imagine 30 people laughing at you,, i got used to it too.
●i never had a boyfriend,but i did have a few almosts. At around 8th grade i stopped telling my friend my crushes since everyone would find out from her and i was sick of "" girl look at you,you have no chance"". Well one of the guys that i once had a crush on,confessed to me in highschool and i rejected him, cause he hurt me once and i didnt like him anymore obviously. However,he started guilt tripping me,(his dad died when he was young)and he purposely played on that card and since i cant talk about anything vulnerable about me,the word ""no"" couldnt leave my mouth when he was asking me out. I felt horrible and in the end i ignored him and i still ignore him when he talks to me. Since i couldnt say no i stopped talking to him completely. This march i had another 'almost'. I was charmed by him,and he ended up so manipulative,toxic, he degraded me so much and acted like he was 100 times smarter than me so i snapped out,but i still feel damage. I feel fear when i think about one of those 2 guys. I feel fear when I remember my dad. 
●i am literally unable to talk about my insecurites,problems and stuff. I feel something in my throat and just can't. My mom urges me to talk to her but i cant. I feel like if i start crying i will die from dehydratation cause i have been bottling up my tears and emotions for so many years,i would die if i let them out now.
●i am scared of people now.scared of them shaming me. Im not shy,i can talk to anyone without stuttering, but i feel like if i talk to that one boy everyone will see me as desperate,thirsty etc. I feel shame so much to the point of being suprised when a girl in a movie confesses. To express your emotions so easily??? Miracle.

145,"I recently got kicked out of my dads house because he wanted to rent my room to someone for a high price, he came into my room and threw out a bunch of my stuff when I was at work and I came home and he wasn't around for 3 days and wouldn't return my calls or texts. I could kinda take a hint so I moved out and back into my moms who is a hoarder with 14 cats, where I sleep on a couch and don't have any privacy. Then my dad finally texted me ""we have to talk"" and he chewed me out for being a ""messy peice of shit, and I ruined his apartment"" literally i had just not done dishes in like 3 days because I had to work overtime for 4th of july. And he told me that my mom raised me like shit. Then the very next day he tried talking to me like nothing had happened and was like ""I got you food"" as if thats enough to make up for everything he did and said to me in the past few days. On top of this I've been busting my ass at work recently, I work on the beach in 85 degree weather everyday for like 7hours and people have been assholes someone screamed at me ""if I was donald trump I'd beat the crap out of you"" just because I stop people from breaking rules like no dogs on the beach and you have to wear your mask. Also my old friend from elementary school committed suicide recently but there won't be a funeral because of covid. 
I'm sitting here watching TV thinking about how I can't motivate myself to get ready to go to work at all today.

148,"i have depression and anxiety, but i’ve been controlling it well with medication and therapy once every 2 months (i should probably have more sessions but i’m relocating soon).  diazepam 1 and 3/4mg + pristiq 50mg.  relatively light doses.


lately i’ve been feeling like i’m losing my grip on reality.  there are short periods, maybe 10 minutes to 30 minutes, where i feel detached.  like reality isnt real.  like i’m in a simulation.  if i die at any moment, nothing will change because everything is simulated.  i don’t feel as if i’m living, or alive.  even though i’m generally happy and content outside of these periods.

i dont think it has anything to do with quarantining, since i live in asia and we generally have it under control + can live our lives with masks.

it sounds really stupid but these ‘episodes’ have been gradually increasing in occurrence and duration.  i dont have episodes where i do things and i dont realize im doing them.  i just feel really detached from myself and ’reality’.  looking back into the past almost feels unreal, as if it never happened.  should i be concerned?",11Jul2020,1
149,"Is it normal to feel overwhelmed because it seems like everyone wants you to do something, be something, and you’re falling behind? 

Sometimes I have these moments when it seems that the world is moving too fast, everyone around me is expecting me to be a productive member of society and I’m constantly disappointing said everyone.

Just now, I had my relative tell me that I need to make use of the knowledge that I acquired up until now to produce something of value (meaning money), my mother constantly wants me to do little favors for her or go with her for a walk or something, + a lot of other little things from my family as a whole. Then there’s also the pressure that I put on myself to be more social, to constantly improve, to please people around me. 

All of these things may be good for me, all the advice that everyone gives me, but I don’t really care at this point. I’m just so tired of feeling like I owe it to everyone to do this or do that.

My family is really tight and we’ve tried really hard to work through each crisis. But once we get through one the next pops up. She’s losing friends and pushed family to breaking points.  She has basically convinced my dad, who tries really hard to support her, that he’s a horrible person and the root of her problems.   He’s not perfect, but there is no way these things are my dad’s fault. 

My mom, and most of her family, are all really negative people. My mom was neglected as a child. She talks about not being loved as a child. 

Anyway, I love my mom.  She was an amazing mother to my sister and me growing up.  I want to help her and I don’t want my mother to have to live in conflict all the time.

I talked to my dad about the possibility of her having depression, but we don’t know if/how to move towards a good path if that is the case. And we have no idea if it is. We are definitely a family where the word depression is Taboo and we’re afraid to hurt my mom.

167,"I'm a 17 year old guy who has played football(soccer) since I was 8. I've always done fine in school and have a really good social life. I've been the best at the sport in my area and was the top scorer for the most competitive league in my country India (Hero Youth League). I've also always played video games and have been addicted to Rust, DayZ and CSGO since I was 14. Due to my genetics I have been able to peak my fitness and football skill while playing videogames all day.

However this all ended in 10th grade when I started facing problems with my ankle and getting injuries everytime I shot the ball. I got an MRI and got diagnosed with numerous injuries(impingement, bone marrow edema, synovial thickening) bone marrow edema being the worst out of them. This injury wasnt enough to prevent me from playing but caused me a lot of constant pain and prevented me from being able to shoot the ball at a certain angle with a lot of power. I also have had constant ankle pain for the last 3 years. Finally this year due to quarantine i was able to rest my ankle for 5 months. My parents took away all my videogames which were my primary source of happiness after football so I have had nothing to do but study and wait for my ankle to heal. Last week I finally decided to play a 5v5 match against some college guys and got the most horrible swelling after playing for 10 minutes resulting in me not being able to walk and I still have the swelling preventing me from being able to walk for the last week. My dream has always been to become a professional footballer and this year was my last chance to fulfill it but this injury seems to have not changed in the 5 months of healing as it feels worse than before i started the rest. I just dont see any point in living anymore as the only thing I really want to do with my life is being taken away from me because of this injury. I feel like a cripple and cant see myself getting an office job in the future just giving all of this up. The only thing that brings me joy in life is football and I've basically become a cripple as any physical exercise results in my ankle swelling up to the  point that I cannot walk. The only thing I have to do now is study all day and attend online classes but its not what I feel I was born to do. I have 0 happiness nowadays and don't see any point in living anymore. I am completely aware that there are people who have much much worse circumstances than me and I seem like a baby complaining about this but I don't feel like I have a reason to live anymore. The only thing stopping me from ending it all is how I know that it will deeply hurt my family and friends and could result in them blaming themselves for it when it was really just me who was the cause for it. I feel slowly and slowly neglecting that consequence and I feel eventually I'm just going to end it because I dont have any real purpose in life anymore.",11Jul2020,1

I'm dealing with a lot right now with some pretty serious and debilitating health problems that are frustrating to get help for as most doctors don't know much about. I needed Counselor #3 to help me work through my thoughts and told her so. 

Right off the bat, I just felt that things weren't ""clicking"" with Counselor #3. I realized that my misgivings were because she seemed to not really be listening. Counselors #1 and #2 were great with reviewing whatever I had just said: ""I understand that it's frustrating that X and that you would like things to change with Y. Can you tell me some more about Z?""

Counselor #3 would just ask open-ended questions and I would provide a response only for her to completely change the subject each time and not acknowledge a thing I said. This made me question why I just put in the effort of telling her all this. 

Is this normal?",11Jul2020,1
170,"There are situations which are very sad and helpless that make everyone around me cry but i dont feel like crying, i do feel extremely sad and should be crying but i just can't.
For instance when my grandfather died, everyone around me was crying and i was sad too but i did not cry a single tear.(But that might be because we weren't close enough)

Another situation was when my sister got married and in Indian customs it's a very big deal when a girl gets married and she goes to live with her in-laws so everyone gets really emotional. Even during those times i did not feel like crying even though my elder brother(who btw used to fight with her like shit and i was much closer to her), my parents my cousins and everyone around was weeping. I am close to my sister but i did not feel like crying.

Today my parents were fighting crazy and shouting at each other, later my mom started crying and soon my elder brother started crying as well. I feel extremely sad and nothing at all at the same time right now if that makes sense. (I dont know if i am making any sense at all throughout)

my grandma has been dealing with a lot in the last couple of years. one winter, years ago, we thought she wouldn’t make it. she had gone septic. I don’t know what that means but it’s when you have an infection in your blood. I drank myself into a stupor and ugly cried to my friend. a while later she got diagnosed with lung cancer. it hasn’t been... bad, but it hasn’t been good. 

she’s not eating. likely an eating disorder. she’s rail thin and after struggling with her health on and off so so many times she’s... becoming absent. like her mind isn’t there. 

and someone needs to take care of her. and I don’t know if I can be that person. I don’t know if I’m ready for the emotional heartbreak, the TRUTH that my grandmother will die. and it’ll come sooner than later. that I’ll watch as she can’t take care of herself. that I’ll have to bear witness to her decline. I don’t know if I’m ready. I won’t be. But no one else can take care of her, and I live at home at 18 years old with no job because of my chronic illness. 

I’m scared. I’m scared. Because I know she will die. And I know it will be soon. I will lose my grandmother. I will lose her. And no ones ever ready for that kind of heartache but I’m especially not ready. Im just. I’m scared. I’m scared and I can’t talk about it because my mom is scared too.

175,"Hopefully this is the right place to post, but I’m looking for advice from people who’ve experienced what I’m about to share. I’ve struggled for years with anxiety and slight depression, but I feel like I’ve improved so much over the past year or so. I’ve started seeing a therapist who really helps and understands me. I find ways to document and intentionally take time to process my feelings in a healthy way, etc., so I don’t immediately default to lashing out. But now matter how hard I try or how much improvement I feel I’ve made, I’m still always seen as the bad guy. In every. single. situation. I can’t escape it. 

Whether it’s in my relationship, at work, with family, I’m always in the wrong and I am always the bad guy. I can’t stop shaking this feeling lately and it’s really taking a toll. I hear the way my family talks about me, “you’re a loose cannon, you’re short tempered, you bring so much drama to everything, you’re crazy and scary.” My partner is saying similar things like “you don’t have patience, you’re not nice to people, you’re acting like a douche bag.” These comments have been so hard to process and I’m really at a loss because I try to explain how I’m feeling or why I’m reacting the way I am. The blame is always shifted back on me, thus always being the bad guy. 

At this point, being able to honestly share my emotions or how others are making me feel has been a huge step forward, but no one else will admit fault in the situations or experiences I try so very hard to productively talk through. 

I don’t feel like it’s worth making any additional effort because I’m still the bad person in most situations and will always been seen as such, despite all of the effort and positive progress I truly feel I’ve made. 

I never once felt that I have been some terrible person, but I do recognize I have a few areas of growth and I’ve been working so hard at those. In my heart, I also believe l am not a terrible person — I am compassionate, selfless and overly considerate. 

Just at a loss and needed to share this somewhere because having this conversation with my partner, friends and family is just an endless cycle of taking the brunt and ultimately becoming the bad guy.",11Jul2020,1

But I was born and raised in America and grew up with an American lifestyle or mindset about freedom and bring able to do whatever I wanted.The ironic thing is, in the Bengali community I'm considered a quote on quote ""light skinned beauty"" and get asked if I'm biracial.. Lately I've just been experienced a lot of unintentional microaggresions and it's starting to pile up inside of me and turn into resentment and anger towards myself for not being white. My mom makes me dress modestly and I can't drink or have dogs or barely go outside much. So I can't ever fit in wherever I go besides NYC. I grew up in NYC in a diverse community with lots of ppl of different color and religions but then moved to Long Island which is when I began experiencing actual racism in late junior high- early hs. I got called a camel jockey, sand nigger, Indian (even though I'm not Indian) , Hindu, ""smells like curry"" back in high school. I was never considered pretty, attractive or dateable, no one asked me out to prom, and the popular white girls in school would always leave me out but pretend to be my friend . Some of my white friends made fun of me while I was talking on the phone in Bengali with my parents sometimes because they never really heard the language before.   Flash forward to college, I went to a small engineering school called SUNY Poly with mostly white guys . Even there I was called ""ew"" and how guys wouldn't date me because ""I'm not a white female."" And now to present day I don't experience direct racism as much this year but I experience unintentional microaggresions in my engineering job now. People can't pronounce my South Asian name, and don't even bother asking how to pronounce it. They confuse me with another person or name of a that is brown or Muslim. My name had five letters and it's pronounced the same way you would spell it in english. I keep getting asked by coworkers what country I came from even though I was born and raised in the united states and probably went around the states more that they have. It's really starting to get to me. I literally started googling ways to get a skin bleaching treatment. I also keep wishing I had more brown or black friends but I don't who can relate to me.

179,"Hey guys. I really don’t know what’s going on with me or why I’m like this, but I often feel really bad about myself. Even on days when I’m mostly fine I might start crying out of nowhere. I don’t know what to do.

I think this has to do with my childhood. It wasn’t anything terrible, but I was bullied a lot at school because of my disability (I have mild autism), and I received no support, and as a result I became extremely anxious. Home life was hard as well bc my mom was extremely demanding. It felt like I had to be perfect. She would pressure me a lot with school and we would get into fights often especially when she wanted me to practice my instrument, and those fights would get pretty agressive. There was a period of time during which she would beat herself up in front of me whenever she got really mad, and say I’d made her do it. She would also say things like “I’m only staying alive bc of your sister, you don’t deserve it.” I feel really bad typing this out bc I love her so much and she really loves me too and she’s been supportive in other areas, but this has traumatized me a little. Now that I’m older, thankfully, our relationship has gotten much better.

I realize now that my childhood is like this “black box” that I don’t want to open bc I don’t want to go back to feeling alone and without support. I’ll have an adverse emotional reaction to anything that reminds me of my childhood. And then I feel guilty bc there are so many people who’ve had it so much worse, and I wonder why I can’t get over it.

During the lockdown I had to go back to living with my parents in my childhood home and I felt trapped. My mom was putting a lot of pressure on me for my studies, and I felt so isolated, it made me really anxious. It got so oppressive that I became depressed and started to have anxiety attacks during which I would harm myself (I was put on Xanax). On top of this my first boyfriend, who I’d been with for 3 months, lost interest abruptly during the lockdown and then broke up with me. He was a little disrespectful and since the breakup I’ve felt worthless and humiliated, like I’m unlovable. I’m 21 and most of my friends are in successful relationships by now.

I really don’t know what to do. I have a therapist and I tell her this stuff but it’s hard bc I can’t help but feel judged and I’m afraid I’ll break down crying if I try to talk. I have friends but none that I talk to on a regular basis and I’ve tried to tell them but I don’t feel comfortable doing that either. I often want to hurt myself and I’m sick of feeling so worthless and angry and alone.

180,"Hoping for a discussion, if anyone's feeling it. I have so many questions; feel free to contribute to any that you feel you can.

The word 'depression' usually makes me think about the usual symptoms you hear about - low mood, loss of motivation, lack of pleasure, hopelessness, etc. I want to understand it beyond that though.

I want to understand more about how feelings, behaviours, thoughts, and perceptions range at different levels of the spectrum. More about what the spectrum of depression looks like. Can anyone share experiences or recommend resources that address this?

My depression is never too deep, yet it does impact areas of my life in a deep way. I have always had calm feelings of not really minding if I'm here or not (which occasionally deepen into a desire to just casually stop existing, but that's usually because I'm in pain, and it'll fade). The worst it gets is I might not be able to get out of bed, enjoy life, I may feel hopeless, and stuck. No matter what though, I feel that I'm always really happy, excitable, and positive inside, and that everything is always going to be okay. I've never lost that hope.

I feel that I am mostly firmly planted in a reality that is shared with others around me. But then I'll talk to someone like my brother, for example, who shares thoughts/feelings that make him sound like he's talking another language, like he is in another reality. Like big time cognitive distortions. I feel I have to be careful what I say in case he may interpret it the wrong way. And it's very scary to witness him in his own reality, or in his dark place, because it's like he lives there now and there's no coming back from that. Do you know what I mean? Some people seem to somehow make depression *who they are*, and not something they're experiencing.

I have never had a depression that makes me plan or fantasise about ending my life. I have never become my depression. My depression feels more circumstantial/environmental than anything. My depression is more like, I'm just fed up of the world being a dark, crazy place, where people aren't always kind or welcoming. It's like, I'm tired of being a part of a system that is oppressing us all, where it's hard for me to thrive. It's like, I'm fed up of things being so hard for so many people on Earth. It's like, I'm fed up of everyone walking around unhealed and unhappy. I just want everyone happy - how I feel I am deep down.

If I am depressed, and someone points it out, I believe I am able to see it, own it, work on it, and improve things for myself. There are people I have met though, where it seems that nothing could ever work on them. My parents, to me, seem like people who will never not know depression. I have never seen them not depressed. In my mind, because I have cured many of my depressions, I want to believe that most people can be cured - with good therapy, psychedelics and other life awakening experiences, prayer/meditation, REALLY putting in hard work and diving deep into uncovering trauma and healing it. ... Or are there people who really just are depressed and nothing can be done about it? And why is that?

How does depression differ in people who have an environmental link versus people who have a genetic link? Might it be that genetics make it much harder for those people who cannot alleviate their symptoms to ever move past it?

Where do you feel you sit on the spectrum? What is your depression like? How do your thoughts become distorted, and are you aware that it's happening? How do you bring yourself back?",11Jul2020,1
181,"I had my annual physical earlier this week. Of course, I hesitated to say that I have been struggling mentally, but I tried to get it out there to my primary care practitioner. I mentioned to my PCP how I have been stressed and anxious and that was before the pandemic hit. She did not acknowledge it and brushed it off. I realized this after my appointment and left a long and honest message in the patient portal about how I have been feeling and how it may be affecting my physical health or vice versa as my bloodwork results weren't good and I'm still relatively young. I asked in the end of it that I just wanted a list of counselors in the area or a way to find one.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days later, I'm able to have a follow-up appointment after fighting with a ton of scheduling assholes in the medical office. I was really upset about how rude and nasty they were to me. She was 15 minutes late to the telehealth appointment, and asked me in an angry and annoyed tone, ""Why did you wait to tell me after your appointment that you've been feeling this way? Why did you not mention it during your physical?"" I replied back ""I told you but you DIDN'T LISTEN TO ME!"" We just kept going back and forth, with her yelling at me that ""I do listen and I write everything, I write meticulous notes. If I didn't write down that you had anxiety and you go commit suicide, it's on me."" (and yes she said commit). Well I'm sure someone has done it already lady and yes it is your fault for not listening to your patients when they bring something up that concerns them about their physical and/or mental health. 

&amp;#x200B;

Immediately after trying to tell me what a good listener she is, she told me ""so now I can write you a prescription for a SSRI because that's all I can do for you. You already mentioned that you tried everything."" I quickly fought back on being placed on medication (by a health professional that has not properly assessed me). It wasn't until i mentioned all the side effects and knowing people that took anti-depressants and then as a side effect went and died by suicide, that she started mentioning alternative supplements and online counseling. I told her how I didn't know how I felt and I didn't feel comfortable telling her anything anymore. I was just upset at her office and she told me that ""I had nothing to be upset about"" and how she had three more patients to see after me. She never provided me with a way to find my own counselor or how much I should be taking of a particular supplement.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, when  I tried to reach out to my counselor that I had this past spring at college, I left a voicemail two weeks ago and she still hasn't called me back. I called the office this week and was able to reach the counselor on call, and she told me she'd send a message to my counselor that I wanted to speak to her about finding local resources, but no one has gotten back to me since. 

&amp;#x200B;

My healthcare professionals have failed me. I tried to find a counselor on my own, but where I live there aren't many providers here, even though my county has 1.5M people. As a result of dealing with these idiots, my mental health right now is even worse. Everyone tells you to reach out to healthcare professionals but when I do, they ignore me or berate me for being this way. That's not a way you treat your patients, clients, customers, etc.

We've been through alot of things together and individually, and we've been each other's strength. (Quotation on the title because we're going not official until we meet but are in love so.. yea)

So, this post isn't what I have gone through in the past so I won't mention it. 
Well.. she has been a victim of abuse(mental, physical, sexual,etc) and has been really depressed and suicidal her entire life. She has had many losses in her life, peope she loved and cared about, dying or abandoning her. She self harms too. She was raped once before when she was younger (I'm 17M she's 15F) and that infuriated me so much that she had to go through that, along with this stuff..

I have some mental issues myself so I wasn't able to sleep because of them, so I one night a few days ago, opened her text in like 4 in the morning where I live, and she said that she was raped again.. and was going to commit suicide and was saying her goodbyes.. I somehow managed to stop her and make her feel loved enough to stop, but this has taken a toll at me..

When someone is interested in me as a friend or they try to flirt with me, I ghost them. I have terrible social skills and I have extreme trust issues. I can never believe that someone is attracted to me and I always think that they’re just toying with my feelings. I feel broken and alone because of the humiliation I’ve dealt with in the past. I don’t even feel human. It’s like I don’t deserve to be happy and people would rather see me in pain.",11Jul2020,1

I've become someone completely different from the person I was and want to be. I struggle to keep friends, I'm always failing someone left and right, I'm always angry. I've been through so many different medications and I'm about to go back on (after a 5 month break where I felt a bit more ""normal"" only to crash down spectacularly) a couple different meds.

202,"This is gonna sound weird but I think about this a lot and i figured the fine people of this subreddit could possibly help me. I think I either lost my mind or had some kinda mental break down two different times. Ill try to keep the explanations brief and hopefully someone hear can help explain the situation to me. 

First time was when I was extremely stoned. I was at a friends house and we were smoking non stop. After a while I was laying on the bed and k started getting paranoid. Ive gotten paranoid before while smoking but this time it was really bad. I started thinking a bunch of bad shit was gonna happen, then I started feeling like my reality was shattering. Like it felt like the world around me wasn't real and that my mind was disintegrating at the seems. I'm being 100% serious here. It felt like my reality was breaking.

Second time was when my very mentally broken ex gf told me that she lied about getting better about self harming and that she put up a facade and faked her happiness throughout the whole relationship. She told me over vc. I dropped to my knees bawling my eyes out and then out of nowhere i just felt empty. Once again it felt like my mind was shattered. It wasn't as much as the outside world breaking like i felt the first time. This time it felt like my own mind was breaking and everything I knew was a lie.

To this day I don't know what the fuck happened those two times so I'm hoping one of you guys that are intelligent when it comes to mental health can help me out.",11Jul2020,1

207,"before i write the actual post, i’d just like to say i wasn’t sure how to flair this as i’m sort of asking for advice and online resources at the same time. 

i (20f) recently had my first mental health evaluation since 2014 or so. 

back in 2014, i was diagnosed with depression, generalized anxiety, and bipolar disorder (unclear on the type). 

as of a week ago, i was diagnosed with severe depression, generalized anxiety, PTSD, and bipolar type one with psychotic tendencies (my psychiatrist said she believes it’s either bipolar type 1 with said tendencies or borderline personality disorder since i fit most of the symptoms, but she’d like to wait to confirm BPD after some more sessions/notes/etc). 

this is all news to me as i thought some of my more severe symptoms were stemming from just depression or anxiety, but it turns out i had more going on than i realized. 

my questions are:
•do any of you have tips on dealing with flashbacks? mine aren’t so much visual, but in every other sense i’m reliving traumatic events. i find myself getting what i thought were just intrusive memories/thoughts, but i end up reliving the situation emotionally for sometimes days to a week or so. it’s been effecting my relationships severely because i isolate, my job, doctor’s appointments i need to go to, i can’t go to certain places or so certain things, at times i lash out, take my emotions out on the wrong people and am just generally disoriented. 

•do any of you have some resources that explain more about PTSD and bipolar type 1/borderline personality disorder? i’ve had bipolar for quite some time so i know a bit about it, but i’d like more specifics on specific types and whatnot.  

•do any of you have tips on 1) changing your mindset, 2) not giving in to delusions caused by trauma/trust issues/insecure thoughts, and 3) communicating your emotions in a more healthy way? i find myself getting emotionally overwhelmed and it makes it hard to communicate effectively with those i care about. 

i know these are all things i should ask my therapist, and i do plan on doing so. but in the meantime before my next appointment i’d like to reach out to you guys and try to do some research/talking on my own.",11Jul2020,1

215,"i dont know if im bicurious or gay or a pedophile because this shit is fucked and idk what to do about it. so im 20 and my friend who is a guy is 16 and ive seen his dick like multiple times already. the first time it was a total accident, i swiped on his phone and saw a picture of it, and the other times were because he just wanted to flash me. like tonight for example, we were swimming together and i was underwater and he swims in front of me and flashes his dick in front of me. He thought it was funny, and I did too but I got a boner from it which i know is fucked up and it was just awkward and I don't know why I feel this way whenever I am friends with someone for a long time.

This shit even happened with my old friend who im not friends with anymore because he thought i was too sensitive and couldnt handle the stress of me venting to him all the time. back in 2018 i made a friend who was 14 at the time and 15 when the friendship ended and we hung out all the time and had lots of sleepovers. i ended up getting attached to him and forming a little bit of a crush on him in the middle of our friendship which made things awkward. He used to let me rub his ""abs"", I hugged him once after we had an argument and I got a boner, and i even asked if we could kiss to see if im gay or not (which he refused). oh yeah i did that to my current friend too, asked if we could kiss but he takes everything as a joke and dosent care about what i say. i ask if anything i say bothers him and he says nothing i say bothers him. we even go as far as to slap eachothers ass and ive put my hand on his thigh a couple times while he was driving as a joke while we were messing around.

I know the shit i do is gross and i honestly would never do anything to hurt my friend(s) and thats why i would never go farther than ive already gone. i would never do shit to someone while someone was unconscious, i would never beg for sex from a minor, and i would never force myself on a minor either. i know this shit is fucked and i honestly cant believe i even have to type this shit up. I guess it would help to say ive never been in a sexual/physical relationship ever in my whole life. ive never kissed a girl/held hands with a girl/hugged a girl/done anything like that. the only experimentation ive done was when i was like 8 or 10 years old and my friend wanted to always run downstairs until our pants fell down or lay on top of eachother butt naked or shit like that. anyway if anyone has advice for me that would be great because im honestly really needing it right now. 

TL;DR: I am a 20 year old virgin who has never had a relationship with a girl or boy and whenever I form new friendships I start to get sexually attracted to them

Edit: Also just in case anyones wondering how im making friends with minors in the first place its because I look very young for my age (around 14-16 yrs old) and even tend to act that way alot which I guess attracts people of that age group.",11Jul2020,1
216,"I spent 2 years of my early childhood feeling violated and touched in ways I didn't like by a close friend of mine.

I ended up (recently, after reconnecting) coming to terms with the fact that I was in love with her at the time, and had a lot of pent up anger and internalized homophobia at the time. It feels like all the trauma treatment I've done is just because of some elaborate lie that I somehow made up. I feel like I painted myself as a victim. I feel disgusting.

And now I'm in yet another situation like that. An ex-boyfriend who attempted to sexually violate me quite a few times. I just feel like a liar. I feel like all the terrifying ""flashbacks"" I get are completely made up. I can't even trust myself. I feel that I don't even deserve to call myself a victim, but at the same time I feel like I've just been hurt one too many times.

I was doing so well, too! I haven’t gone to therapy or a doctor and I’m too scared to ask for one, but goddamn I thought I could to it on my own. 

I was doing okay before, but this weekend I cut calories again! Yesterday I got 500. 500!! And right now as I write this I’m at 300. That’s certainly not enough. 

Do I have to go to therapy? Should I get real help instead of just my dad’s advice? I don’t know, I don’t want to, I don’t want to have to go to treatment I don’t want to face what I’ve done I just can’t! 

I’m not even underweight! Would they believe me? Would anyone care if I’m not in immediate danger? They wouldn’t put me in a psych ward or treatment. They would just hand me a calorie recommendation and say fend for yourself wouldn’t they? 

I don’t know what to do. I’m just not worth it. I should just keep it to myself I don’t deserve anyone’s worry anyway they have their own things to deal with. 

Five of my friends haven’t talked to me in weeks. So who really cares? I’ve only spoken to two of my friends for about three weeks, and only those same two spoke to me on my birthday.

We didn't approach trauma issues as I jumped states suddenly before the pandemic. I was firmly under the impression that i had done as much work as possible to come to terms with what I went through as a kid. I moved in with somone who was still working through their issues as if they were fresh (i dont mean to sound condescending i just solidly called anything in the past, the 'past' and this person hadnt.) and I think it forced me to think about my things on repeat which only escalated due to lockdowns. This person also was the first to call me out on some personality traits I had no Idea i had. That really shattered who I thought I was, and I have no outlet to deal.

Whenever I speak of my point of view to either of my parents, they always respond with an un-related answer. And when I am direct with them, questioning whether he/she had heard and understood what I said, they always say yes.

For instance, my father would be taking about a topic, and raise point A, I raise point B in relation to his point A, and asked for his opinion, and the answer I'd be getting back is a repeat of his point A without any mention on my point of view (point B). 

&amp;#x200B;

I told them many times back then and eventually I got blamed everytime for not being able to understand their response and relate it back to my spoken input, eventually this let me to start questioning reality, and whether I was actually able to understood anyone's word, my anxiety spiraled and I kept getting stuck in the thought that I may be schizophrenic for never really understand what anyone says.

I am in a a lot better place now and I don't ever doubt my ability as a listener anymore. But I am still buffled if anyone had studied this characteristic, and if there is a scientific term given to such?

225,"I’m currently stuck in my parents’ house, and with how depressed I’ve been feeling recently + unresolved LGBT issues because my parents are homophobic and transphobic, I feel like I could definitely benefit from therapy.

However, I don’t feel comfortable talking about subjects such as being LGBT and parental abuse over a voice call, in case my parents overhear and give me a hard time (beating) for it. I can’t do in-person either because my parents won’t let me leave the house for any reason, and definitely not for therapy; they don’t believe in mental health and think therapy is a waste of time and money. I’ve heard that therapy over text isn’t effective.

I don’t see myself getting out of my parents’ house anytime soon, even if the virus goes away, since I actually got better grades while schooling from home so now my parents think that home is a better environment for me academically, and will probably make me stay home for as long as my school provides online classes, even if there is an in-person option.

I feel like there’s literally no solution to this and the only thing I can do is waste away from depression and dysphoria under my parents’ roof??

226,"I met my husband about 3 years ago when we were both 18. We quickly fell in love and got married (af of yesterday) a year ago. We lived long distance for the first year but I'd vodot him two days a week via bus until I learned to drive. He proposed right after out or first year of being together and we moved into an apartment about 4 months later. We wtayed happy, sex was good, we rarely argued. I would do dishes, he did laundry. He supported me and raised me up when I was down. He helped me get a dr and a therapist. I found out I have bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. He supported me through my lows and self harms. He would cook me dinner and hold me as I cried. We moved into a bigger apartment and got married. 

Everything was okay for the first few months. Sex was still good, we rarely argued. But then... 

Slowly but surely things changed. Here's some side story that feeds into what I need help with. 

My best friend Tara and I got into a bad fight. A huge one. She had a key to our apartment and gave it back and basically told me to fuck off. Now, this girl was my best friend. My soul sister, everything I needed in my life. We did everything together and she took me camping, just the two of us, for my bachelorette party. So here we are fighting, and the 3 of us are working on the same client at a call center. My husband was a lead there. I know what you're thinking, why was my husband above me? We were told that it was okay because he didn't have any real power. 

On the night that Tara gave me my key back, I had been mentally exhausted from the fights that had recently started with my husband and I. This caused me to have a total and complete breakdown at work. I ran to my car and sobbed for 10 minutes. Here comes my husband, yelling at me that I'll get fired if I stay out there. 

He drags the 3 of us into a room and tries to fix things. It made things so much worse. He punched a wall, screamed if we didn't become friends again he would kill himself. 

Someone overheard it, and went to our supervisors. This launched a massive investigation again us. I was forced to go to a different team, Tara quit work for a slightly different but stemmed from that night. My husband remained lead. 

I HATED my new team. Because of Covid we had to work from home. I had mental break downs nightly and would get yelled at that I'm making him feel guilty. I don't remember what this fight was over, but he got so mad he punched a whole in our apartments door. He also yelled at me saying he doesn't think I love him. He scared me and I was afraid he would hit me. I decided I was gonna leave him. I left for the night and told him the next morning i was leaving. He convinced me to stay. Begged me and said he would kill hinself. I talked to his grandma who I'm very close with and she helped me think cleared. So I stayed. But, I then got a call from my mom and my best friend, let's call her Julia, that they need me to move back to my home town. My mom has a 4 year old daughter, and my friend has 2 kids and is going through a divorce. 

It took a couple weeks but I decided to move down there. My husband initially was to move with me but after sevvvvveral arguments and scary fights, he stayed behind for a month to pack the apartment up with the help of his parents. 

I ended up in a relationship with Julia. ( I'm poly and my husband is extremely supportive so he knows). 

I'm so hapoy down here. I have my dream job, my mom and I are finally close after she and I lost contact for years. I'm happy. But... And here's where I need help. 

He constantly says I'm overshadowing him. Saying that my problems are more,important and that he doesn't matter. I had to go to the hospital for severe side pain. He told me I wasnt allowed to. I finally went two days later of extreme pain and it was a severe UTI that was in my kidneys. His comment was, "" at least you're alive to complain about it."" 

He also says that I turn everyone against him and he doesn't even want to be in the state we're currently in. It took him months to even try for a job. When he finally got one he decided he's,gonna quit because he can't handle over nights. 

He constantly tells me he's going to kill himself and that I'm being horrible to him.

229,"so my parents died in a car crash because i failed to stop my dad from driving while piss drunk. i have severe depression. or atleast i think it is. 1. i let my dad drive piss drunk. 2. i offered for my mom to sit in the front and she accepted. i have to hide it because i have a little sister and she’s the only thing i have. she also looks up to me. i love her and will do anything for her. but i don’t know how to help her get through this as i can’t help myself and it’s killing me inside. one of my best friends cut me off because she didn’t want the “negative energy” in her life. my whole family blames me for their death and i don’t deny it. i just want to make it better for my little sister but i don’t know how. she’s literally all i live for. but she’s starting to realize what happened and how it’s my fault. she’s 9 now. i don’t want to leave i really don’t. i’m so fucking scared because when she’s gone i don’t have anything left. and i know it’s only gonna end one way. after my parents died we lived with my aunt. and then she kicked me out because it was my fault. so i took my sister with me. we bounced from place to place until we got put into a foster home and then a year ago i got into a good university and she stayed with me in my dorm. i always told her our parents left us. i couldnt tell her i just couldn’t. now she’s visiting family more and she’s realizing what happened. and i’m so scared that i’m gonna lose her and i know how it’s gonna end if i do lose her. i don’t have anyone. all my friends are gone. my family despises me. she’s the only thing i have. i’m failing class, i’m slacking in my job. i cant sleep. i cannot seem to be positive at all. but i still get motivated because i want her to have a good life and not be burdened by this. if she’s gone then i’m nothing. literally nothing. i want her to be able to relate to other kids. i want her to be able to say she had a childhood. i want her to grow and have a boyfriend and get married and have a family of her own. i want her to eventually forget about me so that i can leave this place because i’m worthless. i don’t even get horny anymore. i don’t find joy in anything. i haven’t told anyone because i don’t want them to call a therapist or suicide prevention i just want them to listen. another thing. i’ve tried getting a girl in my life. i’ve tried getting someone else to love other than my sister. i’m either ugly a loner or a freak. i’m still trying after 2 years. but i understand why. i cant fulfill a girls needs at all. i wont be able to keep her happy. sometimes i think i’m not enough for my sister. she’s the only reason i’m not doing anything drastic. and i try to give myself credit, i can’t.  i literally can’t. i try to but then the guilt of my parents death completely outweighs it. all i’ve been told is that it was my fault. i can’t believe anything else. i don’t use substances or any form of drugs because it’s not what my parents would want.",11Jul2020,1
230,"All day long. Every single day. I hold this in. I'm not a psychopath, but I have this unbelievable urge to kill someone. Not just a random person, but someone who deserves it (in my mind). I've had this and held it in my entire life. I'm 34 - and it's just not passing. I never kill insects, because they're so pure and have no nuance. I don't have a history of killing animals. I did kill a cat when I was 9ish, but that was a personal vendetta between me and that fucking cat. I hated it. Anyway, it's people I despise. Fucking cunts, the lot of us. Every time I see a dead body, my instant reaction is that they probably deserved it in some way. I spent two years, maybe more, plotted up opposite an alley where I felt it was a ripe place for a rape, and fuck me, the things I had planned for the potential rapist would make Hitler blush. I applied to be an assassin when I was fifteen, with a criminal record of grievous bodily harm after shooting someone as my credentials, but they wouldn't take me on because I have psoriasis and could leave DNA evidence at the scene. That was my only plan for life. To take it. And I can't even do that. I have very few emotions; a skeleton set of them at best, being angry, obsessed, fixated or indifferent, especially with regards to people, but I *was*  definitely narcissistic. Now it has come to light that the person I'm in love with - me - has nothing to offer. I'm a dud. I'm a miscarriage that kept growing. I have nothing to offer the world other than my own projection of misery. Actually, on reflection, I might be a psychopath. Am I? I don't give a fuck if I am. I'm probably going to end my life soon because I can't stand this frustration anymore.",11Jul2020,1
231,"I am a 22 M, I have worked and attending school for the last 8 years giving myself time to sleep. I had very little social interaction outside of school and work. Always kind went with the idea of co workers being friends, slowly realizing that’s not always the case. 

To add on top of that I have a special needs sibling that took a lot of dedication and time from my parents who have a small to nonexistent social circle and further made me limit my interactions. If people couldn’t accept my sibling I wanted nothing to do with them. 

Moving on to my college time I had a rocky start as a freshman (not knowing how to go to events and hangout with people). My sophomore year I left my living situation because of several roommates treating our dorm as a bar. Then I lived alone my junior year and finished schooling online my senior year. And I currently live with my parents and my girlfriend with hers aprox 200 miles away. 

More about me I do not drink, I leave one job to go to another to make ends meet, I have a long term girlfriend who I plan to propose to soon but she also has a small social circle and is an only child (none of these being negatives but it’s not like I can inherit more people I guess). I work a high pace high stress public service job (very long hours and low pay) and I do landscape work to help make ends meet. I do not really have many hobbies, I play some videos games but not a super dedicated player, I have a few fish tanks but that’s a fairly solo hobby, I enjoy being in the outdoors but never found people to do that with outside of scouting, I have tried to throw myself into many more hobbies lately with no real avail of finding more people to hangout with. 

I don’t really know what I want but I live a very lonely life, it makes it hard to move forward some days knowing I will really only talk to co workers and my girlfriend. There are days where I might not actually talk with anyone in person or through social media until I am a good portion through the day. I just feel like I don’t have anything to offer, I am not truly funny, I don’t think I have good stories or stories worth sharing, I have lived a very quiet life and I just don’t know what to do. 

Come Monday I will he reaching out to a counselor as well as my primary doctor to have blood work done, as some days are better than others but generally they are a 5 out of 10. 

I know this is a lot to read and take in, I hope to get some advice or a suggestion from someone, I have never tried to reach out like this before. 
Thank you.",11Jul2020,1
232,"For some reason, ever since i was a child, sex work fascinated me. I want to earn money for something i'd otherwise do for free. 

I don't think there is any way i'll lead a successful life, so why not just make myself useful? I think i'd be pretty decent at it, just enough to make a living. I've been feeling pretty suicidal for the last few years and i see no future for myself, so why not make use of my body while i'm still around?

I don't worry about feeling dirty and worthless after sessions because i feel like that even when im not doing anything. I just feel so done.. i want to be a punching bag (both metaphorical and non metaphorical) for someone. I'm obssessed with the thought of becoming a prositute while i'm still a bit under 18.

233,"Hey guys, I just want to tell you my journey of kind of learning to not give a fudge (can I swear?) and become a sort of unempathic hedonist because I love attention; hope you have fun! 

I was a lil loser that was pretty awkward and cringe with a group of friends that disliked my quirky annoying presence (understandably so). I took everything to heart so I kinda just decided to make myself not care anymore and it took a loooong time but I got there in the end, kinda.. by just telling myself that I'm a loser and am worrying about stuff that won't affect me in many ways at all, I should make the most out of my silly human life. I now no longer feel much empathy toward most people as long as it doesn't involve physical pain (because ouchies, man), this helps me have fun with people by messing with their emotions without hesitation (I've always wanted to do this but felt too much empathy to actually go through with it). I've learned to live for pleasure and to minimize pain as much as possible. I'm going to join multiple activity clubs such as karate lessons and other sports clubs and act as a quirky schizophrenic for the lulz. I invent new personas for fun because acting covertly is SOOOO fun. I'm going to buy reading glasses and I'll be Mr Serious professional gal at my new job as a bartender, ooohhh I can't wait. Live for pleasure (remove any hindrances such as overthinking and being overly emotional and you'll be set to go) and life will be a fragrant breeze, just make sure you've got money covered and live in a simple apartment without too many expensive unimportant items. This is the easy way, you could try living a so called ""respectable lifestyle"" but is it really worth it when you have a simple, eventful and enjoyable life? This won't work for everyone, it will if you go through the effort of developing my mindset. Just remember, I love youuuu alll. I'm high on life and I hope you all feel good. Just kidding, life is pretty terrible and I don't care about any of you because I am a brooding psychopathic edgelord that doesn't care about anything because I am a dark badass.

They stay quite far away from my work but it was fine due to working from home

237,"Hi all. I hope you’re having a lovely Saturday! Just a reminder, if you’re in need of some support, my PM’s are open when you’re comfortable enough to have a chat. Times like this, we should all be supporting one another, and I’m more than happy to support you as much as possible. :) 

- Discipline your mind to think positively. Discipline your mind to see the good in every situation and look on the best side of every event. 
- Always end the day with a positive thought. No matter how things were, tomorrow’s a fresh opportunity to make it better. 
- A positive thinker sees the invisible, feels the intangible and achieves the impossible. 
- Life is like a book. Some chapters are sad, some are happy and some are exciting, but if you never turn the page, you will never know what the next chapter has in store for you. 

It’s not easy to think positively, especially when you’re feeling as low as the ground. Always remember, think positively in every situation you’re in. It will help you out, bring a smile to your face and give you strength. 

I trust each and everyone of you. I believe in you all. To get to the bright days, you have to go through the dark ones. You’re getting there, baby steps, you’re improving each day. I am
proud of you. And I always will be. 

Massive hugs to you all.",11Jul2020,1

239,"Will try keep it short but everyone has down days and struggles in life, I have never seeked help apart from self help, but I am pretty sure my levels of unhappiness are allot higher than normal. At the same time you hear many people struggle to live, have struggles behind closed doors, are putting on a brave face. 

I am trying to change my mindset to be more positive, my main sources of pain are career unhappiness (covid does not make it easy to change this), and high living cost. I was hoping to make a career move until covid, then I stopped wearing a seatbelt on the way to work because I felt trapped in my current job. To put it simply I see living as painful and barely worth it, it seems like the average person in modern capitalism is in a constant struggle just to keep their head above water and feed themselves it is hard to not think you would be better off .... sometimes. Sometimes my weekends are spent in misery battling constant thoughts about life. 

Like a said I am trying to be more positive and live a better lifestyle, I tried to start of my weekend of ok but then I got a missed call from someone which disrupted my line of thinking at the weekend, this set off a spiral of how much better they are doing than me, basically compared everything good about their situation to all the worst parts of mine. Messed up my energy, couldn't be bothered doing much the rest of the day, Went to bed early, didn't even get changed or brush my teeth, seems like stress causes me chest pain which concerns me but in the darkest hours I just accept it like I don't really care if it takes me, I don't think it is normal to ever feel like you don't have the energy to breath. Sometimes I hear about news stories of people dying in accidents and people saying how sad it is, In my own miserable mind I think oh-well at least they escaped the pain of living. 

Other days I am ok. I would rate my extremes of happiness as 9 out of 10, because at 10 I would be dead. So if everyone has bad days how bad out of 10 are the worst days of the average person? Is this something you can work yourself out of with self care, I know some of my triggers are situational such as career but it is not easy to change them yet.",11Jul2020,1

244,"I sometimes feel like crying, and I want to, but I just cant. I have been in therapy ever since I was 12, I am 20 now, my parents are divorced and have been for 7 years. Between then and now I have developed an Anxiety disorder, which I was in Treatment for in a Clinic for 6 months. I now have that under control. When they divorced I was 13, we moved to Europe and my father stayed in the US. I yearn for the past, because the future is too imminent. I also have Narcassistic Traits, which cloud my judgment sometimes. I feel like my emotions are at a Constant state of distance from my own self and being. I havent had a solid relationship, because of the disruption of my emotional development. I dont lack social skills, I have plenty of friends and get invited enough, sometimes more than I want or need. I feel like I am scared to commit. My relationship with my mom is not good, we fight often, and I lack empathy towards her. I want to feel guilt and empathic when she starts crying, but I feel like I cant. She says I lack empathy in General. I dont know, I can cry during some movies, but over a person feels difficult. And I know that if she does get sick, that it will be partially my fault, she has said this to me, but even before I knew it is true. I am angry that I cant cause her less stress, and seem to push and oust all that to the side. For some reason I sometimes look forward to sadness, and to that moment where people point fingers towards me when she gets sick. I dont want her to get sick and I do love her alot though, and its important to me how she feels and how she is doing. But our relationship hasnt been based on feelings, since I do not feel comfortable sharing mine with her. One could describe it as cold, from my perspective. My father and I arent that close either, I would describe the Relationship as the same, except that we dont fight often, 1. because he lives far away 2. because I feel more respect towards him. I dont have suicidal thoughts, but when things get bad, it calms me to think that in death there is no bother. I am not suicidal. That was actually one of my anxieties growing up, thinking that I am. I Think that it crosses my mind as such because of need of attention, I never say it out loud though. As I am typing this I am scared that you will title me as such. Usually I am happy, and I think I do have a Good life, but I dont have any aspirations. I just finished school, and it is sad to see everyone leave. A good relationship, is what Im missing and I hope that is what can balance my emotions. Its not the problem of look skills as I have had turned down a few in the past, but a problem of commitment I think, any tips? UPDATE: I seem to have more bad luck in love than i thought. Recently I came into closer contact with a friend of mine. We stayed up multiple nights writing eachother, and sending voice messages, laughing so hard we couldnt breathe. She was even angry when i said that her best friend distracted me because she had also texted me at the same time. This plus many other indicators where I even asked my boys if this is finally the time for me to gain at least some stability. Each of them said that it was a 8/10 chance. All that just to find out that she has a boyfriend. The person before her was a Sociopath, who also manipulted me, and screwed me. And now her? Im slowly starting to give up. With no aspirations in life, and the law cutting down on my hobby (graffiti) this would have been the highlight and the reason to keep my head up. But once again, no. Im starting to give up, please help-I dont know what to do. I feel empty. Im literally the meme ""funny guy at school and depressed at home.""

247,"So for the past couple of years I've been taking antidepressants on and off as I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. The main issue I raised with my doctor is the obsessive picking of my skin around my fingers and lips. I eat the picked skin most of the time too. It sometimes gets super bad that I have to vacuum my floor because it's ridiculously littered with skin crumbs. Doctor said it's my anxiety that's causing it, so she gave me meds that are supposed to ease my anxiety.

However, I've been off meds since early this year and in terms of depressive episodes I've been doing great. But my skin picking hasn't stopped, even while I was on meds. I can't go back to the doctors yet due to the virus and I'm afraid they'll just keep giving me meds for anxiety when it's clearly not just anxiety that's causing it. I did some research and found out it's called dermatophagia.

248,"I have a lot of respect for people who are able to pour their hearts out anonymously to total strangers and then receive the feedback with grace. Let’s see what happens when I do it.

Labels, labels, labels. I do not like the label ‘disabled veteran’ because it sounds like a really shitty job title. “Hi, I’m CanalAnswer and I’m a disabled veteran. May I take your order?” I dislike labels such as ‘PTSD’ because it paints everyone’s symptoms with such a broad brush, the same way ‘war crimes’ can apply to everything from shoving a prisoner of war to shooting him. There are degrees of awfulness. There are degrees of disability. All things considered, I’m not that bad.

My wife and the VA disagree. I have no complaints about either — they’ve both been far kinder to me than I deserve — but I’m resentful of the label. Do I equate being disabled with being lazy? No. Do I assume that a mental illness is faked until evidence suggests otherwise? No. For some reasons, when I’m the one who is ‘disabled’, I feel the need to put the word in quotation marks.

Medically retired, or a broke-dick, or whatever the term is, here I am. The VA gives me a variety of benefits; in return, I’m not allowed to work. I think I liked it better when I believed that my emotional problems weren’t service-connected. I’m quite happy to admit to my own mistakes, character flaws, and emotional immaturity… but it’s harder to admit that sometimes I wake up screaming because of things that happened over a decade ago. It’s especially hard when I don’t remember waking up screaming. My wife insists that I do. She has no reason to lie to me. Then there are the flashbacks, the hypervigilance, the freaking out when someone comes up behind me without announcing it, and so on. The other night, I rolled over and pointed an imaginary rifle at my wife because she turned the vertical fan on. I’ve no memory of the sound, only of ‘waking up’ to the sight of her, standing over the fan, giving me a bemused look. We figured out that the click-click of the on/off switch sounded like a round being chambered.

So, that’s where I’m at: not allowed to work, feeling like a freak, but still financially stable. I have zero reasons to complain, which is why I (usually) don’t. I’m grateful to be alive. These… these habits might be with me until I die. I’m okay with that, as long as I’m still finding ways to be productive. That’s the problem. I feel useless.

I’m a decent househusband, according to my wife. There are stereotypes — we all know about them — and I’m a stereotypical housewife, but I’m male. I do the dishes, clean the house, feed the dogs, do the laundry, and do most of the cooking. My wife has a full-time job. I am completely happy with this arrangement, and so is she. Although I do feel guilty about not being allowed (or able?) to work, she insists that she loves and appreciates me as I am. She is a blessing and a constant source of joy. To the best of my ability, I make sure she doesn’t have to support me too much; that is to say, I try to ameliorate my symptoms and shield her as much as possible from the worst of it.

That’s why I’m focusing on learning foreign languages. It is an inexpensive hobby; it will make me more useful to the people around me; it is good for the soul (because it forces me to look around and realize how little I really know about other countries and cultures); it may even give me the opportunity to work again someday, if I can persuade the VA that I’m stable enough and self-sufficient enough.

Here’s what I’m looking for. Someone, please tell me what I’m missing. Clearly I’m doing my best, but there must be something I’m missing, some perspective, some fact, some insight… because I’m feeling guilty about putting my own needs first for a change.

It's kind of weird anf I'm fortunate that I've not had to deal with it, but she's the closest person to me who has died. I found out yesterday and idk how to feel about I've lost grandparents but I wasn't close to them. She was someome at one point wad a friend. It's also weird to have someone from my class die. It isn't like there hasn't brem pthers but she's the first one I knew. I reached out to someome who was in our friend group and she was such a bitch before I even said anything importakt. All I said was hey I know we've not 5alkrd in awhile but wanted yo know ig you've heard about (our friend)  I'm sorry ig this doesn't make sense I'm just needed to share with someone outsife of my emotional self.",11Jul2020,1
256,"I am convinced of the fact that this is normal. My mother and I seem to share the same level of paranoia (she might have unknowingly taught me this) though they come in different shapes. That’s why I think it’s normal, and just something people don’t talk about due to being taboo.


Thoughts like «my friends/ family all hate me, they are whispering about me» and «they pity me, they think less of me». These thoughts can come from nowhere, from a remark or two, or from a wrong movement or gesture. I know this is irrational and silly, but in the heat if the moment it all feels *so real.* It is a fact— like how the sky is blue and gravity is real— undeniable because to me it is all tethered to a solid fundation to reality, though most times I tell myself to not get upset and ignore it. Ignorance is bliss afterall. Even if this was all true, being passive-agressive won’t help. 


«those strangers on the street are laughing of me». The worst thing is that I know this obviously is rarely true. Yet my back burns from a dozen imaginary eyes glaring holes on my back with disgusted amusement.


Worse are thoughts like « can people read my mind?». Fortunately I rarely get that thought. That one is especially harsh because you feel as if you are a specimen put under a magnifying glass with a view of your mind for the whole world to see and probe into. I know this makes me sound like I’m on bath salts; it’s not as dramatic as I make it out to be. Funnily enough, when I tell a friend or two about some of my personal problems (not these) they often either laugh and say me to, or when they sense I’m being serious they tell me to «get help»— I realised then that I have a habit of overdramatising because it feels normal to me. Hurts in the moment yes, but I always manage to laugh at it in the future (or cringe at 2am ;)
So take this post with a grain of salt.


«If everyone is an asshole then you’re probably the asshole»
- a redditor.
Ever since I saw this, I’ve used it as a rule of thumb for these beliefs (just modified to fit situation). It might all be a type of projection for all I know.

257,"I’m just feeling frustrated with mental health treatment. I’ve been seeing doctors and therapists for the past 2 years and I’m not any better off, I think I’m actually worse. I wish there was any easier way instead of an hour or so long intake describing symptoms for a diagnosis, then someone making a guess as to which drug might work. Oh, that didn’t work, lets take a another spin of the wheel, OK how about this one? Meanwhile meet with a therapist and talk about stuff. And of course lots of advice from friends, family, and society at large... exercise, eat this diet, meditate, practice gratitude! I’ve tried so many different things my head is spinning. I just want someone to tell me why this is happening to me and make it stop.

OK, thanks for reading, just needed to get that off my chest, hoping maybe someone out there can relate.",11Jul2020,1
258,"Hi,

This is an extremely personal post. It is a bit long, but I hope somebody finds the time to read it.

Ever since puberty, I have been feeling socially akward, uncomfortable and humiliated in social settings, such as at school, at work, and at family gatherings. I am socially ept, I know how to respond to situations and act in an appropriate manner. However, my extreme social insecurity has always lead me to being quiet, stand-offish and asocial.

I always thought this was just who I was, until something magical happened. When I was about 17 years old I made a school trip to asia, and for some reason my social anxiety/insecurity just vanished. I became social, got to know a lot of people and I happened to be quite popular. This effect lasted some more time when I got back to my home country but then disappeared entirely. I lost contact with the people I met and I reverted to my old, akward, insecure (and unhappy) self.

More years passed, again filled with feelings of social humilation, until a major life change seemed to provide insight into what happened earlier. I moved out of my parents house and again became a 1000% more comfortable in my own skin, got to know a lot of new people and lived as though social anxiety was something foreign to me. I acquired a social wit and confidence that was so strong someone suggested stand-up comedy could be something for me. This was really the high of my life and I look back to it with great joy.

Unfortunely, due to mental health issues I was forced to move back with my parents in 2019. And, to my great despair, I ceased to be that person I had always dreamed of being. The mental problems surely contributed to the huge diminishment of my (social) confidence, but are certainly not the only cause of it. In many ways, and sadly, I feel similar to the way I felt before I moved out.

I have long pondered why leaving home could cause such a enormous difference in personality, confidence and feelings of social-well-being. My parents are fairly normal, but I think my mothers personality type - unfeeling, critical and a know-it-all - is potentially causing me to internally collaps as a person. I genuinely think that if she were not here, I would again be that person that I'd like to be, but I'm not sure.

Unfortunely, there aren't many ways I could leave home again very soon. I'd need a job, and my social anguish holds me back in engaging socially with the world again. When I'm able to continue my studies, that would also be the time I'd be able to rent a room again (on my parents costs lol). That is what I now look forward to. In the meantime I have little choice but to survive this feeling of being less-than-me.

I wonder if anyone has had any similar experiences, regarding this contrast in social well-being. Any other comments, questions or advice is also very welcome.

Thank you.",11Jul2020,1
259,"I know the whole world is going nuts because of COVID, but i have been trying to be positive that everything will go back to normal.

So I’m asking, am i being stupid for trying to think positively?",11Jul2020,1
260,"I was wondering if I could get some input:

Basically, the guy I was dating stopped answering my texts for a little over a month now. He is active on social media and even likes my posts at times. 2 months ago he fell into a deep depressive episode and its like he turned ice cold from one day to the next. He never mentioned how he wanted us to handle the situation (as in no contact, or even end things). Based on your experiences, do you believe he will reach out eventually? I must say, previous to the depression, the relationship that was blooming was very close to perfect. At this point, I have been treating it as a break up. Its fine with me if he no longer wants to pursue anything romantic, but I genuinely miss his friendship and truly care about him as an individual. I guess I just wonder if he’ll ever come back with some sort of explanation? The whole deal was very confusing for me. The last message I sent to him, I let him know that whenever he is able to, even if its months from now- he can reach out, and let him know i’ll always be here for him no matter what. It just sucks losing someone that meant so much, just out of the blue. In the past we shared great communication and he always expressed gratitude- thanking me for always listening to him and being there for him. The ghosting has been hard because I cant seem to understand why he would do that. I know everyone experiences depression differently, but any insight would be greatly appreciated!",11Jul2020,1
261,"For reference I'm now 21/M/Aus

For a long time since I was 18 months old I've had a kidney disease which effected my weight, hair growth and overall growth throughout primary and high school. I always struggled with body image but had to always 'grow up' and 'be the bigger person' because I was different. Thankfully I had a few friends and fringe friends who's parents explained why U/nathannotforyou was different.

Das forward to the end of high school being 17/18, I never managed myself a girlfriend despite working to lose 30kg on my own accord. I was self conscious and my academic drive dropped. In my final year of school a girl I was getting close to took her own life, a close friend tried to (I had to call the police) and my close mates had family issues that were often taken out on me.
I dealt with it but was unhappy. Through University I struggled to find my feet and new friends and it wasn't until moving institutions and travelling to China that I thought I was happy, retrospectively I think it was the independence. 

Coming home I was miserable. I had no career ambitions or anything lined up and was so lost I felt the every decision I made had to be the right one. I put so much pressure on myself that I lost contact with friends and stopped cooking (the thing that's kept me going). I had a breakdown and had to seek out help. I went through feelings of despair, loneliness and thoughts of self harm. I fought back tears because 'I'm a MAN' at work and had thoughts of being gay/asexual because I hated myself and everyone around. 

6 weeks into my mental health plan I am in hospital now  with a Kidney relapse and an unexpected lung clot. It has been severely humbling as I've slowed down and taken time to write and think. I'm happier now than I think I've ever been, let alone when I came in. I now have 3 creative projects in the works, one of which is cooking related as well as a career in politics in my sights. 

I'll be speaking about my time in hospital, as well as my health history (both physical and mental) on my IG cooking page although I don't think I'm allowed to advertise that here (sorry?).

TL;DR. Struggled with body image through school and felt lost through University. Turns out I was depressed and had been showing signs for a while. I'm now happier than ever after a humbling series of unfortunate events.",11Jul2020,1
262,"  I didn’t have the best childhood growing up, and was the “quiet kid” in school. Literally, I did not really talk to anyone at all unless I was spoken to first; and even then, I’d usually just respond with a head nod/shake, or shoulder shrug. I had no idea why I was like that— I assumed maybe I was just ((shy)), but I don’t think being shy to that level is something many people are experienced or familiar with. It made me feel weird sometimes but, as a child, socializing with people was just hard for me. 

  Fast forward to more recent days, my social skills haven’t been as big of a problem since I was maybe 14 years old? Basically when I hit puberty, I got a lot more outgoing. Being outgoing results in more friends, and more friends can result in drama, and drama was something I became accustomed to in my teen years. Sometimes, due to what I’m assuming were insecurities, I was sometimes even the initiator or instigator with drama.

 As I grew up, matured and made more friends, relationships were introduced to me as well. I had 3 serious, long-term (long-term for me, at least) relationships, back-to-back, with short windows of time between each one, that were all emotionally/mentally abusive, from both sides, and all crashed and burned horribly. All of the drama that ensued within the blast radius of each dramatic break up, caused me to want to just shut out for awhile and disappear, work on myself— I was tired of losing people I was close to because of the way I would choose to handle tough situations.

I feel like each time I’ve wanted to “disappear” for awhile, I’ve found it harder to resurface and be social again. Of course I have my small circle of friends I’m close to and can talk to anytime comfortably, but going out and making friends is hard, and I feel like I come off as weird or socially awkward because I just lost all of my social skills. 

Can anyone relate? Is there anyone that might have discovered a solution to similar issues? 🤔 

This issue isn’t crippling me or anything, but it can be frustrating to deal with.",11Jul2020,1
263,Hi there I’m a 23 year old male that is currently struggling big time with my mental health in general but even more so I’m just feeling extreme waves of emotion currently. So for example I get extremely happy about the most obscure little things it’s uncontrollable but more worryingly I’ve been getting extreme sad waves. One of the big things for me right now is that I’m due to move out after buying my first house but very much struggling with the idea of growing up and having a feeling of it being the beginning of the end and that’s it all crumbling. I have a close connection with my immediate family and feel that this is it and everyone is getting older as I am and aren’t going to be here for much longer which just puts me into extreme waves of crying and sobbing that I can’t control. I’ve always had this very much pessimistic view on things which I’ve never been able to help but my reactions to them just seem to be even more present. I don’t know if this is the right place to put this but Im at the road end of it now and don’t know what to do.,11Jul2020,1

It's been 11 days since we lost you
Out of those 11 days, I've cried for 9 of them
I miss your voice, your smile, your laugh
I miss how you could make me feel good about myself no matter what was going on in my life
I miss seeing the happiness in your eyes every time you saw me
We only got close during the last few years.....I wish I had grown up before that so I could appreciate your true value
I'm sorry it took me so long to see how incredible you truly were
I'm sorry I didnt spend more time with you
I'm sorry I didnt take more photographs and videos
I'm sorry for all the times I thought of calling you but didnt because I'd had a long day....I'd give anything to make one of those phone calls now
  
I wish you were still here with us. I wish you could have stayed long enough to see me better myself and become the person you always knew I could be. 
I'm sorry if I didnt do enough. I just hope you knew how truly loved you were and still are.

tw: thoughts of suicide


 A while ago I thought a bit too much abt death and gave myself a panic attack and now I again thought about it too much and I don’t know what to do. I hate it when people say “Death is inevitable” when I tell them about how I feel. If death is inevitable why don’t I take my life right now?? Why waste any time if it’s gonna happen anyways??? 

I also hate it when people say stuff like “nothing you do in life is gonna matter” I know it’s meant to be uplifting for some people but for me it’s the opposite. If nothing I’m gonna do is going to matter then why live at all? 

If anyone knows how to stop these thoughts or things that will make me feel better about it pls do. I don’t want to be forgotten-",11Jul2020,1

267,"Every day has become excruciating

I've heard before that for men (perhaps women as well, but this was directed at men), their early 30s is the hardest time in their life.  Typically have one or more young kids that haven't reached the age where they are self-sufficient for most daily tasks.  Career is at the point where you have the most work vs earning potential - working long hours to advance in your career to get to the point where you can slow down a bit, enjoy your successes, and have the extra income.  But if you don't succeed at this time in your career, you'll never advance far enough to get to that point.  Your marriage is usually 5-7 years in now and hitting the ""first slump"".  Add to that - or perhaps the reason for it - the aforementioned items, and it becomes more and more a co-parenting situation and nothing that is filled with passion or excitement.  I'm 32, and I have found all of this to be true now.  Tough career, marriage that is 7 years in and going through a rough spot (no thoughts of divorce, just very much feeling like a job with no passion).  Three kids 5 and under.  They're wonderful kids, but they're just being kids - don't listen, yell, wake up the baby, disobedient.  Add to that that two years ago I got diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that changed my whole life and is a daily struggle, and my 4 year old son just got diagnosed as well.  Oh, and COVID of course.  Anyways, this rant is just that...a rant.  I have a wonderful life and family I know, but man, every day has become a massive mental struggle.  People at work need me all day long.  My kids need me all day long.  My wife has hit her limit and I have to pick up the slack all day long.  And by the time the kids are asleep, I just want to be by myself and drink, which I hate feeling that way.  Every day has become the exact same excruciating numbing routine, and I am finding it to be a very hard matter of breaking out of this mental prison.  Any suggestions?",11Jul2020,1

Hello All! 31F here and having trouble sleeping/eating over anxiety I’m having. Hoping someone can provide some sound advice, or has been in a similar situation before? ***Trigger Warning*** Please stop here if you are a sexual abuse survivor and hearing details causes you angst.

Long story short - I haven’t been to a doctor since I was 17 years old, due to the insane amount of anxiety I have from a past sexual trauma experience. The event occurred when i was 7 (Was kidnapped and held captive by my babysitters boyfriend) and tortured/sexually abused for days, before the babysitter got scared and ended up telling the cops and my parents where I was. I went through long periods of depression, suicidal attempts, and inpatient hospital stays - Before I finally got the help I needed and started workin through my issues in therapy.

Fast forward to today, I am a totally productive member of society with a great job &amp; healthy relationship. It has taken a lot to get to this point. We want to start a family, and that (obviously) requires doctors visits, obgyn, the works. I’m viewing this as one of my last giant hurdles to face my fear, since having a family is so important to us as a couple.

My questions: I have a shocking amount of scars from the event, and also some that are self-inflicted. I’m wondering if I should give a “heads up” to the nurses and doctors, so they are taken aback. 

Also- Has anyone else gone through anything similar? Fear of being touched/seen by a doctor &amp; triggering flashbacks? Even thinking about it gives me a cold sweat....

I appreciate all advice and candor. The lack of sleep and weight loss stemming from this is starting to impact my daily life. I know someone may ask, But no I am not currently seeing a therapist but yes, I would consider it if this continues.",11Jul2020,1
