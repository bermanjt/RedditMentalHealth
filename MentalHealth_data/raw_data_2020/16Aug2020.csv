0,"I've been having serious mental health issues for a good four years now if I'm not wrong. I kind of remember the exact period of time when things started to become lifeless and colourless around me and slowly little things became bigger things, I mean little patterns and the way I thought about myself, they way I saw everything, and I'd say it started with external factors pushing me down this road but it continued for so long because of me. I had a choice to turn my life around but I couldn't - because I started to go through a road of anxiety and depression and I couldn't ask anyone for help. The past two years have been gracious, I was able to get out of the difficult situations in my life but I just couldn't let that feeling go.

But I finally mustered the courage to seek a therapist, ask people for help and support, and I really want to make things better. At first I wasn't aware of what was happening with me and now I do and I want to take action.",16Aug2020,1
1,"Long story short, I'm 21 and i already have multiple mental health issues (C-PTSD, chronic depression, possibly Schizoïd Personality Disorder), due to heavy bullying in middle school.

During a summer camp, when i was 14, i had my first and only GF. I never had anyone care about me before then, and i think i started being a bit of a jerk to her, as i could get a little handsy even though i later realized she was embarassed. It was ""just"" that, me letting my hands wander a bit too much, but i still cant stop thinking about what i did, up to this day, and almost every day. I hate what i did, to the point of hitting me (not hard, tho) and getting a bit of anxiety everytime i think about it. 

Also, i now consider myself pretty much asexual and im starting to wonder if that's not related to that. I'd also like to recontact her to apologize for what i did, but i have no idea if she still thinks about it, and i think that it might be better for her if she forgot about it (i wouldnt like her to suffer from it)

As I said, i already have PTSD, and honestly the symptoms are quite similar, but i wanted to know if it  is possible for someone to get PTSD from something they have done to someone else.",16Aug2020,1
2,"I have just backed out two weeks ago from a career opportunity that could finally take me out of this mediocre life. Currently, I work as an underpaid healthworker swabbing confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients in my country. I still get flashbacks from my previous breakdown. I feel like a disappointment to my parents. All I ever wished for was to pay them back for the years they have spent financially on me (i.e. school). My parents never pressured me or anything, by the way, it's just my thoughts making me sad and all.

Tl;dr I refused a job that pays more because I think I wouldn't be happy there and I accepted a low-paying job that somehow makes me feel satisfied, but I want to adequately finance my parents and now I can't.",16Aug2020,1

PLEASE I'M TERRIFIED FOR HER. Hi, my friend luna tried posting but it's not showing up so this is her message. Copy and pasted. (I'm 15)

Hi, I'm new to Reddit so please be gentle with me. Anyways, my name is Luna, I'm 16 and live in Poland. So, my problem is that I live in a abusive household with very toxic parents and brother and I want to get out of our house right now. My parents have been abusing me verbally and physically almost my entire life, and I have had thought about commiting su*cide but I truly don't want to harm myself because I found a very good friend (That's a different story) and I don't want to hurt him. I truly don't know what to do with myself anymore. Please, answer me. Thank you guys.


(This part is me not her) I suggested because she wants to move country badly and has a few career paths in mind (Psychologist, dancer, actor), I thought she could move to the UK where I live to study at college or university. She loves to game (dunno if that means anything here).
Please help her. I'll message every comment to her ❤️.

Me now: there was other stuff like she got raped my her brother and severely beat.
Her dad beat her brother and chucked him out the house, she is feeling much better now. However she is very traumatised. I want to be able to raise money for her but can't set up a gofundme.",16Aug2020,1
7,"I don’t really know why I have came to a mental health reddit but it seemed to be one of my best options. Recently what I have been experiencing over the past few months since lockdown is unusual to me. 
I started off daydreaming a lot about myself in better scenarios with people who don’t exist just pretending and making up stories in my head. Keep in mind this is just to pass the time.  But nowadays it’s all I do. I can’t not zone out. It’s at the point where I don’t even enjoy doing real life activities because I have all of these weird stories in my head of an ideal life and real life just seems very dull now.

It's not okay, but i can't seem to convince him that stress laughter is a real coping mechanism and an uncontrollable one at that. If anyone else here experiences the same thing, i'll show this post to him to make a point.

9,"I am reaching out to others here who have been diagnosed with clinical depression. If you were prescribed Prozac could you share your experiences with taking the medication? How did it impact your mood, focus, general state of mind, happiness, suicidal thoughts? How long did you take it for and were you ever able to get off of it? How much did it cost you per month to buy the medicine? I have been prescribed a mild dose of Prozac and wanted to hear other people's experiences. I have been clinically depressed for sometime and much of it has to do with a heavily toxic work environment and having little social support living in a rural town. My family doesn't understand the support that someone with depression needs which doesn't help either. Have people on this forum found a way to get out of their depression without taking medication?

I’m 19 and in college. When I started my second semester of college in January I remember not being as happy as I was during the first semester. Since then everything has gone downhill.

I don’t care about anything anymore. I’ve lost motivation for doing homework. I feel like I’m too dumb for the major. I’ve been passionate about my major for 2 years. I give absolute zero shits about it now.

I used to love baking and reading and don’t even do that anymore. Everything is a chore for me. I can’t concentrate on my homework for more than 10mins and end up letting everything pile up to the last minute and rush to finish it.

I used to love going to work, but it hurts every minute is struggle. I feel like every bit of my soul is being pulled  away every second in there. Being around people is draining to me. Every social interaction is bad I always mess up. I know everyone at work hates me even the people who do like me hates me but is just nice. 

Every time I walk into that building I get impending doom. You know how hard is it to be in a building for 12 hrs when when the 20 people there hate you?  Everything nice people say to me is a lies. They don’t think I know that they’re lying (I know that’s irrational but my brain makes me think this).

I can sleep for 12 hrs and still be tired. Some days I get enough motivation to do something and the rest of the days I feel like doing nothing.

I hate everything I once loved. I just want to stay in bed a listen to music and waste away.
I don’t feel anything anymore.

If I just died in my sleep so I wouldn’t have to wake up and annoy people with my presence that would be good.",16Aug2020,1
11,"Hi,

I've been struggling with gradually worsening depression since the beginning of the pandemic, and as those of you who struggle with it know it comes with feelings of self doubt, self loathing, physical exhaustion and lethargy, not being able to do much, not being able to focus. So I haven't been going out much, and I haven't been seeing anyone but my boyfriend. And he's working on weekdays, and takes care of his daughter on the weekends. So he's a pretty busy person who has his shit together, when compared to me. He's been very supportive and he's the one that encouraged me to start seeking professional help in the first place. However lately I feel like he sees me as a disfunctional person who ""does this to themself on purpose, as self sabotage"". Well yes, but I don't want my mind to be self destructive either, I wish I could control it. Anyways. Today I called him when I was feeling overwhelmed, and he told me I should get out of the house, not do this to myself, go out and see some friends or at least take a walk. I know he intends well, but I felt so misunderstood, and as if he sees me as a child, a disfunctional being that requires ""a push in the right direction"". (He's also 10 years older than me, so this part has become an extra insecurity during these fragile times.) I already hate being in this situation and wish I was in the place to go out and do stuff, and occupy my mind with things other than my insecurities, past, future, etc. I just feel alone, and as if nobody around me truly understands me. It's extra lonesome during the pandemic because a lot of my friends have gone to their hometowns while I stayed in the city where I go to college. I almost exclusively get to see my partner, and he's extremely busy, or otherwise trying to give me advice that is simply not helpful. I don't know what to do.",16Aug2020,1
12,"So basically I touched a bottle of vodka that a homeless person was trying to steal, it was left on the ground and I picked it up to hand it to the security guard but then realized that it’s very gross because the bottle was on the homeless guy in a wheelchair.

13,"1) Forgive me for any mistake or error as im not from a english speaking country .
2) Not sure which flair to post as Im in a mix of venting out my emotion , asking advices and thoughts , .
Q : Why didnt I tell anyone except for my 4 friends ?
A : I wanna remain anonymous and those 4 friends wont rat out anyone .
Backstory : This happened back in March (before covid) But i elected to keep quiet as idk if i should say anything , I told my 4 friends that i met last year (When i was 15) . Alright , back in March I attempted to kill myself (again) but couldn't do it . My mom  came into my room and saw me sitting at the window (i live in the 7th floor of an 8 floor apartment) with my feel hanging out the window . She literally prevented my suicide by threatening me that she will kill me herself if i didn't crawl my sorry back to the bed . So i did and that was the end of it , still wondering what would happen if i actually jumped after she said that .
Q : You may be asking why do u wanna kill yourself ? A : Well its kinda complected . I wanted to kms again because I had a short fight with another kid in my class (who was a actual gangster , i think the gang is called 03) . It wasn't much of a fight but more of a he punch me in the face so i took of my shoe and threw it at his face , we almost actually fight but i saw a teacher climbing up the staircase (my class is on the 2nd floor of a 3 floor school) and walking to the right hallway so i stop cuz i know non of the class are gonna rat out this fight of we stopped rn and i dont have to go to the discipline room for a petty fight like this . 
Q : Why did we fight ? 
A : Cuz I was in a bad mood that day (due to me remembering my oast trauma) , he kicked me that day during recess and he has been harassing me , taking my stuff and not returning it for quite a while so i got hella mad that day and i let my emotion take over me called him the most popular derogatory word (you guessed it the n-word , with a -a not a -er) and thats why the ""fight"" broke out .
Q : Why didn't i told any teacher ? W
A : Well i did , i wrote a letter to my maths teacher (who was also a disciplinary teacher) explaining the situation , well fast forward a few days later nothing happened , so yeah . 
Q : Why did I only consult that group of friends i known last year?
Backstory : As to why i told the 4 of them about my issue even though we only actually known each other properly for 1 year , well 3 of them are going thru issues as well ( 2 of them are living with their mom as their parents divorced , the friend that consulted me has mom has cancer , not sure what cancer , i didn't ask him cus that private stuff) and the last dude , well he didn't have any apparent problem but he is a great listener) 
A : Because I dont think Any other friends would understand it . The friends that i made at 14 , well all but one of them didn't do anything to make me hate them for a while . What did they do ? Well they told the entire class before i came to school to ignore my existence for 1 day to see how would i feel . After that incident idk if i can ever trust them again with my private issue . And the Friends i made when i first came to highschool (13) , well they wpuld always rat out whatever I told them to their other friends so that is a no-go . 
Q : Why didnt I consult my parents ? 
A : Because parents and my mom's garndma is one of the problem . He would beat me up if i fked up on something . Like last year around Nov , He wanted me to help him carry a metal frame into the house , so i did and when i grip the thing wrongly and almost dropped it (my fault) , he put down the frame and punched me in the arm , I fell down the floor pretending it was painful so he punched me very hard , twice in the side as a reminder that I dont fake how painful a punch was . He also kicked me out of the house once (When i was 12) because he scold me and said that it was my fault that he didn't win the lotto , my mom managed to convince him to invite me back to the house (Technically I deserved that cuz when he didn't get the winning number he told me to get out the house immediately , I thought he was serious so i packed my stuff , he got really mad and actually kicked me out) . My mom when i was 11 locked me at my grandmother's house after an argument , My uncle (my mom's younger brother) quickly open the door and told me to be fast , well i was too slow as she shut the elevator door on me . I ran down the stairs (16 Floors) To try to get to her and when i did she drove off without me (she came back later but how was I suppose to know ? So I climb back the 16 floors , took me 5 minutes to reach my granma's house) and i saw her shoes there , I thought she hated me for that so i walked down the stairs and tried to walk my way back on foot , well i didnt get very far , As I walked to the nearby police station she appeared and told me to gtf in the car , she scold me in the car and said that i had to explain to the police what happened (thankfully I didnt have to do anything) cus she thought i got kidnapped . And my grandma , well between the ages of 9~12 she would always whip me with a bamboo cane if i didn't wake up from my nap on time , i loved her but i hated that she did that to me . 
Q : Child Protective Services , Mental Health Care ? 
A : I dont think that exist in south east asia ( I live in Malaysia) 
Q : Is your family abusive ? 
A : No , they were just brought up that way , but if i were to have any children , i definitely would not treat them like how s.e.a parents treated their kids . I want stop this cycle of abuse to keep going on . 
Q : Did any other factors contributed to how i act now ? 
A : Yes , between year 2013 (9½) ~ 2016 (12¼) I was bullied by 3 students . Since I was taken home by an uncle who rode a van (Its common for parents to pay Uncles and Aunties as a driver to drive their kids home , you may think that wont it be risky to do so , well yeah , but people normally dont just drive back 4 or 5 students , they drive back around a class full of students in 1 or 2 rounds to save on gas and earn more profit) . So yeah During those 3 years , since our Standard/year would release class early , It is just me and those 3 that have nothing to do . The leader , accused me of taking a large sum of money and not returning it , she said if i dont let her and her friends to whip her with a bamboo cane (uncle's) for an unknown amount of time (They would whip me until the other standard are released) So that went on for years until i was 12 , I wrote a sucide letter and tried to jump off the window of my apartment but i couldn't do it as im scared that i would break my parents heart . So i told my mom that the 3 were bullying me , Mom confronted the uncle and told him something (I couldn't remember what) , and promptly told him that i ain't sitting on that van again . She ask if i had any friends who could take me home  (thankfully i did and that brought an end to my primary school suffering) . 
Idk how to tl;dr this .",16Aug2020,1

It then came down to 2-ish minutes, and I've found myself unable to cry at all now. I feel all the sadness and pain as usual but I can't let it out. Recently, I've started experiencing a really strange phenomenon; I would go into an episode peak and I would feel tears coming out and streaming down my face.

17,"Hi y’all. A friend of mine had a bit of a melt down earlier this week, sharing incredibly personal and scary things on his story and posts on socials. I checked in on him a few times that day, and he kept assuring me that he was fine, but his posts spoke a different story including one about suicide and one saying that the hospital was the “next stop”. Now he has been radio silent on social media since Tuesday afternoon. I texted him on Wednesday to check in, and he didn’t answer. Same on Thursday, Friday, and today. The texts delivered, so I know his phone is on, but he hasn’t answered.

I told him on Thursday in my “check in” text that I was going to continue to check in until he got “super annoyed and tell(s) me to fuck off” but I don’t know how to keep doing it without repeating myself. I don’t want to keep saying “checking in because I care about you” so I’m looking for other things to say to remind him that I’m thinking about him but not necessarily in as many words. More fun things, maybe?

I can’t even remember what age. I’ve always had insecurity issues and anxiety my whole life. I got into an abusive relationship from 15-20 years old and got into a near death experience when my ex tried to kill me so I do have ptsd from that as well. After my 5 year relationship I got into severe depression where I would eat and sleep A LOT. Now I’m with an amazing man that’s my soulmate and is an amazing support but recently all my anxiety is coming back and I’ve been having anger outbursts that turn into panic attacks.

So I’m fat, since I was a child I’ve been self conscious, kids at my school (and family) always pointed out my imperfections with later turned to insecurities; I was bullied by my best friends in 5th grade when I was 10-11 which them turned to some kind of depression? And also gave me some suicidal thoughts and a suicide attempt (no one noticed since I regretted it halfway and stopped before I could do anything more dangerous). It’s been some years since that but I’m still feeling like that, and because of this pandemic I’ve had more suicidal thoughts and insomnia, which just basically made me a time bomb lmao, long story short, I have COVID and my grandma was making an appointment with a doctor, and asked for my weight, I just said “I don’t know, it’s 70kg I think” and she assumed it was because I was lazy and didn’t want to weight myself, but it’s because I don’t want to know my weight, she forced me to weigh myself and I was right, and THEN, SHE HAS THE AUDACITY TO SAY IN FRONT OF ME AND MY MOM “Oh, I told the doctor you weighed 68kg because I was embarrassed you weighed that much” LIKE EXCUSE ME?!, then I went to the bathroom, cried for half and hour (because my brain heard it as a synonym for “you’re fat and that makes you an embarrassment)”).

She has to tell me her struggles but in a way that she acts as if I have no idea how she feels and that I've never gone through that. But I have.

29,"I hope I’m posting this correctly and to the right subreddit, and if I’m not please let me know and I will readjust accordingly. 

I want to start off by saying that I’m in no way asking for a diagnosis, and I am not trying to self diagnose myself. I just want some insight and maybe some resources (helpful articles, etc.) on what’s going on in my head. I haven’t seen a therapist in about 3 years due to me moving, and I’ve procrastinated finding a new therapist for multiple reasons including: A) Having to go through my extensive list of mental trauma sounds exhausting, especially if I have to do it multiple times until I find someone I vibe with, and B) I no longer have insurance. 

So, to help me get a grasp on my mental health until I’m able to budget in regular therapy sessions again, I was hoping to just get some opinions and ideas. AGAIN, I am not asking for a diagnosis of any kind, just ideas or maybe some tendencies I may have. This is purely for education. 

What I was diagnosed with a few years ago was just generalized anxiety, depression, and I showed signs of executive dysfunction. I was prescribed accordingly, and that was that. Had to come off the medications since I was moving... anyway, moving on. 

I wish I were exaggerating when I say that whatever is happening inside my brain is ruining my life. I always seem to set standards for myself before doing anything else, and then I don’t have the energy or motivation to perform said standards. For example, I want to watch a movie, but I cannot watch that movie until I clear off the trash from my nightstand, scrub and clean my cat’s water fountain, and put my laundry away. I don’t have the energy to do all of these things so I stay in bed miserable because I cannot function until I do those things. Another example: I want to light my candle but I can’t light my candle until I’ve completed all productive tasks for the day... because I guess in my head lighting a candle symbolizes completion, and if I light it under any other circumstances it just doesn’t feel right... it’s hard to explain. It’s almost like I can’t allow myself to enjoy things like watching a movie or lighting candle until I complete this random to do list in my head. 

In addition to my already horrible anxiety, I feel like my brain gives me ultimatums (if that’s the right word) for the most ridiculous things. “Go back upstairs and put that shoe back in the corner where the other one is. Someone is gonna trip on it and it will be your fault.” “You didn’t hang your shirt up in its usual spot, you’re going to have bad luck now until you adjust it.” 

Sometimes it’s so bad that I’ve shown up to work late before because I had to turn around and go back home because I swore I left my curling iron plugged in and I thought my apartment was gonna burn down. I literally could not restrain myself; I was struggling to breathe and couldn’t focus unless I went back. (Yes, it was unplugged.) 

There are also times when I will see something with my own eyes, and a second later my brain will say “check again”, “check again”, “one more time”, “op—one more time”, and it will go on and on. Sometimes I need to ask my friends or family to verify things because I just don’t trust myself anymore. This makes me laugh now, but I just started a new job and was told to be there this past Monday at 8:30am. I sat in the parking lot from ~8:15-8:30 convinced that I wasn’t supposed to be there. I checked the email several times and still kept staring at the doors, then checked my calendar several times to make sure it was this Monday and not next Monday.

Anyway. If it’s not already obvious, it may seem like I have some OCD tendencies. So then why am I here if I already have a general idea of what I would want to talk to my future psychiatrist about? Because now I’m convinced I don’t actually have these tendencies and I’m just acting. I feel this way because I didn’t really understand what OCD was until I met a friend who happened to have it. I did some research, not because I thought I might have it, but because I wanted to educate myself so that I could better understand my friend’s habits and behaviors. I wanted to make sure I was being mindful of how I approach them, (Being very direct to avoid causing them to overthink as much as I can, reassuring them when they need it, etc.) As I was researching, I did notice some behaviors similar to my own, but I tried not to think much of it. I’ve noticed I tend to convince myself that I have things wrong with me a lot, and I didn’t want to set myself down that path. It was too late, though, because ever since then I’ve just been noticing my behaviors more and more. 

And now I just think I’m faking it all. “You’re just acting this way because your friend has it and you doing this is some strange tactic to establish a bond with them.”

Lately I’ve been asking myself... Did I have these symptoms before I learned about OCD? Is this even OCD or is it just really bad anxiety and I’m trying to find a better fitting label for it, so I’m acting accordingly? 

You know how when you meet new people, you eventually adopt some of their speech patterns or small quirks without noticing? It’s totally harmless and normal (wait... this is normal right?) and we don’t think much of it... it can even be endearing sometimes. Well, I now feel like I do this with some mental illnesses. Which... who in their right mind would want a mental illness of any kind? I don’t even know. All I know is that it’s ruining my day to day life and I wish I could finally understand what’s going on so I can learn to cope with it... whether it’s anxiety, OCD, or some weird copycat behavior.",16Aug2020,1
30,"I know, I know. Never trust the internet. A lot has been happening with my body recently and every time I go to Google it's always a symptom of depression. When I was 13 a psychiatrist made me take a test and it said I had severe depression too. Nothing's ever been done about it like a diagnosis or medication but things keep getting worse. My period is getting delayed constantly (as a trans guy you'd think I would be happy with that, but it's like you can feel the estrogen building up and up and up and I hate it), food doesn't taste good even though I could never tell when I was hungry in the first place, my sleep is out of whack (has been since I was 7), my weight is going all over the place (I have a bad relationship with my weight so this isn't good) and I find myself wanting so SH a lot more. Idk, I should feel something, I should be able to tell. I should feel like I'm on the same planet as you guys. I get a fair few numb or sad periods, the more recent ones have been lasting months at a time. Should I see about getting a diagnosis and possibly meds? I've tried therapy but it's a bunch of pointless talking to me. I don't cry or get any of my feelings out, I'm just recounting events and my annoyance at this world and the people living in it.

I'm turning 16 soon, I don't want to live like this.",16Aug2020,1

32,"so i was on tiktok and a video came across my for you page where this person was singing a more chilling, folk type song - i'm usually really into that but there were certain notes they hit (higher pitched, maybe a sharp C6 or around that octave, i'm not the best at identifying notes) that just threw me into a complete panic attack - not the type where i'm like ""oh i'm a little nervous, weird"" it was full on ""i feel like i'm in danger, i don't understand why this feels so bad""

for additional context, i don't have any stims that i'm really aware of (nothing has really effected me at all in a way like this before) - i do have anxiety and depression though so i'm not sure if that's effect it or not.

does anyone else have certain octaves or notes that physically effect you like that?",16Aug2020,1
33,"In the past three or so years when I get super stressed out or frustrated I stutter and stumble with my words a lot. Also if I’m super excited or happy about something. I never used to do it, but I deal I guess. It’s super annoying, but when I recognize myself doing that I know how to calm down, stop trying to talk, and try again. It may take a few tries, but it’s mostly just embarrassing, no harm done. My immediate family have gotten used to it cause I explained why it happens sometimes. I’m very lucky to have such a patient family, but extended family I don’t know....

This was a little over a year ago but something happened that I still stress about. Probably nobody remembers but It still bugs me an I wanted to tell someone. 
I was visiting family and one evening had a panic attack. I don’t recall what triggered it, but I know that afterwards I had to pull myself together and go out an eat dinner with everybody. Nobody knows I have issues with stuttering when I’m under a lot of pressure, or anxiety/depression/ptsd in general. So whenever I tried to talk an did that they gave me funny looks. I also feel like I offended my uncle, who has always had a stutter, by just suddenly doing that. I know it’s so stupid, but I was just so worried everyone would think bad about me for some reason? It’s so embarrassing to remember, although I doubt anyone else remembers. Nothing bad was said to me, no consequence or conversation. Ik it’s just my social anxiety, and if I actually have that issue I shouldn’t feel this way, and have nothing to be upset about.... but I do anyway and it’s so annoying. There are so many small moments like this that I just can’t let go of, and it really affects me for some reason. 
Anyway, that’s it. I just wanted to tell someone I suppose, so thanks!",16Aug2020,1
34,"I'm sorry if this post turns out shitty, but I'm pretty shaken up from what has been happening as of lately. I just want some help and had nowhere else to turn to. My parents couldn't help. My school haven't helped. I have not recieved help from medical professionals. I just want some advice.


About me:

*14yr male
*Sleep schedule is nonexistent
*Mental scarring from constant bullying by students, teachers and adults
*Trust issues
*Low self esteem


Issues:

*Paranoia
*Anxiety
*Seeing and hearing things that aren't there
*Nightmares
*An overall decline in cognitive function and mental health
*Surreal experiences


The paranoia is self-explanatory.

The anxiety is also self-explanatory.

I sometimes see things move past me or hear people saying ""hey"" in a whisper. I don't share a room and the voice isn't recognizable.

The nightmares often include suffering in physical and mental ways. I am oftentimes harmed by guns and sometimes suffocation. Sometimes I feel actual pain, although it is relatively mild. 

Thinking is getting hard and my memory is getting worse, but it's always been terrible.

Yesterday, I went out to eat with my parents and noticed that everyone's face looked familiar, even though I have never met or seen them. Imagine taking a stranger's face and replacing it with a family memeber's face. That's the only way I can put it.

36,"So for about two weeks I've been having this massive fear of going to sleep. I have no idea why this is happening all of a sudden and no idea what to do about it.

I've got no reason to feel anxious about anything and throughout the day I feel completely fine. But around 10pm I've just been on the brink of tears scared of sleeping and this doesn't end until about 6am.

I pulled an all nighter last night and its currently almost 4am where I am now with no sign of sleeping soon. I can usually sleep for 1 - 2 hours before waking up and then the fear starts all over again as I try to get back to sleep.

I just wanted to know if anyone else had experienced anything like this and if this is maybe a sign of something else? I've never had anything like this before and it's starting to get kind of worrying.
Thanks for reading.",16Aug2020,1
37,"These past few months have been super fucking stressful for me, and it all came to a head last night.

Almost a year ago, I met the person that I married(I'll call him my partner, mostly because I don't know what to refer him as, I'll explain that in a bit). We had a very rocky start to our relationship, but that slowly became more amiable as the days went by. I was kicked out from my SIL's house and needed a place to stay, and my partner took me in to his home. I lied like crazy in the beginning of my time there, including saying that I loved him very much, so much in fact that it hurt.

We got into a bit of a fight the next month, and I was preparing to leave and move back in with my grandparents(I moved out earlier that year to live in a different state), but they basically told me that they would not help me until I could help myself. I forgot what I told my partner to let me continue to stay with him(he was already ok with whatever I chose to do, God bless him, he has been nothing but kind and loving to me through all this), but I definitely lied about it. At least I think I did. I honestly don't remember either way, so I'm assuming I lied. 

The months went on, I grew to actually love him, but I kept lying about little things and continued to not do much around the house, and basically being a leech while doing the bare minimum to keep him from kicking me out(even though he has repeatedly told me he would never do that, no matter how bad it got). 

Shit really hit the fan the day after we officially married. The managers of his apartment did an inspection, and even though the apartment was passable, they still overreacted and abused us up until last month, when we fled and are basically homeless in a van and have been for a month or so now. I've continued to do the bare minimum, if that, to keep our lives going and at least semi-comfortable. 

Last night, my partner finally reached his breaking point. All the major and fundamental lies I told him came out, and I completely broke his heart to pieces and he no longer trusts anything I have said or done, even the truthful parts. I do not blaim him at all for feeling that way, nor do I wish to paint myself as the victim here. 

We have come to an agreement this morning that as long as I really do care about him and want to change for the better, I am allowed to stay. If not, I have to leave of my own volition. He says that he still loves me, and I really do think I love him, I just don't trust myself at all and I don't know if anything I think and feel is real at all. My schizoeffective has been acting up all day, and has been compounding my already near-nonexistant self-esteem.

I don't know, I feel like I'm sounding very victimy right now and that is not my intention at all. I just feel like a douchebag of the highest degree and there is nothing I can do to fix that. I don't know what I'm asking for, I just don't know. I don't want sympathy, I just want to fix what I broke and have trust in my life. Death is too kind of a way out for me and does nothing but hurt the living.

I just want harm to none and do no harm. I don't know if any of this makes any sense, I tried to keep it as coherent as possible through the loud screaming in my head muddling up my languaging skills.",16Aug2020,1

He has anxiety, depression and OCD. I have been as supportive as I can, but sometimes it is just bigger than me.

He won’t talk to me, even though he was ok two minutes ago because he feels terrible, and I don’t know what to do. Should I give him space? How do I help him without pushing the situation?

I sometimes feel that I should break up with him, but it just would make everything worse. He would go down, and honestly, I would too. My boyfriend is the love of my life, but he is falling into a hole that I can seem to get him out of.

Am I being selfish? Or impatient? 

The thing that hurts the most is that he doesn’t believe that I love him. But man, I have fallen so deep for him...

Maybe he need something I can’t offer, maybe he would be better off without me? I don’t know what to think, my heart is broken.

I want to help so bad, but he doesn’t allow it. I need to let him know that I’m here, but often I just can’t do anything to fix the issue. 

He has a psychology team that is helping him. But it isn’t working.

This is too much for me to take, but again, leaving him doesn’t seem like the right thing to do.

I’m confused, scared and heartbroken. Please, help me.",16Aug2020,1
41,"Hey, I wanted to share how I feel here bc I kinda need  to vent. So since at least last year, I was already feeling worse and worse, for no particular reason really, I was starting to have more and more bad days and breakdowns, at the start of the year I had a really really bad phase bc of many things happening combined. I eventually got better for a brief period of time in febuary, but since then, idk when I really felt happiness for the last time. I was starting to feel more lonely and all I did was distracting me with videogames all day, I just waited till the day ended, cried in bed, went to school, waited for the day to end and so on. It isnt like I lost someone or something horrible happened, its just that I cant be happy. I only have a very few amount of real friends but still no one to really talk to, I feel like no one understands me, even if Im together with people I just feel lonely. Everything just hurts. It got kinda worse the last 2 weeks. Im always sitting at school waiting to come home and let all the tears out.

44,"So I’m 15 (assigned female) and I don’t know why, but all my life I’ve always found it way more embarrassing to get in trouble when I’m wearing less clothes or wearing strange clothes (like costumes or just weird things in general)

I remember when I was about 7 and my cousins (both boys) came over to stay with me, my brother, and my mom and stepdad. I don’t remember the exact reason why, but I’m pretty sure it was because their mom was working night shift at the hospital and their dad probably was too. Anyway, we were all playing together and I thought it was hot so I took my shirt off. I didn’t think too much of it, and my mom didn’t either, since I was 7 and my brother would’ve been 10 or 11 and my cousins would’ve been 6-7 and 9-10. I don’t remember what exactly happened but my stepdad scolded me about something and he was pretty harsh with it, and while I don’t remember exactly what it was for or what I did next, I do remember this weird feeling that I was exposed and looked ridiculous because I was shirtless, even though what he said probably didn’t have to do with my state of dress

Now as I’m older, I wear a lot of shorts and muscle shirts on my weird muscle-less body and any time I’m scolded (probably not the right word) by my mom, it always seems a lot worse than when I’m wearing a sweatshirt or baggy t shirt with sweatpants

* I came home to my childhood house where my brother and his friends abused me and the dog I started fostering 
* My family splintered because of it and I was responsible for bridging the emotional gaps between everyone

And then the past couple of weeks: 

* I went back to New York with my brother and he had a psychotic break that I witnessed. I spent 36 hours trying to keep him from killing himself or me, and had the most terrifying night of my life
* I was forced to give up my beloved dog and go back to my childhood house, with twelve hours to fully move out of my apartment
* I found out I was pregnant, scheduled an abortion, found out I wasn't pregnant anymore and actually had a miscarriage weeks ago that I hadn't noticed
* At dinner with my father, I watched him slip and fall directly on his head. I thought he had died, but he only tore some ligaments in his leg. I stayed in the hospital parking lot until 1 because I wasn't allowed to go in as I waited for them to tell me whether the bleeding in his brain was under control

56,"She's telling me not to share my truth. She's telling me that I'm an outcast and no one will ever understand me, no one will ever love me - but they'll pretend that they do, out of pity or willful deceit. She's convinced that no one really likes me or wants me around, like I somehow ruin experiences just because I exist. She thinks I inconvenience others so I should put their needs before my own. She believes I'm less than others so I need to prove my worthiness. 

I don't know what I ever did that would cause anyone to dislike me, at least without first getting to know me. I'm a good person, I know I am. Why does she only see the worst in me?

She's constantly imagining the worst-case scenario. She's fixated, stuck in her negativity. I try to get her to see the truth (which is so much less painful than her reality) but she just keeps going farther down the hole, creating and replaying visions of discomfort, agony, or fear. Like being in a horrifying car accident and losing the ones she loves. Or getting attacked in the middle of the night, her life ending before she ever really got to live. Or coming to the realization that she is being deceived by the people she loves and thought she could trust...

I've known her for as long as I can remember. She's had a hard life and I understand why she is the way she is... But none of her fears are real and I can't convince her to see that. She's lost, her mind in overdrive. She's hyper-aware of everything, overwhelmed and convinced that everyone can tell she's freaking out. I know that no one can tell (her suffering is invisible to most), and even if they could tell, I know they wouldn't pass judgement because she's an amazing person and she has a lot of people who care about her - I only wish she knew that.

Despite all of the love and support she receives, she still struggles to keep herself afloat. Her chest feels tight and heavy. She can't breathe. She can't move. She's in pain and she can't escape it. In her teenage years, her pain manifested in terrifying panic attacks and social anxiety. Back then she didn't know how to pull herself out of the hole without hurting herself. She hurt herself for a long time before she learned how to cope with the depth of her emotions. 

Years have passed since then. She's grown now and she's come a long way since her teenage years. She has healthier coping mechanisms, but sometimes they're still not enough.

Sometimes deep breathing helps. Sometimes meditation helps. Sometimes she can release her mind and body from her pain and suffering. Sometimes she can't.

Sometimes she becomes lost in her inner turmoil and suffers for weeks at a time. But she doesn't want anyone to see her at her worst, especially because she knows she'll eventually bounce back - she has good moments too. So when things get tough, she has a tendency to hide. Her body and mind in pain, she suffers alone because she doesn't want to inconvenience her friends and loved ones.


I love her and I'm there for her if she needs someone to pick her up when she falls. I am her honest and compassionate voice of reason but sometimes she just can't hear me. Sometimes the wave of emotion is too much and she's swept off her feet. She's far away, out of touch from herself and everyone around her, barely able to keep her head above the water. It breaks my heart to watch her silent suffering but I can only wait for her along the shoreline because if I step into the current with her we'll both be lost at sea...



She is my anxiety.
But I am not her.

I spent the better part of my life trapped inside my head, unable to muster the courage to express how I felt inside. Afraid and unsure of how to let anyone in, I suffered alone.

When I was 22, I ended my first serious relationship, we had been off and on since we were 16. The relationship was a painful learning experience and when we separated for good, I had no idea who I was. I had spent my young adult years with him, always chasing what he wanted to do, trying to keep up with his lifestyle. After separating, I suddenly had nothing...And so began my journey to self discovery.

It took me many years to grow into the woman I am today. Some know my past and have witnessed the major changes I've undergone over the years. To them, I'm a completely different person, I made it out alive and well. Others have just entered my life and are surprised at my continued battle with anxiety and depression. I bet they wonder how someone so happy-go-lucky and friendly could have such a troubled past? 

I believe that my pain, however much it tainted my perspective or tore at my heart, gifted me with a level of depth that only those who have suffered can understand. Like a pendulum swinging from side to side, the greater capacity we have for pain, the greater capacity (and appreciation) we have for pleasure.

My years of suffering forged the empowered woman I am today. If I had never struggled, I wouldn't appreciate the life I now have in the same way. I believe that my pain tore me apart but - remarkably - made room for something else to grow from within, something beautiful. I believe the same is true for you and everyone you know. We are all capable of rising above whatever is keeping us from living our best lives.

It's not an easy journey, it was never meant to be. And unfortunately, the longer your reality is tainted with anxiety, depression, insecurity, or hopelessness, the longer it takes to unwind and rewire your mind to think differently. But hear me out: you can rise above. 

If you believe in the process and you trust yourself, you can and will rise above.

I share this deeply personal truth because I believe that my story can inspire and set fire to changes in the way we perceive mental health. Not everyone is at a place where they can openly talk about their emotions and experiences, but I know that if I connected with others who understood what I was going through, it would have made a world of a difference for me. My heart goes out to all affected by mental illness. Stay strong, you will rise again &lt;3",16Aug2020,1
57,"I work at a grocery store and my OCD greatly affects me to what I do. I’m always exhausted every single day no matter how much I sleep I get. I asked if I could be transferred to a different department due to my OCD which was a huge mistake from me. They said I wouldn’t be able to leave the department because of my disability. If I can’t do 85% of the job, I would have to be terminated. Which only left me which night shift overstocking. I feel like I have neglected my mental health my entire life and never really worked on it. I’m a high school drop out, 23, poor hygiene, no friends to rely on with social anxiety which has actually reduced ever since I got a job so I feel like trying to find a new job would be less stressful since I can take my skills and what I’ve learned on dealing with my social anxiety much better. I just feel alone, I really have no one to talk to. I don’t take meds when I should. Constantly eating and eating although I haven’t really gained weight due to how physical my job is. Wondering whether I should quit my job and focus on myself for a bit. Then get back to finding a job and getting my life back together.",16Aug2020,1

However, I sent her an email thanking her for filling out some paperwork for me last week, and she never responded. Then, the next day I ended up having to go to the hospital so I texted her when I was on the way to let her know that I was going to the hospital, didn't know when I would be out, just in case I wasn't there for my next appointment I was giving her a heads up. I just got out of the hospital and see she never responded. I'm really worried she doesn't care about me anymore. I do have problems with being abandoned in the past. The only thing I can think of is that we were emailing too much (I've been sending a lot of emails lately unfortunately) and she recognizes that now and isn't responding anymore. I'm just really worried. I'd love objective advice on how I'm seeing this. I have a history of being invalidated emotionally for my mental illness over the course of my life and it's done a lot of damage to me, so I'm always scared that my therapist out of nowhere is just gonna think I'm faking my problems.

60,"Since I knew what depression was I thought that something has to be hurting you to feel this way, you can't feel this way without reasoning. Childhood trauma could definitely cause depression and other mental and psychological issues for the rest of your life. I've heard of chemical imbalance but I ignored it because I was stubborn. I thought that maybe the negative thoughts themselves were causing the pain, irritability, and anxiety. It's just the way I cope with the hell going on in my head. It is a chemical imbalance. 

For example, I'm depressed because I'm lonely and I want love from a female and I'm anxious because I'm afraid I'm going to be lonely all my life, I'm afraid I'm going to die alone, I'm afraid I'm not going to have a wife and kids one day. But something is telling me I am going to be successful, I am going to have a big house with wife and kids, I am going to be financially free. I have faith in myself.

My depression started at about 12 - 13, I was sad because I didn't have a girlfriend. I was jealous that other boys had girls all over them. And I'm dealing with the same fucking problems, I'm now a 19 year old virgin. I don't want to care anymore, I need to take care of myself. I have big plans for life. I have a feeling that my hard work and patience is going to pay off so good. But the demons in my head are telling me I'm going to fail in life and commit suicide as a depressed virgin.

62,"This post is prolly gonna be a big mess of words. I just felt like getting this out so bare with me...

I'm just sick of my mom drinking and smoking weed. And I feel bad for wanting her to quit. She just gets so fucking annoying when she's high. She tries to avoid me and not talk to me but it's hard to completely avoid someone you live with. And its ruined our relationship. 

She has it in her head that she can drink a tiny bit and I won't notice but I do and it ruins the rest of the day. She also has it in her head that the weed wears off after like an hour when I only see it go away after at least 3 hours. And then she wonders why I lock myself in my room all day. 

I wish I didn't mind her doing that stuff because she's told me before that it's the only thing that makes her happy and that hurt. Cuz I don't want her to not be happy but I just can't stand her when she isn't herself. It's a horrible feeling when you don't wanna be anywhere near your parent bc you're scared that their breath will smell like beer. 

It makes me sick when I walk into the kitchen at night and have to spray 10 tons of air freshener bc it smells so bad and there's cans all over the counter. It's hard to not drink when someone you live with does and is very open about it. 

I had a therapist. She knew about the drinking but Marijuana isn't completely legal in my state and I didn't know if I should tell her. So here I am complaining to Reddit about it.

It hurts to see her passed out on the couch cuddling up to a fucking bottle of Vodka. 

I just don't know what to do. I don't wanna make her quit because I know how hard it is but it's gotten to the point where I'm spending half of my life at my friend's house cuz I don't wanna go home. 

Any advice about any of this? If not then cool I guess...I just felt like complaining. I'll prolly end up deleting this.

70,"I'm currently leaving the antidepressants I've been taking for the last year and a half. I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety after a suicide attempt on early January 2019, 3 days before my birthday.  The events that led up to the event aren't relevant, but what's relevant is that I downplayed my mental health for way too long. Depression in my young and Latin-American mind was just an illusion and a sign of weakness, thus, I just drank myself to sleep in order to avoid anxiety. I've been taking Escitalopram for the last year and a half, and left Alprazolam more or less 6 months ago. 

Panama has had one of the strictest and longest quarantines to date and my two hours to go out are from 7am to 9am, severely limiting any social interactions. I've been isolated and actually quite mentally calm for the last months, since I'm studying at college online and I love my mayor dearly. Last week I knew a bunch of my faculty freshmen, making several acquaintances very fast since I'm very extroverted and social. Beyond a transient quarantine relationship I decided to end since I felt nothing, I've had no interaction with my friends here whatsoever. Tonight I finished several projects and then sat with my laptop in my bed, where I'm writing now.

After almost a month of decreasing my doses of the antidepressants, I've been 2 weeks or so drug-free. Now, I feel as if beyond my Major, all meaning in life has ceded. I can't find any value in building a relationship beyond the couple of friends I talk with several times everyday. I used to write poetry to understand what I felt, or at least grasp a notion of it. I don't know if this is a side effect of the long-term antidepressant drug usage, where my feeling where almost completely suppressed. I'm genuinely concerned if I'll ever recover the sentient and sensible being I once was.",16Aug2020,1

75,"I have been struggling very, *very* hard since about 2013. I have had a lot of major life traumas in that short time. I suffer from chronic depression, hypothyroidism, and chronic pain amongst other things, but those specific illnesses can make housekeeping a challenge.


I had fallen into, and am still in, a very deep depression. My house has been like eviction level trashed before. I'm  not happy or proud of how gross it's gotten in the past. Things had gotten a lot better, but there are a lot of old habits to unlearn. Because of these struggles, in addition to having a dog with kidney failure and incontinence at the time, my house was in rough shape.


Several months ago, I invited a friend over on a handful of occasions. Having people over is not something that I often do, due to my anxiety, and at the time the cleanliness of the house. During some of these visits, this person would drink, eat, and sleep here. Never complained about the mess. I thought it was nice having them around to hang out with cause we were both going through some things,  and having someone around really helped distract me from the misery. 


We became somewhat distant again recently  as a result of life. Not too long ago, I was told by another trusted friend, that this person pretty harshly talked about my living space and how disgusted they were by it. This info really hurt to hear. They have visited every living space that I've ever had and they knew that this was different and extreme. Instead of helping or asking if things were ok, this person would trash the place even worse when they visited. My other friend claims Friend A told them they offered us help, but only if they were paid. They didn't even clean up their own messes they made when they were here let alone offer us help. And to ask for money for an offer we didn't even request? Idk. I have a feeling that I won't feel comfortable or safe inviting this person over ever again.",16Aug2020,1

Having a mom that's so willing to accept me is a privilege. I know I'm probably just kind of insecure becoming really vulnerable for once instead of being the ice queen type I’ve always been. But I’m at point where I need hugs &amp; love &amp; I don’t know how to ask for it or take it in if I even get it. I think after the stroke &amp; the whole pandemic thing I just have no idea how to approach things being so raw &amp;  fully experiencing it now instead of feeling jaded or disassociating myself entirely or exploding with so much energy that I'm exposing people to really interpersonal or weird sides of me they aren’t comfortable with where it makes me insecure &amp; pull back or that drains me completely if received well.

I dont know how to not be extremely distant &amp; offensively walled off or too interpersonal &amp; projecting. I have to learn to live with myself, functionally. Not just drifting by being misunderstood &amp; likeable. I want people to be so involved that they’ll be able to talk to my therapist that they’ll talk to them theirselves &amp; give honest opinions of my behavior, and me trust them enough to allow that.

I need to tell people I need help or reminders or reassurance &amp; im ready to receive that. I just need reminders I'm still wanted for that bc I don't want to be a burden. But I’m reaching go out for help?”

I’m just going to vent because I don’t know where to start. Back a while ago I was dating a girl who I was absolutely in love with. She was my everything and my best friend. During this time I was in this small group of friends, about 8 people or so and my girlfriend and some of her closer friends in that group had a falling out with someone else so that person was removed. As a result, 2 people who didn’t have a say in what happened argued that they didn’t actually have say in anything and I had to stay neutral on that issue since I they were very close friends but in the end I got pulled to my gfs side by presumption. After that the group was essentially just my gfs closer friends and one other person. I would have tried to stay close with them but one of them who is my best friend dated her back earlier in that year and still had a thing for her and was upset that I was dating her despite the fact that he didn’t tell me anything about it. Going into Juneish I started having really bad anxiety and I started getting into some bad habits which I am not going to specify. She ended up breaking up with me during this time which didn’t help very much for what I was going through and I started getting super aggressive in the group chat we had and I had a bad mental breakdown that everyone found out about. 

To get to modern date after that until about a week ago I was doing a summer program that kind of kept me distracted but I still thought about it. Now I only have free time and I can’t stop thinking about it. I’ve been extremely irritable and I can’t stop thinking that I’ve lost every friend I’ve had. I talk to some people on a regular basis but I don’t actually have conversations with people individually. In that old chat I had they added someone new and then made a completely new group chat with them and everyone except me. I feel like I’m lost now and I no longer have a purpose and I’m scared that my habits are going to relapse because I don’t want to be sucked down any of those holes again.

86,"Mobile, sorry for format.

This is a long one, I apologize in advance. Last spring, I dealt with a huge bout of depression and anxiety, the brunt of which was dealt with largely by my friends and roommates as they scrambled to save me from myself. Concurrently, a close friend who helped me during that period of my life was also dealing with severe anxiety and depression. We supported one another, and I eventually improved after taking meds and opening up more about my past trauma (some of which I shared with her only recently). She has also started taking meds but has not improved as much at all. It’s gotten to the point where I am on FaceTime or in bed with her until the early hours of the morning grasping at straws to support someone who I am so ill equipped to support. Though I’m aware of this, I’m afraid of what she will do if I stop constantly spending our time together helping her work through something that is occasionally quite triggering for me (on that note, she asked that we not even discuss my trauma because it is triggering for her). 

I know that I should set boundaries but she can be volatile and lash out when she’s vulnerable and I don’t think she would understand if I told her I needed space or limited involvement. On paper, she might say she would, but in practice it would breed resentment. Just tonight, I asked her to think about what I do to try to help when she’s struggling and let me know what actually works, because we often just sit together for hours as she inconsolably wallows in her dark thoughts. I was met with “that isn’t exactly my top priority right now” and essentially waved off. She is very much the type to tell me to leave her alone for “my own sake” but feel hurt when I actually do and that, coupled with the fact that she gave in to my unhealthy neediness when I was at a low point, makes me feel obliged to constantly listen to her either joke/make light of her suicidal ideation or sob for hours about thoughts that I can’t help to remedy. This post almost doubles as an AITA because I feel so horrible about wanting space given that she was there for me a few months ago and still supports me as I continue to recover. She was one of many people who I relied on, but I think I’m one of the only people she opens up to like this and I’m bearing the brunt of it. We are now roommates and, though we are living with others, I worry things will only escalate from here. I apologize for the length but I’m at a moral and psychological impasse, as I’m desperate for boundaries from someone who sees me as a soulmate  but simultaneously constantly fears abandonment on my part and would interpret aloofness as rejection. Please help. Just now, she texted saying that I “made her most recent mental breakdown about her by talking about how hard it was for me to help when she doesn’t know how I can go about doing that and that it made things worse for her.” I love her but this isn’t sustainable and I’m scared.",16Aug2020,1

93,"Hey all. It seems like a straight forward question but I just want to ask. Am I lazy or depressed? 

I’ve lost motivation for almost everything. It’s hard for me to actually feel like I should do something. It feels like I’m stuck in a mental box that’s hard to get out of. I’m very anxious right now because of online school starting. I want to become a mechanical engineer, but I don’t find the motivation to learn or even look up stuff about it. 

I’d like to be productive. I don’t play video games anymore unless a friend calls and tells me to get on.

94,"Dear Reddit, 

I live in a fairly conservative family where drug use is substantially frowned upon. My mom is a medical doctor and discovered that I had used an illicit drug, LSD. The result of this was a substantial reevaluation of my past choices, but moreover relatedly impacted the way I approached thinking through ""life"", in an obscure way, and the way it impacted my future choices. As a result, I broke down on three occasions and was hospitalized for mental health reasons for all of them. In each of these instances, however, the actual reasons for being hospitalized seemed two-sided. On the one hand, I was behaving abnormally (limiting food consumption and sleep by significant amounts, etc.) on the other, my parent's concern seemed to amplify bias significantly with respect to the actual events which lead to my hospitalization. In other words, yes I may have been acting out of sorts, but whether I should have been hospitalized seemed unfairly one-sided. The actual trauma of being forcibly placed in a hospital under (this may be a biased description) the false pretense of self admittance, and the bureaucratic placeholders to keep me in hospital, left a considerable impression. I was informed that I had ""manic depression"" and that I had been acting in a manic. This is the extent of what I know of my ""condition."" I could speak at length at the many injustices I faced (such as being coerced to sign documents) or the horrors that I saw others face (being physically removed. . .) yet what has me most concerned is the actual soundness of what I was being ""treated"" for. 

My question is twofold.  Firstly, how can one determine if such a diagnosis holds water?  and Secondly, in the case that the diagnoses are unsound, then how one prove or qualify the alternative? 

It reminds me of a section from  Catch 22:

""Oh, they're there, all right,"" Orr had assured him about the flies in Appleby's eyes after Yossarian's fist fight with Appleby in the officers' club, ""although he probably doesn’t even know it. That's why he can’t see things as they really are.""

""How come he doesn't know it?’ inquired Yossarian.

""Because he’s got flies in his eyes,"" Orr explained with exaggerated patience. ""How can he see he's got flies in his eyes if he's got flies in his eyes?""

Furthermore, recently I have been staying up very late playing dungeons and dragons - a 3 to 5-hour board game- and have got myself stuck in a very poor sleep cycle. One morning my Mom walked into my room and called me manic for not falling asleep. I got fairly heated because that ascription not only brings back bad memories but also, if not taken seriously, as I have discovered, may lead to seemingly arbitrary and very subjective claims for hospitalization.  

I am worried, deeply, that my lack of an effort to fall asleep; This very, unapologetically long, call for help into the deep web that is Reddit, is a symptom of ""mania"" that I feel I have been falsely diagnosed with. Upon a quick search of this ""mania"" Bipolar disorder was one of the first that came up. 

I do not intend to discredit mental disorders in general. I believe that mental health conditions and disorders are a very real thing. I have seen them up close and personal, however, I still do not agree with the treatment of those deemed hospitalized. I am skeptical, and even though I do not feel that I am bipolar, ""I don't think I am"" does not externally qualify me to claim that this is the case. However, at the same time, ""I know because I am a professional,"" does not seem to qualify this either, especially when the impression I receive is that some judgments (not all of them) feel happenstance or for the sake of a consensus - a form of ""hot cognition"" naturally part of this line of work. 

If there is no way for me to internally determine if I am Bipolar and if external judgments feel happenstance or for the sake of consensus, then on what condition or criteria should I accept or reject such claims made.

So last week me and my mom got into a huge fight. I was so angry that I could barely think. My mom cried and my sisters went to comfort her while I was there losing my mind alone in my room. My other sister went in our room after and Idk what happened but when I was explaining to her my side while crying, I suddenly have difficult time breathing. My chest hurts so bad like I'm having hiccups (?) and I can't stop crying. I can't speak properly because I was catching my breath. I was so scared. I searched it on the internet and it suggested that I'm having a panic or anxiety attack? I honestly don't know if this is true since it's my first time experiencing it and it was so scary.

I will always HATE how my emotions have always taken a back seat ever since I was a child. I’d feel pain. Emotional trauma. Real sorrow and my parents would tell me to stop being so weak and being a cry baby and to not let things get to me etc. They still haven’t changed their ways. As an adult now and especially during sheltering In Place, I’ve gone through an ugly breakup(called off engagement) dealt with alcoholism and depression. Yet for the Latino household....It’s all. BS. It’s not real to them. It’s not a valid reason to be emotional. It’s just weakness to them. It’s just being dramatic and over the top. Maybe not all Mexican families. But mine takes the cake on not giving a FUCK about mental health. It’s almost as if they poke fun at the wounds to try to defuse how painful it is. But they don’t understand that they’re wounds that were never ever really healed in the first place. I’m damn sure never going to let my children feel like their emotions and feelings don’t matter.

I don't abuse it but i do use it frequently for major anxiety and super stressful situations.  I have lots of people reaching out to me telling me that they care about my wellbeing but at this point I already kinda know.  the problem is I've lost my own drive to live anymore I feel like I'm in limbo just living without a purpose.  I'm not a religious person so that isn't really something that i can cling to in hard times but I'm starting to feel that these psychiatrists and therapists don't fully understand that YES I can be a functional individual but my pain is more emotional and in my head not something that can necessarily be resolved with forgiveness or reconciliation. the only thing that I have found that helps me is these stupid pills which I would rather be off of but they help me get through my days.

103,"There are consequences for every action and I normally can reasonably guess what they will be. But sometimes, when I do something bad or stupid, I tend to overblow the consequences I might face. I get in my head so much that the imagined consequences are highly improbable. 

For example, I asked my supervisor at the uni for a deadline extension on my thesis (because I'm a lazy fuck and don't put in any work). In the e-mail, among other things, I asked my supervisor, if he was thinking of terminating our association because of it. He granted me a 10-day extension, but didn't even respond to that question and told me to please keep things professional and not ask frivolous questions. I hadn't realised at the moment how comical and drenched in self-pity that question must have sounded, but once I read it again I felt really embarrassed.

To give you another example, when I was starting my internship, there was some trouble with my paperwork. I asked my then supervisor if they were going to let me go, because my paperwork wasn't in order. She thought it was a really weird thing to ask. Of course they wouldn't! My paperwork was sorted out the next day. 

People get really angry at me for this. A friend has told me they get upset, because they think I'm doing a bit to get sympathy, or that I'm doing it to wallow in self-pity. Maybe they are right, I can't really tell though, and I want to stop doing that.",16Aug2020,1

105,"So I need to tell someone about this, but I don't know who (this isnt really a topic for my irl friends and it's not something i want to tell my mutuals bcs i dont want them to think differently of me, and my parents would just tell me to grow up already or pray)

since childhood, i'd have moments where i'd feel like everything was fake. I would be lying in bed, and suddenly my mind would go blank. I would feel the breath in me but it didnt feel like it was me (?). I'd wait and I'd wait, just to start feeling again, because the nothing i felt didnt feel real. i'd have to keep reminding myself that *this* is existing. i am *alive*. then i'd feel fear. nothing else. just fear. i'd feel like i'd stopped existing.

eventually, i taught myself how to keep my mind active, because as soon as silence settled, as soon as everything was quite, i'd stop existing. i knew i was alive, i knew i was right there, but it didnt feel like it.

recently though, i dont know if it has anything to do with what's been happening, it's been coming back. i'd be doing my work, and suddenly it feels like everything is gone. it's right there in front of me, but it's not. the worst thing is now i dont even see the point of anything. because once i die, all there is going to be is that nothing. the void of black. no matter what i do, no matter whose lives i change, no matter what job i get, nothing fucking matters. hell, i could find the cure for cancer. give it a couple hundred years i'll be nothing more than a name that once had meaning. nothing matters. nada. wallashi. its all pointless. the only constant is the void. the nothing. nothing is all life has to offer. and thats so fucking scary. 

i used to be so happy. i was always laughing, smiling, joking. i was the class clown, people came to me to have fun. i was fun. i was happy.

i cant talk to anyone, because i know people have it worse. i know all i need is to be grateful. and i am. i'm grateful that i get to live. that i get to breath. that i get to open my eyes every morning and see the sun. i dont really know how to put this, but i feel like i dont deserve help? writing it down it sounds stupid, but it's more just... idk i guess im guilt-tripping myself? like... people are starving, dying, being tortured, being killed, living in poverty, and i'm here, living with my family, in a first-world country (or second world... idk what australia is), i'm getting a good education and i have three meals a day. and i'm the one who dares think i need help? who the fuck do i think i am?

idk

just.... if someone maybe knew what this was, if i could label those thoughts, the feeling of nothing, maybe they'd go away? i really don't know what's wrong with me, or if there's even anything wrong with me....",16Aug2020,1

107,"As the title states, this pandemic has literally opened Pandora’s box of emotions I can’t seem to handle. For one with context, I’ve always delt with family issues with a really abusive household and I never got out much, so it never really bothered me until now. Being home all the time with that, with no way to escape it, has been getting to me now after years of just ignoring it or shoving it down in my brains priorities.

I always focused on my external life, my close friends I made etc. So I never paid mind to it as I saw them as an escape, recently (early March) I finally asked out this girl who I was great friends with who liked me too, I took way too long to ask her out despite the signs but we only dated for a week and it was amazing before the closures happened. Since then she ghosted me and broke up with me in one message after a month and a half then ghosted me after, and till this day I’m still not over it.

My mind is all over the place, and I’m just sick of existing. I’m in a constant state of emptiness and I can’t seem to find anything that can make me happy even temporarily, I never suffered with mental illness or anything so I don’t know what to do I don’t even know if that’s what this is, but I’ve never experienced it before. I’m afraid of who I will be when it’s over, because it’s like all the social ness inside of me died in the last couple of months, I want to socialize but I can’t muster up the strength to do so, my brain just can’t push aside the shitty feeling of wanting to stay in bed and feel like shit with constant negative thoughts all day long. It’s even been hard to try to take care of myself, I stopped eating etc and it’s not even purposeful. It’s just so hard with everything that I just don’t care even though I really want to if that makes sense especially on the good hours I have where I start feeling better only for the usual crappy feelings to creep in and take over.

My best friend (since kindergarten, we're in our 30s) lives in another state but we've always kept in close contact, we text each other on a daily basis.

But now this is going out of hand. She doesn't have any real friends where she lives, she lost her job recently, so I see where this is coming from but she's really obsessive. To keep it short without giving too much details, every other day I wake up (we live in different time zones) to a wall of text and several links to mental health articles, she self diagnoses different mental illnesses/disorders and pathological unhealthy relationships dynamics (she's struggling with her marriage too).

I've already told her over and over that she needs to get help, but money is tight and her husband is currently in therapy for some situation he's struggling with, she gets some group therapy in a support system (related to her husband situation) but I don't think this is helping, I rather think that it is making it worse because she is exposed to a number of toxic thoughts without being able to focus on her own situation and it adds up.

I don't really know what to do. First, I'm really worried for her and I feel so helpless, but also I'm going through a lot of pressure at work and this is draining me out. I can't wake up every morning to 46 new messages from her, most of which self diagnosed disorders, with links to articles which say ""if you do this, you might be (insert disorder)"". I am close to the point where I roll my eyes every time my phone buzzes and I hate it because I know I'm being unfair, but I feel so overwhelmed.

I don't want to let her down, but at the moment I really have no time to deal with it on a daily basis (obviously, I can't just type a short answer and call it a day, but if I'm at work I can't sit down and have a real conversation with her... I would if it was once in a while, but this happens every day). I openly say it to her (sorry, I'm going through a shitty day, I'll get back to you later) and I also get to vent and talk to her about my own personal life, so I'm not saying she's self absorbed, she's still my best friend. But she's been spiraling for 6 months now and I don't know how to handle it anymore. 

What should I do? At this point it's clear that I can't help her other than being there and listen to her, but it's affecting me too and I don't know what to do, for both of us.",16Aug2020,1

113,"I have been home from college since March living with my parents and grandparents. I haven’t gone anywhere due to the stress of anything happening to my family during this pandemic. The issue arises in the fact that my cousins live 2 houses down and treat us as if we are paranoid.

I was shocked by this because these are their grandparents to and having to explain to my cousin, lets call him AP, who is the same age, that it is not worth the risk to hang out since he goes to work and out for lunch. He accepted this but still commented that people were being overly paranoid.

Before the main part, I want to provide a little background. AP and I have been super close for our whole lives but after I went off to college 7 years ago, now in Grad school, we went down different paths since he stayed in the same town. He went to community college and eventually dropped out, getting into drugs and partying. Whenever I came I could sense him changing until eventually he started considering his “friends” his true family because they fed into his ego trips and gave him a fun time by partying with him. Whereas his parents, siblings and my family confronted him whenever we felt he was being to stubborn or angry by trying to reason with him but he always thought of us as being against him for irrational reasons. This eventually got worse and worse. For example, one time I was watching a show with his brother at their house and we did this as a weekly thing and he was always out and about doing things with his “friends.” But this night he happened to be home. So as we are sitting there about to start the show, he walks in and tells us to stop. He says its his turn and to give him the remote. To provide context, him and I were 22 and his brother was 4 years older then us, so this felt pretty insulting. We told him no, and he turns off the tv and sits down in front of us and repeats himself. Now his brother gets angry and tells him that we watch at this time every week and why is he being so selfish. This sets him off and he starts yelling. This eventually escalated to wear i had to hold his dad and his brother off of him. The cops were called and he left the house for the night. There were many nights like this where little things would set him off so I started to learn that I can’t be honest with him like I used to be and instead I became to the point and not argumentative as not to set him off for his mom’s sake. But he became worse and worse and started calling his friends, his true brothers. Until, one night I got a call saying he was in an accident.

 He suffered a lot during that period due to a major injury and when I first saw him after that he was very weak and burst into tears remembering all the good times we had together as little kids. From whispering to each other during movies, to playing video games and playing pranks on others. From making home movies to playing basketball. The first thing he said to me when he saw me in his hospital bed was “sorry” and how he had let his family down. I believed the shit out of him and went back to my old ways of saying trying to make him feel good by saying that once he gets better will do this and that. And he enthusiastically agreed. But after he got better, he had to serve a few months for his dui. I visited him in this period worried that he may have changed but when I talked to him that same excitement was there and he listed a bunch of things that he wanted to do together after he was out. Leaving that day gave me hope that maybe the person I considered to be like a brother to me had finally turned the corner.

I waited for the day he came back home enthusiastically and got a call from his mom saying to come over. So I went over with a smile on my face and when I went to say hi to him he quickly said hi and walked right passed me, asking his mom where his socks were. I was dumbfounded but thought maybe I was overthinking it. So I follow him asking what he wants to do now that he’s out and he said he was going out. I asked where, and he said to hang with his friends. My heart dropped, not once did he consider me or even text me that we should hang out later. Unless I had gone over there he wouldn’t have regarded me at all. This gnawed at me because I thought about him so much and I didn’t feel that reciprocated and it just added to my inner turmoil where I asked whether I’m being selfish, but this has stayed with me 3 years later so obviously this moment cut deep. He chose the friends who became intoxicated with him, asked him to drive them, who left him on the road with a broken back because they were afraid of the cops over me. His mom was saddened, his dad was angry, his brother was silent and I felt worthless. I went back home feeling like shit. 

This was my gap year so I was going to be home so I thought we could rebuild our relationship but at the same time I didn’t want to initiate that after he left me that day. A couple days later he texts saying to come over so I ecstatically went to his house. Even writing this, I feel like such a pushover who just arrives when called. So, I go over to his house and see him in an ankle monitor. He was now forced to stay home for 6 months as a part of his sentence. So I reasoned that this was the reason he went out right away that day because he knew he couldn’t later. So, I felt better. We hung out all day and played video games. Over the next few months I would be doing my own thing and would get a text saying “come over.” Not asking me but telling me. Of course, after a while I felt annoyed because he never asked but basically told me to come over. I would then respond back saying I would come later and then he wouldn’t reply so I would second guess myself and say coming for his mom’s sake not to anger the all mighty AP. 6 months passed, my gap year went and he went back to his old ways and moved in and out of the house whenever he felt like it. I finally told myself to not waste anymore time. I felt it was too one-sided and that I was watering grass that did not wish to grow.

Fast forward to now:

When the pandemic hit, he was back home, going to work and had a girlfriend. When I talked to him before coming home from college to quarantine, he seemed in a much better place and even cut off some friends. The first day I came home, I was on high alert and did not want anyone coming over since it was March and there was a lot of uncertainty. But he came over that day to say hi and sat down in the living room. I was being a little stand offish wondering whether he was not taking the pandemic seriously, especially with our grandma right there. And then he started coughing so I told him to leave. And he left right away concerned too. This swelled me with pride that he was concerned. He was sick for over a week with the flu and tested negative for Covid. We talked everyday on the Ps4 since we we’re both home and started playing videogames everyday. We were both super nice to eachother like adults but that felt off to me because even that light ribbing we gave eachother like a couple pals wasn’t there. I felt afraid to anger him and he must have felt something similar. There was a wall there. We talked almost everyday for the last 6 months while playing online and that facade is there. I may be the only one who feels this way out of us too but to me it felt like our relationship can’t restrengthen fully if we are tip toeing and being agreeable all the time but we still started opening up again and sharing stuff with each other. So, maybe I was wrong about the wall.

 So fast forward to the past week on Thursday, when his sister came home to her parents from where she was living and was coming to our house as part of a tradition in my culture. This was fine with me since she had been quarantining alone but AP got word and decided to come to. I told him while we were online that I was not comfortable with him coming because he went to work and still hung out sometimes with his girlfriend or a couple friends. This was his response: “I don’t care. I’m coming. You guys are so paranoid.” 

I was shocked, my heart rate strengthened and I didn’t know what to say. I felt angry that after spending so much time opening up and then being told that he doesn’t care. I stayed silent the rest of the game and he knew I was mad. So before he came, I called him and said I didn’t like that he straight up said that he doesn’t care what I have to say and he said sorry that he should’ve been more careful with his words. I accepted and was happy I didn’t hold that in and was being fully honest with him. The wall was broken. I told him to wear a mask and he said of course and he said that he would stand 6 feet from our grandma. I felt good that I was able to be honest and said what was on my mind. When he came he did give our grandma a fist bump but I brushed it off. But this could’ve ended dreadfully I later found out.

3 days later on Sunday, I found out that someone at his office had tested positive from Covid that previous monday. So first thing I do is text AP in confusion and frustration , and ask him if its true. He says ya and that he tested negative so I dial it down and say good. That night I jump on to play online with him and this thought continues to gnaw at me so I ask him when did he get tested. He says on friday. I freeze, realizing this is a day after he came to our house. My anxiety goes up, I ask him when he found out about the person who tested positive. He says monday. So no I’m angry realizing that he came over to our house knowing this and before getting tested. I ask him calmly but anxiety in my voice, why he would take that risk when I specifically said not to come. He says he knew he was fine. I say how when he hadn’t been tested yet, knowing his answer was ridiculous. He stumbles and answers annoyed, that he’s fine so it doesn’t even matter. I’m flabbergasted. I tell him, “That’s fucked up man.” And he doesn’t say much after as we finish our game. I’m in shock but don’t talk about it anymore. And he starts talking more and more about his frustration with the game and I just make small talk. That was a week ago and we haven’t talked since, when before we talked almost everyday. So I felt bad, like a little bitch, and decided to text him today to ask him if he wanted to play seeing that he was online. He didn’t respond to my text or chat invite and logged off soon after. He has ghosted me before when I criticized him so I know that this isn’t me being paranoid but this is my last straw.

Writing this whole thing out and reliving the last couple years I feel like such a pushover, going out of my way. And this extends passed AP. I have become overly nice to everyone and analyze everything I say or text with extreme scrutiny so I don’t piss anyone on off and push people away. But it is extremely tiring and it makes me feel like I have a wall up that doesn’t allow me to make genuine relationships where I can say what I want with out feeling like i’ll be abandoned.

I never used to be like and was more of a guy who said whatever he wanted and had strong friendships. But now I overthink everything and feel like it isn’t worth going out of my way if after everything I’m being honest with someone over something that is right on my part and they ghost me. I don’t want to give fucks anymore but my mind won’t let me. I’m just sad.",16Aug2020,1
114,"That's all it is. I want to make myself sick. I'm at my wits end really.
I've gone through a really tough break up with a girl after she cheated on me, second relationship this has happened in in a row, but after I blocked her for say a week, I unblocked her again, I broke down crying and told her I still loved her. And I do, that's not a lie. I do really love her. She's honestly the most beautiful woman and she's kind at heart and I got along with her super well, but, I guess that wasn't enough for her. 
But I told her we could try work things out, and in the midst of this pandemic, we met up. It was a good day, and, I thought we had fixed it, but she told me before she left ""I just don't see a future between us anymore"".
When she got home, she texted me ""I don't find you attractive anymore"".
She explained why after I asked her to, and I'll admit, I did put on a few pounds over lockdown, but it's nothing crazy. I still look the same just maybe a lil extra on the hips I guess. I mean I guess it's okay she's not attracted to me, but, she said we weren't getting back together until I worked on myself. I already had body issues before this, which she knows of, I took some drugs that got me really high but on the comedown would make me sick during our relationship, I told her that was the reason and she didn't really take notice tbh.
But, even though she does these things that are res flags, I still love her, and I want her more than anything else, but I feel like even if I try now, it's too late.
She met up with the guy yesterday again... When we met, she told me she could omly meet at 2 till 6 because that's when she'd be able to get rides home. Yesterday, I didn't hear off her till 9, so I already know she spent more time with him than she really wanted to with me, but I brushed it off, they're just friends, right? well today there was no good morning message, though she was online. so I sent the first one. and after something like 20 minutes, she messages back, and tells me she's at his house.
And I just don't know anymore. It's really killing me inside. As cliche as this sounds, I know I love her far more than most people love. She's my genuine everything and I wanted this life with her.
But it never seems she cares about me when I tell her how I feel about all these things. She tries saying I'm just jealous and controlling, even though she admitted to cheating, though she didn't see it as cheating.
I just want to hurt myself. I cry every single night now. I can't bother to eat most of the day anymore, and I keep forcing myself to throw up if I do because I immediately feel like shit. I keep considering suicide just to end it so I don't have to be around to feel this anymore.
I hate her but I fucking love her. I just wish she was still mine. i wish I was still attractive to her. I just wish I wasn't around.",16Aug2020,1
115,"I am very sorry if the following post might be triggering to anyone. 

I saw a post online saying that “having issues does not justify bad behavior, if you have trauma it is your responsibility to heal.” Trauma does not exactly equal mental illness, so I’m kind of torn with how to respond. But as a person with trauma, I feel kind of annoyed towards the second half of the statement?

I agree that having mental issues shouldn’t be an excuse towards being a shitty person. Many actions are because of the mental illness though, so it’s a really tough discussion... As with the next part, I feel it’s kind of annoying to say that healing is a **responsibility** as it is not a person’s fault when an external factor causes their trauma. By making them accountable for their trauma and giving them added responsibility is... unfair? I mean healing is pretty much directly facing your own trauma and it’s no easy feat.

Open to a discussion, please be kind ❤️",16Aug2020,1
116,"Just found out that being premature increases risk for schizophrenia. I was born after about 30-32 weeks, and I have used lsd about 4 times, shrooms 1 times, and smoked weed pretty heavily for a little under a year I’ve been clean for about a month now. I have noticed some behaviors that relate to the negative symptoms like, depression, mild anxiety, no motivation, wanting to stay locked in my room, hardly have any friends and I never feel like going out to hangout with them, and I have had trouble with school and concentrating since my freshman year of high school. I moved to an independent study school where I pretty much just do my work at home and hardly ever go into class. The most anti social type of schooling I could find and even then it’s been extremely hard trying to get through.

I am sitting there and screaming at myself in my head and tearing up because I know I’m just making it harder for myself by not doing it but I still can’t do it.

118,"I'm not talking about this forum. It's perfectly fine to reply to those who publicy expressed distress who wants and needs help. It's absolutely fine to give personal attention to specific burdens.

I'm talking about those random comments on Youtube or other platforms saying ""You're beautiful, you're worthy, you're talented, don't give up on yourself!"" like bitch no you don't even know me? I mean like that generic crap that can apply to just about everyone. 

It was cute the first ten thousand encounters but then I realized how cheap it is. I get that it's a genuine gesture (and maybe not maybe it's just upvote farm) but it feels so random and impersonal and shallow. You don't even know how I look like, you don't even know how I define my worth, you don't even know my aspirations, and you don't even know what I'm good or bad at. How am I supposed to be in any way comforted by someone so completely ignorant of who I am?

You just KNOW they don't mean it. It just feels like a cheap trick to make you feel better on the surface so you don't make any more ruckus with your unhappiness. I mean it's starting to feel akin to giving starving children a small piece of candy for a meal. 

Lately I've felt the same about songs of the same caliber. At least there's work put in to songs to make them sound good.

So anyways recently I have met a girl who absolutely blows my mind. She’s such an amazing, kind, and caring individual not to mention she’s absolutely gorgeous and funny (and the sex is 15/10) and means the world to me. Only problem is we’re not dating we’re just a “thing” and it’s basically polyamory. She has a group of female friends who all have sex with each other occasionally but I’m the only guy she’s sleeping with. I am genuinely fine with it but it feels like my conscious and subconscious are on 2 different playing fields about the matter and it’s causing my head to basically self destruct. 

My problem in the past was always having extremely negative racing thoughts so bad that I would just curl up into a ball and cry. 

Why does it seem like I can’t be happy in life without these horrible racing thoughts? When I wasn’t talking to anyone and just going about life I felt like I found a balance, I was neither happy nor sad but it felt nice.

128,"Backstory: I have a really difficult relationship with my mom since the earliest moments of my childhood. This leads to any insecurities on me and myself including self-worth and having really strong problems with overthinking etc. I'm already approaching therapy but this is not what this is about.

The problem I need advice on, is about me and an old friend of mine, I know for a long time now. We are well known in other friend groups, for having a lot of arguments and discussions. Sometimes because I don't agree with his points or mostly because he is somewhat toxic about delivering or taking criticism of in certain topics. 

For example, we talked about trump. His opinion was that he's not that terrible like the media is presenting in media while my opinion is that Trump is not a good president, alone on the fact that he reacted way to late on the COVID-19 Virus. He was not happy with that. He didn't take any of my arguments seriously and became somewhat toxic by nitpicking my words. Even when I tried to show him videos or articles, nothing was enough for him that counts as a good argument for him to talk about.

This situation dug up an old hole on me. It felt like I was talking with my mother again, making me feel like I have nothing to say. This is so frustrating because I really know that I have my own opinion, that I'm 100% represent it but I can't stop think about being a ""low-class"" in this situation.

132,"Hi, as the title says, I'm an only child who had a pretty good childhood from a material and educational point of view, but my parents were very detached because they're both emotionally repressed due to their own childhood trauma + their relationship is also awful. So it's a dysfunctional family pretty much, even though on surface level it seemed alright. For eg. we never went on holidays together, they never hugged me, and they never said they loved me (my mother started saying she loves me after I left my home country, so in my twenties - a bit late lol, but at least she's trying). 

My father was completely emotionally and verbally absent (he would barely speak to me and my mother), and my mother was very authoritarian and was ordering me around, she also had a short temper so I always had to walk on eggshells with her. I had to grow up by myself basically and be my own emotional support. I've become very independent and self-sufficient due to that situation, but there are other negative effects that I haven't fully understood yet, so please let me know if you have any insight. I would like to go to therapy some day but I'd like to understand this more (I've realised all of the above very recently - still new to this).

What I've noticed so far:

1. I don't really miss friends? I value their friendship but I don't have that aching feeling if I don't see them for long. When they say ""miss you xx"" I say it back, but I'm not really feeling it and it's making me feel awful. I really like them and they're great people, but it's as though I have all these millions of barriers.
2. I question authority sometimes.
3. I am *terrified* of being myself and vulnerable, both in friendships and romantic relationships (especially).
4. I *need* affection and being taken care of emotionally by my romantic partner (and I also want to return the favor). This is not quite healthy because I end up depending on him emotionally too much - it's as though I have this very idealistic idea of romance where my partner is my savior and I'm expecting him to nurture me the way my parents have failed to do.
5. The above point also makes me extremely perfectionistic in love and I get disappointed *so quickly* (""oh he's not the savior that I thought he was""/""oh he's not that ideal partner that I had in mind"") - even though he is wonderful. It's as if my mind enhances the negative qualities that I see in romantic partners, even though they're not a big deal.
6. Not necessarily a negative one but I've made it my life mission (well, one of my many life missions :P) to have my own loving family. To have kids that I can nurture and raise the way my parents have not managed to. With love, care, affection, communication, understanding. This is definitely not bad, I just don't want to become obsessed with it, you know, or have my entire identity revolve around my future husband and kids.

141,"If there is anyone on Reddit who may have any clue after reading this of what my brother may potentially have, I’d love to know. I’m not looking for an official diagnosis, but my brother won’t go to the doctor for help which is why if maybe we have a sense of what’s going on we can help him better.

My brother started doing drugs (mostly if not only hallucinogens) in early high school, maybe as far back as middle school. He’s abused hallucinogens so badly over the last decade of his life (he’s 27), that I think he’s living in a distorted reality, or in the least consistently trying to escape the current reality. He thinks crazy thoughts such as the idea that someone is following him (this thought hasn’t gone away). The only possible way I feel this could be possible if he didn’t pay someone for drugs which I’m pretty sure he still uses despite him denying it. 

He doesn’t know how to socially interact well anymore. I’ve become very disconnected from him. I can’t talk to him about anything anymore. When we video call (I live in Japan), he will have long periods of silence in between questions I ask, or when we are not sure what to talk about. He always answers most questions with the same answer and repeats the same questions over. It oftentimes takes him longer to respond. It’s not very obvious until you really take the time to talk to him. It’s little things at first like his intonation compared to other people, and once you get deeper he’ll open up about his full belief in a range of conspiracy theories and what are most likely hallucinations (what I think the whole someone’s following him idea is). 

He has huge anger management issues. He’s broken dozens (not an exaggeration) of electronics over the years including MP3 players (which were expressive at the time), computers, laptops, gaming platforms, as well as many walls and my grandmas kitchen cabinet a couple months after she passed away and started living in her house alone. He had been living with her for months up until her sudden passing in November. 

He cannot keep a job. He’s worked dozens if not over a hundred jobs and every time he quits no matter how good the job is for him. He only ever graduated high school so it’s more difficult for him to find a full time job with benefits. On top of that he always prefers working part time because he just mentally can’t seem to handle working a full time job. Oftentimes when he’s quits he’ll say something along the lines of, “I can’t do this anymore” and just up and leave in the middle of a shift.

He treats my father (what I guess you could refer to as his caretaker) like scum. He’ll call him names, spit awful words at him and has even gotten into a physical fight before with him (the cops were called supposedly and they had to go to court). He does not appreciate anything my father does despite him being the reason he’s alive as he doesn’t manage his money, can’t cook, and doesn’t clean. He blows his paychecks on drugs (I hope it’s just marijuana, but I can’t say for sure if he’s not doing other damaging drugs like he used to). 
 
If anyone can tell me what they think this is, I’d greatly appreciate it. I’m not taking it as an official diagnosis to say the least, but if anyone is going through something similar and has advice on how they deal with it, that would also be nice. Thank you.",16Aug2020,1

145,"Hi everyone here, so I'm having a bit of trouble right now and was looking for a way to cope or help the problem.

In the last 2 months I've put myself through a lot. I went to the school of my dreams (or so I thought) which was one of the military academies in the US. When I got there I found myself crying daily, sometimes more than once, for at the time I couldn't tell. After a while I came to the conclusion that the military was not for me, so I separated.  I came back to live with my mom in the mid-west because of the large social circle of friends that I love very much that haven't left for college. For being short I'll post the link to the problems with my mom that my brothers and I had [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/i3a06z/looking_for_advice3rd_party_commentary_reposted/). They moved to the east coast with my dad before I left for one of the academies. I decided to move from my mom's to somewhere else in the same town with family, who have all expressed support for me to do so. 

That's the context, so now I can get into the problem. When I moved my mom blew up, which I predicted, but it still hurt me. She had said several things such as ""I'm sorry that I'm not her (my stepmom),"" ""I'm glad you know how to treat women like crap,"" ""I'll see you when I die,"" ""Why don't you move down to \[East Coast State\] with your brothers,"" ""The truth is you're (my mom referring to herself) not worth the effort.""

I've been more stressed and anxious than ever right now. My entire life was flipped and the negative pressure from my mom doesn't help. I was on my way back from looking at cars to replace the one my mom gave me but still owned, and I just felt like I was about to cry the whole way back.

148,"Hey, I'm just here for a rant! Also I am new to this sub. So I (F) work at sea which is a very male dominated industry, I often struggle with being the only woman, feeling inadequate, imposter syndrome and low self worth are regular visitors in my daily routine. I've recently started on a new ship and though everyone has been nice and welcoming, the captain has decided otherwise.

A couple of days ago I was having lunch and he joined the table I was sat at. I made small talk and as I was about to leave I said half jokingly ""well, I suppose I should get back to work! Not that I can be bothered today"" now in the UK this is a normal things to say. However this guy took it as literal and had now been bitching about me to the crew.

My anxiety has been through the roof and I feel worse to the extent that I've not been sleeping and my mental health is at a low. It's hard enough being a woman at sea, having depression at sea, without the master of the ship telling people I shouldn't be here if I can be bothered and that I'm just taking someone else's job.

I'm desperate to have it out and tell him but I k ow it won't do me or my career any good. Even if I didn't have mental health issues, people are allowed to have a bad day. The guys just met me and had already decided I must not give a fuck about my job!!",16Aug2020,1
149,"I'm 19 M. Since this morning I've been feeling really low. I've been trying to keep myself busy. Sure, online classes are stressful, but I log in and go to sleep so there's that. I've started to go to the gym, they opened here a week ago, not many cases here. I've been playing pool(snooker) and taking guitar lessons at home with my sis and my friend who I'm secretly hooking up with. Sounds happy enough, right? I have loads of people I can call and talk to. And/or meet physically. 

But I'm still feeling extremely low. I am very self aware, but I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. I don't know what to do. I don't know how this began, or why I'm feeling this way. All I know is I might never stop feeling this way. It's really saddening. I can barely feel my emotions. Like Dementors are sucking the life out of me. Please help. What is this?",16Aug2020,1
150,"The NHS doesn't give a crap about mental health. That's pretty clear. I tried to get a doc appt in february because my compulsive skin picking, related to OCD was getting worse and beginning to get painful.

They cancel my appt.

My mum spends several HOURS making phone calls to get me another appointment, a phone consultation later that week early march.

She just tells me to move up to the max dose of my medication and that she'll refer me to mind matters for CBT/ERP.

I call again in june because I had a panic attack and i'd left a large cut, several centimetres wide and a mm or so deep. I was terrified it was going to scar, it still hasn't fully healed.

They said they'd call me back about getting me a prescription for something to help it heal and disinfect it.

They never called us back. 

Well now it's infected and I had another panic attack last night. My entire chest area is a bloody mess, my mum had to go and get me some extra large surgical dressings to cover the cuts and it's so sore I can hardly move without it hurting. She had to use the money we'd saved for a family meal out next week.

Sorry dad, mum and sister. I ruined our night out.

I can't bring myself to shower because it's going to sting like fuck. My hairs a frizzy mess and I need to shave and I feel gross, but I just can't- even a cold bath sounds too painful right now.

The blood ruined one of my favourite shirts. It's never going to come out.

It's going to scar. I'm never going to be able to wear a bikini. I'm never going to be comfortable going topless for a partner. 

I'm always going to have a stupid ugly reminder of all those cold dark nights alone when the only thing I can do to relieve the anxiety is to scrape at my skin.

 It's disgusting and while i'm not normally the kind of person to give a shit about appearances, I don't like the idea of having this for life.

Is your life in immediate danger? Then the NHS is amazing and we need it.

Anything else? Fuck you.

I still can't get an appointment util october. I need help, but it's not an emergency so nobody in the NHS is going to even try and help me.

Idk why, but I struggle with trusting friends and family at times. No matter how little evidence there is to support my claims a part of me is convinced that they’re lying to me and want to ridicule (and potentially harm) me. Suddenly every normal body language seems to be a secret code, as if they’re mocking me in front of me.

153,"It accrued to me recently, that I was becoming unhappy. I was struggling with my relationships, my work, and my life. But you would never know it. From the outside, I have the ""perfect"" life. A nice house. Wife. Kids. Car. Job. Health. And to be able to say I have and maintain these things is unique right now. So many people cannot say the same thing. Don't get me wrong, I am extremely fortunate, and I thank God for what he has given me. But I found that I was still very sad. 

It wasn't until about a week ago that I realized why. It wasn't my life that was upside down, rather it was my perception of myself. Regardless of all my good fortunes, I did not respect myself. That disrespect for myself has continued lingered since I was a child 30+ years ago. While contained and tamed, it has always been there. I just now realized something. While I thought I had it under control, I did not. And it projected out of my voice, attitude, and actions on a daily basis. Over time, I learned to ignore it to the point where I didn't think I even had a problem. But those around me, closest to me, who love me... were the ones who were feeling it most. My selfish notions, and my ignorance that I had a problem, ultimately hurt the  ones dearest to me. Friends, family, and most importantly my wife and children.

 I see that now. I am only a week into my journey, but I have begun to love and respect me for who I am, and not what others want me to be. I will no longer compare myself to my peers. I will be happy with me. Content with me. Love for, me. In doing so, I am allowing myself to love and respect others as well. In hopes this will project something I have been missing for so long. 

I encourage you all, to join me in this journey. It will be long, it might be painful, but in the end, we will be liberated of this burden!

158,"I don't know where to start but please be kind to me. I think I'm starting to realize I'm messed up all along. 

- Ever since I was young, I was pretty passionate with my emotions. When I liked someone, I would do anything, not just that I would pour my heart out and give notes. Now I don't do that anymore.

- I think I have high expectations and is sensitive over how people treats me because I just felt like I was always there, I don't even have friends now

- I always fantasize about breakups and I don't know how to describe it but I just love the feeling of pain it gives me just by fantasizing it. The scenarios are mostly: Partner cheats on me/ did something wrong to me and I'd want a breakup and they would cry and tell me not to leave. These thoughts are getting out of hand because I'm almost daydreaming every hour even when I'm out with friends, sometimes I'd just wander away and especially now that I have my first relationship

- now this gets even worse, I have this anxious thoughts that my partner is talking/flirting/cheating and sometimes I even want it to just happen already so I can get over it. I don't know how and what to do. I really don't think I'm capable of being with anyone. Not just that I lie too so that my partner thinks that I have a life other than them for example creating scenarios that never even happened, I honestly think I have a serious codependency issue and my partner is the center of my world. How I see myself is like a dog wagging its tail when their owner comes home. 

- oh, and I am also a people pleaser. Sometimes I lie just so they won't think bad of me, I say things so they would see me in a positive way and like me. 

-I really hate myself when I lie. I feel like I have no goal in life too and no sense of identity, I am what others see me as but sometimes I am able to just be myself. 

I don't know how and where to start, I just want to be a better and healthier minded person. I can't even go to therapists in my country because we have not that much and the private ones are so expensive. I can't afford online one too. I just want to get out and leave myself, I hate me.

160,"I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder for over a year now. And my psychiatrist/therapist prescribed medication to me in the second of therapy session itself (I did feel a little weird, as I could not accept that I was in depression and needed medication). But I was too much in distress to question or rethink anything and I did start taking medication, which was quite low dosage then. 

Now I need to mention that I haven't always followed my medicine schedule. I stopped taking them for longer periods of time. Mostly because I used to slip into depression, skip my meals and forget to take my pills. Sometimes when I couldn't sleep or had bouts of panic attack, I would take my medicines randomly as SOS measures. But I felt guilty and I always thought I'd change my habits and tried to be more regular in taking my pills, hence I never told about any of this to my doctor. 

Over the course of time my depressive phases and anxiety increased and my medication dosage increased too. And I started becoming more responsible in taking medicines daily, but I started experiencing side effects. (Extreme lethargy, constant yawning, insomnia). We have tried a couple of different medicines but nothing seems to work yet. 

A while back, I went complete medicine free for 3 weeks, due to certain unavoidable (and quite difficult) circumstances, and I did experience a low phase after that. My doctor knows that I didn't take my medicines for 3 weeks and she suggested that I immediately start taking them. But I feel worse after taking them, my brain isn't functioning at all. I am constantly yawning. And I want to stop taking medicines but my doctor insists that I need my medicines. What should I do? Has anyone faced this before? Also, is it normal to experience the side effects I'm facing? Please help.

She was only 16 and I was 15 at the time, and since then, I’ve had horrible nightmares and woken up with images of her in a pool of blood. For these last months, everyone tells me that we all die and I need to suck it up, but it isn’t just a death of a friend, I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD. 

I finally took the effort to write a goodbye letter to help me move on and I put it on r/unsent letters because I wanted someone to see it to, I don’t know, I just needed someone else to read it even if they didn’t care. I received one comment that told me it sounded like a middle school speech; I didn’t respond at first, but I decided to tell them it was a good bye letter to which they responded something along the lines of “I don’t give a fuck, everyone dies, suck it up.” I told them what happened and they told me I was overreacting. I looked online to get support because everyone in real life is dissing my trauma like it’s nothing and now the only place I’ve ever gotten real advice from just made it worse. So thank you do that redditor who forgot rule 0: don’t be a jerk.

I love being completely alone where no one cares what am I doing and stuff like that. Which is why I did not talk to my friends (over call or messaging) for some days at a stretch, however, they confronted me saying I am in some sort of state of depression which is causing me to plummet to such thoughts, and that it's illogical that some person thinks that having ZERO human contact (or rather friendship, since the job line I chose is solely based on human contact) is healthy or that they can live without it forever.

While I do understand that this kind of life isn't something they'd like but my question is that is it completely illogical?

I am 19M. I feel like I complain about everything and I am just bored with life. I have set up long-term goals in the works and did a great job on it for like 3-4 months and now I am just going back. Everyone around me told that I just need to find a hobby so I started looking for one. Tried cooking, making music, going for long walks, gaming, looking into conspiracy theories, watching a lot of shows and some other stuff that I can't remember. I am just bored with everything. Can't seem to find anything interesting.

Used to game a lot with friends a  year ago. Now I have moved to a different country and can't seem to find a community where I feel like home. Tried a lot of different games in search of finding communities. They are really boring solo (atleast for me). Also tried games made for solo players (not fun after 1 or 2 hrs of gameplay).  And this has happened to every single thing that I like. I don't have a lot of friends so I can't rely on anyone to hang out with. Also, I always seem to think that I know how I can get out of feeling like this but I don't know what to do.

Currently, I am seeking shelter in a lot of memes on reddit, yt compilations, insta short vids etc. They have also started to get a little boring ngl.

171,"One of my earliest memories is sometime in the year 2000. I was at a book exhibition at school with my parents, which was sponsored by Scholastic. I remember being happy and excited, even though at that age I barely knew anything about anything. But I did like books, and was fascinated by the dizzying collection of colourful books there.

My favourite book as a kid was the Atlas. I loved poring through my copy, and to look at not just maps of India, but of the whole world. This atlas not only had political maps, but geologic and weather maps too. I used to play atlas with my cousin brother where he would name a city from a country and I had to find it. It is unbelievable how much joy I got out from one book. I used to look at the scale at the bottom and marvel at the sheer size of the earth, how 1 centimetre on a map could equal a thousand kilometres.

The appeal of geography is for people who find ‘what is the world like out there?’ an interesting question to pursue. There is another subject that poses the same question: Space &amp; Astronomy. That day in 2000, the only book I asked my parents to buy was one on the solar system. When I flipped through it and saw the pictures, there was no way I was leaving without it.

Books were my lifeblood. And I don’t mean novels. I mean the atlas, the book on the solar system, Tinkle comics, and Amar Chitra Katha. For my 11th or 12th birthday my dad bought me a collection of 25 Amar Chitra Kathas. To this day it remains to be the best birthday present I ever got. I was so hooked onto these books that my parents had to lock up my collection during exam time. And I of course sneaked them out and read them to my heart’s content.

Another gift I received around that age from my cousin brother, was Trivial Pursuit in the form of a small digital console. Every time I pressed the button for ‘Next question’, I yearned for the shuffle to land on Science &amp; Technology. Though I fortunately wasn’t aware of the word at the time, but I was a dork, and glad to be one.

What I love the most about my childhood was the certainty I had about the things that made me happy, and the determination to pursue them earnestly. Granted, books and games are inherently quite ordinary and not particularly challenging. But no act is small when it is towards something your heart truly enjoys. I never stopped to question whether these things made me a dork/nerd/geek, or whether my friends liked it, or whether my parents liked these things about me. I liked doing these things and that was it — end of story.

It’s 2020 now, and doing what I want has become incredibly hard. And it is not because of work or this pandemic or ‘a part of growing up’. Consider writing for example. Apart from a couple of long captions on Instagram, I haven’t written a word in the last 6 months. I had time, I had things to say, and I genuinely enjoy writing. It creates a coherence and flow in my thoughts like nothing else and there is a sense of adventure. It’s like you start drawing a fruit, which then becomes a part of a tree, at which point a nest emerges, and you end up drawing a baby bird taking its first flight to grab the fruit.

And yet this is how my attempts to write go: The moment an idea enters, my friend’s face pops up, smirking at me and telling me this is no good. I think of how certain people will react, most of whom never read what I post anyway. I picture them narrowing their eyes, flaring their nostrils, and just scrolling past my words mercilessly. I remember a friend calling my writing a ramble, and another one saying I don’t mean the things I write. And thus the idea dies before it even takes shape into words.

Rationally, I know I’m not supposed to care.

Should I care about what people say? No.

Should I care when my friend smirks? No.

Do I care anyway? Yes.

Singing is something I enjoy too. A few months ago I purchased a condenser mic to record better. But I have been falling into the same trap again. Instead of recording, I hopelessly go through songs and think “well, this won’t be well received.” “This one will make people call me gay.” “This is too niche and nobody will connect to it.” “I sound funny on the high notes so what’s the point recording, fuck it.”

I think this is what is known as compulsive behaviour. They’re kind of like these bad habits, that you know are bad, yet you find it impossible to break out of them. When I eat at home, I absolutely must watch something while eating. And 95 percent of the time I will be watching something I’ve already seen. A re-run of Seinfeld, It’s always Sunny in Philadelphia, Arrested Development, the entire MCU movie list: it is just an automatic action, into which no thinking goes whatsoever. Grab plate. Open mac. Open chrome. Enter Hotstar or Primevideo. Click on next episode. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, tea, or even fruit: press play.

Breaking out of these loops is like going through withdrawal. Last week I was angry at myself for watching The Newsroom for a 4th time, so one day I just didn’t watch anything. It literally felt painful  leaving it mid-season like that even though I knew what was going to happen. The next day, I tried browsing to see whether there’s something that genuinely interests me. I searched for space, and ended up watching an Engineering Marvels episode of the International Space Station. The next day I found the show Cosmos, and it rekindled joy. The joy of rediscovering a lost love, of the mind actually having to work to decipher what was being said, and rewind, if needed. Planet Earth is the only other show to have had this effect on me. It is Cosmos in fact, that sparked the memory of the book exhibition from 20 years ago.

There are other more embarrassing instances of compulsive behaviours that angered me. The launch of reels on Instagram meant that whenever I clicked on the search button, I was forced to constantly see what is usually a teen/young adult woman prancing and dancing in a series of costumes. I somehow got hooked to this particular profile, and started obsessively loading it again and again till a new post came. I don’t know this person, and yet dutifully watch her and learn 5 different ways to style a black tee. I had to uninstall Instagram for a few days to come to my senses, then eventually block her.

Everyone wants to live their life doing the things they love, and everyone has the time to do it. Looking back, if I think about why I haven’t done (more) of things I like, even the easiest of things, the answer is simple. One, I have spent way, way too much energy on ‘what would people think?’ and two, I spent my free time on auto-pilot, instead of taking the wheel and driving where I want to.

Doing what you love is level 2. Level 1 is to be conscious of what you’re actually doing. Watch and study yourself. If you’re anything like me, you’ll be surprised at the number of things you do without actually consciously deciding to. Love can wait, I’ll be happy to take the wheel for starters.",16Aug2020,1

175,"I really don’t know. It’s hurts. It feels like I’m literally gonna puke. I’ve been with my girlfriend for over 4 years and I don’t think she’s trusted me at all. 
Like I said. I don’t know what I feel. I just know it hurts. I want to cry, vomit, or just do something. But I’m stuck at work. Doing nothing about it. I’m ending it with her today because I can’t take it anymore. We have lived together for over a year and I just can’t deal with the anxiety of having to deal with her parents, our friends, the things we do together. Our neighbors. I really can’t find what I feel anywhere. I want to cry but can’t. I feel like I have to vomit but it won’t come. I need something. This just hurts. I’m not thinking of self-harm. I just want this to stop hurting.",16Aug2020,1
176,"Hey guys, 
I’m a 29 year old male. I have a daughter as well as a wife who is very extraverted and bipolar 1. I recently found out I am that I am autistic and show a lot of signs of borderline. As you can imagine, communication is very difficult. I have been to therapy and psychiatrists, but I can’t afford anything right now.

Are there any great mental health resources for people who don’t have money? 

Thank",16Aug2020,1

178,"I trust my bf. I’ve known him for 10 years and I love him to bits. He works at a jimmy johns with a coworker he fooled around with and ended a few months before we got together. He “used” her as a guinea pig, not sexually but said he wanted to help straighten her life around. And she did. But she thought they were dating and then went a bit crazy after that when he told her they were never dating just hanging out fooling around. They currently still work together only once a week and says there’s always tension Bc of that history. 

Now there’s a girl who’s like 4 years younger then him and I’m worried about her. He says “she’s too young”. He’d bring that up maybe twice when he does talk about his coworkers and it’s like I didn’t even ask for that. She’s 19, her hair was so pretty and long and curled. Brown on top and blonde on the bottom. I assumed she was really pretty Bc she was well put together. Super skinny and super tall and id think her and my bf would look physically perfect together. Yesterday I went to his work unknowingly that both girls would be there. He was supposed to train the pretty girl but he slept in and he didn’t. I asked what the girl was with the pretty hair and he was was like “yeah I guess she’s pretty...” I became overwhelmingly sad and can’t stop thinking about that comment. Then I assumed the blue haired girl was the one he fooled around. I’ve told him before it bugs me you work with the gir still but it’s only once a week. He really likes the people at his work that he doesn’t want to leave.

This all stems from my own insecurity. I’ve tried improving myself . I’ve tried makeup. Mascara looks weird Bc my eye lashes are too long (it really does look weird). I’ve got some weight on me. 5’8”. 180 lbs 
I’ve saved so many videos on how to improve my appearance on YouTube and just have been overwhelmed to even try to make myself more prettier. I hardly ever get any compliments from him but yet I get attention out on the streets if I dress in basic jeans, a dressy shirt and a cute bag.

I’ve been giving him the silent treatment since yesterday Bc everytime I have brought up my feelings, he said once , “if you keep thinking like this, idk how long we can make it...” but he knows when’s something’s wrong and he’s just been asking but I feel like I can’t tell him any more",16Aug2020,1
179,"Theres some people that seem to be negative about me (laugh when i walk in a room or talk behind my back etc) for no reason really because I'm always nice, work hard and help them when they need it. Maybe its because I dont speak as much as others but thats just the way I am. Any advice to not care what people think especially when its out of your control like this? Hard to remember that there should be nothing to worry about when I haven't actually done anything just cant wrap my head around why they would act like that towards me rather than just let me do my own thing",16Aug2020,1

181,"My boyfriend (26 M) and I (22F) have been in a relationship for almost two years now. We live in two different countries but have already spent a whole year together. So we first met in summer of 2018 as friends but quickly became a couple. Just before that summer he helped me through a really though time, got me out of my depression and kept me from taking my own life. So we had a really great time and met five months later. I went with him to his country to spend there three months. And they were really great, but it was just then, that I realised that he is struggling with stress mainly bc of work but also coping with it in general. Living with him in a room I got to see him being distant and not as happy and cheerful as he usually is. He also sometimes would get a bit mad and hurt me with the way he said things. But I kinda managed to deal with it even tho it was something that hurt me a lot bc I am a very sensetive person and always loved that he never yelled or got furious or anything. In that time I also struggled mentally a bit myself. Being away for the first time from my parents for such a long time, being on the other end of the world and still dealing with social anxiety, caused some break downs where my boyfriend had to take over and take care of me so I wouldn't run onto a busy street or pack my suitcase before leaving. He never seemed to have lots of issues with it but as I learned later on, he in fact did. So after that time we spent four months working and travelling. It was challenging for me bc I haven't really been working, since I got sick but I still managed to do it quite well. But again with the work he often got stressed out and living in a tiny caravan, kinda made it even worse. So I had to work on a farm for many hours which was already a struggle with a boss that wasn't always understanding of me taking time off bc I wasn't feeling mentally well. So all that got together and lead to me having a total nervous breakdown where my bf had to carry me to our caravan while i was crying and sobbing and couldn't talk or walk or do anything but scream and bawl my eyes out. I also struggled a lot with my body being sick where he had to take over heaps of hard work for me bc I had a really bad cold that later turned out to me mono. So we both struggled. Additionally the boss made me feel bad for letting my bf do all the work even tho I clearly couldn't do it. My bf is also someone that wants to impress everyone and do more than he has to or should do. So he was always exhausted and I guess my mental and physical state affected him too bc he cared about me and took care for me as good as he could. The whole work and travel thing was good and we had lots of fun travelling but at some point at another place I and all the others got treated so horrible that I couldn't stay any longer. We left one month earlier than we wanted to bc I was mentally broken. So we went back to my country and spent three months in my room, since I live with my parents. Since I still had mono and was constantly sick we couldn't do much so he was stuck inside and hated it. Sometimes he would go for walks by himself and visit two friends but other than that we would be inside. And I think that affected him a lot too. So he left early this year and has been depressed ever since. He has a history with depression, took medication and went to therapy. At some point he got better and quit both. Back when his ex broke up with him, he managed to not get into depression again and except for the dealing with stress thing he always was pretty stable. So ever since he got home I told him to go to therapy. It actually took me crying and sending heartbroken messages, for him to go to a therapist. He doesn't like to take help from others and isn't to keen on going to therapy. He only has been once and keeps telling me that he is looking for someone else bc he didn't like that one he met with. But that's now over a month or even longer ago. He does sport which helps him, but he doesn't wanna take medication nor talk to me about his issues or what's going on. I know a lot and what works or could work but I feel like he never really wants to take my help or actually work on it even tho I could help him. So since I am not really stable myself... seeing my boyfriend being down, not himself, not being able to answer my text or talk on the phone or video chat or watch something together or even playing a video game,really really hurts me. And this past year he has been hurting me. Not on purpose since the mental illness isn't his fault but his stubbornness and just not even being willing to bite the bullet for me. I also struggle with not feeling accepted or taken seriously or important. He always was the one that gave me the feeling that he cares and what I say is important and matters and is interesting. He always was there for me, understanding me, reacting to things and talking about it and being excited instead of just boring like all the others. He is so special to me and I have never met any one like him. We are just so similiar in every way and he means so much to me. Yet all of this is taking a toll on me and my mental health... I cried more times bc of this, than I can count and it's always pulling me down again. He doesn't respond to a message I get upset. He doesn't answer something I really wanna know, I feel rejected.

I ve already distanced myself a bit but I cant fully do it yet bc I just love him so much and care so so much about him... I don't wanna loose him but I feel like I am loosing him to his mental illness... and there isnt much I can do bc I am already doing everything possible in my power. I am trying to focus on myself and my own health but it's just hard to do like this, especially bc he has always been the strong one, that's there for me, catches me, cheers me up and Picks me up. If I would be in a better mental state I could do that for him too but I just don't have enough energy for the two of us... And he told me that those times when I broke down and he had to take care of me like you do of a child, affected him a lot and forced him to mature and grow. He doesn't like to talk about what's going on inside of him and I just don't know what he is thinking or feeling or what he wants. When I ask he tells me that he doesn't know or I have to repeatedly ask the question till he finally answers it. He says it's all a big mess and he doesn't like to think about the future which makes me very worried and I insecure as well. I don't wanna loose him bc of the mental struggles bc we except for that get along perfectly... never have fights or arguments and just had such a great awesome time together. I know that he truley loves me but the distance and not knowing when we ll be able to see each other plus both of our mental states just makes it all so complicated and though. And I just don't know what to do. I feel like I ve already lost him in a way and I am not sure if it can work out...  if any of you went through something similiar or have any advice or idea of what I could do, I would really appreciate your help. I definatley won't leave him just bc it's though bc he is the most important person to me and just perfect in any way what so ever.

184,"She constantly criticizes me and rarely offers any solutions or praise. She is very hypercritical of even the tiniest mistakes. 

I was put on a PIP but it's really insulting to call it a ""plan"" because it was all just a list of my failures and no suggestions for overcoming them. 

I looked up signs you have a toxic boss and she hit all of the characteristics.

I am actively job seatchingto get away from her but I'm worried about how much time it will take. I have to survive without getting fired or killing myself until I'm gone. 

Aside from making me feel passively suicidal, it's starting to affect other areas of my life. She got frustrated with me on Friday and I've been obsessing with it ever since. Obsessing about finding a new job, fantasizing about calling her a c**t on my last day, fantasizing about murdering her, etc. I've lashed out at my fiancée a lot this weekend and I can only assume that my bad mood is related.

I’m just going to vent because I don’t know where to start. Back a while ago I was dating a girl who I was absolutely in love with. She was my everything and my best friend. During this time I was in this small group of friends, about 8 people or so and my girlfriend and some of her closer friends in that group had a falling out with someone else so that person was removed. As a result, 2 people who didn’t have a say in what happened argued that they didn’t actually have say in anything and I had to stay neutral on that issue since I they were very close friends but in the end I got pulled to my gfs side by presumption. After that the group was essentially just my gfs closer friends and one other person. I would have tried to stay close with them but one of them who is my best friend dated her back earlier in that year and still had a thing for her and was upset that I was dating her despite the fact that he didn’t tell me anything about it. Going into Juneish I started having really bad anxiety and I started getting into some bad habits which I am not going to specify. She ended up breaking up with me during this time which didn’t help very much for what I was going through and I started getting super aggressive in the group chat we had and I had a bad mental breakdown that everyone found out about. 

To get to modern date after that until about a week ago I was doing a summer program that kind of kept me distracted but I still thought about it. Now I only have free time and I can’t stop thinking about it. I’ve been extremely irritable and I can’t stop thinking that I’ve lost every friend I’ve had. I talk to some people on a regular basis but I don’t actually have conversations with people individually. In that old chat I had they added someone new and then made a completely new group chat with them and everyone except me. I feel like I’m lost now and I no longer have a purpose and I’m scared that my habits are going to relapse because I don’t want to be sucked down any of those holes again. I feel sick everyday and miss having a real friend to talk to.",16Aug2020,1
186,"Hey Reddit. So mentally.. I don’t feel like something is right.. I get angry quickly. My energy levels are down..like my life is just zzz tiresome. And Due to a big part of my memory being so shit. Makes me hate myself. I’m always forgetting shit. Like this morning. I live an 1 hour and 15 minutes from my jobs at an airport. Half way into the drive I realized I forgot my badge and my job won’t let me in without it so I had to call off... again.. and this happens with everything! go to my car, forget my keys, grab my phone, forgot who to call.. everytime i tell people about it “or you’re just not WANTING to remember” or “you’re just being lazy, make notes” 

Like someone always has some logical reason when the reality hits those type of thoughts just simple don’t run across my mind to help me.. I honestly don’t think “hmm let me make a note of this” and it’s gotten to the point where now I feel like I am lazy.. 

On top of that i just have real bad image of myself.. I feel like I’m way too skinny. Can’t speak in one fluid motion.. I can’t come up with the right words.. or say “ umm” a fuck ton..  all of this has given me social anxiety. I hate going out and speaking to people.. now my life is just quiet to myself.. forget a lot and smoke weed to calm me down. I have no genuine friends.. I’m 25 and I come from the hood. People don’t really show affection.. so i don’t really know how to ask for help.. or where to go. I wish having a therapist was free cause I would’ve done that along time ago. All I know is I’m tired of feeling like I’m in a dark corner alone..",16Aug2020,1
187,"I got in trouble a year ago for sexual misconduct for hugging a coworker in a way I didnt know they were uncomfortable with, from behind. I thought of us as friends and back hugs are one of my favourites to give. I never considered it sexual, but I got in trouble for it. As my first ever write up, it was a final corrective action.

I find myself in the same situation a year later for touching a coworker's back while they were mopping backwards to let them know i was right behind them in a corridor. Once again, I considered us friends but also, I touch everyone when I'm close to them from behind because that is how I would prefer to be let known someone is there. Verbal is probably better, but after an 8 hr shift of talking to customers, my throat hurts and 80% of my conversation is non-verbal. I dont have the best use of words outside of text to be frank.

So I'm under investigation again and in the time of COVID, I immediately fell into despair. I took my meds, took a nap, cried. But I also applied to 3 or 4 jobs and already got an interview for monday. I was a former employee at this job and left because it was just a season temp job, so chances of me getting hired for the full time position is quite high.

I'm doing okay. I'm still sad and get panic when I think about all my plans through my job I made. How I had a 5 year plan for attending school and work. How I like my coworkers for the most part and how I planned to get benefits. Because I'm not even sure I'll have this job next month, I'm going to be without health insurence after october 1st. I'm in so much debt up to my eyeballs but cant fet credit to open a credit card account so everything I owe is literal cash. I panic because I had plans, and now mynplans will change against my will and I have to adapt and I'm not good at letting go.

But I'll be okay. This new job is full time. They also have schooling assistance and benefits and I make $3.50 more an hour. I know this will be fine.

I just wonder if I should quit now, or let the investigation go on and let them fire me. Idk. I feel if I quit, I may be able to get rehired later on. But that isnt a guarantee and if I stay I can get as much money from them as I can. But I'll be okay.

If this happened before my medication, I would have tried to kill myself. I would have blew money out of spite towards myself. I would have hurt myself in so many ways as if to atone for my mistake like that would mean anything to the corporate monkeys. No, instead I have an interview, I havent even so much as relapsed in my eating disorder, let alone self harm. I didnt get drunk or buy anything.

I'm doing okay. I'll be okay. It'll be okay. I really think it would be. I just feel a little extra lonely now.",16Aug2020,1

My friend died of covid on Thursday. She was 32, a year young than me. Up until then I've been thinking that I'd be fine if I get it, just mild symptoms. Don't get me wrong, I've been keeping safe and wearing my mask since March but I wasn't too worried. 

But now I feel anxious and helpless. I have a real fear of going out in public. I've spoken to my partner to not to go and if he has to, to be very careful. Her death hit too close to home. She, like me, has been living abroad, hundreds of miles away from home. She didnt get to say goodbye to her mum and dad. She didn't know she had underlying health condition until she was admitted to hospital with covid. The number of positive cases in my area is on the rise again, some people don't wear their masks and don't socially distance.

I know this sounds very cringeworthy but watching the rain hit the pavement and drip from the tree in front of my window, with the cold air against my face, just made me appreciate how beautiful the world can be around you sometimes. It made me realise that due to our daily struggles and battles we fight within ourselves, we sometimes miss the little moments around us.

194,"Sorry just a little vent. A lot of people say this and I know they mean well but I can never believe it and sometimes I get so... angry? frustrated? whenever someone tells me this. I often drown in overwhelming loneliness and it's so unbearable.

My family is good relative to a lot of other families but all my beliefs and my identity clashes with all of theirs so they will not support or accept me if they find out. I also want to get checked up for mental health issues but I feel like my parents will just spout some religious bullshit or make me go to church more often if I ask to go to a doctor. So I'm just here not knowing what exactly I could be diagnosed with and not having anything treated. All I know is that it hurts so much and it hinders my life almost, if not always, daily.

I have friends (though I think it's more appropriate to call them acquaintances at this point) and only have 2 actual friends but they live on the other side of the world. In all of my relationships, I always feel like I'm not cared for as much as I cared about them. I give so much in the relationships but I'm barely given anything back. I know I shouldn't expect so much but it just hurts to have everything be so one-sided all the time.

I have no one as my support system and I have no one to turn to when I'm hurting and crying or even when I'm excited about certain things. My mental health really plummeted because of the quarantine so nowadays I'm often left alone drowning in my negative thoughts, most of which peak during the hours when I should be asleep like right now at 3am.

I just want someone who actually cares long-term but I guess that's too much to ask. So here's another night of feeling incredibly alone.",16Aug2020,1
195,"I have been making posts and deleting them. I don't know how to say this without sounding like a bad person. And I can't make it short.

So an accident happened. I was injured and our dog almost died (he is all right. I am so happy about that). Only I got ""hit"". I might have some permanent damage. My other hand feels just weak and I can't trust it. I don't know if it will get better. 

The fragility of life just got me. But other stuff too. I am bipolar and have aspergers. I have a suicide attempt in my past. But this time others were really strongly involved. In the situation I worried more about the dog and my flatmates/siblings mental health and we just waited for our mother to arrive because I couldn't leave them alone. It took an hour (because she took a bus and didn't drive because she thought it wasn't that bad)  and I was just bleeding in the sink. A lot. Trying to calm down my sibling who was just a crying mess. I just took some sugar pills because I looked so pale. They were panicking so bad I couldn't leave them alone. My injuries were just disgusting and dirty too. Stuff other than blood was coming out too. It was worrisome. I wasn't dying (I was bleeding a lot but not enough to kill me) but I needed treatment and my fatty tissue just needed to be put back in there where I can't see it. It was a perfect breeding ground for a serious infection. And I was bleeding a lot.

I am just so tired. Why must I always be the one who just copes alone and it's expected of me? The efford is actually pretty great, you know. And they still act like I am selfish. I must always be the voice of reason and supportive when everyone else just panics. Even later on. And if my family is there I get told I was ""panicking"" the most and others saved me when that was not the case. I don't blame anyone for how they acted in that situation. People can't control that. Not everyone is calm and rational when stuff like that happens. It was a horrible. But later on. Did everyones' memories just turn into something else or do I remember it wrong? I didn't cry or panic. Yeah, I wasn't able to go and buy my sibling some ice cream because I eas bleeding that much. I only cared about my siblings and the dogs' wellbeing.

All I got now is just "" You will be fine"" when I might actually have more serious injuries. And why must I endure insults by my mother in those situations? ""She just doesn't think"" But she always does it and I can't say anything back without sounding like a horrible person. My sibling just needed someone. I can cope alone but they can't. 

I have been alone at home for over a week. (I took a taxi to ER. Took caution to not bleed on the seats). I have been drinking although I managed to be sober for almost 2 months. My hand was completely unusable for 1,5 weeks. And it was pretty painful. Eggs were pretty hard to peel... I can't trust my hand even know, It's just weak and fingers don't work that well. The feeling is gone in some areas but it's nothing I can't deal with. People do manage with no arms at all so I shouldn't complain. Living alone with one hand isn't impossible.

I am just tired. Why must I just endure everything that happens and also everything they trough at me? Even when I was bleeding and stuff was spilling out I am the one who just has to be decent when everyone else has a reason to not be? Because I am always the one who is not hurt the most. I can handle it when it happens but why do they tell me I did poorly? It's all my fault in their eyes I guess.

This is eating me up. I wouldn't care but it's like this every time. Maybe I have had enough.",16Aug2020,1
196,"So I(M19) have been in quarantine since March. During all these last months I didn't really went out much with the exception of groceries and stuff for my parents and myself. The first few months felt really weird being away from college and dorm and being inside my old room once again for the entire day. My house is very small and there's not a lot of places that I can go to during the pandemic so I've been living inside my bedroom for all day for the last few months, reading books and watching movies. I am kind of a shy person so I didn't really make deep friendships with many people while I was at college and as a result I don't talk to anyone now. My parents stay busy with their work for the most of the day and spend time with each other for the rest of the day which I don't want to interrupt. I just numbed into the habit of not talking to people anymore and as a result I can't really hold conversations with anyone anymore. I feel suffocated and terribly alone in my small room all day. I told my parents that my mental health isn't at it's greatest and they replied that many people have lost their jobs and their homes due to the pandemic and that I should be thankful about having a roof over my head in this situation and that I am a grown up man now and I shouldn't be acting weak or feeling bad for no reason. I kind of get what they are saying, and I truly am grateful that I still have a house to live in but this just feels suffocating. I am scared. It's like I am losing a part of my individuality because I don't talk to absolutely anyone anymore. I have not friends to check up on me and I don't have the balls I guess, to call them up and start talking. Umm, I guess I just want a friend to spend some time with, idk.

197,"I'm suffering from an eating disorder and body dysmorphia along with general anxiety and feeling very low. I used to feel alot worse, until I was put on lots of medicine, I am on anti psychotics and the max dose of fluoxetine for someone my age.

I have cried once about the death of my grandma in the past 4½ months and i feel like a zombie, I just don't act the same way I used to. I used to be able to feel happy and have a good laugh, but at the same time I would feel intensely isolated and alone, unable to reach out to anyone and everything seemed grey and lifeless to me. The thoughts regarding my body and weight used to be alot more intense, I used to be severely underweight before my medication and the thoughts of how I looked would completely incapacitate me, I wouldn't leave the house or meet my friends for days on end. Now that I can manage most days with my thoughts I feel like they are no longer valid. I am feeling very suicidal right now, I don't know how to approach someone because I feel like they all assume that I am fine.

I don't even believe I suffer from mental illnesses, I just think that I can clearly admit to things people don't want to tell me that they are true.

My anxiety. Dear god it’s terrible. I hate the idea of going to loud places with lots of people, confronting anyone about pretty much anything except for like 2-3 people. Which makes asking teachers about stuff a nightmare. I haven’t been diagnosed for anything, and before covid hit the US as hard as it did, there was talk with my mom about seeing a therapist. That was when she had a steady income for herself, and not relying on my dads job. Of course now I think it would help, but with her not having a good income I don’t want to add yet another thing for her to worry about. (And causing me to worry)
The random bouts of sadness and hopelessness that come with either something not going how I imagined (like a craft project- stupid I know) or how attached I’ve become to my phone. Or just not having motivation to do anything. That includes the sport that I do, or practicing the instruments that I play.
I’ve tried talking with my friend, but since he moved we now almost never see each other. And he has a f*cked up sleep schedule and doesn’t check his messages that often so I can’t just talk with him. 
Idk if I have an anxiety disorder, or depression or a blend. I want to see a therapist but I get nervous asking my mom for stuff. And now she probably won’t let me bc of COVID not that that’s a bad thing- I understand staying apart as much as possible is a must.",16Aug2020,1
211,"This is basically an intrusive thought. When I was younger in school, some of my friends looked up to me as some sort of mentor for...reasons I don't understand. It placed a lot of pressure on me though. I would give them self-help, confidence tips, etc. Those friends grew in confidence and social skills, dated a bit; I had a nervous breakdown largely as a product of my parents' divorce and my Dyspraxia catching up to me. I've been stuck at home (currently my own apartment but in the same flat block as my mum) unemployed with helicopter parents and a bunch of mental health issues, they've moved on with their lives. I've been single for 6 years and with a flattened libido from antidepressants for much of it. They aren't bad people for leaving, which my illnesses say makes it my fault for failing to recover at the same rate or keep up with them. 

Lately the same fear has come up with new friends. When I meet, sometimes they're not doing great. We both have the mutual hardship in common. I do try and consciously make the relationship somewhat positive, not just 'misery loves company', but of course sometimes this is difficult as we're both handling a lot of stress. It's not even that we're not both in therapy or trying, because God knows I TRY to get bettter; they just seem to be more successful at either feeling better, or society validating that they are accepted now. Over time (I feel like) they grow more distant and it reaches the point where they're healthy enough to no longer need me. This happens with everyone but most commonly with female friends I made through social media etc. I'm left wondering what I have to offer and why I'm lacking the strength, the discipline, to be able to keep up with them. It's very much a feeling of me chasing people who like in a dream are always able to move quicker than me and eventually leave me behind alone.",16Aug2020,1

We’ve worried about loved ones who are sick and grieved those we’ve lost. We’ve faced trauma and grief over racial injustice and the devastating loss of many Black lives.

In a humble response to these high levels of stress, trauma and grief, the Lifeology team partnered with [Dr. Natalia Peart](https://lifeology.io/user/drnatalia/) and [illustrator Jordan Hunter](https://lifeology.io/user/jordanhunter/) to create [an illustrated mini-course about how to strive for mental wellness in these troubling times](https://lifeology.us.lifeomic.com/static/ologies/mind/mental-wellness-after-stress/index.html#/). This resource was created with Black individuals and communities in mind, but is relevant for all of us. It is beautifully written and illustrated to feature Black voices and faces and to help us all understand why it is that we are so stressed these days, and how to grow as we move forward.

216,"tw: emotional/physical/verbal/child abuse (its the whole cocktail), neglect, self harm and a whole lot of mental issues because life decided why the fuck not 

as the title suggests, my life for the past 20 years has been funny to live through. i dont know how to explain it other than funny. you guys probably know that feeling when someone asks if you're okay but all you can do is laugh because have i ever been okay? 

im the eldest child of many siblings, i've had severe anxiety as a child and instead of getting the help i needed, my family humiliated me to the point that i repressed any kind of emotion that would lead to me showing any type of fear. i had to raise my siblings from a very young age, i heard stuff coming from my parents that no child should've ever heard, threats and insults towards me that i only recently remembered because young me decided to write it down. and the problem is that my parents seem to enjoy the fact that i dont express myself that much, calling me their ""golden"" child and all that. 

to recall an incident, back in 2015, my mental health was an all time low (to the point of self-harm) and i found myself a support system through my friends and for a while it was good. however, a person that i considered a really close friend decided to tell one of my siblings and out of fear, the sibling told our mother. all i can say is that due to how much i was beaten up, i barely remember what happened that day. (yes you read that right, i got beaten up for being depressed and a few cuts on my wrists)

i went for therapy about a year ago and while it helped, i can no longer bring myself to trust my community and the society that i live in when it comes to mental health. and its depressing because i know that i need help but im too scared. its very hard to open up and living in a country where your mental health can get you locked up in jail, brain decided its better off being quiet. (for my safety, i will not specify where im from but ironically, its a very known country, just a horrible mentality that operates within society)

people say its gonna get better but fail to mention how hard it is to get there. my parents have gotten better but the pandemic is creating unwanted tension so no difference tbh. but nonetheless, even though i can never run away from home and live my life, ive found fun friends once again, i found hobbies, i found interests, i've listened to songs that remind me of those sad times and cried my eyes out but now i can listen to some of them and remember that once upon a time, i wasn't the happiest child back then and it didn't solve any of my problems but it helped soothe the pain and gave me a sense of happiness temporarily. 

it gets better, even if its not what you wanted, even if its not how you wanted it to be, it gets better. to every human reading this, it wasn't your fault and it was never your fault. what happened to you, you never deserved it, not even one bit. you deserve to be born, you deserve a chance to live your life, you deserve to be happy. don't ever allow anyone to tell or convince you that you don't deserve to be alive.

I walk on my toes a lot, and my mom realized that my feet were constantly slanted from me walking on the ends. She said that if I didn't stop she'll take me to go get surgery. I started crying. She told me to stop crying so I could listen to her. I told her that she was making me nervous, but she kept talking. I was pretty much begging her to be quiet. 

Another example is whenever I need to go to the dentist I'll have a nervous breakdown and start crying for 5 minutes straight. I was in the chair waiting to get my teeth cleaned, then I made the mistake of looking at all of the tools. It made me cry. I didn't stop until somebody came and calmed me down. When we left, my mom looked really mad at me. 

I'm scared to tell her about this because I'm scared she'll tell me that I should just be quiet. Or she'll completely overreact. She knows I have anxiety, she just doesn't know what I go through because of it. Can somebody please help me?",16Aug2020,1

I want to die when they pass away. I have no passions. Nothing ever excites me. Sometimes I have a random burst of productivity where I feel like I have a lot of energy and I do get stuff done. But that only last for a few hours up to a week at most. Then it's back to having so little energy that I barely talk. Also during that period just hearing people's voices is enough to make me irritated and annoyed. Other times i have violent thoughts against my self or stuff that I would never act on, but it would put me on some kind of list if i said it. 

I get urges to bang my head against stuff and I do typically end up drinking alcohol and/or eating too much junk which has a negative effect on me.

This is my first post here and wanted to get some advice on what I'm about to share. Lately, I've been struggling with a lack of motivation and been procrastinating a lot on some things I want to do. For instance, when the summer vacation started I was practicing piano every day but fell off following my relapse after two months of being sober. I am back on track (two months sober again), but I have a lack of purpose and feel like there is nothing to look forward to. I wake up in the morning, make my bed, take my meds, take a shower, brush my teeth, etc. so I have no problem in terms of taking care of myself. I eat and sleep well. However, I lack any real interest in anything. I like music and been wanting to practice piano and singing again on a daily basis but have been avoiding it for some reason, maybe due to my perfectionist tendencies and fear of failure. Impatience is a big problem for me and turns everything into a disaster. When I was dating, I rushed things because I wanted to jump right into cuddling (not sex) and the lovey-dovey things. I want to master things in no time when I know it's not possible and I acknowledge everything is a learning process, but I can't seem to enjoy the steps leading to the end goal. I just want it now, indicating problems with instant gratification (I'm majoring in Psychology). I feel like I have such a boring life now that I can't really party (because I'm trying to stay sober). I am trying to stay single to ""work on myself"" because I know I won't find something serious on dating websites. Everything is just 'meh' and this life is just a broken record.",16Aug2020,1
220,"Hey... I (15) have been thinking a lot about moving out etc., even if it are still two years until I finished school, and the thought of breaking contact with my family crossed my mind, but I don't know if this would be to extreme. 

I have always had a difficult relationship with my family. I am the only gifted person in the family and I never had a real relationship with any of them. My mum used to yell at me as a kid and she said some pretty bad stuff, f.ex. that she wished to never see me again and that she wished she didn't have a gifted kid. She also yelled at me if I didn't understand something immediately and I still can't ask for help without fearing to be mocked and yelled at. 

There have been more conflicts with her lately as I started seeing the school counseler because I am scared/extremely uncomfortable if someone touches me or I would be convinced that people are going to hurt me if I let them near me. It got to the point where I coudn't stand in qeues, go to town or hug people. I would start crying and felling as if I wouldn't get air if it was to much for me. I just couldn't deal with it anymore (there have been incidents where I broke down crying because someone approached me to fast etc.). My mom mocked me and fought with me because of it and forbid me to go to the school counselor or a real therapist. I have also got other mental heath issues (suicidal thoughts, problems to sleep, extreme stage fright...) so maybe seeing a therapist would have been a good idea. My mom has a very bad opinion on people with mental health problems in general, she thinks they are just doing it for attention or should just get over themselves. She also won't let me go see a doktor because I have got a constant migraine/headache.

For the rest of my family: My siblings only mock me if I have got problems and don't even try to understand me. My sister once annoyed me until I got a panic attack. My dad is nice, but he also rather mocks me if I tell him about something or says things like ""Just get over it"" than trying to understand.

I have schizoaffective disorder and I stopped some of my medication about a month ago. For a while things were fine. I was having some mild mood swings and a little bit of paranoia but no big deal to me. I had voices a few nights but they were mild and didnt bother me much.

Last night was bad. As I lay down in bed I thought I heard my moms voice talking to me. It sounded scary and threatening and like it was coming from the hallway. And then I heard voices coming out of my phone, really loud, telling me silly things like “remember you have a doctors appointment on the 14th” (which I dont). The room started to shake and spin and all the voices were chanting over each other and I was just begging it to stop.

Im afraid its going to happen again tonight. Usually I get these bad nights in spurts. Ill get 2 nights bad, and then Ill get a night free, then Ill get 3 bad nights and so on and so on. But sometimes I can go weeks without it happening. But once it starts... it tends to continue for a while.

226,I’m really curious why suicide rates are so much higher among white and Asian communities. We are some of the least persecuted groups in society and live in some of the most developed nations so why are suicide rates disproportionately higher than in other races? Super curious and would love to hear theories/explanations.,16Aug2020,1

229,"  I’ll give you the story of what just happened. I’m sitting out on my porch petting my dog that’s on my lap. He comes out and asks to hold the dog. I said no as I was on the phone with my mom who wanted to see my dog through the camera. He then elbows me in the arm hard. Hard enough that I was genuinely in pain. So I give him a little, tap on the forehead. He then gets up and starts chasing me so in response, I went in and shut the door, as he does this all the time and I knew he would beat me. So he then starts punching the glass in the middle of the door, cracking it. So I got scared and just ran into the bathroom and locked that door. He then comes in and breaks the door off of its hinges and off of the wall and starts viciously attacking me. He then yells at me saying that I broke the door. I try explaining to my parent that I didn’t and he just keeps yelling. This is an everyday occurrence. I can’t take it anymore. I want to end my life.",16Aug2020,1

I made a bunch of different AIs, but today I improved my strategy and built AIs that have context from your existing conversation and tries to communicate conversationally rather than as a question-asnwering type chat.


The best news?


I built this particular one on The Ricky Gervais Show featuring Steve Merchant and Karl Pilkington - all the transcripts I could find ;)


http://jare.cloud/the-ricky-gervais-show-featuring-steve-merchant-and-karl-pilkington-chat-bot/


I built this one to flirt with you regardless of the time of day, or such stresses common folk have like headaches or being toooo tired...

I built this one to reference only banned books by the likes of Chomsky or dozens of banned books on the occult or current situations....

This one simply draws it's wealth of knowledge from a subsection of reddit posts, and is probably the most likely to beat the Turing test of all of them:

232,"Hey,  
I'm 26 yrs old (F) and I have depression + anxiety and I've been receiving treatment. Right now I'm only on medication, but I do see a psychologist when I can. The problem is, I feel like the medication that is prescribed for me makes me way too sleepy and drowsy to function. I have a really hard time waking up no matter when I go to sleep, sometimes I sleep for half a day or even more and still wake up tired all the time. Sometimes I just don't move at all that's how low on energy I am, I physically feel week and just can't.  
As to why I think it's the medication, well, not long ago I had to switch and while I was coming off the previous one I felt more energetic and all-around better, not a 100% sure on it, but still think it's a big factor.   
Right now I'm taking Asentra (which is basically Zoloft for the Americans), supposedly 50 mg but I halved the dosage after talking to my psychiatrist, I told her that it makes me sleepy. I had to take it in the morning before and now it has been moved to the evening. I am overweight btw and might have an eating disorder too. It's only been about a year that this has been going on and it's driving me crazy.edit: I did talk about this w my family physician and got blood tests done at least twice, they found nothing. My physician did say that I'm very slightly anaemic but said not to worry about that.

Is there anyone here who was/is in this situation? Did you find something that helped?   
Does it ever get better or should I just ask my psychiatrist if I could stop taking medication?",16Aug2020,1
233,"So, for nearly a decade now, I have been feeling just scrambled in my head, like I'm in a fog and can't find my way out.  I'm easily irritated and make mistakes.  Every doctor I've seen has told me I'm perfectly healthy. All my tests come out fine. Even had an MRI in July 2018 and it came out clear, with just an incidental note about a partially empty sella.

I gave up after having the MRI and just thought, ""Okay, I guess this is just how it is. This is what normal is.""

Well, hold the phone, because last Wednesday, I had a profound clarity. I jumped out of bed with energy, I was emotionally stable, I wanted to talk to people, I felt open and like myself for the first time in a very long time. It was like raising the blinds on a dark room and seeing the light shine on everything that was hidden away in the darkness. It felt so damn good.  All of this, despite the stress of it being the first day of school, even! (I'm a fifth grade teacher). I went to bed so happy that night, wondering what might have caused the change.  Perhaps it was that I've started eating salads more or that I started intermittent fasting a few months ago and losing 30 lbs that way has caused a switch to flip.  Whatever it was, I was so happy to have myself back again.

And then Thursday morning came.  Back in the fog. Back to having to work to focus on the task at hand. Back to the irritation and feeling constantly distracted... and I wanted to cry. I wanted to scream.  It made Wednesday feel like such a tease.  I had a glimpse into what I'm supposed to feel like and it was taken away from me just as fast.

234,"TW: cancer, illness, drug use

As a backstory, my little sister had cancer (medulloblastoma) when she was 3 years old back in 2014. I was fourteen at the time, already had problems with bullying at school and self harm and was seeing a therapist but I wasn't prescribed anything.
My parents had to move with her to Sao Paulo so she could have her treatment and so she did, thing is I don't recall most stuff about this year after I started seeing a psychiatrist and taking meds (Alprazolam, Flunitrazepam and antidepressants).

When I was 15, the beginning of the year, I began drinking and smoking cigs, weed, most stuff teens do. When I was 17 I experimented with coke and acid, never liked uppers. And when I was 18 I started taking morphine pills, snorting H and the rock bottom was IVing H. But inbetween those experiences, which I knew were bad, I took 500ug of acid and expected something out of it (ego death or idk), I just had a good trip and nothing else even though my grandma caught me in the peak but didn't turn out bad. Took shrooms, nothing again.
Last time was one year ago.

Now as of last week I started having vivid dreams about this period of my life, where my sister was sick, bald and fighting cancer and I'm afraid that I'm having some kind of flashback of those events (even though I don't remember or recall most of them, it seems like my brain suppressed those memories for good) and that my addiction or addictive personality have something to do with it. I'm 4 months sober as of right now.

If helps, I'm on Alprazolam, Flunitrazepam, Lithium, Vyvanse, Topamax and Brintellix.",16Aug2020,1
237,"About a month ago, my mental health was pretty poor. I had another ""break"" and was struggling to keep afloat in my daily life. I didn't realise it then, but my boyfriend would be my saviour. He's held onto me for the past three years, and even through multiple breakups and getting back togethers, he's been there to help me through it all. He was the one to be there and tell me I can make it through everything and anything as long as I stay here, alive and trying.

I'm happier now. I'm just as anxious and toxic to myself as before, but I shut down the negative and self-destructing thoughts now. It's worth staying on this planet, because eventually, it will get better.",16Aug2020,1

239,"Hey guys I don't really know where to start. I guess I just need some advice and direction about what to do. Basically, I am in a pretty tough place at the moment with my anxiety due to everything going on. My boyfriend is aware of this. He always tells me not to bottle it up and that he'd rather me come to him and vent then not tell him at all. However, the past few times I have had stages of panicking and I have really needed someone and gone to him. he has gotten annoyed at me and sent a message saying it's annoying and he is going to bed and then he will be active on social media and just ignore me completely which actually in turn makes me feel more anxious because I have annoyed the person I didn't want to annoy but it also makes me feel really alone and as if I honestly have nobody to distract me from how I am feeling. Maybe I am over reacting I don't know. I am never talking to him when I feel anxious ever again, but in a way I feel hurt and betrayed by the person I thought was always meant to be there for me, especially when he said he would be. But he makes me feel like I can't talk to him about things like that and the way he ignores me just really hurts me.",16Aug2020,1
240,"TW: domestic abuse, nonconsensual sex

I (23F) woke up today from a dream where I had been held basically hostage for a week or so. I’ve never been in this kind of situation in real life, although I’ve read and empathized with many stories on Reddit. I just can’t believe my imagination pieced together such a horrifically vivid situation. 

I was in a school program and lived with a roommate. I had an acquaintance who struck me as an odd person, but I’m generally always friendly to oddballs so it didn’t bother me too much. One day after out work was over, she forcefully took me to her room. Within sight of many people, she yanked me by the hand down hallways, and being as averse to confrontation as I am, I was mostly just letting it happen or acting like it was normal and we were friends. 

I’ve been questioning my sexuality recently in real life which must have translated into the dream, because most people just accepted that I was moving in with her when she kept me in her room. I couldn’t go around the common area where her roommates were without her there. She also wouldn’t let me go to the school program and would leave me trapped in her room. At one point she showed me polaroid photos of myself from the night that she had brought me there, and I realized I didn’t have any memories between walking down the halls and coming to in her bed. It was like I had blacked out everything and been on autopilot. I didn’t know if it had been a day or five days. 

I acted like everything was fine and even had sex with her and kept up appearances by acting happy, but at the first chance I had to talk to her roommates alone I asked very seriously for them to get me out of there. They got in the car and waited for me, but in that awful way that dreams do, I nearly managed to leave but my captor showed up and took me by the hand and led me back to the house. She put my finger in a contraption built into the back of a pocketknife that had serrated teeth and dug small punctures into my hand while walking like normal. 

And then the roommates gave up and parked the car. I knew it was partially my fault because I had grabbed too many things and taken too long. When they came back in, I tried to push them out and tell them to get someone to come here. Then I realized I would rather run away with nothing than be stuck with her again. I luckily woke up from this dream as the second escape attempt was starting to go poorly. 

It was truly horrifying. The feeling of being trapped, that I had put on a lie for the world and I had to keep up appearances, the realization that I couldn’t just grab my stuff and go back to my old life, the fear that people who had said they would help me were going to give up, and on top of that realizing that if I had gone with her willingly a second time, I might have lost my will to escape. 

I don’t believe this is necessarily accurate to domestic abuse experiences, just to my limited knowledge from people’s stories and whatever hidden assumptions I have. It still feels chilling to the bone, and throughout the day I’ve have a hard time feeling anything but panic and the need to freeze when it comes to mind.",16Aug2020,1
243,"What would be categorized as feelings? Like for a person of interest. I think that feelings are when you long for somebody, wether that be just wanting to be close to them, to hold them and tell them how great they are. I’ve had trouble trying to find out what feelings are, and thats the only thing i can come up with. I don’t like having feelings, especially when i just came out of a really mentally abusive relationships. I have trouble trusting anyone, even my own brother. And the thought of just being with someone in that, way again scares the fuck out of me. I have a friend, she is amazing, she saved my life a day before i was going to take it, she inspires me everyday, and she cares for me in a way no one else does. We are in a fwb relationship and its going well so far, we both really enjoy each others company and we sort of trust each other. But i think i have feelings for her, and its only been like a week.

246,"It's my first time writing about this on a forum or frankly anywhere. Basically, what I discovered a few years ago is that I have a weird brain dualism what I call the normal brain state and a rare brain state (the II state). The characteristics of the rare brain state are: it happens at a maybe 1/8 ratio as opposed to the normal state, i can recall words much quicker, im more creative, brain fog dissappears, iq pretty much is the same or the difference is not huge, the thinking is visual, i can make wording choices on the fly, much more funny thoughts etc.. My psych doctor suggested it could be mania in a bipolar disorder, but my contention is im not irrational during that state, it feels like kick starting my brain and callibrating to the right position.  One notable fact is that once I enter the ""II state"" i will stay in it no matter what till I got to sleep, then it resets and when I wake up I will be back in the normal state.",16Aug2020,1
