0,"She‚Äôs a bit older than me and honestly with her flirting here and there I thought that was cute. Then I thought about going over as she invited me a couple times. I said I was tired. 

Now I thought about calling her and asking what she wants from me but in a more polite way... hmm. How would I phrase that? I‚Äôm concerned she‚Äôs going to want to jump in the sheets with me and although I‚Äôm a horny virgin... I‚Äôm still a virgin and anxious.

I don‚Äôt know. This is silly. Anxiety isn‚Äôt good, it‚Äôs dumb I was feeling relatively fine until I started talking to her again. I tried calling her earlier but got way too anxious and worried I‚Äôd say something silly.",10Dec2020,1
1,"Yup, I‚Äôm rapist apparently according to one of my classmates. Ima explain. Today we had to go upstairs to go get some stands and chairs from some other kids who were using them. I was messing around with a stand and then these two boys (lets call them J and P) thought I was doing something inappropriate with it. J copied the movement I made with my crotch apparently (I didn‚Äôt even notice) and I asked ‚Äúwhy were you looking‚Äù. ‚Äúno, I just noticed‚Äù said P. Then J said I was humping the stand and that I was a rapist. the actual fuck. idc if that was a joke that was fucking rude and disgusting. it isn‚Äôt my fault that I was (supposedly) making movements with my crotch, I didn‚Äôt even notice! I only way someone would have noticed is if they were looking at it, which was probably what P and J were doing in the first place. lord, people at my school are such pieces of shit like I always wish something bad to happen to them but it never happens. I guess P got karma because he had a nose bleed later and apparently something broke in half (not sure what). I just want something bad to happen to J since I‚Äôm offended and annoyed at the same time because they said that. god, why can‚Äôt people mind their business and be nice like is it that hard? smh.",10Dec2020,1
2,"I use all the privacy software available but I still feel so vulnerable, so I am considering destroying and throwing out all of my tech. I have been super paranoid for a few years now, started showing symptoms of paranoia a few months after the Snowden leaks (2013), and I noticed that the level of my paranoia goes up every few weeks. All the news articles about tracking, spying etc. really take a toll on me. I have not been officially diagnosed. Did I finally go completely crazy or is it the right thing to do?

6,"I'm not sure if this goes in the questions or need support catagory, so I'm just gonna put it in question

I made a post on here before, but I don't think I actually explained it well enough if I'm honest, it was just a generic question really.

So, my friend has now given me about a month to get help and if I don't she's going to report the fact I self harm to our school (which I don't trust) - I could ask before the holidays or wait until after the Christmas Holidays which start next week. Honestly, I don't think she will she's been saying she would since she found out and hasn't done so, but everytime she mentions it I get scared that the next day I'm gonna be pulled out by safeguarding. My mum (who doesn't know about the self harm), also wants me to talk to someone who may be able to 'help'. My GP surgery is still closed due to covid and being understaffed, I can't understand the website either to be able to get in contact with them anyway, so that's out of the question.

I don't actually think I need help though. I mean, yeah I've struggled for a while now but I can't seem to work out what I've been struggling with or understand what's even wrong. Where I can't explain it, I don't see the point in getting help cause how can someone help me if I can't talk to them about it. It's just gonna be a waste of time.

However, I think whatever the hell is wrong with me, is affecting my friend as well. Whenever I tell her I'm alright, she doesn't seem to believe me, and every time it appears I'm having a bad day of sorts I'm worried it's bringing her down - it's not even bad, it's just a normal day. She's getting help currently for severe mental health issues, and I think I'm just adding to that. I didn't even want to do that, she only found out about the self harm we were talking and I accidentally kinda let it slip. 

With the self harm, I don't see it as that bad. Yeah, I first started about three years ago stopped, and then relapsed during lockdown 1.0, but there's some people who need help more than people say I do. None of the cuts are deep, and I like to think I'm pretty sensible about it as, even if I don't realise what I've done until the pain is there, I make sure it's clean and dressed straight away and keep an eye on it until it's healed incase I catch a scab or it doesn't heal properly which has never happened. Everything else I just don't know how to explain it, or understand it for that matter. 

I guess what sucks the most about it all though, is I struggle to help my friend, I struggle to help my mum for whom I'm apparently meant to be a young career for, and my siblings as well. The things I'm meant to care about, like my grades or things going on within my friendship group or within my family, I don't seem to care. I kinda just go with what I think is right, and if I'm wrong or make anything worse I admit it I do beat myself up over it cause it feel like I just don't function right, or I don't fit in with that group of people, or I've just made it 10 times worse. I have a crap memory, a crap attention span, and I don't know how to express emotion or what to feel or say at certain points, which is another thing but I don't know if it links. Even if I'm in a really good mood, I can't seem to get the balance right of how to help people. I can't just seem to do well enough at school, and I think I'm not a good person either. Sometimes I just think it's about things which happened in the past, which I honestly think I should have gotten over by now, it shouldn't affect me like this. It makes no sense.

If I'm honest, I don't see why people would bother. I mean, how can they do anything when I can't explain it. Besides, other people have a lot worse problems than me, they'd probably tell me to just deal with it. And that's what I'm trying do, I'm trying to sort myself out without any help so I don't waste people's time. But how can I convince my mate that I am alright, and I am getting there slowly, even if I'm only a few days clean? How am I meant to convince my mum that I don't need help and I'll be fine? How the hell am I even meant to help myself when I can't understand it?",10Dec2020,1

8,"I recently got a new job.. At an actual salon. All this time I've been working at home to avoid being around alot of people. All I could really handle was one client at a time and no one looking over my shoulder. One year in therapy and meds, I am finally ready to go back into world. I feel confident and motivated, soemthing I've never felt. 

I even got the days I wanted. I did my first 3 days.. Everything was great. I'm supposed to go in tomorrow and I get the call today. She just asked me to come in to pick up my pay and collect my stuff. She apologized and said I'd like to keep you but I can't afford it. said she'd call me in the future. WTF??!

I just said ok and hung up. I needed time to collect my thoughts before I let my emotions take over and do the talking for me but when I arrived at the salon she was busy and she just quickly handed me an envelope and walked away. 

Now I'm here making up scenarios and reasons as to why. It's like my fears come true.  Fear of failure and just trying to come up with reasons why it's my fault. Thing is I know I didn't do anything wrong. I know covid has business on the brink of closure but I can't help but feel down on myself.",10Dec2020,1
9," You would think that the difference is overt, but the more I learn about people and mental health, the more I realize that the lines are super blurred. 

**TL;DR  Have had a string of bad luck running into toxic environments and situations in my life, recently diagnosed with BPD (a heavily stigmatized disorder with a lot of victims) in addition to the already knowing about my anxiety and PTSD, and now feel like every single toxic person and situation I‚Äôve run into, was just my warped abuser mindset and I was the abusive or difficult one the entire time.**

A lot in my life, I notice that I end up in objectively toxic environments, with friends that bully me (calling me ugly, or disgusting, not wanting to be seen in in public with me, ignoring me, telling me I‚Äôm stupid, having me do their assignments, excluding me, isolating me), teachers that bully me (revealing private information in front of the class, calling me names, reading my diary/ personal notes to the class, excluding me, blowing up and yelling at me/being super disrespectful for simple things, creating false narratives around me and making those narratives public knowledge), mean coworkers (at my workplace, gossip is dialed up to 100, and everyone talks about everyone, but I notice I‚Äôm targeted the most \[ignored, talked about, called names, demeaned\] because I have dissociative and anxious episodes where I‚Äôm prone to making mistakes which makes me even more of a nervous wreck). I was sexually harassed when I was 5/6 by an older man for months, and at 15, I had a strange, two-way exploitative relationship (not dating) with someone 11 years my senior. Don't even get me started on my home life.

  My mom is extremely abusive. She has said horrible things, done horrible things, is a horrible person. But after she hit 50, she‚Äôs extremely friendly all of a sudden, but I only meet her change with a cold, sometimes callous, disinterest. My mom had a physically abusive childhood. I know it‚Äôs possible for victims, or past victims to be abusive. We see this happen a lot in child abuse cases, but it still doesn‚Äôt excuse their behavior. But now that my mother is very nice, I haven‚Äôt adjusted and am quick to snap at her, try to spend as little time around her as possible and can say callous things (never as bad as things she has said though).

 I‚Äôve always known that I can be difficult, I have extremely bad anxiety, it is common for me to cycle through manic, depressive and dissociative episodes, but one thing that I‚Äôve always thought of myself as, was a nice person. Everyone I get to know well usually says I‚Äôm nice, even the friends and workmates that have bullied me. They say things like they‚Äôve never seen my angry, that I‚Äôm quick to help and that I have a nice personality. 

But recently, I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, I previously theorized, I was just extremely anxious and mildly bipolar with a hint of paranoia and adhd. But borderline fits a lot better and encompasses all those things. But BDP is a cluster B illness in the same strain as narcissistic personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder (psychopathy and sociopathy) among others. There‚Äôs a forum on reddit dedicated as a support group for people that have friends/family/spouses with BDP. People with BDP are known for being abusive and toxic people, socially, it‚Äôs seen as bipolar‚Äôs scary cousin. I have seen a post saying that the stigma around BPD shouldn‚Äôt go away because of how bad the people with it are.

And the more I read up on people that deal with pwBDP, the more I feel like every single bad relationship I‚Äôve had with a person is my fault. I used to already feel like that, but now it‚Äôs worse. Are people being mean to me because I did something to warrant it? What if I‚Äôm just the delusional abuser that thinks I‚Äôm the victim. People that have dealt with pwBPD say that they always believe they‚Äôre the victim. No one just has bad luck like that? To run into so many toxic environments one after the next. And there‚Äôs that quote, that when everyone around you is the problem, it‚Äôs likely that the problem is you. And I say that these environments are objectively toxic, but perhaps I‚Äôm just interpreting it that way because that‚Äôs what abusers do, paint themselves as the one in the right.

I know I can be paranoid, I try to reassure myself it‚Äôs in my head, I have a lot of thoughts and actions that align with BPD but it never leaks into my social life since I'm more prone to going mute and being avoidant than acting out (with people outside my family anyway). People say that I‚Äôm super spacey, but I‚Äôve never gotten called other typical BDP traits.",10Dec2020,1

Last time I saw a therapist it was horrible so I was scared to seek help. I know it‚Äôs trial and error but I had so much anxiety about trying again and the song and dance of it all...well last week I got the courage to call and set up a psych appointment. They were able to get me in THIS WEEK. 

She said I was running on such a high baseline of anxiety, it was almost like I was in a constant manic state. Definitely have depression and some PTSD. She suggested maybe BPD but needs to get to know me know before making a formal diagnosis. I have so much relief. I told her I smoke weed ‚Äì she said just cut back to evens until I‚Äôm stable and then I can do what I want after that. She actually cared about getting me stable and functional again.

She has that strict misogynistic mindset that women are supposed to stay inside of the house and clean . I have a brother and literally all he does is clean.

17,"Hi, just like the title says, I‚Äôve been struggling. 

It‚Äôs been a while since I last self-harmed, but the issue is, it‚Äôs still on my mind. I‚Äôve never really known how to talk about this subject but I‚Äôm gonna try my best.

Self-harm was weird, I felt better while I did it but i always felt like shit afterwards. Now I‚Äôm finding myself thinking about it more frequently, what it looked like, how it felt, I‚Äôm so tempted to do it again, just to feel it. Just because I know I could if I wanted too.

What‚Äôs stopping me from doing it is I know I‚Äôll regret it if I do, as-well as fear of my boyfriend‚Äôs reaction if he saw it. My boyfriend had a panic attack the first time he saw it, that‚Äôs what made me stop in the first place.

I‚Äôve been seeing a councillor for a few months and there‚Äôs a part of me that doesn‚Äôt want to tell her about it. I have it written down in my journal but I can‚Äôt bring myself to tell her.

It started with one person, and then another, and another and another. They're all people I know in real life. I started to resent them and feel envious of them. I used to be so confident in myself, so happy, so content. I don't know what happened? Did I wake up and realize I'm actually not all that or is society in general getting to me just like how it's getting to everyone. You know, making people feel like they're less than, never good enough, always comparing, never content, etc. Anyways, It makes me feel so horrible. Makes me feel like a failure and a loser. On top of that, I also feel lonely, but feel uncomfortable changing my lifestyle. I have friends that I don't see. One of my friends invited me over next week and I said I'd go. Other than that, It's literally once in a blue moon. I got used to being an introvert and a homebody. It makes me feel like I'm wasting my youth away. I'm in my mid 20s and don't really remember any amazing, crazy events. I have always enjoyed the type of lifestyle I had, until recently I started feeling bad.

Whenever I hold myself accountable, be productive, take care of myself: skincare, workout, eat healthy, etc I feel good about myself and stuff. Negative thoughts get less and stuff, but still they'll come around at some point. I'm honestly thinking of deleting social media, but yet again, that's the only place I can actually talk to people since I don't see people or anything. Other than my family.

I know this post sounds confusing, but I don't really know i just feel like I'm suffocating for some reason. I feel like shit, and I'm just scared, even scared of changing the things that dislike for example being more social although I'm outgoing and can make friends easily, and have friends.

24,"Well, the title really says most of it.

Long story short(er): I'm 22, and for the better part of my life I've been on and off medication and in and out of therapy. We've known I was mentally ill since a young age (under 10 years old.) I stopped taking all medication and therapy for a few years. I started again about 2 years ago at the insistence of my then boyfriend. Therapy has been on and off since then, and I haven't been since May of this year, but the meds have been constant, and I'm on new ones every month or two because they never work. I've been diagnosed with depression, generalized anxiety, and borderline personality disorder. I also struggle with an eating disorder.

At my last two visits with my doctor, she's really stressed that I need to go back to therapy and also see a psychiatrist who can prescribe better medication for me. At this most recent visit, she made me promise to put myself first and to go back to therapy and see the psychiatrist before the new year.

But I really, really don't want to. The medication almost never helps, and when it does, the side effects (ie. weight gain, headaches, etc) aren't worth it. Therapy doesn't help either. I'm extremely introverted, and I hate talking to people, especially about my problems. But more than anything I just... don't care, and part of me is afraid that who I am will change. I'm fine with who I am, even if others aren't. I'm okay with how I feel. Even if everything is negative and things suck, I don't necessarily feel like I'm suffering. 

I tried to use the work and college excuse to get out of it, but my doctor said she'd even contact my job and work with my boss to accommodate me and make sure I don't get fired or written up. She also said that she wants the notes from the therapist sent to her. I promised her that I would go and I'll feel really guilty for not (as well as probably getting chewed out by her at my next appointment...)

But I just really don't want to. It's not that I'm afraid, or hopeless, or don't feel like I'm worth it, I just... don't want to, like the same way you feel when you just don't want to go into work. I don't know why I can't keep living like this when I think I'm doing okay. I feel lost about it, and I'm dreading it, and I don't know what to do.",10Dec2020,1

After reading books, and manga, watching shows and anime‚Äôs, there has been one feeling that has allways come back, it‚Äôs almost as if longing very hard for something is the best way I could describe it, but at the same time I feel almost happy. this feeling comes after I‚Äôve watched an episode of a show or read a chapter of a book, which has a expansive universe and so mush to explore. these things include Harry Potter, How to train your dragon (weirdly), My Hero Academia, and now sword art online. The only pattern between them is that they all have a female love interest, and that‚Äôs what I think, among other things causes the feeling. I think that the feeling of longing I think is caused by a mix of wanting to be with the people in the book, and wanting to be like the main character, wanting to be loved, wanting to be viewed as a hero, but above all what I think it is, is that I want to be in love. Even as I type that it sounds creepy, but that‚Äôs the only explanation I can think of. This answer doesn‚Äôt quite seem right to me though. Has anybody else encountered this feeling as well? Thanks for reading.",10Dec2020,1

Do you guys have any idea how to get out of that mindset, and maybe what to even tell the therapist in the first session? I'm really worried I'll just waste their time and at the end they'll just tell me that I'm just overthinking things and to go home and just deal with it.

From day to day, still, I struggle with this, but I know that self awareness is the beginning stages of healing. Watching thoughts, being present in the moment and going on offence, rather than dwelling why I am still in the same spot, allowing those negativities to consume my body leading to self numbing etc., is growth all in itself.

&amp;#x200B;

Its enough. I have realized that we all get to a point where we say to ourselves, ""Its enough. I'm tired of these same feelings coming from the same person, with the same mindset, that won't change"". We must take ourselves out of that situation. It is difficult, I completely agree, especially when it is family. The thing though is, we don't have to spend our time around them, even if we live in the same house. Its interesting how our mind will then play the game on us, ""oh but you're being rude and disrespectful, and lonely by ""secluding"" yourself, is it because you are anxious? depressed? is this more than just another person?"", our **mind** lives in two areas, **only.**

&amp;#x200B;

It lives in the past with dwelling and connecting with how we felt then, since we have already lived through that situation prior, **or**, in fearing the future and the unknowns, which 97% of the time will have different occurrences then what we expect. Releasing expectations. Another thing I am embracing on releasing but thats a discussion for another day.

I have seen lots of posts on r/depression and similar subs where people mention their struggle with mental health, but also they mention they have a significant other or spouse. Also a thing that seems to be pretty common among people who struggle with mental health is loneliness, lack of physical affection, or not having someone to talk to. Someone to talk to and physical affection would most likely be very important things that are present in a healthy relationship with a significant other.

I do not have clinical depression or anxiety so I am aware there is lots I do not understand. I have struggled with mental health a fair amount though and in every situation having someone to talk to and physical affection would have at least given me the strength to keep going.

48,"So I've been dealing with anxiety past couple years, mainly panic disorder and I've been having Agoraphobia but that's a lot better at the moment although I don't go out much due to covid anyway so it's not always easy to tell.

My question really, is how do you tell if things are making you genuinely anxious and need dealing with or if it's just 'normal' nerves. I'm not used to anxiety with life decisions etc as I've been unemployed and basically at home hiding away and trying to cope with it while I've had it bad.

I'm starting to try and piece my life together and I'm finding some things are making me feel that wave of panic. But it's like, is this something I need to take into account or just push through it and 'ignore it'.

One example is volunteering somewhere - I know it's something I'm gonna be nervous about and it won't be easy after finding it hard just leaving the house a few months back, but if it's going to cause too much anxiety then do I fall back, try a smaller step or do I accept its just normal nerves and carry on to get past it?????

Another example is that I've been looking for a relationship lately but just having a good online conversation with someone gave me brief panic and I can't tell if it's from the fear of having to do something that might cause anxiety or being with a stranger and not knowing how they'd react if I panicked, or just normal nerves around change and this will only be my second relationship...

I just want to try and get on with my life, and I'm going slow to respect my mental health but I don't want to be stuck in a hole if it's just because of some nerves that will always be there. 

Hope this makes sense....

50,"For about the past year, I've been collecting disability insurance. This plan is through work, and I'm lucky enough that it's a government workplace so it's ultimately government funded. The insurance company only administers the program. 

However, like most other disability insurance plans, the definition of disability changes after 2 years. At first, the criteria is that I can't perform my own occupation. After that, I have to be deemed unable to perform ANY occupation that I'm reasonably qualified for and that pays at least 2/3 of my pre disability pay. 

So... I guess it's something to think about. I'd love to be able to work a great job that I find interesting and that works with my disability, but I've never found it. For 10 years, I've struggled with severe depression. I probably also have ADHD as well but nobody wants to do an assessment on an adult. I had my first serious episode about 10 years ago and went on disability for just over a year. Because I was no longer working in a stressful, horrible environment, I improved gradually and participated in a return to work program. This program was extremely frustrating and slow. I spent 2 years getting bounced around between dull, unskilled administrative assistant type jobs, despite my repeated offers to fund my own education and qualify for better positions. 

That whole process took a toll on my mental health. Eventually they found a permanent position (dumped me in the first one they could find is more accurate), and I worked there for 5 years. My depression got progressively worse over this time. I desperately tried to apply to other jobs, but I only got one very temporary one, which sent me back despite my pleading. I got worse and worse until I just couldn't do it anymore and went on disability for the second time. 

My claim was approved easily, because of the mountain of medical and workplace evidence. My medical report was from a treating psychiatrist, not a family doctor. They were told about my ultimately failed return to work and difficulty with most positions I worked. By now, I've been on over 20 different psychiatric medications, had a failed course of TMS, seen 12 counselors, 3 psychiatrists, emergency hospital treatment, intensive outpatient therapy and I'm barely functioning right now. In fact, it's because of an obscure old drug called Nardil that I'm able to go about my day at home without trying to kill myself. 

So there's the thing. Do I try to stay on disability beyond 2 years? Is it full time work that was way too much for me to handle? Do I try to return to work again, but this time with even more medical restrictions and accommodations in place? 

I don't know what to do. Work gives me purpose, but so far, it's also destroyed my mental health and nearly killed me.",10Dec2020,1

61,"I‚Äôm 17 [F] and I have borderline personality disorder. My teenage years have been filled with ups and downs and lots of hell in between. 

Recently, I took the initiative to make a friend (which I hardly ever do). Ever since then, we have been talking every single day. I thought we had been talking since October, but it was actually November. We haven‚Äôt even been talking for a whole month yet. 

He‚Äôs a really nice guy. Super sweet. And we get along so well. I feel super comfortable with him and I haven‚Äôt felt like this in years. I see him becoming a best friend of mine. 

However, I feel like I‚Äôm going to hurt him. 

At the beginning of High School, I only had one friend. We had known each other since the 4th grade and had been best friends ever since. I lost all my friends in middle school and was severely bullied. My ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù‚Äôtook advantage of this and made me depend on him. Discarding me, and only using me when he felt necessary. At the end of 10th grade, we split ways. He befriended a girl who used to bully me in elementary school and made me want to [TW] commit (I was in the 4th grade). I told him this, but he told me to get over it.

Ever since then, I made another ‚Äúgood friend‚Äù but she randomly ghosted me out of nowhere and it hurt so bad. She talked badly about me behind my back too. 

Additionally, I had a really bad friend ‚Äúbreak up‚Äù in 8th grade which almost made me [TW] commit numerous times. You get the gist.

I haven‚Äôt had a friend in a very long time. I only make shallow connections with people and stay hyper vigilant so that way‚Äîthe first sign they show, I can leave them. 

I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm really scared. He‚Äôs such a sweet guy and I can really see him being my best friend. However, I feel like I annoy him (even though he always texts me every morning when he wakes up and he texts first). We share the same interests and have such meaningful conversations (like best friends do).

But I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm going to hurt him with my instability. I‚Äôve found myself detaching from him because it hasn‚Äôt even been a full month yet, and I feel myself getting attached to him. I‚Äôm scared he might get tired of me one day and he might leave me. I can‚Äôt handle another heartbreak.

I haven't spoken to her in at least five years. I dont know whats causing them. All the online articles refer to recent breakups, not this. I worry about my mental health deteriorating from them. Even of it doesn't, they are not helpful to it.

73,"Recently applied to a school I've been dreaming about for 2 years. I put my all into it. I worked hard to prepare materials for this application, without the help of my school. I worked out a budget plan for crawling out of loan debt afterwards. I finally turned in my application for this particular school in November, and my backup schools should follow in January. 

But after I turned in my first application, I stopped thinking about everything. I stopped thinking about my future and dreaming of my school experience. My brain won't let me. And now I'm scared that I don't want to go anymore and that I'm making the wrong decision too quickly. 

For more context, the particular degree I'm looking for is pretty financially risky, but I've pursued it up until now because I couldn't see myself happy any other way. I often get the ""what's your backup plan"" question and my insecurity makes it more difficult to think clearly on these things.

But I can't feel anything in regards to my application and I can't bring myself to apply to any more schools. I'm confused as to why my brain is so damn avoidant.

I never brought it up to him or anyone really. It has been five years and I still have nightmares where I am trying to get away from him? This has gotten so bad that I am in the works of seeing a therapist for these feelings.

80,"You know how you have a school issued computer or iPad? And on that computer or iPad you  are signed into a school issued google account? And that school issued google account has limitations, like how you can't go to certain websites or look up certain things?  Well all of that surveillance is for a reason. The reason is school shootings. The reason is suicide. The reason is self harm. The reason is bullying. Now these seem like great reasons to watch a kid's internet presence on school accounts and devices. Well in recent years schools don't stop at school owned and issued devices and accounts. As school shootings and self harm get worse schools do more and more to prevent it. So. Let's talk mental health. First of all mental health in itself is a lot to deal with. Taking care of your mental health is hard. Really hard. School makes it hard because you want to have good grades for yourself or your parents or whoever takes care of you. Friends make it hard because there is constant drama going on. (To be fair friends-if they're good ones-help you get through the bad stuff) Parents make it hard because they're always pressuring you to be perfect. Whatever your specific problem is, everyone has trouble with their mental health now and again. Now how does this all tie back in to the well known fact that our schools are watching us? Well I'm gonna get to that. So started back where I was, our schools watch the accounts they give us in order to keep us from looking at anything that would be considered inappropriate. Now though they're going much farther to prevent school shootings and self harm and bullying. Schools have started monitoring things like student's private accounts, social media accounts, and online messages to friends. This is firstly a HUGE invasion a privacy. They can monitor and regulate however much they want on the school accounts but they have no right to mess with the private accounts of any student. Of course the goal is still to keep kids safe online and in real life. More than 50% of students get bullied online and girls are more likely to be targeted. More that 900 lives have been saved because of online surveillance but is it worth it when you measure the cost? As a result of online surveillance kids get used to having no privacy. What do you think that will do to them when they are adults as well as future generations? Plus with all the online surveillance there's bound to be false positives. A student joking with a friend in a private message could be flagged and that student would be left embarrassed and confused. Or if a student is doing research on their private account for a paper. Let's say it's on Christopher Columbus. Researching Christopher Columbus could bring up some huge red flags. Columbus was known to have raped many Native Americans during his time in the Americas, doing research on that could a get a student in huge trouble for doing the homework that was assigned to them. Plus even the surveillance system is racist.  Students of color are being flagged more often than white students and females of color even more so. What about a queer student who is scared to research their sexuality because they know they're being watched. Is that really fair to them? So, as I said before this does have to do with mental health. Think about it. The goal of online surveillance is to keep students safe in and out of school from things like school shootings, self harm, suicide, bullying. And what is the cause of all of those things? You got it! Bad mental health. Students with depression sometimes commit self harm or suicide or they bully other students which in some situations makes that student depressed. Depression of course isn't the only cause of these things but it is a big one so I'm  using it as an example. The schools aren't really dealing with actual problem through online surveillance. They are only dealing with the symptoms. Instead of putting all that money into online surveillance schools could spend it on councilors and educating students about mental health. Many kids in schools are scared they'll get made fun of for going to talk to a councilor so they don't do it. Making schools more open about mental health would help solve the problem instead of causing more to stop parts of the problem.",10Dec2020,1

92,"I am a 25 year old former/semi drug abuser and I have failed to do anything with my life. Ever since the 6th grade I would have severe depressive episodes that would make me shut down and withdraw to just about everything and everyone. It mostly stemmed from percieved inferiorty I felt in comparison to peers and friends, I became paranoid to the point where I thought people were saying things behind my back even if they were not. But that is all history and no longer truly relevant with my life. I only mention this because I resorted to using opiates to counter my depressive moods so I would not be in any danger of wanting to commit suicide. My first high could only be described as mystical. Granted I never felt that high again but I didn't care, all i cared about was that I could feel up and not down anymore no matter how ""mild"" the high felt. Any fake happy high is worlds better than real depression. For awhile my troubles seemed to be solved, until my parents got divorced because of their drug use (I got my drugs from my own home this way because my parents were apparently using since before I was born. Don't ask me how I didn't notice this because even I can't believe it.) I won't go into the details of the divorce to not turn this into a big essay since most people won't read it then, but things got bad to the point where my father was sectioned 39 or whatever you call that legal thing and I was taken to live with my mother and soon to be step family. My mother and step family did their best to keep me away from opiates. I never had physical withdrawals because I did my best to go a few days in between using but I did have powerful mood swings. Time past and I certainly did not feel any better. I would take whatever I could, Benadryl, Kratom, Alcohol, fucking anything. A good day for me is when I am at home at night high on 15 or so benadryl (I build up a tolerance so thats not much for me) or maybe just on a ounce or so of kratom because thats the only thing that stops me from wanting to lock myself in the garage with the car running with the windows down.

This really eats me up inside, I feel like a monster. I‚Äôve been sleeping with a loaded gun by my bedside for months and I sometimes I want to use it on others, sometimes I just want to use it on myself. I need to know if others feel this too.

I feel like I'm taking the medicine for no reason.

He cared so much about me and expected the same from me whereas I did not require wht he gave me and also didnt    return it . This made him resentful and he started asking me to do things . And while I did it he felt even worse causing I was doing it cause he asked me to. My ideology is that people can do as they wish since it's their personal freedom . Whereas he believes that we have to always sacrifice to prove our love . It was the extreme of both ends. This created tension in both of us and we soon started breaking out .
Anyway the friendship is no more. This is where another one of our mutual friends come in to the story .
She is in love with him and listens to everything he has to say and supports him. 
This is where I need help. 
Seeing her  take care of him and tell him things like I love you for who u are makes me feel like a bad person.
It makes me feel that it was somehow my fault only .

Thank you all for the advice and support.

So she and I did talk about it and it took a lot of convincing but I'm going in January.

Thank you all for the advice and support.

So she and I did talk about it and it took a lot of convincing but I'm going in January.

She did believe the stigma that mental health support=medication and it'll lead me on to harder drugs and I'll end up a junkie but I tried to tell her that it's not about medication.

130,"I have been dealing with my depression for years now. Been on meds for it since I was 16 and they have helped tremendously. But every once in a while, I go back into the dark place and when I do, it gets very dark, very quickly.

It used to be a sadness I could manage most days but now when it hits, I find myself immediately jumping to horrible thoughts. I start looking at inpatient programs because I become scared of my own brain.

I just want to know why?????",10Dec2020,1
132,"I don't think I've ever expressed emotion in a healthy way. When I was younger, I worked myself so hard that I never had time to consider my feelings. When I had any down time, I was extremely self-loathing. I engaged in eating in secret and purging most of my food but never quite bingeing. I engaged in behaviors in an attempt to deliberately be caught as a person with an eating disorder. I read about ""safe purging"" online and tried to deliberately do the opposite so that I would have the best chances of hurting myself or dying. I tried very hard to find ipecac. I couldn't. 

Now, I am about to graduate college and am less busy due to COVID. Since the start of the lockdown, I have had several ""anxiety attacks"" (not sure if that‚Äôs actually what it is) or something where I panic and freak out crying (my boyfriend is so sweet in helping me) and then I become completely apathetic and feel as though I am not real. I cannot do anything. I just sort of stare. I get an intense urge to bash my head into the wall or bite my lips raw or scratch up my arms. Sometimes all of my muscles tense up and I'm just in an unmovable fetal position. When I was younger, I prided myself on how tough and thick-skinned I was. Now, I am hypersensitive to any conflict. I see my reflection and feel visceral loathing. I am frightened by my reflection and it feels like I am two versions of myself: one is angry and the other is cowering. I hate myself. I think that I'm empathetic but I'm actually very horrible and judgmental. I think that I am strong but I'm submissive and stupid. Whenever I get drunk I talk about my desire to end my own life. That doesn't happen when I'm sober though. I don‚Äôt think I actually want to kill myself, but I don‚Äôt know if I would mind dying. Is this normal stress?",10Dec2020,1

138,"TW: attempted s*icide (I'm censoring since idk if that gets blocked)


So for some context: 

When I (17f) was 7 my brother attempted to commit s*icide (he was stopped) and that left me with some pretty big issues since I was the one who found him. 

Since then it's been generally accepted that my role in my family &amp; friends group is that of the support, I'm there for everyone and put them first (not the healthiest I know) 

I've dealt with depression for several years, I didn't want to be medicated because I was scared of missing doses and of the side affects (I'm incredibly forgetful and regularly forget my ADD meds). It may not be the best reason but it made sense at the time. 

I've had my lows and while I wanted to never tried to do anything because the memory from when I was 7 and how horrible it would be for those around me made me keep going. 

Flash foreword to a few days ago when my boyfriend tried to kill himself and is now hospitalized. I'm not very close to his friends (those who know) so I can't get support from them (I'm better at giving support as mentioned earlier). 

And it's kind of feeling like the straw that broke the camel's back, I spiraled and I haven't really been able to function properly (get out of bed, eat, drink etc) only the things I have to or can't get out of. 

I'm doing my best to be there for him and support his recovery, as well as I know that once he gets out he can't know how badly I spiraled. 


But I'm worried I'm making this about me, that rather then focusing on him and those around him I'm too focused on myself and my issues?

I should probably mention I have and am currently been going to therapy but have some trouble opening up honestly because I get anxious when I have to articulate myself vocally

139,"Ever since high school I have felt the lack of desire to do anything. Over the past 5 years I have slowly lost all desire to do anything I enjoyed before and now I simply do not see the purpose of doing them at all. The only thing that keeps me going is money and keeping up my image. I am unmotivated to study, but I spend every day working and studying deep into the night just for the promise of a career with a high salary. Knowing myself I'm not going to spend most and  live as if I were on minimum wage, so this passion isn't rooted in materialism. Money is simply the only thing I can quantify progress with, so I guess it is the easiest thing to work towards.

I'm not entirely sure what has happened to me. When I was younger I used to be one of the most social kids and was motivated to learn just because I was interested in how things worked. Now I have dropped most of my friendships, and I believe subconsciously I only kept those around that I knew would be of use (i.e. people who are intelligent, entrepreneurial, etc.). I used to value my friendships so highly, but for some reason I can't seem to care about people I have known for almost my entire life anymore.

I first noticed that something was off when a close family friend that I have known all my life died. I just couldn't feel anything. Obviously I would like for him to still be alive, but I did not feel sadness. I feel like I have just gotten colder and more of a shell of a person the older I have gotten. I put on a different mask for different people I meet, just showing them who they want to see. I show my family a happy and humorous guy, I show my professors and inquisitive and serious student, I show frat guys a guy who's chill and just wants to live life, etc. I feel like I don't even know who I am anymore and I have lost the person I used to be. I have no idea how to get my old self back, or if maybe this is just the person I am now. I guess I'm just asking for any advice or if anyone else has experienced something similar to this. Please don't suggest I see a therapist, I was raised in a loving environment, haven't had any traumatic experiences, and am not interested in talking to one. Thanks in advance.",10Dec2020,1

She‚Äôs currently looking for help online, but the free services are incredibly limited. She has a little bit of money put aside, though I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs not a lot.

I don't know anything about myself. What I like, dislike, if I genuinely like it or if I'm doing it because I think someone thinks it's cool.

In junior high school (13-16) i realized how shit life is. I was annoying to everybody. To clarify, i have always had friends, still the same friends from elementary. First year was over, summer time. I cried every single day because my friends were chilling outside without me (probably could have chilled with them). I thought of suicide all the time. I promised myself i would kill myself just before i would have to go to the military (~19yo).

Now im 18. I had couple years where i didnt have suicidal thoughts, i kinda enjoyed life. At the age of 16 when i went to trade school, the feeling came back. Its been like it since. About 8 months ago i finally started therapy. Got diagnosed with ADHD and depression. 

I, myself thought about ADHD and told about it. Im still very unsure of if even i have ADHD. What i just fake it. What if im just so lazy. 

Now my school got put on hold because i just cant do anything, i feel so much anxiety just being in school. I think about suicide everyday. I try to think of simple fast ways of just ending it. I want to have a moment where i wont think of what im doing and will just do it. I know i will hurt my family but i just cant anymore. I really cant.

I dont care if the future will be better. Everybody tells me to just wait and see for the future. Its what i did  at 13yo, now im 18 and i still feel like total shit.

163,"I don‚Äôt really know where to start but I‚Äôm just going to keep typing so maybe it will be long. I‚Äôm sorry.

I don‚Äôt feel so good recently. I can‚Äôt focus on anything and things seem so overwhelming. I have 3 small kids who I solo parent mostly (my husband lives in a neighbouring country for work but comes home every 3 months for a week. The kids are 1,3 and 5).
I am able to take care of the kids and make them food and bring them to the park but I don‚Äôt feel capable of doing anything deeper. I want to read to them and play games but I just don‚Äôt have the mental energy. I feel I‚Äôm on auto pilot.

I have paperwork to do but I can‚Äôt do it. So it‚Äôs been left there. It‚Äôs all feeling a lot.

But going back to May-Oct and I was feeling pretty great. I was doing so much with the kids. Loads of homeschooling. I signed up myself for online language lessons and was doing so well. We had a weekly schedule and we stuck to it. My home was always so tidy and clean. Now it‚Äôs in disarray. I barely can wash a dish.
I had gotten into fitness and was running laps at the park while the kids played (empty park...Covid). I really had so much energy. Was going to bed at 12-1am every night and waking at 5 and feeling fine. 
I did fantasise a lot about cheating on my husband. I never did anything about it. Just fantasies. I think I‚Äôm just lonely. I also really craved cocaine. It‚Äôs been over 10 years since I last used it. I don‚Äôt know why I wanted it so much. Oh I also found it hard to eat so ended up at the doctor with malnutrition. This is fine now and I eat fine now. But just thought I would mention it.

But back in March/April and I felt kinda sorta how I do now. Except I was really hyper focused then on one issue and would spend most of my time crying and researching the issue.
Which was my home. We live in an apartment and I because really obsessed with moving to a house as I felt it would solve all of the problems I was having as the kids would have a garden to play in.

These days I don‚Äôt really know if I feel sad. I don‚Äôt feel happy. Maybe empty. But also not me. 
But then I think back to the time when I was 17 and was having a hard time and dropped out of high school. I talked to a therapist who ended up calling my mother to discuss a possible diagnoses. I never found out what that was though as my mum just got angry and told me I was doing it for attention and feeling sorry for myself (I went back to high school a year later and graduated).

I don‚Äôt know if right now I‚Äôm just overthinking super normal things and being silly. Maybe I just want attention? 
I don‚Äôt know.
I don‚Äôt know what to do next.

For now I just kinda live on auto pilot, avoid social media and watch a lot of TV. TV is a nice way to escape myself.

I‚Äôm also not really sure what this post is for. I guess I just needed to vent my feelings. Due to Covid a lot of friends are having a hard time and I don‚Äôt want to burden them with my thoughts. They have enough to deal with without me being annoying .

Thank you so much if you read it all &lt;3",10Dec2020,1
164,My Dad recently called me a people pleaser and I dont really know why it's bad. Making sure that everyone else's days are going wonderfully gives me happy hands just thinking about it. But he was yelling and being really serious about it. It cant be that bad can it?,10Dec2020,1
165,"After so long of suffering with anxiety and depression, I finally got help. 
A few weeks ago, I had a bit of a breakdown where I could not stop sobbing for about a week straight. I wanted to stop and quit everything. A dear person in my life gave me the push to get help, and came with me to support. 
I‚Äôm now on medication and receiving counselling. I took a few weeks off of work, and I started going outside everyday, and exercising. 
I‚Äôm mad at myself that I didn‚Äôt get help sooner, but I thought that I wasn‚Äôt bad enough or that I wasn‚Äôt worth wasting resources on. I realize now that I can‚Äôt do the things that I‚Äôve been doing without taking care of myself. I have to challenge the bad thoughts when they happen, and even tell myself out loud. 
I know I have a long way to go and that there will be setbacks, but I know now that there are many people who care about me and want me healthy.

170,"I gained 15 kgs (33 pounds) since last year. With covid I started moving less since I am working from home and gym closed, and I started smoking weed almost every day which led to a nasty munchies habit. 

Now here I am, fatter and self conscious. And it makes me anxious. And when I‚Äôm anxious I eat. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do because the idea of restricting myself gives me anxiety, and I feel like I won‚Äôt be able to lose those 15kgs just by eating healthier and exercising, I feel like I need to cut quantities drastically so I can have a fast outcome and then I‚Äôll be able to start eating normally again.

I suppose it's the million dollar question. I'll not go into lengthy details but this last year its been one thing after another.

*my dad died
*I had a miscarriage
* I fell and damaged my teeth, 9 months later I'm still in awful pain and waiting on hospital referrals. 
*I have a stomach ulcer from painkillers (above) 
*I'm diabetic and I've had to give up my career aspirations on medical advice because it was making me ill (cake maker)
*husband was under threat of redundancy for months, thankfully didn't happen but it took its toll as he's in a very well paying job and is the sole earner.
* My 16 year old dog died, I'd had him from a puppy and it's expected at that age but heartbreaking
*My nan has cancer

176,"I'm a 19 year old female. I'm not sure how to cover everything but basically 9 months ago, my personality changed completely. I used to be super proud of my golden heart. I helped others and showed so much love even though being bullied in middle school made me quieter and more reserved. I was very happy with my boyfriend I'd been with for 4 months at the time (a year as of last month). I don't know if corona virus sending us into lock down played a part since we were forced to stay home for months and I missed prom and graduation but I feel like the real source is bigger. I was suddenly very cold, like a switch went off in my brain. I began to hate being touched by my boyfriend, I didn't even want to be nice to him! I wanted to be in my room alone either sleeping or playing video games but would still enjoy being with my mom. I actually preferred my bf to stay at his house and just text me, which is not like me at all! I have always been a bit clingy and loved affection. He is the same way. Eventually I fell deeper and deeper into this, I could barely stand him and didn't even really want to text him but still did. I questioned if I loved him even though he did nothing wrong and I loved him very much before this weird stuff began.

He told me he could deal with it because he loved me but I could always tell it bothered him and I don't blame him. I began to realize that the questioning my love for him and wanting to be angry and mean all the time felt less like me changing and more like I was fighting myself or fighting a mind that was not mine. Like my brain was telling me ""You don't love him"" and ""You hate everything"" but the person I always before was saying ""No that's not true"" but no matter what I tried to convince myself of, I couldn't shake the disgust of being touched or the dislike for everything. It truly pains me and I've thought maybe I had borderline personality disorder but this has lasted 9 months now. 

My boyfriend had told me if I felt like there was someone who could make me happier, I should find that person but I started to feel like I know for sure that I won't feel any different with anyone else. I also am absolutely terrified of being alone and feeling abandoned despite always wanting to be left alone... I know it's contradictory. One minute I go, ""Nah me and my bf shouldn't be together because I don't trust him anymore (I'll get into why) and don't even like him around me"". Then the next minute I go, ""I need him... I can't let go of him over nothing and what if it's a horrible mistake, I love him"". I fight with myself and can never win. 

Now I'll get into why I feel like I can't trust him. About two weeks ago I asked what he did that day and he said he went to the mall and saw a friend. So naturally I asked which friend. With my ex I was extremely needy and jealous over everything (mostly because he lied and cheated many times over the span of 3 years) but I learned from how miserable that made me and I got better. I had come to completely trust my current bf and almost even stopped caring when my personality changed leading him to hang out with friends more often and be less clingy. But, I had asked which friend and he said ""A friend named \[insert name\]""...suddenly I snapped and I don't know if my brain was just looking for an excuse to mess everything up (something I would never do if I were myself) but I responded with ""That's a girl name"" then looked at who he was following on his social media and saw her there, I said ""Yeah, no, bye"" and then he explained that she was working and that he used to be good friends with her brother. I guess I didn't really have a reason not to believe him, I still don't know but my brain is just not letting me believe it. So we argued and I acted like I just didn't care at that point, he ended up leaving me on read for 6 days. When we finally talked it was pretty much over at that point. I still don't know where we stand but I'm at a point like I said, where I'm fighting myself over whether I should just move on because my brain tells me I can't stand him or try to reconcile and makeup because I do love him and hope my mind will go back to how it used to be so we can be happy and loving like before.

I know it's all a big mess and I've tried hard to figure out what it all stems from but struggle to find a source. I was terribly bullied in 6th and 7th grade. I abused opioids for awhile. I grew up watching my mom's boyfriends hurt her, betray her, cheat on her. My dad has never been a great person, he isn't really in my life. And of course my own ex who had ruined my trust. But by no means, has my life been bad, I've been quite fortunate.

I had not allowed myself time to process after I broke up with my ex and moved on very quickly to my current bf because I was afraid to be alone. I think maybe this damaged me horribly. Even though for 5 months me and my current bf were very very happy, it just suddenly hit me that I hadn't been ready for a new partner but at that point it was too late to grasp that feeling because I did already love him. 

I'm very depressed now and my anxiety is worse than it has ever been and I'm so sad but yet still irritable and mean and I hate that. I don't take medication and I haven't been to therapy since i was 12. I'm not sure what happened to me, I just feel like a switch flipped in my brain 9 months ago and I'm trying desperately to find it so I can go back to normal. I feel like I'm fighting myself everyday because this isn't me, this isn't who I've always been. It feels unfair and I'm so scared.",10Dec2020,1
177,"18m with alot to talk about. thanks in advance for reading the long post 

(tldr; stuggled with anxiety but found my solutions/ causes, but now im struggling with depression? well im finding everything boring/ not fun and dont want to try anything anymore unless i have caffeine. also im really struggling with my own thoughts, or being on my own with nothing to do, im not suicidal just really down)

i used to be smart, clelver etc... aiming for medschool. then BAM corona lockdown so im no longer in formal education. i get calculated results completely out of my control and they are ridiculously lower than i expected so i lost my medschool offer. i felt like shit, completely hopeless etc... (from around march to august i chilled watched anime and played games but then everything got boring, my results were in august and i tried not to think about it) anyway i was studying biology chemistry and physics at college or whatever and my physics grade was too low for medschool. i then had to take a physics exam which i was ok with, i prepared for about a month constantly working  filling 100s of paged with calculations and practise.

then in the week running up to the exam i fucking broke. anxiety took over. ive had nervousness before like for my medschool interviews but not anxiety to the point im shaking when i pick up a textbook and cant read it. made it through all the papers (3 of them) even though most of the content never covered in college since my teacher was shit (normal teachers dont play episodes of thomas the tank engine during lessons) and the year was cut short. anyway once it was over i still felt shaken up that i had fallen so low, like i used to be on a pedastel where my education defined so much about me and i keep thinking that back then i was way better than i am now

so yeah after that i felt like i needed something to do to keep me busy cause i was mentally pretty fucked, questioning purpose and life etc... so i got a job at a warehouse that pays well but money isnt important to me (first job) and made a friend there too. (mind you i currently dont have any friends that stay in contact, they are all in uni living their  lives and i contacted them alot but they hardly respond, so we've gone our separate ways i guess). but the job is a 10 hour shift with no headphones etc... and i feel as though im losing my mind on the job, cause you are pretty much working on your own all that time with your own thoughts. I once had a panic attack and had to take a break etc.. but the time is kinda useful because i figured out the cause of my anxiety (from unrealistically exaggerating challenges that i will face e.g. exams etc...)  so i try to remind myself to think realistically e.g. a medschool interview sounds scary to me even now depsite the fact ive done 2 of them and  even succeeded to get an offer. 

anyway that aside the job allows my free time to be much more enjoyable. in the lockdown i got really bored with games, tv shows etc... but now i enjoy them more but im starting to get scared of working. I think its because im isolated on the job. being on my own is really difficult for me because my thoughts just make me feel awful or anxious or just sad. im not suicidal i just generally feel down, i kinda have to force myself to feel more happy its just not natural and too draining to keep up. I used to be an introvert for my early teens then completely switched to becoming really confident doing all sorts of stuff in public. but now in this job im struggling with being on my own with my thoughts for 10 hours a day. i dont know why exactly, maybe im worried ill be an introvert again (which isnt true since my social skills are half decent) or maybe i really want friends (but there was a time i didnt have any and coped alright) so im not sure why im so unstable or uneasy.

also there are times on my days off i dont enjoy anything even though i am working. caffeine seems to make it more enjoyable, i drank coffee from an early age idk if i need it everyday now to maintain a normal mood. i know how too much causes nervousness but even none can cause anxiety for me. idk if im an addict now or if its permanent damage so i must have some to help 

im looking for advice really, how can i be more comfortable on my own, or at peace with my thoughts? i spend time with my parents and have opened up to them about all this stuff so im not entirely alone but my thoughts seem to betray me and make me feel like shit. i have a 50 hour week ahead of me (not complaining) i just need a way to fill the time since i cant wear headphones as a policy or go on my phone. i try to turn my brain off entirely and just do the job until i get home but then im just not happy, im like neutral or slightly negative. the job is an active one walking around the warehouse all day and im doing 20k walks which ticks the physical activity box, im eating better too but im still not happy",10Dec2020,1

I don't know whether I'm being dramatic or not and whether maybe I feel certain emotions more than other people but I'm really hurting emotionally. My uncle has been given two months to live after he had an allergic reaction to chemo. My other uncle has brain cancer and has forgotten who I am because if it. My grandma is on chemo and we don't know how serious it is. Another Aunt is also on chemo.

Both my dad, my mum and my aunt are on antidepressants and I can hear them cry when I come back from school. Additionally I have been having some identity problems as I have been playing the role of a person who I'm not in school to try to be liked, I am now trying to stop this, but the more they get to know the real me the more they distance themselves. I also have a crush on this girl, she is wonderful but I really can't tell whether she likes me or not, we've been talking for a while but sometimes I feel like she wants nothing to do with me, and I feel like that about a lot of girls in general.

My grades are going down even though I'm trying to study. And everyone seems to have picked a wonderful university course while I'm choosing a career path which basically guarantees poverty. I have basically no self esteem and I keep having mood shifts which go from slightly happy to dangerously depressed.

I'm at the point where a minor thing like, this girl I like seeming cold to me, can send me down a depressive spiral which has occasionally given me suicidal thoughts.

And I don't know whether I'm being dramatic or not and I'm scared to tell people because I'm only 17 so I have no business being depressed.

So we are all female, 22.

So i have gone completely AWOL on the group chat, not replied to anyones messages etc and this has been for about 2 months as I‚Äôve been struggling with my mental health and comparing my life to everyone (including my best friends who are in relationships/engaged, have put a deposit down on a house etc. I feel like such  a failure I have never been in a relationship, always been rejected &amp; have always been the fat ugly one at school/college/work etc. All I want is to be loved. 
I put in the group chat after weeks of being missing ‚ÄòHi guys sorry I havent been replying, Im not in a good place mentally‚Äô
To which both of my friends sent a similar message to ‚ÄòHope your ok! If you need to talk im here, love you!‚Äô 

Its has been a whole month, and not one of them have bothered asking me whats wrong, how I am etc. They are both in happy relationships, and all they seem to post is their boyfriends, going out, cosy nights in together-basically everything I want in this life but God wont let me have. This is worsening the situation as I keep comparing myself to them, but making me angry too as they are so busy living their lives with their boyfriends, they cant even check to see if Im ok.

However on my third try I really hit the jackpot. I liked what I was doing, I liked why I was doing it, and most of all I liked the people I was doing it with. I was on my way to become the person that I wanted to be. That I feel like I deserved to be. Cue corona. It turns out I have pretty severe abandonment and trust issues, and the only thing that kept me from going nuts was going to school, seeing my friends and knowing I was okay there. At first it was okay. I was just hanging out with these friends. But my mental health began slipping and they definitely noticed. Finally one of them, the one I trusted most, asked me what was going on and I realized I had some issues. I told her about it, but after that she couldn't look at me the same. Consequently she cut me out of her life for the most part, without explanation. From there everything just spiraled further and further. I made a lot of mistakes and I tried to make up for it in my own way but it just wasn't enough. I even went to a psychologist. Then one of these friends got mad at me for something stupid and the psychologist was like: you don't like conflict, so I tried proving him wrong by explaining myself to her, taking it headon, and she got pissed and doesn't want anything to do with me. I was lucky to have a few friends stick around to help me through but this is where everything feels like it's getting complicated.

The people that have stuck around have already planned to go to the cabin with the first group, leaving me without a ride. They instead told me that I should ask this third group for a ride. The people that I identify with the least. I don't know what to do. I don't get invited to birthday parties or events anymore, and even the stuff where I do get invited I'm still left outside, and it feels like no one else can see it? I feel completely broken.

186,"To say the least, I was abused sexually, physically, and mentally. I was homeless, starved, and forced to shoplift and dumpster dive for necessities.

At the age lf 9, I was able to tell my mom about the sexual abuse. Children services wouldn't let the doctor examine me because it ""would traumatize me further"" and kept me in the home with my abusers often visiting.  I contracted a STI and didn't get treatment until mom got custody at the age of 13, I could have had it since I was 6.  After the exam, children services tried to say my internal scarring came from me willingly having sex and possibly ""chronic masturbation"" - anything other than admitting I was raped due to their poor placement. 

Anything I told children services was ignored as a lie. They only let me live with Mom after my father was overdosing on heroin and was obviously very ill. 

When in mom's care, children services actually showed up on a regular basis. They were always trying to take me from Mom, but couldn't be bothered to save me from my father. 

Over my life, I was in 7 foster homes and juvie twice for a total of 1.5 year. 

Today, I have PTSD and BPD. I have physical health issues from the trauma of abuse. I go to physical therapy and mental therapy. (Until covid)

 I'm the happiest I've ever been, I never would have imagined this life as a child. Things aren't perfect, but I've got a home and most my needs met... Yet I still can't let go. 

My ugliest trait, I want those who made me suffer to feel the same. I want to scream about it, I want the world to know how they hurt me, and I want to out those who wouldn't save me. I feel I'm owed the world from my abusers and from children services and juvenile court.

When my father died many states away, I celebrated... But then I looked at his facebook page, seeing his thousand friends... Seeing the kind words people were putting on his page.. I was outraged. He should have been suffering too, he should be lonely too... If people only knew, he shouldn't have any friends or kind words even after death.

I also fantasize about horrible things happening to the staff of the juvenile court, juvie staff, children services staff, and the foster parents who hated me so. I never got love, acceptance or kindness from anyone other than my mom, and these were the people always tearing us apart. 

I want hell for everyone who brought me pain. I don't know how to stop it. I only brought it up once in therapy, and was promptly told I need to learn to forgive. The hatred is the only thing I have for all that I went through.

187,"I am very shocked regarding how uncaring i am to myself. I talk about my past physical and emotional abuse so casually to therapists or close people. I stayed friends with people that sexually assault me and went partying with them knowing the consequences, thing is I didn‚Äôt care what happens to me. The only time i did is when i cut off a guy who used to be very close to me, cos I understood that he was only befriending me to eventually take his way with me. I opened up to him regarding my past and abusive parents, and he knew that i would be an easy victim, new country, very young with no real friends and an abusive family. I cut him off the morning after, felt betrayed by his intentions with me, by not upset regarding the sexual assault itself. 
When i read stories about people being raped or taken advantage of, i feel sorry for them. But I never seem to be able to extend that to myself. I don‚Äôt feel anything about it.

Hedonist/inappropriate. Insufficient. I put minimal effort into living. I am inferior to everyone I know, in any way I can think of. I am not enough to inspire goodness, am not even enough to evade disappointing everyone I meet with my being.

191," 

I am a 16 year old high school student. I just don't know what is wrong with me. Previously I used to be a proper student who did all the work on time, score high grades and readily work on my own interests. Nowadays I can't even concentrate even on smallest things. I can't even focus on a single page whereas previous me used to complete reading a book on a single day. Completing my work has become extremely difficult for me, mostly I keep it incomplete or even if I manage to complete it the work will be full of careless mistakes. Yesterday I had a practice test, I didn't feel like doing it even though I knew most of the answers. I submitted my incomplete work ( thank god it was not graded). I never used to be like that.

I am not only facing problem in studies. I love to paint but even if I start on something I fail to finish it. I just can't even focus on the things I used to love doing. I have always liked physics. programming and painting but I can't even complete the thing I started. I just spend my day by mindlessly scrolling through memes or webtoons.

And I feel that I am getting colder day by day. Sometimes I even feel irritated by smallest things my family do. Recently my grandma fell really sick but I didn't feel slightest bit of concern. I just want to stay all alone in my room whole day.

Sometimes even smallest thing like eating my food or like picking up the things I dropped feel like chore to me. I just don't get what is wrong with me. I never used to be like this.

Everyday I resolve to do all my work properly and to change myself but I fail to do so. I am really scared. I feel like I will end up like failure. Though I know if I don't change myself. I am really scared. I don't know anyone I can ask for help. My family is going through tough times so I can't ask help from them and I don't have any friends.

Has anybody gone through anything like this? Please help me I just don't want to live like this.

193,"Hello everyone I really really need help identifying what just happened to me today. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs something serious and I should be worried about or not. 



I‚Äôm a 19f college student who had to do a group presentation for my physics lab final today. A lot of effort was out into the project and slides and although it wasn‚Äôt A worthy, it was still quite decent. 

Me and my group presented in front of 3 lab instructors and it went pretty nice. Of course, until it came to the end. 

Two of the lab in structures just starting ripping apart every flaw of our final project (in a very professional and constructive manner, of course, and I am VERY thankful for their input). 

However, because I‚Äôve always been a sensitive person, about 15 minutes into their critique, I started crying very lightly while wearing my facial mask due to the overall stress I‚Äôve been feeling for the past few weeks I suppose (I‚Äôm actually not sure)?

Unfortunately, one of the instructors caught on and told me it a ok to take off my mask and take deep breaths. Despite the empathetic gesture, it actually caused me to quickly spiral into a full ugly-crying, gasping and shaking monster  in front of everyone. 

The instructors quickly approached me and tried to calm me to their best abilities (god bless them) and told me it‚Äôs ok to feel upset from criticism since they were being quite harsh and it‚Äôs my first ever college project. 

I tried to explain to them that I was not upset but rather just nervous and that I can‚Äôt really control my body‚Äôs reactions sometimes. However, it felt like I was being suffocated and could barely breathe because I lost all physical control over my breathing and I started to be unable to speak. 

To make matters worse, I started stuttering for the first time in my life and couldn‚Äôt even count to three. My face and body then started twitching and flailing like they were some sort of tics and I couldn‚Äôt force myself to stop. 

It felt like my body and brain were disconnected and I couldn‚Äôt control basic actions like breathing, speech and body movement. It was absolutely horrible and I was in absolute terror to what my body was doing despite my brain wanting it to stop. 

The very worst part about it, though, was that I wasn‚Äôt feeling anxiety or a ‚Äòfight or flight‚Äô sensation which seems to be the core sensations of a panic attack. If anything, I just felt somewhat embarrassed that my body was freaking out for 10 mins straight as if I lost almost all control over my somatic nervous system and made me look like I was batshit.

So to be clear, I was 100% conscious and didn‚Äôt *FEEL* anxious or sad or anything. Despite that, I couldn‚Äôt control my sobs and sporadic twitches. 


So, *please*, if you have ever experienced something similar or have an idea of what may have occurred to me, please let me know. I was absolutely mortified by what happened and it felt so helpless and disturbing.

Thank you and bless you all. 





TLDR; Presented final in front of lab instructors and starting crying very lightly (from stress) after 20 mins of them scrutinizing my work. When an asked if I was ok I had a full public breakdown: no control over my breathing or speech and body movements for nearly 10 full mind despite me feeling mentally ‚Äòok‚Äô.

194,"So, I‚Äôve had nightmare syndrome for 6 years (professionally diagnosed) and lately it‚Äôs been the worst it‚Äôs ever been.

196,"A little background: I‚Äôve been dealing with generalized anxiety disorder, chronic depression, and Bipolar II my entire adult life. This has naturally created issues with motivation, focus, mood stabilization, and stress management. 

Having tried (and failed) to treat with traditional means such as SSRI‚Äôs, Benzo‚Äôs, counseling, and even Medical Marijuana - I found nootropics, and have spent the last year+ heavily researching and trying different supplements. Here‚Äôs what I found, by catagory:

BOTANICALS

- Ashwagandha: This is one of the most touted nootropics for stress relief, so naturally one of the first things I got into. The type certainly matters. KSM-66 (when properly stacked) seems to be the most effective and versatile version for me. Sensoril is stronger, but can induce serious fatigue at the recommended dosage. Shoden is scientifically the strongest, but practically underwhelming and overpriced. Regular ‚ÄúAshwagandha root powder‚Äù doesn‚Äôt do anything.

- Lemon Balm: Synergistic with Sensoril if you want to go to sleep, or KSM-66 if you recently had an anxiety attack. Doesn‚Äôt do much by itself, and most varieties tend to cause unpleasant drowsiness if taken during the daytime.

- Bacopa: Generally overrated. Does ‚Äúokay‚Äù at increasing focus if you‚Äôre trying to get away from synthetic stimulants; but keep in mind the Scientific studies are based on the Synapsa extract with 50%+ potency. Most affordable vendors are selling undisclosed potency, or below 12%.

- Panax Ginseng: Mild energy boost if you go for a decent extract and stack it properly. Again, most affordable vendors are selling low-potency and low-purity garbage versions.

- Maca: Same as above. Also can create a minor improvement in Libido.

- Rhodiola: Actually a tangible mood lift (if you get the right extract) but limited dosing opportunities and half life. Really only good as a morning or afternoon pick-me-up.

- Kratom: Hardly a nootropic, but there‚Äôs definitely an overlap in the community‚Äôs promoting it. Can work well to mitigate pain, depression, anxiety, sleep issues, and indigestion in the beginning. Can cause copious amounts of indigestion, anxiety, and restlessness later - when you realize you‚Äôre detoxing off a mild opioid. 

SYNTHETICS

- Piracetam: The original racetam. Requires additional choline supplementation and regular dosing to work. Can provide focus on depressed days, or more anxiety on anxious days.

- Aniracetam: Also requires choline. Decent at mitigating social anxiety. Increases focus if paired with Noopept, or brain fog if paired with Fasoracetam. Very short half life (~2 hours) and more than two doses in a day can cause nasty headaches.

- Fasoracetam: Theoretically upregulates GABA in the brain. Useful after a day or two of Phenibut, which downregulates GABA. Pretty mild on its own.

- Phenylpiracetam: Debatably the strongest and most undeniable of the Racetams. Provides respectable amounts of focus and energy with a long half life. Also expensive to keep up with, depressing to get away from, and still requires choline supplements.

- Colouracetam: This was initially marketed as an antidepressant of sorts, and then long term users got depressed anyway. Pleasant effects on mood, energy, and focus if taken occasionally. (Also requires choline, as all racetams do.)

- Noopept: The table salt of synthetics. 10-30mg will make any Racetam hit stronger, but rather benign to take by itself.

- Adrafinil - Gave me the most productive month at work ever, then stopped working. Doubled the dose for a while, which was successful until I realized how much money I was wasting on one substance.

- Fladrafinil - Claims to be 10x stronger than Adrafinil. Also potentially harmful to your liver, kidneys, hairline, and wallet. 

- Phenibut - Works on GABA receptors to mitigate anxiety and induce a sense of cognitive euphoria. Also takes 3-4 hours to kick in, has rapid tolerance, is extremely rough on the stomach, and can cause a depressive comedown in the following days if you aren‚Äôt prepared with other supplements.

VITAMINS / MINERALS 

- Multivitamins: Science is up in the air and says we should simply practice good dieting; but most people eat junk. Take a food-sourced option like Naturelo if you want to avoid common deficiencies.

- Magnesium Citrate: Keeps bowels regular and your mood balanced. This is especially important if you‚Äôre taking something like Kratom; which is essentially insoluble fiber.

- Vitamin D: Your multi should include it, but depressed recluses can use a little more.

- B Complex: Same as above. B6 is also a necessary cofactor for Amino Acids to work.

- Lithium Orotate: Literal lithium, bound to an OTC molecule (orotate) that some people believe is safer and more bioavailable. I take it to stabilize mood. Honestly not sure how well it works, as I still occasionally have severely depressed days. But it‚Äôs cheap, and I‚Äôm concerned about having a mental breakdown if I randomly stop.

AMINO ACIDS

- L-Theanine: Neutralizes the anxious effects of caffeine when paired with it, and induces relaxation or sleep by itself. I use this every few hours.

- L-Tyrosine: A conditionally essential amino acid that helps build dopamine in the brain. Worth trying if you‚Äôre coming off harder substances, taking regular serotonin supplements, or think you have a dopamine deficiency.

- Mucuna: Tyrosine‚Äôs brute big brother. This will release dopamine faster; but is very dose dependent, and should be both cycled and combined with actual Tyrosine so as to avoid long term problems.

- L-Tryptophan: An essential amino acid that helps build Serotonin. If you have a condition that would normally warrant SSRI‚Äôs; this could be helpful. Also can induce drowsiness.

- 5-HTP: Faster acting, less drowsy, and less bioavailable than L-Tryptophan. A matter of preference; but mind your dosage.

- L-Taurine: Works in synergy with L-Tryptophan to induce a relaxing sense of fatigue before bed. Can also help to balance levels of other amino acids and vitamins in the body.

MUSHROOMS 

Cordyceps: Initial experiences were akin to Panax Ginseng; later experiences were akin to taking nothing at all. There‚Äôs other reasons to take it - such as reportedly increasing lung function and immunity. But the psychoactive benefits are small.

Lion‚Äôs Mane: I‚Äôve taken three versions of this. The popular 8:1 extract was expensive; but had a noticeably positive impact on mood and focus. The popular 1:1 extract did nothing for me. The mycelium version did absolutely nothing for me.

Reishi: Some take this for immunity, some for energy, some for sleep, some for hangover prevention. I didn‚Äôt notice a huge effect in any of these categories.

CONCLUSIONS: 

- Some botanicals and mushrooms do some of the things they‚Äôre touted for; but extract potency, purity, and brand really matter. They also range from synergistic to only working short-term. This means you‚Äôll always need ‚Äúmore‚Äù or ‚Äúsomething to go with it‚Äù - which can create instability in and of itself.

- Amino acids are perhaps the most natural approach; but require a ridiculous amount of education and patience. For example: increasing dopamine will decrease serotonin; both of which should be taken at a 10:1 ratio (ten parts dopamine) to begin with. They also don‚Äôt work instantly, and won‚Äôt get you ‚Äúhigh‚Äù in any sense of the word.

- Synthetics can have the most noticeable effects, but are essentially failed pharmaceuticals. They all have side effects, most require being paired with other supplements, and several of them have almost been banned repeatedly. Reputable vendors are also scarce and can range from unreliable with shipments, to prohibitively expensive (especially long term.) I would recommend them the least.

All in all, it‚Äôs been an interesting ride. Educating oneself on the brain, body, and aspects of pharmacology can certainly make you a more informed person, patient, and buyer. 

Is there any one capsule that cures depression? Not in the least. There are some things that can help in different ways, though; some of which I‚Äôd buy again, a lot of which aren‚Äôt worth it IMO.",10Dec2020,1

I am not over from my break up with my ex of 2 months yet. She is seeing someone new now and I hate the fact that I am being left hanging. I do not want her back but my mind is addicted to thinking about her and our past relationship.

I have been talking to my ex of many years and there is a possibility that she may want to rekindle our relationship but I do not want to be with anyone for now (nor do I want to get married) (this is mostly because of my toxic relationship of my ex of 2 months - I find myself not wanting to take risks like that) so I do not want to lead her (ex of many years) on.

I have been sick with many things lately. Firstly, I had a sore throat and I was prescribed by my GP with antibiotics. After this, my testicles got very painful and he prescribed me with another set of antibiotics and anti inflammatory meds. Just when I am about to finish my 2nd set of antibiotics, I notice my right fingers are swelling as hell. This time, he prescribed me with steroids, antihistamine and 3rd set of antibiotics. And the swelling is not really getting any better. My GP referred me to dermatologists which would probably take months before they can see me. Now, I am hoping that my GP can provide alternative way to get my fingers treated apart from waiting for dermatologists.

Because of all these especially the illness part, I find it hard to do my job. I have been on sick leave frequently now. I am really frustrated with the progress I do in my work. And I am going to be very busy by January.

210,"Hi, I'm here to vent/get some input and since im a guy who can't talk about his feelings in person I guess I'm gonna try reddit :)

So over a year ago a few bad things happened all at once. Family related stuff, the pressure that comes with moving out from my parents and managing all the real life adult stuff for the first time. Plus most importantly my first real crush dumped me after dating for some months. I felt pretty bad for quite a while, which is okay.

But I never really recovered from all that. Multiple times a week, for no real reason I get absurdly hung up on the fact that this girl rejected me. My heart starts racing and I feel extremly stressed out and helpless. I always need about an hour of beeing alone just to kind of ""reorder"" my thoughts and then I feel better but the rest of the day I'm kind of drowning in self-pity.

This has been going on for over a year and a half now and although i can manage feeling bad on repeat it is just really exhausting.

I feel like I'm obsessing over this person for no (apparent) reason, since even on bad days I can kind of accept that it just wasn't meant to be and that theres ""gonna be a next one"".

Said crush and I are still friends and see each other on occasion, which doesnt help. (Also hooking up with said crush doesn't help - who could've guessed)

Now the input I'm looking for is: Is it possible that I'm still hurting from the rejection more than 18 months after it happened? Because to me it seems like either I REALLY suck at getting rejected or I might just be in a bad mental state and the rejection is just what my head comes up with to ""feel bad"" if that makes any sense?! Has anyone experienced something similar?  I just want to know how I could be approaching this whole situation and get better, since I have no real idea about what I'm feeling or should be doing.

My parents fight a lot, (especially over my father‚Äôs alcoholism) and honestly it‚Äôs just really annoying because it usually interrupts me going about my life (reading, exercising, watching tv ect).

217,So again if you check my subreddits my older brothers been having a manic episode and refusing to get help. Today he left before my family woke up and refuses to answer our calls or text messages. We messaged his friends to find out where he was and what he‚Äôs doing and we found out he bought plane tickets to Vegas and plans to fly out there tonight. He also bought a Tesla and this whole week he has been spending over thousands of dollars. He has also confessed to my other sibling to having suicidal thoughts and we called our crisis hotline but they said they can‚Äôt do anything other than check him in but he has the rights to refuse help or treatment which he has already done last time we took him in. And we can‚Äôt detain him because he hasn‚Äôt harmed himself or anyone yet but we‚Äôre worried he will. My family and I don‚Äôt know what to do anything we feel like we lost him now. We know what hotel he‚Äôs staying in Vegas but we tried all we can and don‚Äôt know what more we can do to help him if he keeps refusing and spending.,10Dec2020,1

231,"I have been married for almost 13 years now. My wife cheated on me in 2012. I recently (in the last few months) came to the realization that I'm unhappy in my marriage and asked my wife for a divorce. We have been trying to work it out but I feel that I don't want to and am just doing it because my wife is asking. Thinking back on it, I feel that the majority of decisions I made since she cheated was for the sake of my daughter. My thinking back then was to try and move past the cheating and work it out with my wife for the sake of my daughter. My guess is at some point I just made decisions guided by that motivation and they just became subconscious decisions. Fast forward to now and idk whats wrong with me. I'm unhappy in my marriage and want to leave but I keep on finding myself doing things to keep my wife happy for the sake of my kids. When I sit down and think about these decisions I make I feel like they aren't even conscious decisions. I feel like they are how I'm ""conditioned"" to respond rather than emotionally driven like I feel that they should be. More often than not the things I do around my wife I just feel indifferent about. Honestly not even sure if I'm trying to ask a question here or if I'm just looking for help and support.

232,"My parents have been going through a divorce for 11 years now and the only reason they‚Äôre still together is because of money, housing and raising us. im 20 years old now and i have difficulty being a human because of how they raised me and the trauma they put in my brain. they would do things like tell me to be quiet all the time, tell me my opinions werent important and theyd yell at me when i would try to help them and they still do that. i got mad at my father when he needed help with a car, and i volunteered to help and he started screaming at me that i wasnt doing something right (and ‚Äúright‚Äù to him is just a way of saying ‚Äúdone as he wants‚Äù) even though it was a different way of doing things that still works. thats just the surface of what theyve done. my mom would always downplay my emotions and ridicule me for crying when i was a child when i was upset about something. she would hit me and punish me in ridiculous ways that scarred me and i dont know how to get rid of it. there was a time when i went to nicaragua and stayed in a guest bed. i was around 9 years old and i went to sleep and wet the bed and when i woke up, she was yelling at me and told me to get naked in front of her and all my siblings and family and stand in the corner for an hour to think about what i did and i think about that a lot. they would always call me the runt of the family and i felt weak, and my brother would always beat me up because it was easy. hes a year and 9 months older than me so hes a little bit bigger and had anger issues and itd be daily, id always be afraid that i would get hit by him, or my parents if i didnt do something right. and all the constant yelling by my dad, like YELLING. i lived with a dad who yelled at me like i was in the army. it was just too much for me and i barely remember my childhood because it was just so bad, i only remember the bad parts because there were so many. theres just too much to cover and its already getting pretty long. i think i turned out alright despite my circumstances. im not really shy, just trained to be quiet if that makes sense. my sense of humor is entirely my own, my social skills are entirely my own and my success is definitely my own. i dont feel pity for myself and i dont want anyone else to either. i just needed to get this out there. i have gone to therapy but it didnt help. im slowly learning how to be a human again. one that isnt bitter or mean or cold to everyone they meet. its hard though because its still going on. they‚Äôre not like they used to be 10 years ago but they still belittle me every so often and i just dont care what they have to say tbh. its hard to make connections with people, with friends and especially with potential lovers. and the girls i do date, they always leave me because i fuck up when i dont mean to. i get these nasty feelings of insecurity and jealousy and i know theyre wrong. i try my hardest to analyze and tell myself theyre feelings of the past, that theyve been conditioned into me but sometimes they slip through and all it takes is one fuck up. my last ex, i love her to death but im not a good person for her so i broke up with her and it just hurts to think about it. i want to be a better person but dont know how",10Dec2020,1

The last bit started coming up more since the day my own mother started telling me how she wished she never had me. How she wished she could just go back in time and never have me.

She would have these episodes once in a while, usually on the phone now that I don‚Äôt live with her anymore, before it was once a week. She would usually blame me for everything bad in her life. She always says how I am just like my father (who she also hates) knowing well this will hurt me.

I was 9 at the time, my parents were going through their umpteenth separation process. My mom had had gave my father until the end of the summer to look for a new place and get out of the house, but he had no intention to leave. He instead moved into our guest room in the hopes that she would change her mind. The atmosphere in that house was horrible. My father would always trying to comfort me and tell me things will improve. One night he ended up staying in my bed until I fell asleep. During the night I woke up, his hand was inside my panties, touching and massaging my labia. In that moment I froze. This big, huge man in my kid bed, pressed against me, who is my father is touching me down there. I couldn‚Äôt process what was happening. It was boiling hot but I remember shivering. Once he tried to insert a finger I moved, and turn on laid on my stomach. I couldn‚Äôt sleep anymore, but couldn‚Äôt say anything either waiting for the sun to rise and him leave my med.

I didn‚Äôt tell anybody.

My parents eventually separated. This happened only once one night they had a physical fight outside our home and our neighbours called the police. They gave him a week to collect all his stuff and leave.

It was traumatic. I still remember the blood everywhere, the pieces of broken glass. I had stayed in room, in my bed under the cover until a policeman came to see how I was doing.

The day I was supposed to go to spend the night at my dad‚Äôs, I was too scared. Me and my mom were about to get in the car and I told her what happened.

I am glad I did, because the man is sick so who knows what he‚Äôd have done to me... but sometimes I just wished I stayed silent, so that all the mess and chaos that came after would have never happened.

The court, child services, my mom
loosening it even more. She was now going to everyone we knew talking about it, screaming at him in the streets, at my school.

My father ended up not getting one day of prison... actually, my mother ended up taking him back 3 years later. I told her I wanted to forgive him and meet him to talk. She got mad... Until this day I don‚Äôt know how she went from that reaction to getting back with him.

They didn‚Äôt last long. Their toxic, on and off relationship is still going on. They are off at the moment.
 
I don‚Äôt talk to my father anymore. I stopped having any contact with him a year ago and he said he‚Äôs fine with it. I don‚Äôt even know why I keep having a relationship with my mother. One minute she‚Äôs happy, laughing and she says she loves me. Then as soon as an argument start or I don‚Äôt do something she wants me to do, she starts with the long and hateful rants. Telling me who much she can‚Äôt stand me. She said she only has a relationship with me because I‚Äôm her only daughter.

I don‚Äôt even know if I love parents. I only know that I can‚Äôt trust them, that they don‚Äôt really love me like that and that I can only count on myself. I only have me, myself and I.

One year ago, my depression got so bad I couldn‚Äôt leave my bed for 2 weeks. I couldn‚Äôt go to work, I didn‚Äôt shower, I just kept overeating in my room and watching random stuff on Youtube. I kept thinking over and over again about all the shitty things that happened in my life. My horrible parents, my childhood trauma... I thought about all the relationships I ruined, all the people I pushed away. How I alone I was. I almost had a nervous breakdown.

I went to see my family doctor who I had never even met since I signed to that clinic. He prescribed me some pills, can‚Äôt even remember what it was exactly. I tried to take it for few days and stopped. I was feeling worst, I was feeling suicidal which I never did. I just talked myself out of that state and went back to work the following Monday.

I kept on going like I did before, barely surviving.


But now I feel like I am slowly getting back to that point again, because of the pandemic, working from home and my constant state of depression.

I gained weight, I don‚Äôt take care of myself anymore. I don‚Äôt feel beautiful anymore. I don‚Äôt feel confident. I basically hate myself. I don‚Äôt want to see people, let alone date anyone. I had one serious relationship, which ended because of long distance. I had guys asking me out but I‚Äôve always turned them down, more because of me.

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8, my body weight had always been between 132lbs and 154lbs, the lowest being 121lbs between the age of 18 and 23 due to my eating disorder. I was dealing with a lot of stress, due to my situation at home, finances and trying to survive college. I finally moved out once I graduated, but over the last two years I gained so much weight, mostly due to bad diet and emotional overeating. I weight 198lbs now. I tried to loose weight, but it‚Äôs so difficult. I sticked to a healthy diet and exercising for like 2 weeks and I lost 6 pounds. I got everything back because I can‚Äôt keep up with it, between the emotional eating and working from home. I still look good, but I am more concerned with my health now.

I live in London, UK but I‚Äôm actually thinking about leaving to relocate somewhere else (not back home, there‚Äôs nothing there for me) once this Covid situation gets better.... to see if it might help and give me the strength I need to start living a bit.

But I am not even sure if this is a good idea anymore. Should I get myself better mentally first? I would love to start therapy, but I don‚Äôt know if I can afford it.

I am so sorry for the long post... which sound more like a vent, I know. I don‚Äôt even know what I am asking for. This is actually my first thread ever on Reddit, I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm in the right sub forum.",10Dec2020,1
236,"Sigh. Not officially diagnosed with CPTSD yet (it is pointless at this stage since the only advantage to having that label would be to help the doctor find medication for it for me, and I refuse to be medicated) and battling my urges AND my depression so hard right now. I dunno. Talking about prison and how I am still having nightmares about being so trapped with no information about what was happening to me (the first month especially) has just brought those demons back to the surface when I thought I had buried them for good. I just want to torch another Dumpster right now, but I can not. I just got off Drug and Alcohol classes and COLORS (random drug testing) so I should be happy...right? I can't feel happiness.

237,"I have gone the larger part of my life identifying my issues with depression due to experiencing persistent low self-esteem, insecurity, social isolation, intermittent suicidal ideation, and a deeply pessimistic outlook on life, all of which has caused me to miss out on a lot of living, therefore leading to more regret and rumination which continues to the present day.

Recently, I began reading Reasons to Stay Alive by Matt Haig. He describes his first experience with major depressive disorder, how he was essentially bedridden, didn't understand what was happening to him, was shaking uncontrollably, and made an attempt to jump off the roof of his house. I have had moments where suicide seemed like the most rational solution to my problems, but have never had the physical symptoms he describes or made an actual attempt on my life.

This makes me feel like perhaps I have only convinced myself I have depression, and really all those wasted years were just wasted years, irrespective of mental illness. My life has not been that terrible other than persistent loneliness and insecurity, which is common enough nowadays. I don't have any major traumas I don't think other than having divorced parents, also not uncommon. It just feels very childish to me that I've been hanging onto this supposed mental illness thing well into my 20s and letting it define my existence when there's probably a simple way out.",10Dec2020,1
238,"If lots of different people all end up walking out, you'd generally assume that the problem is you. Friends, family, they have all walked out of my life slowly over my 23 years of existence.

I have a lot of insecurities and self-esteem issues, having grown up with a narcissistic mom and brother. There weren't any other children who lived nearby, so the only socialising I got as a child was at school, really, and I only had one friend there.

I have a lot of emotional baggage, but I keep it to myself. I love helping people and I can listen to people for ages, and I have been told in the past that I give great advice. I'm extremely introverted, so I'm definitely not high-maintenance. I have a lot of hobbies, I love playing games and I spend a lot of time creating digital art. No one has ever raised any personal issues they've had with me. So, I guess what I'm trying to say is, I have my issues but I don't think I'm a bad friend. I don't understand why everyone eventually ends up leaving.

I made a post on a subreddit not too long ago, looking for online friends, and it got a lot of traction. People messaged me, I responded to every single one and in most cases carried the conversation. Yet one by one, they all eventually stopped replying.

I reached out on a second subreddit, looking for an 'Internet mom' type figure, because I am estranged from my own mother and sometimes I just want some warm words and motherly advice. I found a lovely person who genuinely seemed to want to be a part of my life. 2 weeks ago was the last time I heard from her. Messages read, but no response.

Maybe I am just really fucking boring. Other than my partner, I am completely alone. I know I'm fucked up and have a bunch of issues, but it can't just be coincidence. I must well and truly be crazy because I have no idea what I'm doing wrong.

I already have an intense fear of abandonment, and there's literally nobody who can convince me it's irrational anymore. Everyone always leaves, eventually.",10Dec2020,1

I also know that the pandemic worsened the mental health crisis nationwide (and probably worldwide), and I'm really upset about that as well.\*\*\* 

 I looked back on what my life was like in Feb and March and it's really upsetting to see where I am now.  I was really getting into the flow of things. I finally found an exercise I loved, and I was going to spin classes and lifting classes for the first time ever almost every day. I made new friends and I felt strong and healthy. I found something I was excited to wake up for every day. I was spending a lot of time with close friends, and I had finally found the career path for me. I was really happy and full of energy. Flash forward to today, I am slowly recovering from a really bad period of high health anxiety. I always feel like I'm on the brink of death. I'm just getting back into working out, but I'm always scared. I rarely feel ""full of energy."" I feel depressed sometimes. I feel hopeless sometimes. I hate going outside because it's risky and I feel claustrophobic when wearing a mask. I'm always paranoid that I'm developing an illness I won't catch until it's too late.

I have to watch certain shows in order, like I can only listen to or watch YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, in that order. But, in order to move onto Netflix, I must have watched all of my Youtube subscriptions recent videos. But, in order to move onto Netflix, I have to watch all of the shows and movies in my Netflix list, and then move onto Hulu, and this will reset every day. I have hobbies I need to complete every day, like I need to look at the most recent PS4 games coming out today, not because I want to, but because I‚Äôm so afraid I‚Äôll miss something.

But the past year my anxiety has got worse and I've been avoiding everyone which is making my anxiety evain worse but anyway I only have about 2 freinds now that I meet about 1 every 2 or 3 months because I avoid them and I'm trying to meet my freind tomorrow and hes avoiding me.

I'm worried if I loose my last 2 friends I'll never to be able to make freinds again cause I'm really bad and meeting people cause my anxiety.

245,"I‚Äôm a crier yes. Any type of stress; good stress, bad stress, neutral stress-my bodies natural response is to cry to release that stress.

I cry, then get exhausted from crying &amp; stop for a bit, only to start bawling my eyes out again, so the cycle repeats.

Nothing can distract me enough to get me ‚Äòout of my head‚Äô, assuming I‚Äôm subconsciously thinking negative thoughts which causes me to cry. 

But what pisses me off about this is that ANY somewhat negative thought can drag me into this cycle. And I cannot just ‚Äòignore‚Äô or ‚Äòturn off‚Äô my cries; my body controls that, I can not control my cries. 

I understand it‚Äôs okay and even good to cry, but when it‚Äôs all you do in a day‚Äîcry, try and distract away from the crying/negative thoughts, to then when finally stop crying, to only start crying again &amp; harder which then gets more frustrating because of all the time &amp; energy I‚Äôm ‚Äòwasting‚Äô by bawling my eyes out.

What I tried doing is listening to Buddhist monk videos to hear them out, they have very helpful and calming insight. But the second I turn off that video or decide to work on something else, I‚Äôm right back to crying. 

Maybe it‚Äôs just my seasonal depression being stronger this year, that or I‚Äôm just taking big steps backwards..
(I struggle with depression and generalized anxiety &amp; had a mushroom trip at the beginning of the year that positively changed my outlook on life, like my depression seemed to have lifted tremendously, but now that it‚Äôs winter I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs my seasonal depression that‚Äôs back now and also thinking that maybe i just need to have another trip to remind myself &amp; get some self reflection)

Any recommendations for helping stop the crying would be helpful. Thanks in advance.",10Dec2020,1

I have ADD, Schizophrenia, Anxiety. I take meds for them. 

I tried to kill myself two weeks ago. I got out of hospital yesterday, because i tried jumping and ended up breaking both of my legs and i needed surgery, so now i have two casts up to the top of my legs so i cant even walk. I had to go to a mental ward after the surgery and once i got my legs in casts. They made me take new meds and speak to lots of different people which is bad for anxiety because i almost had an anxiety attack and the voices in my head got bad alot until they tried new meds and it got better but not much. and  i had to be in a wheelchair if i wanted to go to another room and things. I hated it. I was scared. The therapist there was nice but that‚Äôs about it. Oh and that one nurse that sat with me and calmed me down and made sure i was ok. I tried to self harm there i got told off by the therapist and a doctor, it made me upset and i just wanted to go. Im at home now since yesterday. I have not / cant go to school, i cant move around easily at all. I have been in my bed all of today. I guess its good that i dont have to go to school. I get bullied. People even call me names because im small. Im 4ft 10in. I am small but why do they have to bully me. Im depressed because i cant go outside or walk or anything. I think there is a wheelchair downstairs with a leg rest thing on it because i cant bend my legs but idk if i want to use it. 
I cant even go to the toilet without help. I just want to die. I dont want to do this anymore. I dont want to wait 6 months to get my legs fixed. I have to go to this thing after anyways to get help to walk properly again. I dont want to do it. Why cant i just die. I hate this and i hate myself even more and i didnt think i could hate myself more. I dont have the motivation to do anything / the things i can do. 

I hate it. I now have to take 2 more different medicines a day. 1 for my legs ( idk why ) and another antipsychotic. Not including ADD and Anxiety meds as well as some other pill but yeah im not gonna say that one. 
Idk what to even do anymore. Im more usless then i already was and i cant even help my parents and i made them sad because i tried to kill myself and they havent talked to me much.

I havent eaten anything all day and its 2.30pm  
Im 26. Im 27 next month. Im getting old. I dont look 20 anymore. I got a nose job which makes me look a year younger maybe. I think I look 23-24. I Want to look 20. I Want to look TWENTY.  
I dont want to age.I dont want to die alone.I dont want to be alone.¬†I wanted my family to love me but they dont. I cant have a relationship with them.I wanted my ex to want me and accept me, even though I didnt love him, i still liked wannted and accepted him and wanted his vaildation. I didnt ever wanna marry him because of many reasons most of which are that he is weird and i would be ashamed to show him to my friends and family. He would just embaras me. Maybe i didnt accept him publicly. But i was despararete for his validation. I liked his body and couldnt get enough of him. But he CHOSE HER. someone who is OLDER THAN HIM BY 4 YEARS. Someone who looks OLDER than her age or maybe her age at the very least. She wasnt even pretty. IF i looked like her, i would not be happy. I dont like her hair, I dont like her small eyes, I dont like her strong nose, i dont like her thin lips, i dont like her fake lashes or eyebrows which means she doesnt actually have any brows or lashes. I dont like her big lower face, long philtrum, or heavy jaw. I dont like her face. Shes not pretty. He brainwashed me into thinking shes hotter than me in some way but shes not. Its objective. Shes not beautiful. Im prettier than her. I dont know about her body, but from what ive seen over clothed photos, I Dont like it and i wouldnt be happy if i had her body either.¬†  
But i dont like my own body too. I want bigger boobs. I am skinny but still have a fatty looking stomach. I want a tight stomach. I think I would be pretty happy if i had those two things. I dont particularly LOVE my hips or ass, but they are tolerable. If I had a hot upper body atleast that would be something.¬†  
I go back and forth from feeling like I want to look 20 and thinking it doesnt matter as long as youre hot. But I dont feel young and i dont feel beautiful either. Im nothing.¬†  
And this online dating thing is not working out. I am barely getting matches. I tried online dating when i was 23-24 and got so many matches. my photos were nice, but now i am too insecure to put proper photos of my new face with my nose. I think i look ODD and not pretty. I look younger but not prettier. And still not yuong enough. Now that i am 26 almost 27, i am getting barely any matches. Maybe its because I am using the same accounts, so have altready swiped on everyone, and theres barely anyone left to swipe on. Maybe its becausre they are setting their filters to 25 and under. No one wants a 27 or 26 year old, except for WAYYYYYYYY old guys like 40+ which i dont want. my age range that i want is 24-32. But I am insecure that younger guys will say im old. or even the same age ones will say im old.¬†  
I feel my options are drying up. When i was younger i did not get the types of matches i wanted. No one wanted to commit to me, and i wondered why. and i came to the conclusion that i was not hot enough. But now tht i am 27 almost, i am thinking its because i am too old.¬†  
Maybe it has nothing to do with that. Maybe its just so easy to get sex that no one wants to commit. And i am not into casual. And maybe the pandemic has somethng to do with it. I wouldve thought it would be MORE popular to talk online since the pandemic.¬†  
I really dont know. My nose job is getting to me. My lack of online matches is getting to me. My age is getting to me. I dont feel young. I Dont feel pretty. I font feel hot. I dont feel beautiful. I dont feel loved. I dont feel connected to my friends or family. I have no job. I dont like my body. My whole life sucks and i dont know what to do. And I feel broken. Compeltely broken.

249,"I'm only 21 so I don't have a lot to fall back on here, but both my romantic relationships have involved men that relied on me for mental help. I kinda became a therapist to both of them out of necessity. I should say, I hated it both times. The first was at 17. We were only together 3 months and he revealed he was pretty sure he had depression. He seemed really happy and romantic when we first met and I was so happy. It all came crashing down and he never wanted to see me anymore, he was too depressed but would still meet friends etc. I kept telling myself if I just stayed patient/supportive enough he would treat me like he used to. Needless to say that never happened.  

I'm still in a 2 year relationship but sadly I feel it needs to end even if I still love him minus his illness. He has never seen a professional either and acted so happy and normal for the first 6/7 months. Then he  developed OCD of the constant confessing, I don't care how you feel just let me share all my mean or intrusive thoughts 24/7 kind. I was initially really sorry for him and tried but I got burned out and little has changed in 1.5 yrs. I still am holding on in case he magically decides to get help and we can be like we were those first 6 months or during the 8/9 months he acted normally last year. I'm in a really bad place and have became almost as anxious as he has. I get panic attacks and all now (yay!!). I was reading about codependency and saviour complexes and their link to narcissism and now I'm worried I am one because I've turned into some sort of wounded martyr/victim in both. I know I'm not and at the end of the day, its my fault I was too weak to leave sooner or set boundaries, but still I'm worried.

250,"With the modern social media stigma and how abusive friendships are common, I feel like a lot of you are going to say yes so I should probably explain more before people think the worst about this situation. Like many, I didn't have the best childhood and have been left with trauma and social anxiety, I moved to a country I don't speak the language of, and my grades and social anxiety that acts up at school and in doctor appointments,  which are the only times I leave the house other than the occasional walk, often leave me on the verge of panic attacks. The only things that have actually provoked panic attacks are my parents themselves. With quarantine, my friends and I finally have an opening to call after almost losing contact with them in two years. One of these friends is someone who was always there for me, I could always feel welcomed at their house every weekend and I would try to go there as often as possible to avoid being at home when my step-dad would notice I did a job half-assed or forgot to do something. And I can't focus on things for long and my memory was shit so both of those scenarios were are incredibly common. I've been generally going on a call with them from 7 pm-10 pm my time which is the morning for all of them. The reason why this wouldn't work for them before the quarantine is because they would be in school. In these calls, my friend often checks up on me, asks how, I'm holding up, walking me through childhood memories to let go of them. They are basically my therapy. During these calls, we are often doing schoolwork or just chatting about life and playing online games like among us or scribble charades. My Mother Dearest wants me to start getting off the call around 8 saying that talking to people is bad for my mental health and doesn't help with my sleep. I disagree in fact I would say the opposite. This is the only social interaction I can get that isn't anxiety-inducing and in a language I don't understand, they help me relieve anxiety and since I am an introvert talking with them helps me wind down and lose pent-up energy and when I do look at screens during these calls it's with a blue light filter so screens wouldn't be adding too much damage to my sleep cycle.

255,"Thankfully, *AGE UK* is doing their very best to prevent this from happening, especially towards older people. For millions of people, the year of 2020 has been a terrifying and isolating year. Before the pandemic began, the rates of loneliness within older people was at a high number. Now, due to the virus spreading around the whole World, the crisis has intensified. 

Now, we‚Äôre in December, Christmas time. A time for everyone to get together and enjoy each other‚Äôs company with gifts, presents and love. But, this year, it‚Äôs completely different. Many families members are not able to see one another, epically older elderly people. Because of this, they will be spending Christmas alone. *AGE UK* everyday are working hard to relieve the isolation and despair that‚Äôs felt by so many people. The people of *AGE UK* interview 3 elderly people, Roy, Marjorie and Amrita to get their views and opinions on this. (The interviews are available on the AGE UK website, which I will provide to you at the bottom of the post). 

**Roy**

‚Äú*Life is so lonely when you are on your own*‚Äù. Unfortunately, Roy‚Äôs wife, Maggie, lost her life a few years ago. When the pandemic began and was told to self-isolate, not go out and stay in their homes, Roy found himself more shut off from the rest of the World. A few days later, Roy made the brave choice to call *AGE UK* and quickly, they were able to arrange for Roy to have weekly friendships calls through the Telephone  Friendship Service, which they provide. Due to Roy giving *AGE UK* a call, it has made a life-changing difference. When Roy wants someone‚Äôs attention or company, there is always someone there for him when he feels the most alone. 

**Before I continue**.... The *AGE UK*‚Äôs Telephone Friendship Service gives the elderly people the joy of receiving a weekly phone call. During the biggest rise of the pandemic, **AGE UK** saw an incredible 300% increase of the number of older people who requested to have the service. Incredible! 

**Marjorie**

‚Äú*I‚Äôd like to go to sleep on Christmas Eve and not wake up until New Year‚Äôs Day And miss the whole thing*‚Äù. Those are the words of 98 year old, Marjorie. She currently has health problems that already make her life difficult, now with the threat of COVID-19 and further restrictions, Christmas is looking harder for Marjorie. Thankfully, just like Roy, Marjorie got in contact with *AGE UK*. She is currently having her weekly calls with AGE UK‚Äôs Telephone Friendship Service. Marjorie loves having regular conversations and she enjoys telling the *AGE UK* team that is feels like that there are people in the room with her again, which is lovely to hear. 

**Before I continue...** The *AGE UK*‚Äôs Advice Line is now available for people and open 365 days a year, including Christmas Day. They decided to do this as elderly people would then have somebody to turn to when they start to feel lonely on Christmas Day. If you, or you know somebody who needs some support and have a general chat with, *AGE UK* is available for you. Call the number at - 0800 678 1602. It is completely free, and it‚Äôs available from 8am to 7pm! 

**Amrita**

Amrita is a 92 year old woman, she has found the pandemic to be extremely difficult as she loves to be around and in the company of other people. Due to the pandemic, this doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case. At times, due to nobody being there for her, she decides to start talking to herself to feel like there is somebody there for her. Once again, the brilliant Telephone Friendship Service has helped Amrita greatly. They have made her rediscover the joy of having a conversation with someone. She also added that once she picks up the phone to talk to her brand new friend, she can barely stop talking. Well done Amrita! 

If ever was a time for *AGE UK*‚Äôs services to be needed, it is **now**. Seeing older people suffering alone isn‚Äôt nice to see. This is why *AGE UK* is doing everything in their power to prevent this from happening. But, in order to continue this over Christmas, they are asking for the smallest of donations possible, so that they are able to help the elderly people who need it the most. 

*YOUR DONATIONS MATTER*. Here are 2 facts about your donations:

- *AGE UK* have answered 140,871 calls for help to their advice line. 
- They have supported a MASSIVE 316,000 friendship calls to lonely, older people. 

You can donate as much or as little as you possible want. But, here is what your money could help with: 

- ¬£10 = Pay to answer two calls to their Advice Line from older people needing information and some reassurance to cope with the long-term impact of this pandemic

- ¬£20 = ¬£20 will help to pay for regular calls to some of the most vulnerable people in the communities

- ¬£25 = Can pay to answer not 1, not 2, not 3, not 4, but 5 calls to their Advice Line from older people who are in need of information and reassurance. 

- ¬£100 = Lastly, the big one. ¬£100 will help *AGE UK* campaign to ensure older people‚Äôs voices are heard at the heart of the government, as the society moves forward. 

To donate, head on over to *AGE UK*‚Äôs website, click on ‚Äúget involved‚Äù and donate as much or as little as you please. :) As I always say, if you do manage to donate something, thank you very much for your generosity. If you‚Äôre not able to, that‚Äôs completely acceptable and fine, but would you be able to share *AGE UK*‚Äôs network to others, wherever you are! :) 

Nobody deserves to spend Christmas on their own. Christmas is time for family, something we all have. If you‚Äôre alone during Christmas and you‚Äôre in need of someone to talk to, don‚Äôt hesitate to message me or anyone on the (r/mentalhealth) sub. As you are aware, my PM‚Äôs are always open for a chat, advice, help and support. If you‚Äôre in need of a chat over the Christmas holidays, I‚Äôm more than happy to provide you with it. :) 

Keep safe, keep your head up and we‚Äôll get through this together. 

Thank you all!",10Dec2020,1

257,"For context, she ended all forms of physical contact at the start of the pandemic. She eventually distanced herself until the point of daily silence. I did my best to keep her peace by not giving her anxiety attacks with the thought of me possibly infecting her. Eventually she would only talk to me or FaceTime when she needed emotional support. Months of not having my emotions validated made me defensive and i slowly became more cold. 

She told me she had caught Covid a month ago and that thankfully her whole family was okay, only when i asked how she was recently. 

Immediately after reading her text, i started to spiral down.

2 years of what i thought was a good relationship and I didn‚Äôt even deserve to know you might‚Äôve died? After all the sacrifices i made to give her the space she requested and protect her from myself. I found out after our break up that she would hang out with a mutual friend that introduced us and reasoned that if her brother was okay, then she must be too, even though both me and our friend worked fast food at the time.

The constant depression and abandonment issues that were creeping back in me didn‚Äôt catch my attention until months after when my defenses faded away. She didn‚Äôt trust me at the beginning of covid until the very end.

I knew she was narcissistic because i would always change for her, but my request were either too much for her at the time or she only temporarily fixed it and went back to her ways.

Turns out it was worse than i thought, she dropped me to focus on herself which would normally be socially acceptable but i constantly considered her emotions before my own. I loved her and wanted her to be happy before myself, turns out she didn‚Äôt feel the same way when we faced adversity.

I just wanted to get this out and see if maybe this could help those who went through similar ordeals.

This morning I had a shower and then tried to fix the mistakes I made! There are chunks of my hair that are slightly shorter or slightly longer. I did a very bad attempt at feathering the front side bits last night which I'm not going to bother doing anything with. Also I have no clue how people cut their own hair, fixing the back is impossible.

I have somehow managed to hide this from my mum so far but I am dreading the moment i have to admit that in a moment of insanity I just started hacking at my hair.

I feel worthless, inconsequential and disgusted. I wanted to throw up all day.

**What happened?**

Yesterday I learned that a girl I had a relationship with a few years ago had been using me and was making fun of me behind my back. This is not something that surprised me, but I did not know what had continued long after we break. When we were together she used to be aggressive with me and make hurtful jokes at my expense plus she always acted different when we were alone or with her friends.

Her ex-boyfriend before me published a series of conversations from when she and I were together in which she wrote him how disgusting and disposable I was for her. I fully understand that my feelings were not reciprocal, but I don't understand the contempt.

**A bit of background**

We met when we were 16 years old. Her ex-boyfriend at the time was about 21 years old. When they met she was 14 years old, and he groomed her for two years. She once told me that he tried to rape her, and yet she kept having feelings for him and seeing him.

We were together for half a year. Some time has passed since we break but I keep thinking about that and that sh\*t keeps affecting me in my new relationships. I would like to know if she was intentionally using me or was just equally confused.

**What I feel?**

First I think i don't deserve to fell bad about myself because she obviously had been through worse things.

I want to talk to someone, but I don't understand why or what for. I don't have any friends and I'm too disconnected of my family that I don't know if they will care or understand.

Yesterday I felt vitalized and wanted to exercise, I had a terrible need to be hit in the center of the stomach and put pressure on my chest. Today I tried to exercise and I feel like I couldn't breathe. Today I didn't want to eat, I just wanted to vomit.

I hope to feel better in a few days but I don't know how. Maybe time will help me forget but I don't know I want that or if I will continue to recall this memory over and over. I would like to see a therapist to find health, but I have no money and I don't know how his diagnosis will affect me. I don't know what emotions I am feeling or if what I think I want is distorted by my emotion.

Till what I know she had driven her life to the hedonism and doesn't care abut people opinion of her actions, but she keeps talking about mental health and healthy relationships. I fell angry every time she talks about that, like someone who is in the position to judge other people or if she ever cares about the hurt she makes.

I just need another mind to think about this because mine is too immerse in it and I can't trust in my ideas.

266,"Hi, I am a 24 years old human and I often feel sad and I would love to change that about me. I am looking into therapies but the good ones are the ones that I cannot afford. There are many personal reasons that causes me to be sad, angry, hateful. It ranges from myself to relationships and career. It angers me that I have so much to express but I still haven‚Äôt found the medium to do it. Wish I had something to spend hours on that helps me express my emotions and that could sustain my livelihood too. Sometimes I wish I could take my brain out of my head and let it rest for a day or two. 80% of my problems are due to my habit of overthinking and over analyzing everything. I desperately want to be happy and have fun but every time I try to socialize with others it leaves me feeling exhausted and I don‚Äôt want to feel this way. If I cannot connect with people on an emotional level I naturally feel distant from them and it prevents me from befriending them. The person that I am dating doesn‚Äôt try to love me and cannot understand me and I desperately need someone to hold me in their arms right now and tell me that I am beautiful and loved. Sometimes I miss my mother who I never had a chance to try to love and understand her. She passed away last year. I have no career path. As I have mentioned above I don‚Äôt know what to do with it. I try everything and everything interests me but bores me easily too. I genuinely want to help people but feel disappointed when it goes under appreciated and more disappointed in myself because I feel this way. I feel overwhelmed and anxious when given too many options and no correct directions. I feel like I am over sensitive about things of life and I don‚Äôt want to be this way. I always felt ugly on the inside and outside. Didn‚Äôt appreciate how I am created physically. It Feels sad instantly when I see myself in pictures and start thinking ‚Äúwow, I am so ugly!‚Äù and a few years ago a dentist extracted my teeth that didn‚Äôt need extraction and it made my smile even uglier now. Don‚Äôt know what to do about it. I cannot afford transplant and want to sue that dentist. Some things are significant and some are insignificant but either way I feel like I am losing at life. I want to be free and let go of my ego, anger, hate and anxiety. Thank you for reading. :)",10Dec2020,1

269,"My parents are both mentally ill. My mother has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression 10 years ago, when I was still a kid. Since then she is going to therapy and is taking medication.
I believe my father also has some kind of depression, although he is not diagnosed because he does not want to go to therapy because he believes he is so miserable that nothing would help.

Since the divorce 2 years ago things have escalated quickly. Everyone's mental health has worsened and I think I have depression as well since I sometimes feel that unbearable sadness and fear. Although it just started because of the divorce.

I really am afraid of losing my parents. I'm not living in my home town right now because I go to a university far away. My father has talked to me about how he though about suicide a year ago and since then I understood how messed up everything is. 

I can't talk to them about my mental issues, since I fear that it would put them under even more stress which would worsen everything. 

I'm 22, but I feel like a kid that has no home and noone to seek protection from. I want to start therapy, but I hate that I have to be the one taking care of things. I can't bare to think that especially my father could someday just be gone.

I don't know where to go and where I can find my security.

Does anyone have similar issues? How do I get my family out of that?",10Dec2020,1
270,"
Partner has ocd (diagnosed several years ago, still on meds and goes to therapy). At the beginning of our relationship (abt 1 year ago) I would consider myself mentally healthy but as we‚Äôve grown closer I‚Äôve realized some striking similarities between what he describes as traits of mental illness and things I do and have always thought of as normal. Some examples
1. Before him I didn‚Äôt know that ocd could be pure obsession over something for days on end. This happens to me all the time. I‚Äôve obsessed over whether I was pregnant (when we weren‚Äôt even sexually active yet and the test was neg), whether I have free will, and one really awful spiral I now recognize has traits of pocd. This is just to name a few
2. I get these sharp, disturbing thoughts out of nowhere . Doesn‚Äôt happen all the time and usually relates to a certain subject matter I don‚Äôt want to mention but it definitley bothers me
3. I think really, really strange things and don‚Äôt know how to recognize that they‚Äôre probably irrational. For example a friend asked for my address today (most likely for a surprise Xmas thing) but I couldn‚Äôt get out of my head that they had realized something about me I hadn‚Äôt realized about myself and were sending authorities after me. Rationally, I was able to get out of that before it spiraled but it was hard.
4. While I on some level realize these are probably related to some form of ocd, even on a mild level, I keep obsessing that I‚Äôm making the whole thing up and blowing it out of proportion. This is what has stopped me from bringing it up with my partner: fear that I‚Äôve got it all wrong and he‚Äôll think I‚Äôm trying to leech of his identity or something.

I am 20 years old (would rather not disclose my gender) but I've been living in an abusive dysfunctional household for as long as I remember. I won't get into the details but my relationship with my parents is built on fear, on punishment and stuff. And before I didn't think much of it, but the full realisation of how much that relationship and the events I've gone through have had an effect on me have left me feeling hollow for three years now. I get extremely scared, antsy and panicky whenever my dad gets angry ‚Äî which happens so often its a daily occurrence, over every little thing. I need to be perfect to show them I'm worth their time, but all I get from them is a short compliment. I haven't once celebrated my birthday in four years. I haven't been congratulated and celebrated even when I graduated high-school and got good grades in university. And lately I'm so panicky I can't sleep, I keep looking out for my parents, so I could leave the room if they're around, or to avoid them. And I've been in this depressive episode for months now. I won't go on, this isn't a vent, but is this all normal? I feel like I'm exaggerating it all.

273,"Since I was 8 I have had a savings account with money saved from birthdays, babysitting,past minimum wage jobs, etc. I saved up to 10 thousand dollars in my savings! I was really proud of myself and so were my parents... so I thought.
April of last year my first year in college, I was paying off my credit card on my banking app, I saw in my savings that I only had 1 thousand dollars instead of 10. I panicked thinking I was hacked or someone spent it all. I checked the history of my savings. (Mind you my parents have access to my account to put money in) and it said my dad took it. The next day I called my parents up and asked about the money. They answer they gave me was vague. My dad said it was for taxes. Then when I asked my mom she said she needed the money to get alone to buy property. 
When my parents came to visit I told them they I didn‚Äôt like the fact that they took money from me with our asking and they basically stole from me. My dad got really defensive and said, ‚Äúout of anybody, why do you think your own parents that haven don‚Äôt everything for you steal from you?‚Äù.
So sort have devised a plan to get the money back. I asked my parents for the money to buy a car. Immediately they gave me my dad‚Äôs old 2010 rav 4, never asked me how much they wanted it for and took 8 thousand dollars out of my savings. 
A friend of mine who is knowledgeable in cars said the rav would be 6 thousand dollars according to the condition and mileage. I told my parents this. The got defensive, they said ‚Äúwe gave you the car cheap! If we were to sell the car ourselves, we would sell it for 14K dollars!‚Äù. I thought that amount is kinda high for a used decade old car.
Idk what to do at this point. Am I the ungrateful one? Am I not seeing something my parents are seeing?

280,"So I need some help to figure out what happened. I have speculation it might be D.I.D ,but I'm not too sure. little bit of info on me: I'm a 16yo turning 17 in jan I have autism and adhd clinical depression and anxiety.

So allow me to get into a few odd occurrences I have 

Ok, this is the first one I'll be discussing I've had minor episodes before this one this one has to be the most extreme one I have had. 

I was in the office of my school clinician. I don't remember what it was we were discussing , but it was definitely something somewhat upsetting. After a few minutes of talking I remember feeling really dizzy and the world almost turning I started freaking out and said ""JOSH"" (which is my clinicians name) Sooner or later I ""wake up?"" in a different area of the room. I was originally sitting at the table the chair facing towards the door and pushed to the side. But this time the chair was facing josh and I was too. I look down and there's notes evvverrywhere the notes were according to Josh. Made by me I pick one up and I immediately don't recognize the hand writing. Josh proceeds to explain after I said his name I suddenly froze and looked up at him and ran to hide between the chair I was sitting in and the wall and I started crying and talking like a child. I kept jumping every time I heard a loud noise (Loud noises are common in my school since it is for children and young adults with autism). He then said I slowly came back to sit in the chair but I was different I was instead like a man like Spanish or Italian or something? He then told me I spoke to him but then switched to note communication hence the notes. 

I don't really know if it's d.i.d I have like dissociation but idk about the identity part I have other minor occurrences where I'd be on a discord call and ""shift"" One of my ""alts""(I'm putting quotations cause I don't really know if it's d.i.d but I've been calling them this so) came out and said they were Maddie/ Maddison my friend kia pointed out that she had this odd child like hand movement where she'd shake them in the air and stutter and trip on her words a lot so I assume she's a kid ""alt"" or something then I have another who goes by Blau he normally texts and doesn't speak out loud but sometimes he talks to me?  Like out loud and we talk he's like 34 or something. Then there's Adam who's a regular among us. He's like a guardian every time my family argues with me he comes out. Or anything generally bad. Most of this info is from my friends but sometimes I remember vague things that happen. 

Just today I was doing the dishes then I come back again and see I'm almost done and theres a knife and a cup on the table I didn't know if it was dirty since my family sometimes leaves things out so I didn't touch it. 

I also have an old journal with someone named Roxxy which none of my friends know. I also have drawings Adam did of my character Jesse I can do a comparison of my artstyle and his. He never makes a sketch layer he sketches and morphs it into the lineart. I have video of that. I can try posting the art in the comments or something.",10Dec2020,1

This is rooted in my very early childhood, difficult events in my early childhood and it continued all the way till my late twenties. 
I spoke with a senior therapist to evaluate me, and she said that only dynamic psycho therapist can help with such deep rooted issues, and that my severe reactions on abandonment are like a taught instinct or reflex. Which is a good valid description of how I actually feel so I agree with her. 
Her speciality is dynamic psycho therapy. But she her self wouldn‚Äôt be my therapist, so there is no financial motive for her to say what she said.

Hi,

Recently has been a very difficult time for me, I am 19 and haven't faced many mental health problems but I am now at a point where i feel extremely overwhelmed.

I have developed an extreme fear of the idea of death, this is both the idea of the everlasting darkness and emptiness of death after you die alongside a fear that a family member of mine may die soon. I have lost sleep and appetite as my mind is only orientated around this idea of death. I try to distract myself but its near impossible that this thought doesnt come back soon. Epsically now with Covid being around, it appears every 24 hours you get the update of how real death is.

I feel like mostly any issue in life in fixable, i.e reparing a car, fixing a relationship, working towards stopping an addiciton. But any way i try to approach this idea of death, it isnt a fixable issue. Death is going to occur regardless and the idea of this is terrifying me.

Essentially, I am reaching out to see if anyone themselves has been through this and what has helped them. Frankly, I am desperate and need help with this issue. I've been in contact with a counselor but the weekly sessions have been meeting my needs and my fear isn't getting any better,

291,"I feel as if I lost all motivation in life. I‚Äôm 21 years old, and I feel so behind. All my peers know they are at least good at something, while I feel as if I don‚Äôt have anything I‚Äôm ‚Äúgood‚Äù at. I used to have a passion for drawing, I even got myself a good drawing tablet, and yet I lost all drive to draw. It has been months since I last drew often. I‚Äôve made a piece two weeks ago and that made me incredibly happy; but it was just a rare occasion. I feel as if I have to start all over again, and I dont know if I have the strength to do so. Why try anyway? There‚Äôs tons of people, especially younger, that are way better than me already. Why add my insignificant art to the mass?

i emphasize on this aspect because it was my dream to gain a little following on a social network, open my little shop, and maybe earn something from my art. I don‚Äôt see the point in doing that anymore,

but apart from my art, what else do I have? I‚Äò m bad at everything else. I‚Äôm even a bad gamer.

i feel so unmotivated.",10Dec2020,1
292,"I have always thought myself as ‚Äòsuper resilient‚Äô when it comes to problems in life.  I was raised in a faith-based cult my whole childhood, turned around and joined the military.  I‚Äôve always been that person who can ‚Äòfind a way to say yes‚Äô, even at the detriment of my own self-worth and my own self-esteem. I had the mantra of the Spartans from *300* where my ‚Äòshield‚Äô is for the person to the left and right of me, to take care of my family and friends as best as possible.

You get told that ‚Äòyou‚Äôre a better person than I am‚Äô, then they proceed to tell you how they would handle it because they‚Äôre ‚Äòselfish‚Äô or ‚Äòhaughty‚Äô when I would just go with the flow, or do something to help someone else.

Some see it as me being helpful and understanding (which is how I see it as well), but others see it as being spineless.

And sometimes it gets a bit too much.

I give, and share, and mentor, and solve for X, but I don‚Äôt feel like anyone does that for me.

The worst thing I think I could be called is ‚Äòselfish‚Äô or ‚Äòrude‚Äô because I‚Äôm so used to making things equal around me where everyone is happy.

I‚Äôm just worried that this will leave me a shrivelled old man with nothing left to give in my older years.",10Dec2020,1

294,"Possible trigger warning. 

I‚Äôve been professionally diagnosed with ADHD, A-typical anxiety disorder. and I have an extreme tendency for panic attacks 

About a year ago I was having some fun at my local lake. It was pretty normal. But while I was swimming I started feeling very tight and it was hard to move. Consequently I sank underwater and couldn‚Äôt swim up. In my panicked state I ended up blacking out. I don‚Äôt remember how long I was out but I do remember waking up about 15 feet underwater on the bottom of a lake. I continued panicking and I felt more alone then than any other time in my life. It was horribly traumatizing. I ended up snapping out of it and swimming to the surface. 

I was ok, but ever since then, whenever I am alone. There‚Äôs about a 50/50 chance I‚Äôll get a panic attack which I believe combines with mild schizophrenia. I‚Äôll begin feeling like I‚Äôm underwater again and I hold my breath not wanting to breathe. I‚Äôll see bubbles trickling out of my nose and I get incredibly cold. The only thing that helps is if I manage to call a friend and they talk with me. Also wrapping myself in a blanket helps. I‚Äôm already heavily medicated and was curious if anyone else out there knew tricks to calm themselves. Water is incredibly relaxing for me and having panic attacks about it almost daily is tearing me apart.",10Dec2020,1

296," My grandmother claims stink bugs are constantly attacking and spraying her. Every few minutes she'll say, ""Did you hear that? There it was!"" and will start swatting at her head. She claims they are flying around her house all the time. This has been happening for a while, but today it has gotten very serious. Just all of the time. ""There it was!"" I have been at her house (next door to mine) a lot the past few days and have watched her and everything. There are no signs of these bugs. If she asks me if I heard it, I say no, as I did not hear anything. My parents are considering not letting her live by herself anymore as she has clearly gone crazy. I'm not sure what is going on. ***I am not asking for a diagnosis or anything like that. I just wondered if anyone might know something about this or could help in any way, maybe giving me some tips to help her until the issue either goes away or she sees a doctor. I am new to this subreddit but thought someone might have an answer.*** Thank you for any help in advance.",10Dec2020,1

298,"I had a rough night last night( and week) and I thought today  would be better. I‚Äôm not happy anymore. Little things seem to upset me and I‚Äôm overly sensitive sometimes and I hate it.

(Also Long distance)But I should be happy because we‚Äôll finally be together in a few months. But I feel like my happy high about that is over. I‚Äôm not able to be strong anymore. Now I‚Äôm stuck feeling lonely, I forgot my earbuds so I have to listen to my sad thoughts and I end up making myself cry. How can I do this for 11 more weeks?

299,"I have my good days and my bad days. But not a day goes by without me feeling like I‚Äôm ashamed of myself. I‚Äôm really sad and upset. I stopped talking a lot of people. I quit my clubs. My grades dropped.
All the terrible intrusive and terrible thoughts in my head are eating me alive, and I don‚Äôt want to go through this. I‚Äôm scared people won‚Äôt understand me and think this is something I want. I don‚Äôt. I tired of being stressed every single minute. I feel like I can‚Äôt even control my thoughts and my brain is my worst enemy.
OCD really sucks and I wish I never had it. It‚Äôs really terrible, and I want out of this terrible illness. The stigma on mental health is the only reason I don‚Äôt speak out on my experiences to my friends.",10Dec2020,1
300,"just a heads up, english isn't my first language  
I've been used to this weird feeling, like something is very wrong when I start talking about the things I like or enjoy, but I can't relly put my finger on it. Each time, in a casual conversation, that I start talking of a game I'm playing, or a proyect I started, I begin to shake, like fear or anxiety ?. But it doesn't make any sense, I have no problem talking to people!  
I've been used to this feeling for a long time now, but the thing is  it started to damage my personal life, I cant decor my room, I can't show interest, I can't even have a background of anything specific I enjoy, because of fear OF SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW EVEN IF IT IS FEAR?

I just wanted to ask here to check if there is a name for this, I tryed googling but found nothing. Thank you in advance for reading.",10Dec2020,1

303,"I'll just cut to the point I really don't wanna waste your time here.  I actually don't know how to explain this but uuh I basically have this constant emotion of ''Nothing.'' What I am trying to say here is that I think starting from my high school years I haven't been able to feel any sort of a strong emotion. I don't feel sad, depressed or happy, angry and I don't remember the last time I had any of those emotions and whatsoever.I only feel tired and when I get some caffeine in my system I am energetic and that's basically all I feel and I wouldn't call them ''emotions.'' My life has become ''exhausting'' I feel like every activity I do is like an assignment that I am obliged to do. The activities I used to enjoy doing, they all have become less and less enjoyable.It's like at this point my brain just refuses to feel any kind of emotion but tiredness. I just want to feel something be it sadness or happiness. At this point I am just down for anything, I don't know what you call what I am going through right now and surely I don't know whether it's a good thing or not. At this rate, I think I'll never be able to fall in love, cry during a relative's funeral, laugh with friends. Is there anyway to solve this problem? Or what did you do if you had to go through something similar to this. I am 19 years old and I think I should be able to feel something, anything like other people at my age.",10Dec2020,1
304,"So sometimes I get convinced that I‚Äôm in danger like the other day I was out and I noticed a black cloud next to a cloud of white clouds and thought it was moving faster than the other clouds so I had to leave because I was getting anxious. Given that I‚Äôm writing this and recognize it as a delusion it isn‚Äôt a complete delusion. It was more real at the time but even then I was constantly trying to tell myself it‚Äôs just a cloud relax but I wasn‚Äôt convinced.

I also have derealization sometimes with leaving my body included and I‚Äôm convinced that if I stay out of my body for too long I‚Äôll die. I have trouble sleeping because every time I almost drift off my consciousness/soul leaves my body and I have to wake myself up because I get scared that I‚Äôm going to die or a demon will appear.

Sometimes I‚Äôm convinced people are following me or want to kill me. I‚Äôm also convinced that stars are aliens sometimes because sometimes they act weird. And I also think that I have seen some flying saucers. I‚Äôm hoping they are just military drones though. If I‚Äôm out at night and the clouds/sky turn pink/orange I need to leave immediately or I‚Äôll be abducted by aliens.

I know it sounds ridiculous and in retrospect it is ridiculous but at the time I‚Äôm completely convinced this is real or kind of real. I think the reason I can kind of recognize things as delusions sometimes is because I don‚Äôt feel like anything is real. I feel like everything is a dream. So the alien abduction thing seems more real than the rest of the world but it still feels like a dream. Does that make sense?",10Dec2020,1
305,"I don‚Äôt know but I feel like my friend group does not like me and it‚Äôs been festering in my mind since last November. 
Basically November time, me and my friends went to have a talk. They said that when I was off, they were more popular and said I should change my personality.

308,"So I always knew that I had it. I was well aware!
But everyone thinks that I‚Äôm away, happy and living my best life. Whereas I‚Äôve been secretly miserable and not realising the extent of it myself.
I feel like I have been exposed, but in a way that I feel like I‚Äôm wallowing in my own self pity and it‚Äôs coming across as ‚ÄúI‚Äôm depressed I‚Äôm allowed to be sad‚Äù 

And I feel like now that it is confirmed and ‚Äúout there‚Äù that I now have that mindset that I can use it as an excuse! 

Also now that my family are aware they just don‚Äôt want to accept it and avoid it because my sister has bad depression and she has bad reactions to things. And they‚Äôre like ‚Äúoh not you too‚Äù
Like I‚Äôm allowed to be upset, me and the counsellor got to the source of it which has been constantly brought up and a breakup has sent me into this downward spiral.
And they think I‚Äôm depressed because of the breakup and not because of the actual reason.
It feels like they think I will just get over it.
