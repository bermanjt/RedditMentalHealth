0,I feel like the only option I have is to be dead because I’m tired. I’m tired of trying anymore I’m tired of everything I’m tired of having to feel so awful whenever I have to reach out to a close friend because I don’t have anyone. And then they have to hear everything I say and get disappointed in me whenever they check up on me because if I lie then that just makes me seem a certain way but if I tell them the truth that I’m not okay then it’s just like I’m still at the same point and I haven’t put in any effort to get better. But I feel like I’m suffocating I feel like this is how it’s going to be because I feel like I have no potential for anything in my life and I just hurt people around me. But I don’t want to die because I’ll hurt people more. I just want the pain to be gone I want to live for once,03Jun2020,3

3,"I can't bring myself to pick up the FUCKIN PHONE and call for help. I've sort of gotten used to being the rock in somebody's life, and I *will not fail*.

I got in some legal trouble and I think if I just tell the truth to a therapist/shrink, and also to a lawyer, then they're going to let me out scott free. (Which in my opinion is *bullshit* but if I go away.... Might as well just jam a samurai sword in my gut).

I'm scared, and I'm hoping somebody might help walk me through it.

The *worst* part is that it's gonna have to be over the phone... Meaning I can chicken out and hang up anytime... I don't know if that's just me fooling myself but it feels like a brick wall.

Help.....?",03Jun2020,1

5,"I had a really shitty weak mentally. Constantly thinking negative thoughts, feeling worthless and the works. 
I've had major trouble getting over my ex (it's been 3 years and i still want to get her back). 
Feelings of jealousy of other people's lives, shifting into anger. 
I tried writing it out today and it had a line about how a fucking friend had more success on tinder. 

I sent the document to my therapist and the friend in question. Now i worry that might damage the friendship... 

At the end of the day i've fallen back into some of the habits i've tried to leave behind (excessive masturbation,  not having a sleep ritual, sleeping at late hours, screentime before sleep, drinking alcohol) 

My mind was ruminating so badly that a real sense of dread was setting in. I have only this friend that i trust, and i feel like i am becoming more bitter and egotistical and mean lately. 

I'm trying so hard to become better but i can't...",03Jun2020,1

Dear Mom and Dad,

    I didn't want this.  I didn't want to have to say goodbye like 
 this, but I cannot continue.  I am no longer the person that I once   was.  You may not have seen it or wanted to admit it, but it's true.    The old me is long gone, and I don't know what happened to him,   but I firmly it's due to my undiagnosed head injuries.  I am   broken.  I hate to admit it, but for the past 5 or 6 years I have   simply been putting on a facade of happiness. And as you know, I   have broken down many times, simply because I could not muster   the strength to act as normal and ""happy"" as possible.  I mourn   the loss of my former self consistently, and I fondly reflect on the   years when I was an upbeat and optimistic kid.  I used to be so  
creative and would love to engage and be with you guys.  Nothing   about you guys has changed, its just that I cannot empathize and   relate to people anymore.  Human interaction is a laborious task   for me, and I am unable to connect and feel with others.  I feel   this is also why I have never had a girlfriend, or able to care for   Joey, I am emotionally incapable. I am really sorry about Joey,   Mom and Dad.  I was never the brother that I should have  been...he never did anything to me, it's just that whenever I am   with him I feel NOTHING, just emptiness, and awkwardness. The   only feelings I can feel are sadness, anger, discontent, and fear.   Yet, I remember I was once so bubbly, loving and full of life. My   ability to perceive positive emotions is destroyed. I go from sun up   to sun down without an escape from my pain.  I drink, I smoke, I   sit for hours and hours in the backroom to make myself feel at   least marginally better, but to no avail.  It all makes so much   sense, the head traumas.  Running into the glass at the library as   a kid, the pogo stick over the cement, the ski lift in Lake Tahoe,   and countless others. It all has had a cumulative effect on my   psyche.  From the injuries sustained as a kid, came the unyielding   mental illness which plagued me for the majority of my life, OCD.    Born from that illness were my sleeping, breathing, swallowing,   and anorexia issues.  Then later in my life, the intense depression   and anxiety.  I am not living, I am simply just existing day by day.    The entire course of my life was thrown off because of hitting my   head.  I am numb.  I shouldn't be working at Infosys, and I   shouldn't of attended CCSU.  I engaged in both because I thought   it was the right thing to do, and I wanted to make you guys happy,   not because I wanted to do it.  At graduation, which was supposed   to be one of the most uplifting and exciting times in my life, I felt   almost no happiness.  This all feels like a bad dream, and I have   been in denial for years believing that maybe, just maybe, this   was all in my head.  I have realized that it is all real, all the pain,   all of the misery, everything.  Living a fake life, with a fake   personality, is not right for you guys and for me.   I am sorry that  It has to turn out like this, but carrying on like this for the rest of   my natural life would be misery.  I love you guys....even if I can't   experience love like I was was once capable of. I love Joey,   Grandma, Bo, all of my Aunts, Uncles, cousins, and friends.  Please   relay this message to those people, and to whoever you feel is   appropriate. Also, please have my brain examined and/or donated   to research. I want you to have answers as to what exactly went   wrong with me, and I want Neurology to have a better grasp on   the emotional impact of TBI.  By donating my brain, I will have   had some meaning to my short life, and have provided something   of value to the world. If there is a god, I will see you all in the next   chapter.  I hope to be in a better place, and to experience freedom   for the first time in a while. Goodbye Mom and Dad.

7,"After having failed both SSRIs and mood stabilizers in an attempt to treat my depression, my psych prescribed me an SNRI (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors). I have never even heard of this class of drugs before so I was just wondering if anyone here has had any success with them. The brand she gave me is called Venlafaxine ER if that helps.",03Jun2020,1
8,"Don't say you're the one who cares. It's literally impossible for you to care individually about someone you know nothing about. Maybe you care about the idea of depressed/suicidal people. You can care about us as a group but you can't possibly care about *me* and you can't convince me otherwise. You say the same thing to other people on here and other mental health subs. Caring about depressed people as a whole and me as an extension of that is cool but it doesn't mean you care if I in particular die, any more or less than anyone else.




I want somebody to care about *me* and nobody does or ever will. Not a single person would be affected negatively by my death and actually a ton of people would be affected positively by it. Only reason anyone would care is the just sheer inconvenience of it. My work being down a person, my family being obligated to arrange a funeral or whatever (even though I say I really don't want one they'll have to cover their asses with one to pretend they cared), the bank not getting my payments anymore, etc. Nobody would *actually* care and that's final.",03Jun2020,1

12,"I don’t know how to pass this. My life’s image for a future keeps changing and I just don’t know what I truly want in life, or I do but I feel I’ve already missed those chances and can’t go back now. 

I’m unemployed and Dream is to blog and write. I want passion from life. I want to not be able to stop smiling like when getting on a rollercoaster ride. My mind hurts so much and I’m terrified to even admit it to anyone. I have a son and his dad is a pos who isn’t consistent and unreliable. I try to keep pushing through but how can my son be happy when his mom doesn’t even have the drive to get off the couch? To even smile? And then the thought “you’re mom isn’t coming back” and I start bawling my eyes out looking at him. I try to grasp reality again and realize I need to get a job and make money.. back to 9-5 and feeling utterly unsatisfied in life. 

Meanwhile, there’s an unresolved tense in the air from my boyfriend because I’m trying to work on myself. I have a strong, strong, codependency towards relationships.. I’m recognizing this and mentioned it to him.. because I didn’t want to go with him to visit his mom up north this weekend he says it’s suspicious.. what’s the prrovlem with wanting to spend the weekend together and had envisioned myself and son having a blast in her pool etc... all sounds great but I just don’t want to.. I’m self conscious about my stomach so I don’t want to go into the water especially around people I’m not totally comfortable with.. my son gives me a hard time and I can become overwhelmed, that’s vulnerable for me and don’t want to show it, the bed is extremely uncomfortable and no idea where my son would sleep... 

Idk. I have a huge choice to make to end things and focus only on myself and my son but that terrifies me.. I look to please others and hear their view point to determine how I feel about something and If I organically feel a type of way and it clashes then I change that view point.. Now thinking on being alone and needing to find strength to make enough money to support my son and I and to be able to move out of family’s home.. I just can’t even seeing it being possible. I’m too weak minded. It’s to complicated in here. The world is shit. I’m trying so desperately to hang on and stay alive to raise my son to at least 18/21 but that’s a long time when feeling like this. I’m at a lost for roads... one road I could have regrets and not feel totally related to on a deep level, be alone and crave that human touch and love.. I just want to be loved wholeheartedly and there’s a possibility for that too but comes with a list of it’s own challenges and is it just in my head? I just don’t know. 

My mind is hell. But if I end it.. I believe there is more than what we know and who knows if I’ll suffer an entire other worldly hell so I may as well as suffer here.. I don’t know.. I just want to be taken care of.. but I suppose that’s my problem with codependency...",03Jun2020,1

I just want to sleep. But everytime I lay in bed I wonder about the things I could have done differently. Would my live have been better. I ain't the slimmest person in the world, could I have prevented that? I stopped smoking marijuana about a few months ago and stopped drinking just some weeks ago. No I don't have the urge to drink or smoke. But i just don't know how to feel. Everything feels so gray. And everything feels like a chore. I really want myself to be a better man but I can't even step outside for just 2 seconds. I only go out for my job or some friends who invite me. I just don't know what to do, what to say. Or how to feel. I can't seem to focus my eyes go all over the place or just stare. I catch myself alot during the day staring right through the ground or something like that.

I know it will pass with time (rare but not the first time for me). Right now I just don’t feel i have enough energy to feel anyway about anything. My self care has been so consistent and wonderful lately, I also have been practicing a lot of mindful meditation. Today I’m just not here and I think that’s okay. 

I wonder if others have similar experiences? Where you have no reason not be anything but happy.... yet here you are but not feeling much of anything else either.. 

It’s almost a beautiful, serene silence in my head for once. Devoid of any anxiety for a change of pace personally. I just almost feel ashamed I’m not happy when I have reason more than most to be.

26," i feel even more lonelier than i initially was before signing up and i cant seem to get myself to delete it either because i think i have that fomo crap. in real life i dont have friends so i thought instagram would help but nothing. at this point i really just use it for shopping and reference. i want to delete it but at the same time i cant. i've felt more lonelier than usual. its annoying i hate feeling this way. if im not on ig then im on youtube alot...idk why i feel like if i disconnect i will lose contact of people that i dont even talk to on there or that if i do meet people i cant talk to in real life i cant connect with them online cause nowadays it feels like everyone just wants to communicate through social media and not even direct text messages anymore. i never thought the day would come where i would really miss getting text messages from my classmates everyday especially when texting phones were still popular.

29,"Welp time to ask strangers on the internet for help , here goes nothing 

Ime 20 years old , in the army , I have a stable job and a bright future with my degree path. I just don’t understand why I am so freaking miserable. 

I usually keep my problems to myself and I’ve been in a general state of sadness for 2 years now. It’s not unlivable but I can’t shake it. I can get through my days but it’s always there gnawing at the back of my mind. I don’t remember honestly being truly happy for a while now. I’ve tryed talking to close friends on occasion about it , and sure I’ll feel better for a day or two but it never stays that way and Ide hate to be a burden trying to ask again .Ide tell my parents but the usual response is to man up and I have to many blessings to be sad about things. This had led to me just generally staying quiet and just dealing with it 

This has led to a crippling feeling of loneliness. I deeply miss having a person to talk to . I have small circle of good friends but I just don’t feel like it’s the proper dynamic to bring up my problems.Most days I’ll get through without even talking to people. I usually try to fill the silence with YouTube and music because honastly i think ime afraid to be alone with my own thoughts of anxiety and inadequatetcy . Witch leads to self criticism and doubt . 

Some days I’ll just get through without even feeling at all


I’ve been to a few free therapists ( university provided ) and all of them have said ime fine but I dint understand why I feel so lost and miserable in life. Ide like to talk to an professional therapist but I never had the money to do so 

I hate this so much , I just don’t understand this 

I could elaborate further but I think the point has been made. I’ve tried everything I can think of so far but I can’t live like this for much longer I just can’t ........so thanks .....truley , for any advice you can provide . I need it right now 

Best wishes ,

Most people probably do but what is weirding me out about it is that I get repetitive thoughts of it happening replaying in my head and keep getting the feeling as if I'm about to have a panic attack.

I am 19 years old and have just finished my first year of college and I am struggling to find satisfaction in doing anything at all. When Quarantine initially started I was thinking to myself ""Oh this isn't that bad, video games with the boys every day and no school!"". I later found that I wouldn't be allowed to hang with all my friends that I haven't seen in so long (my spring break was a week prior to everybody else's and social distancing started the proceeding week). Although playing video games and communicating over Discord every day with my friends was fun, I eventually found myself having no enjoyment in gaming at all so I don't even attempt to do so anymore. I tried to stay occupied with swimming in my pool and going on bike rides, but I struggled to make the days feel different from one another.

I'm autistic and that limits my social filter so I often say stuff I shouldn't. I really fucking hate myself for it.

Vented on a discord server. Someone reached out to me. Became acquainted, knew them for about 6 months. Started to get lewd with them, but got a bit too explicit on it. We were both furries; it was more on his character than himself, which I admit was pretty superficial. I probably shouldn't have done it in the first place. Only once did I ever say one time I rubbed one out to their character, and only twice ever did I say I had a small crush on them. (And I asked if I could confess before I said it.) They seemed to tolerate it, but then they told me to stop, I internalized it, felt extremely remorseful, and ceased anything lewd.

One day, months later, they block me out of the blue and expose what I said on twitter, and blocked out my name/profile pic with a clown emoji, ignoring when they told me to stop, and that I apologized and stopped all the activity. I tried writing a lengthy apology about a week later, they didn't even read it and blocked me again.

People are stupid, but I've learned my lesson. I probably shouldn't exist now lol. If my retarded parents found out, they’d likely try to filter my internet and make me miserable instead of getting me the help I need, so I’m keeping this a secret from them and asking where I can get help.

38,I am in my twenties/female. I used to have a very good talent of pushing things I needed to forget to the back of my mind. It’s been working for about 10 years but suddenly this year they have been creeping back.. the worse secrets I have are when I was about 4-7 years old. But the rest are mundane worries and memories like saying the wrong thing 3 years ago to a friend that sort of thing. I can probably live with those and push those back again. But my dark memories from when I was young are stopping me from sleeping and making my heart race giving me the worse anxiety out of nowhere. Why now? After 10 years. I have been thinking of therapy but the thing is I don’t think I can ever speak about those memories. I physically cannot make the words leave my mouth. It will ruin my life. What I am asking is that is anyone else living with a secret and is it possible to live a happy life with one. I wish I could just push it back again like I did before. Maybe I can.

39,"I’m hoping those with some experience can advise me how to deal with severe anxiety caused by my 24 year old son’s psychotic episodes.  He was diagnosed at 19 with schizo affective disorder and has both visual and auditory hallucinations.  It’s been an awful 5 years of repeated hospitalizations, treatments etc but he never sticks with any medication or therapy.  We give him money for weed so at least it keeps him calm most of the time, but it’s supposed to make schizophrenics paranoid.  Even before the pandemic, he did nothing but play video games, sleep and go out for weed.  We’ve been told that he has cognitive disfunctions in addition to the mental illness and that he may never be able to support himself.

Friday morning we woke to the familiar noises of him throwing and banging stuff and he started cursing and screaming at me to stop showing up in his dreams.  He broke things in the kitchen and kept up this horrible rambling that didn’t make sense but the anger was so terrifying.  The anger is what’s new, I’ve never been so afraid.  I left the house while he screamed at me to come back, and I called the emergency mental health services to come over.  My husband stayed at home with him, the anger wasn’t directed at him as much. The police came too, and they all determined that since he calmed down and didn’t threaten to hurt himself or anyone, they wouldn’t be able to take him in.

Well, he calmed down the last few days but when he’s quiet and staring blankly I know he’s hearing and seeing things.  My husband says not to nag and leave him be.  Son said he would take his antipsychotic only if he needed to sleep.  

Now my anxiety is so severe, I can’t sleep and I have to work at home in constant fear that he’ll hurt me or my husband. We lock our door at night but it can easily be kicked in I’m sure.

Things just seem dull and grey and it’s what it’s going to be. I have no thoughts of ending my life, I think I’ve come to terms that the rest of life is going to be cruise control.

I tried to go to a hospital but I wasn’t bad enough for their care (self harm). Now I’ve gotten worse and, yes, I’m 20 days clean but my mind won’t stop spinning and all of this homework has been weighing down on me. My mom is better than my dad but not by much, she is also a major trigger for my anxiety when she yells at me to get my homework done. I need a place where I can get myself back together and strong enough so I don’t have a nervous breakdown every time my mom tells me to get my homework done.

So, here are my questions:

Does it show up on a background check?

If you go to a hospital for mental health reasons, will it affect future jobs/opportunities?

If I get a babysitting job, will people trust me less with their kids because I self harm?

Do both parents have to consent for me to go to a hospital and know which one?

My parents both worked hard their whole life to give us the best opportunity at a successful life.  I’d say we’re probably upper middle class.  

We grew up with great childhoods but the teenage years is where the wheels started to turn. (I’ll keep it about myself though) I always struggled with social anxiety and sometimes a sense of entitlement that sometimes the world was against me.  I didn’t really have that many friends and most of the ones I did have were douchebags that I have nothing in common with now.  Never had a gf, never had sex.

Now, I’m a 19 year old soon-to-be college sophomore with a 3.6 GPA. but no major declared and no passions to help make my decision.  I’ve only had one job for a month that I had to quit due to some conflicts, and I’ve applied to a few with no luck so far.  

A good thing to actually note is that I’ve started working out and have actually been noticing some results 

But still, I just don’t feel like I’m enough.  I don’t have a huge social circle, I’m not out looking for a girlfriend and potential life partner,  and I don’t feel good about my future work life.

I do not have any diagnosed mental health conditions or anything, but I do face a lot of insecurities about myself and have not lived in the most stable of households. I am a college student now, but in high school this started, that sometimes when teachers/random people especially are nice to me, I get really emotional. 

I was reminded about this because I had to go to the hospital the other day (I am okay!) and the nurses were just so nice to be when I felt like they did not need to be. When I got home later that day and the next day, I was just thinking about it and it made me really emotional almost to tears that they were just really nice to me. This same thing has happened to me when teachers or friends go out of their way to say something nice to me.

53,"I'm 20 years old, finished second year of college. Obviously, my second year got cut short because of COVID-19 which absolutely sucked because even though I didn't have to stay in my city for school I had to stay to work my job in retail. My roommates have all gone home to their families, so I've practically been alone for two months save for the few times that I've had a 3-4 day period off where I can go home to family. Before all this started, I was planning on taking two courses to catch up on my degree path, and am currently taking one course online with another starting in a few weeks. 

Unfortunately, things have just gotten to be too much for me. The store I work at is understaffed, and while I need 30 hours in order to pay my bills, I've been scheduled for nearly 40 instead, while also being asked to change shifts around. Between my commute to work and the 8 hour shifts, I am exhausted and feel absolutely no motivation to do anything. No cooking, no schoolwork, I can barely even find the motivation to open Netflix and put on something mindless to watch. I get home and lie in bed until I go to sleep just to wake up the next morning and go to work again. 

Because of this I've gotten behind in my schoolwork. It's one class, I've only gotten notes written for one and a half of my lectures and have been doing the readings on my lunch breaks at work (which is the only reason I have most of them more or less done, though none of the info has stuck too much). I have a midterm coming up tomorrow that I am not at all prepared for, so I am also freaking out over that.

Over the last few days, I've been in either one of two states: either I'm emotionless and just feel numb to everything (mostly when I'm at work) or I'm crying and trying to calm myself down so that I can either study or get to sleep, but then I can do neither because I get so overworked. When I do get sleep, I wake up exhausted and only get out of bed because I know I literally can't afford to not go to work. 

I don't know how much longer I can take this. I get that there is no concrete idea of when everything will go back to ""normal"" in the world, and even then I don't think my roommates are coming back in the fall since our school will be continuing with online courses at that point. I can't continue working these extreme hours at work, but I can't put it all on my coworkers to take my hours since I know they're all overworked there as well.

And although I agree with that, I can't help but feel like it's not enough.

How much do I have to experience before I realize I'm wrong about a certain topic? How much harm do I have to cause before realizing what harm I've caused? What if I realize something too late? I don't wanna be the person that claims to be a feminist but is hypocritically pro-life. Although I feel confident regarding some of my beliefs, I can't help this feeling that I'm over all more problematic than anything. As someone that wants to help people for a living(psych major), if that's the situation, I feel like I'm better off dead. Maybe that seems extreme. But I just don't want to cause more harm than good to others. I hope this doesn't sound like some sort of hero-complex. I just don't like seeing people hurt and the idea that I can easily make a terrible remark to someone or choose not to take action when I should have-makes me wanna cry. If anything, the whole George Floyd situation is really making me dwell on this matter a lot.

For the sake of my mental health, I just wanna know-has anyone else ever felt this way? And if so, is there anyway to not mentally beat yourself up over it? I've been doing a whole lot of that these days and it feels impossible to stop. It doesn't help that I also think I deserve to feel like this since I also feel -I am in fact very ignorant. Like no matter how much I reflect, I will always come to the wrong conclusion and thus, remain problematic.",03Jun2020,1
60,"Ever since I was little, Ive had trouble with forming attachment to the right things. Not just attachment, also feeling remorse or guilt for things I do to whatever I didn't feel attachment to. So, being violent with other kids didn't bother me, but I was afraid if I didn't sleep with all of my stuffed toys in the bed that the ones who weren't in the bed would be sad. I also became very attached to a blanket when I was little. Anytime I was separated from it, it triggered horrifyingly gruesome night terrors (which I'm now prone to) that were so detailed and violent that no child should ever have been able to imagine those things. They started the first time around the age of 4. Now, I know that sounds like normal kid stuff, but I'm an adult now. I shouldn't be having that issue. It's causing me problems, I enjoy watching movies/shows and reading books but I usually end up getting very attached to characters. It feels too real for me. It's like it haunts me. I can't tell you how many times I've become horribly depressed after finishing a show/losing characters/etc. It gets to the point where I can't bring myself to get out of bed, I don't want to eat, I've even been in such a bad spot a few times that I considered suicide. It's crazy, and no matter what I say to myself or what I do I can't stop those feelings. It's like I can't even control my own brain and it's scary. I don't know what to do about it. I can't seem to find the right combination of words to search on Google, I haven't found anything like this. What do I do? How do I fix this?

61,"This will probably be a very long post but please I really need your help. (By the way sorry english is not my primary language)

I (M/23)was born in a pretty high class familly, very loving childhood, private school, many friends, good relationship with my parents. 

My girlfriend (21), that I met 6 months ago, on the other hand was from a very poor familly, her parents were violent with her, never cared for her, didnt go to her graduation, didnt celebrate her birthday etc, she got bullied in school, she started terapy at 13 years old because one of her teacher saw that she was selfharming. At 15 she got sexually abused by a guy at a party and most of her few friends didnt believe her, and at 19 her bestfriend commited suicide. Bascially, there are a lot of injustices that she never asked for that happened to her and altho she seems ok now, she still suffer a whole lot and is very unstable... (which I understand completely)

When we started dating, she told me about all of those things and I quickly realized she needed someone to be there for her and that maybe she couldn't really be there for me (I'll explain later) and  I'm really trying my best to be the perfect boyfriend.

So for the last 6 months, everytime something bad happened to her.. as little as being late for work or me being too much on my cellphone one night... you know stuff that most people would just go ""ah it sucks but it happens, whatever""... she really overreacts to those things

When I say overreact it's like she would cry about it for hours and the couple next days she will be pretty mean with me and my reaction was always to be there for her and understanding.

The thing is... as time goes on... I realize that I need someone to listen to me too, and I also need support from my partner but she just can't.

If she does something not so nice to me (which happens a lot and most of the time for no reason at all) and I'm not happy about it and I tell her. She will cry for hours telling me how bad of a girlfriend she is, how much her life is a mess and that she wants to kill herself. 

For example, today she told me she wanted to go to a friends house have some drinks and I wasnt too happy about it because she knows I have severe asthma and that it would be very bad if I get Covid-19 (This friend specifically lives in the worst neighborhood in the city for Covid and always invites friends over and just doesn't care at all for the virus). So I wasnt too happy about it and told her that if I was in her shoes I would do everything possible to limit my exposure to the virus to protect her.

Her reaction was crying for hours... and then she proceded to tell me how f*cked up her life was and that her parents don't love her and that she misses her friend who killed himself... while most people would just go ""You're right I'm sorry""

So obviously I felt like shit telling her how I felt so I decided to cook an amazing dinner for her and when I was done cooking she told
me it wasn't how she likes it...

So the problem I have is that I'm starting to struggle a lot being there for her emotionally because it's just too much. Even when I step on my own emotion and decide to suck it up and do everything in my power to make her happy... it's never enough....

And it's not like she doesn't know... she tells me all the time how bad of a girlfriend she is for being ungrateful when I do stuff for her and she really hates herself for reacting that way... but she's just too depressed and hurt by her past...

I just don't know what to do anymore, she went to terapy for 6 years and says it didnt help... which I doubt but I can't force her to go... I know she's a good person she's just not there mentally and emotionally, she's too hurt.

Anyone who struggles with depression or ptsd from childhood got any tips for me? I really love her and want to help her get through it but I feel powerless.",03Jun2020,1

I know that sounds crazy and I don’t believe it but it’s really fucking eating away at me. I don’t know if it was a fever dream I remembered or if it’s some sort of mental illness or it’s actually true. It’s really fucking bothering me because I don’t know what to do.

I never really can open up about myself (like, even music I listen to, much less emotions, like my last gf we dated for 4 months i felt uncomfortable around even though she did nothing to warrant that). Also I feel bad because I've always had a hard time getting gifts, like I went to the store to get my mom a mothers day gift &amp; card but I ended up not doing it (even though i went to the aisle and even check out with something else) cause of people being around. I don't talk to people much because I say stupid edgy shit when I'm nervous sometimes, it's costed me friendships in the past and it's embarrassing for me so a lot of the time I just kinda avoid that person, also why I avoid new people. I've attempted suicide in the past and I've called hotlines and whatever but for me in whatever moment it's not like I have a reason, usually I feel peaceful if I cry it's usually me kinda debating with myself how I wanna be remembered (like i've written out entire notes before and also little jokes like ""oops i was just trying to learn how to tie a knot"" on a whiteboard in my room and i'm kinda in a light-hearted kind of mood so it makes me laugh a little).

68,"Did anyone else get to experience the surreal, Oprah-esk group event where they rangle up children of different ages from a school, put them together and ask them to share their deepest secrets, worst experiences and fears? Did anyone have a memorable experience? Good? Terrible? 

Many people who I've talked to about challenge day oddly enough either don't remember much it, or, what they do remember was invasive.

My own was rather unique. I, a male, ended up opening up in a share group surrounded by girls, with my old kindergarten teacher as the adult voice. I was one of those at the cross the line section who seemed to be on the wrong side of the line, everytime. Suicide, no childhood, done drugs, involuntary sexual acts.

This same teacher, once i opened up my feelings about my childhood molestation and my part in furthering and eventual attempting to stop the cycle, got me alone and used police interrogation tactics, my irrational fear of jail, my suicidal proclivity &amp; shame to manipulate a confession out of who i felt i had harmed the way i had been.

She then conducted a witch hunt, starting with that boy, using me to tell him it was ok to talk to her, finding out whom he had fooled around with, and so on with others. She wss making a list of names. 

It wasn't until she stated asking me about younger family members that i learned she was targeting these other kids for having simply having learned how to masturbate and laying that at my feet as a scapegoat to shame them as well. 

I know finally broke free of her mind games at that and i got other adults involved. Decpite having cornered, graded, threatened public humiliation and exposing and exploiting the vulnerability of myself and other children - to this day i don't think anything came from her manhunt except that she was asked to leave. 

I don't remember much after that expecpt worrying about my fate once she told my extremely homophobic family. To be honest, i had repressed this memory for a long time. I remember talking to the other adults after she was asked to leave. I couldn't understand how someone as skilled s manipulation, with such a specific agenda geared against my worst fears, could have possibly been there unless the event staff intended for her to be there. 

As far as i know, she went back to teaching the next day and may have since.",03Jun2020,1
69,"Hello I live in California.

Hoping for some advice from strangers!

My sibiling is an adult who has severe mental problems. Because of this I am moving out of my parents home in a month. He has gotten to a point of complete loss of rationality and reason. I believe this is a combination of weed, shrooms, alcohol, poor managment of diabetes, and poor managment of perscription drugs. And whatever else I don't know about.

When my sibling talks, the conversation goes rapidly of course from one subject to another, and often explains things in a way that doesn't make any sense. By the end of almost every conversation, my sibling has either broken something or and screamed/cursed his way all the way out of the house, into his car, to some place, hours away, for days on in. Often running out of gas. Another time throwing is phone in a lake. Another timer breaking his windshield. Many times ""losing"" his meds.

We as a family know the ins and outs of how to treat someone with mental illness.

Here's my issue. He can't take care of himself. He doesn't take his meds when he is suppose to. He has started to stop wearing his pump for his diabetes (all of a sudden he's doing shots in his arms). With his meds he's not suppose to take alcohol, but he does (he is of age). He is an adult and has a very large vehicle in his name. Often drinking and leaving for days in said vehicle. He poses a danger to himself and others. Threatening to kill himself and others multiple times. It is at a point of not if, but when, will someone get hurt?

He has been 51/50'd a few times, always get released. My sibling basically terrorizes my parents, and my parents don't (maybe can't?) kick him out because he can't take care of himself. So they feel as though he will die as a direct result. And we can't force him into care, as he is an adult and doesn't think he needs it himself/doesn't want help.

I am moving out soon, but I am still worried for my parents safety. As I know this is going to blow over in some deadly/dangerous fashion. I am also concerned for my own safety while still here, but I am stronger and have defensive tools on me at all times.

I am not running away from/afraid of him, I want to focus on becoming a firefighter and be able to have my girlfriend over.

Any and all advice is welcome.

Thank you for reading.",03Jun2020,1
70,"I have never done a therapy so don't know much about it. My wife accused me of pedophilia 4 times already. I absolutely have no sexual feeling towards minors. I love our child immensely and would never hurt him. This is devastating to hear from her, I cannot stay alone with our son as I fear she will think I abuse him now. 

I asked her to attend a couples therapy and she agreed. I asked her if she was abused as a child she said that she cannot remember anything like that but it might be suppressed.

It's very hurtful having this mistrust from a partner and not being able to be affectionate with my own on in a fear of how she might interpret hugging etc

I knew it was black out tuesday all day, and I was just starting to learn to be able to use my insta to talk about anti racism and to address how my silence for all these years was a privilege. But it felt performative, even though I know that I am taking steps outside of social media to do more than just repost a few things, it felt like i was doing it thinking the people around me would think ""wow this person specifically has said nothing"" when I shouldn't make this about me. I was trying to get out of my comfort zone of fearing judgment about posting anything outside of my personal life or doing things that I don't normally do (particularly from one person who nitpicks at every thing that I do), yet I'm still falling into it and its shameful. I hear that person's voice half jokingly saying ""oh so you think you're some activist now?"" and it stops me before I do anything. I know I shouldn't care about that but I rely on their judgment and advice a lot. Yesterday the inundation of it all was getting too much and I was getting anxious every time I opened anything, so I told myself I would stop looking.

From not looking and overthinking, I didn't post a black square because I don't want to be performative. I know it means to stand in solidarity, but I knew I would only be doing it to feel better about myself for doing it.

While writing &amp; pondering, I realized that **letting my guard down is the only way out of this shit mess I was in**. It got replaced by love that is naturally there, but was stifled by fear.

My family and I have been living in a hotel/with my grandparents for several weeks and will have to until the 25th when our new rent house is ready to move into. Because of this, we were only able to keep our two dogs with us and sent my cat, Fang, to live with my aunt until July. 

Fang has more or less been my rock the past few years. He always keeps me company, comforts me when upset, and sleeps with me at night so I don't have to be alone. Without him, the stress of being practically homeless, and family issues, I've felt especially down. All I really do is play video games and do homework for my summer class. Don't have much to look forward to about the day.

He's also fairly social and tries to talk a lot, but has difficulty pronouncing words, meaning a lot of the time it's up to others to guess what he's saying using context clues. Only, I seem to be just awful at it! (and he's aware of it ;u;)
My struggle is judging just how intelligent he is and how he thinks. There are times he seems extremely lucid, and other times he just fades into the background... It's driving me crazy.

So about two years ago I brought my mental health specifically how much I worry and how much that affects me to my doctor. I was then referred to a psychologist, not sure if that what their name is, and tried sticking to going to them. They explained I had anxiety never diagnosed me with anything from what I know but was given like worksheets labels Generalized Anxiety. 

Honestly booking appointment and working my schedule to go made me feel overwhelmed so I stopped going. After a couple of weeks or maybe a month and some I did reach out to other counsellors at my college but again faced the same issue. I felt to overwhelmed about booking appointments and how to make it to those appointments. So once again I stopped.

Side note this was within like a year and I didn’t tell my doctor about it. (2018)

I found myself very busy or at least keeping myself busy with work and school. My anxiety was pretty high but I seemed to push past it. A little later like last year 2019 I started working out and it helped my mental health. 

Although I no longer have anxiety and panic attacks, (Still haven’t been given a clear answer of what is what by professionals) I have  noticed that I still have some  that the idea of work overwhelms/terrifies me where I do spiral  (currently unemployed for like a few months before COVID) or small regrets make my brain hate myself and keep me up at night. It does still get pretty bad sometimes although I try to pretend it’s not, even when writing this I am trying to make it sound not too bad because it’s way better than before but I know internally I do need some help to learn how to cope. With Covid19 I am in my head a lot more and can feel the anxiety I have is a lot more than I had thought. 

Anyways I want to bring it up to my doctor and I haven’t done enough research but I want to see my options of low medications so I can feel enough confidence to see someone or just be able to exist without being ridden with worry sometimes. 

Anyways I don’t know how to bring it up to my doctor any advice on how to bring it up or just some thoughts would be helpful. I do live in Canada. 

- I wanted to add that if posting this on here or anything I wrote is incorrect I’ll take it down. I also want to apologize for any incorrect spelling and grammar.

90,"This is kind of a vent, because it's 7 am and apparently there's an ebola outbreak in Congo and for some reason my anxiety is doing this fucked up thing again where I'm convinced I am somehow, in some way, the cause of this.

This is how I've felt for years. Its like some sort of anxious narcissism. I'm aware that the world doesn't revolve around me but that doesn't really stop my anxiety from going fucking bonkers everytime I hear something bad has happened. 

At birth, I was literally considered an unlucky child. The youngest of 3, and I somehow managed to land multiple health problems that my siblings avoided. I was abused in all different ways by one of said siblings for years and I think partially abused by my dad in a way; I'm not sure but I'm really scared of him now. My brother didn't receive this abuse from my sister, but did feel more of the brunt of it from my dad, same with my mam. Somehow, some fucking way, because of my birth, I believe I am a bad omen. I was far too fucking unlucky, and should've been dead, but the fact I'm alive is a bad omen. The fact I was abused might have been a case of them trying to stop this bad omen from spreading and I kind of appreciate them for that. They didn't have the guts to kill me themselves, so they wanted to push me to killing myself. Except, even after I tried to do that, I lived.

 Someone, something, wants me alive and I do not think it's a positive figure. I am petrified that some demon latched onto me upon birth and made life a living hell for me and everyone I love. No one would've had to put up with all that shit if I weren't alive.  They wouldn't have to put up with abuse, bullying, self hatred, self harm etc. And them staying with me despite all my anger and cruelty to them just really screams that the demon in alluring them, or is telling them lies about me.

So, with this anxiety, you can probably tell that I'm having a really fucky time right now, with everything that's going on. I'm literally a British 16 year old guy, but somehow, I think I'm the cause of everything going on in this world. Somehow I'm the cause of George Floyd's death. Somehow I spread the corona virus. Somehow I caused the ebola epidemic. Somehow I am the reason for pride fall.

I know, I know. Its fucking dumb. It's inaccurate. But I am so deathly afraid that it's actually true that I'm really starting to convince myself more and more. My birth caused a butterfly effect on this fucking world I'm sure of it.

I'm in tears thinking that this might do some bad too but I have to vent. I want to know if anyone else feels the same.",03Jun2020,1

I have always been opposed to therapy for numerous reasons, but mainly because I’m afraid to show vulnerability (19f). 
Both my dad and my sister are Bipolar (dad undiagnosed, sister diagnosed) and I’m pretty sure I don’t have that, but I’ve started to realize I might struggle with anxiety and depression. Not in the way that most people would think because I’m very social, and seem to keep it together. I will have weeks where I’m feeling very confident, but then months where I’m not. I have a very poor inner dialogue with myself. I quit playing sports (I played my whole life until this past year) and I think that did diminish my self esteem because that is what I felt I was best at. I have struggled with addiction issues since I was 15, but rarely do drugs anymore. (Aside from weed and alcohol). I feel like I do have that part of my life under control now, but I am dependent on both of those things to some extent. Sometimes I wish I could avoid social situations all together to not feel anxious all the time. Also, I don’t know if I should label myself as depressed because it’s not like I physically cannot leave bed at times, and in general, I can talk myself off a ledge when I am feeling down.  I make a lot of reckless decisions, and then feel guilty about them and wish I could do better. I kind of live my life in opposite extremes at times.

I currently identify as straight, I questioned myself when I was 16 due to a dream I had where two girls were kissing each other. I never had a dream like that again, all my sexual dreams were about men, and I've always been attracted to men, and have never thought about women in that way. 

Now since all these thoughts started, of what if I am attracted to women, I am unable to think, if I watch something, I keep thinking do I like this girl, do I find her attractive, if I hang out with my friends, I keep thinking, do I have feelings for them, and it's starting to ruin my friendships coz I have started to avoid them a little. 

I used to love watching TV shows, but now I don't find the same joy in it as before, I used to love reading fan-fiction, but now I can't immerse myself in it. I can't focus on anything and I don't find the same peace and relaxation in the things I used to do. Alongside this, because I'm noticing women more than I used to, I'm becoming more and more insecure about my own body and features, and if I am even attractive, especially because I've never been in a relationship and have become overweight, and all of this is building up and driving me insane. 

I wanted to know if anyone else has felt this way and I'm really sorry this is such a long post, I'm just becoming so frustrated. Thank you so much for your help :)",03Jun2020,1
114,"It's not the only problem I have by far and I've said it on here before but I have so much anger at the world. I've become a full-blown misanthrope --  I think just about everyone in the whole world is only self-absorbed, the world is run by greed, and that none of this will ever change no matter what. i live in the United States and I fucking hate it here. Everyone's so fucking stupid and selfish and nobody cares about each other unless something's in it for them or the other person has money. Everything here especially but the world at large too is run by money. If you're not rich you don't matter. 

I wish close to everyone could die and we could limit humanity to like 50 million people worldwide. Let nature take back over, let the endless exploitation of people and the planet for profit stop, let people live in small communities like we're meant to, end capitalism and let us work only to support ourselves and our communities directly rather than just filling billionaires' coffers while the rest of us fight for the scraps. 

I feel like Ted Kaczynski, who I really respect and admire no matter how you feel about that. (I'm way dumber than him though, dude was a bona fide genius). He was too smart for his own good, realized how extreme and unsolvable the worlds' problems were because just nobody gave a shit and money ruled it all and tried to do something about it no matter how extreme. He took off from society and lived on his own just like I want to but I can't. He wasn't insane, he was actually *too* sane and that was what made him do what he did. He couldn't just watch TV and eat fast food to distract himself from the bullshit and I don't care if he sent bombs, he wrote an incredible manifesto and said IF it was published he wouldn't do anything extreme and I believe he meant that. But of course people weren't ready for the truth.

Don't fucking worry though I'm not gonna hurt anyone except myself. Much as I wish people would drop by the billions I'm not gonna hurt anyone else. Just myself.

Yes I've tried therapy, medication, hospitalization even, anything you can name to help myself I've probably tried. I'm beyond help. My anger and depression will never be cured; I've accepted that. If I can't change the world (nobody can) then I'll just leave it. Super simple.",03Jun2020,1
115,"I have always bottled up my emotions eventhough I am a somewhat emotional person. This all went fairly well until my mother tried to commit suicide, I had therapy to process it all as I had PTSD from those events (she tried multiple times and in almost all cases I was the person to guide everything, I called family to inform, made sure my brothers were alright, made sure my mother didn't try anything new  etc.). 

After the therapy I thought I was doing good, but about half a year later I started refusing my emotions. Like I said I used to always bottle up my emotions but I would still be able to let them come out, but now I can't let them out. I had multiple occasions where I could feel the tears building up but when I tried to give into the emotion I just couldn't and wasn't able to cry. 

And besides that I get the idea that my emotions are getting more and more active, like if they want to get out of the bottle I put them in all at the same time. I get physical reactions like a shiver through my body or random muscles that suddenly contract. I also get sudden bursts of emotions that try to come through at random moments, first I could clearly point out the trigger but it seems that I just get it whenever without a trigger. 

It is really freaking me out as I don't want to keep it all bottled up but I fear people will look down on me or want me to explain why I suddenly start crying, but seeing that I am not able to let it come through I guess I don't have to worry about that. But I do want to be able to show it, so if anyone knows what the cause can be or something that I can try to let my emotions show let me know as it is really starting to get in my way of knowing what I feel.",03Jun2020,1

It doesn’t help to hear, “Things will get better...” I feel like people don’t really ever get it... 

No, I don’t know that, and no one can be certain things get better, I’ve heard and seen enough, that things sometimes don’t get better.

But everyone hopes and holds on that things will turn up someday. I’m tired of fighting... I want something worth living for.

Relationships are hard and very difficult to maintain, and other people just don’t care or put any amount of effort. I have fear and insecurities that plagues me everyday.

124,"When I was 16, I was smoking hookah with my friends. They all stood up and left the garage. My friend was in the back seat of the mustang and he couldn't reach the door. I decided to stand up and close it for him despite the major head rush I had from the hookah. As I was closing the door, I fell forward with the door and collapsed to the ground, completely blacking out. I slammed my face into the back rim of the wheel and woke up in a terrible panic. I had chipped a small part of one of my lower teeth and my nose really hurt. I never wanted to tell my parents what happened when I was young. I now live with a crack in my nose on the right side and a bump in my nose on the left side. I absolutely hate it and I'm always wishing I could go back and not partake in the hookah session.

I'm 22 and I have most definitely told my parents what happened. I almost got plastic surgery when I was 19, but I bailed based on on the preexisting anxiety. I still want to get it done. 

I'm always pressing on my nose with my thumbs and jamming my fingernail into the crack. I know I'm on a compulsive spectrum and having this is a nightmare.

I was fine with how my nose looked before this injury happened. All I would want is the bump and the crack gone. There is nothing wrong with its size despite it being large. I'm so tired of being insecure about my face. I have felt so powerless not going through with this even though it has bothered me for several years and will continue to bother me for the rest of my life unless I do something.

I used to be very insecure about my teeth also. I got braces and now I cannot stop smiling. I feel so good about fixing that issue and I know I would feel better if I got this done.",03Jun2020,1

126,"Hello.
 So, I'm human. I'm aware of this from an objective POV. And because of that, we make mistakes, and its ok to, as we learn from them. My main problem is that I've done things in the past to other people which I to this day cannot forgive myself for, despite changing completely, learning from those mistakes and never repeating them. I never intended to hurt any of them, it was either a result of my ignorance or mental health issues which I've largely taken care of now. My point is, every time I share these things that I've done with my closest friends and family who are truthful with me, they say that they're not that bad, and that whilst they weren't good in any sense, they are things that can be forgiven. I just feel like every time I try to forgive myself and stop feeling guilty, its me running away from that responsibility I have for having hurt that person, or making excuses so as to avoid the feeling of guilt.
 How does one work on this? I don't necessarily have self esteem issues or anything I don't think, I know who I am and what I can do, but I just feel like the things I've done are things I have to carry with me no matter what, even though I've changed, even though I know that if someone else were to tell me the exact same problems I'd forgive them.

127,"Hi. I don't know how this works, but here I'm. Trying to fit in. I will try to keep it short because I don't want to bore anyone with my gloomy ramblings. 

All my life, I've been very loving and patient towards people. I've loved people immensely with all of my person yet nobody stayed with me. I know everybody is struggling. Life is just like that. It was never supposed to be easy. Nothing lasts. Life is an ephemeral thing. Everything we do is forgotten so quickly like the castles of sand slips into the sea eventually. Feelings fade away. Unacceptable things happen. Yet, life goes on.

Today, I'm completely a dead, cold and numb person. I don't feel anything, not even grief. It has become inevitably a part of my being. I don't talk to anyone. Zero. No friends. No support system. I cannot even share anything with my family either. I was suicidal since my childhood. I've cut myself hundred times. I don't want to live. This existence seems a burden on me. We, humans, are strange. Sometimes, your numbness bothers you more than anything else. I just want to feel like I'm alive, but I'm unable to feel anything. I have kept myself tightly closed in a box which at times suffocates me. Silence is my solace. Life has just changed me drastically. I've nowhere to go to. No safe or happy place.

I'm sorry for the rant. I wish you all the best of everything. Stay strong. Whatever you're going through, it's meant to build you into a better person. Things will get better. You're stronger and more capable than you think. Don't you ever give up on yourself.

I'm confused about how I'm feeling most of the time, and my mind is really cloudy. I cant put my thoughts into words, and with as much as I struggle, I feel like I'm making no progress... I fight so damn hard in my mind, and yet... I spent an entire day laying in bed. I cry, but no one ever hears it. 

I'm diagnosed with an anxiety disorder (don't remember exactly what. Either Generalized or Social), and depression.

Just the other week I told my mom that I wanted to die. She came rushing over to my dad's house (that's where I stay), and I broke down crying multiple times... I'm such a pathetic mess. Broken, and useless. I'd been suicidal for a while at this point. That's just when everything broke the surface.

I'm lonely all the time, and I only have 1 friend. Im hurting all the time, and I just want to be like everyone else. Maybe if I wasn't so worthless, people would actually like me... Maybe I would be feeling this way, and maybe... just maybe I'd be lovable to someone. 


For a few months (Jan to Apr), I dated a girl I knew online (same age as me). I broke up with her in mid April, and just cut off contact with her a couple days ago because of the mental, and emotional stress it put onto me. That's not too significant though, I'm happy that I'm finally able to move on. I realize now that that relationship was unhealthy, and how it made me feel like garbage most of the time. I really wasn't happy in that relationship.

I do hope I can find someone right for me in the future. Someone I meet in real life, though. I have some advice of my own here: Don't e-date!!!! Off topic, I know, but regardless that was a big part of my stress, so I thought I should add it.

If it's true that this is our only life and nothing comes after it than what is the point of doing anything in life at all? Sure the events that take place in one's life are absolutely real in the moment but none of it matters at all given enough time. From my point of view if something isn't remembered did it really happen at all? For the most part the only proof I have of my past are the memories temporally stored in my brain. When I don't exist anymore any and all traces of me will forever disappear. There may be others who remember or were impacted by me but sooner than later those individuals will cease to exist as well.  

What I'm trying to say is I don't see the point of existence for any living thing. All life will come to an end eventually like with everything else and it will be all for nothing. I struggle to even enjoy a fun video game or a movie because all I can think of is how none of it matters. Eventually it will be like a never existed in the first place and everything I went through never happened.

131,"Ok, so here's a backstory:
Around a month ago, I was watching TV with my family. I can't remember the context but I answered back go my dad (just in a teenager-ish way) and he full on started shouting at me. I felt this panic in my head and then just started crying and crying, I basically couldn't breathe and my mum needed to lie me on the floor and help me breathe into a paper bag.
I often get very tearful if I have challenge someone in authority, eg. Refunding faulty items.

I thought that was it but today, I've basically woken up with a feeling of absolute dread. I thought I had a temperature but I checked and its only 36.4 C and I've been feeling light headed too. I went about my morning feeling completely unmotivated and so weak I've had to lie down on my bed several times. Then I was just on my phone and the overwhelming urge to cry came back and before I knew it, I was in tears and now I'm writing this post whilst hyperventilating.

I'm not anxious about anything in particular and I don't think I have anxiety because I'm generally fairly outgoing and not insecure. I don't know if it's the whole lockdown situation.

132,"With all that’s going on in the world, it feels a little insolent of me to be talking about something like this... But regardless of current affairs, mental health is still so important. I hate to talk about it, in fact it actually makes me cringe a little, and I don’t want anybody to feel as though i’m trying to centre all attention onto myself. I try so hard to just not bring it up but I think it’s wrong that I feel that way. Since I was little, I always remember myself being quite shy and coming across so rudely because I would find it so hard to initiate or carry on conversation - which is still something i’m working on to this day. I’ve always been quite shy and felt bouts of anxiety, but only in the past 2 years has it hit me hard. You never fully understand anxiety until you experience it first hand, as rude as it sounds. You typically tend to associate anxiety with things like fearing public speaking or making a phone call or panic attacks (which in no way am I belittling because they’re also things that I struggle with so badly, but in the grand scheme of things...).  You don’t think about the lack of sleep you get from so badly fearing the terrible nightmares you’re going to have and staying up until 6am crying and giving yourself panic attacks because it seems to be the only way your body knows how to react. You don’t think about the annoying habits you develop like planning your entire day and feeling so bad about yourself if you don’t complete everything, and in the correct order, lists and over-organisation literally takes over my life. You become so obsessive and make yourself feel like such a weirdo, and you’ll try so hard to stop but it seems near impossible. You don’t think about the pinch marks all over your thighs or the broken skin in your mouth from the awkwardness and tension you feel when just having a general conversation with somebody you’re not too close to, and how achey your muscles are by the end of the day because you spend most of your waking hours strained.... You don’t think about the excessive amount of sweating that you experience when making such a small decision, because to you it seems like something so huge; and the panic that the sweating brings because now you’re going to feel embarrassed when somebody points out your sweat marks. You don’t think about how jumpy you become, how somebody walking into a room unknowingly and beginning to speak can send your heart racing, but you’ll just laugh it off because it seems so silly.... The fear of your notifications coming up and wondering what your messages will say, but then also constantly checking your phone and waiting for a response and replying within seconds, or perhaps the complete opposite.... The random outburst of anger and not knowing how to control it but later feeling so bad because it’s nobody else’s fault that you’re feeling this way.... Never being able to fully concentrate.... The constant fucking unbearable headaches.... Trying so hard to turn up absolutely everywhere so unnecessarily early because you can’t stand the idea of someone having to wait for you and growing annoyed.... You’ll often look in the mirror and fucking despise what you see.... Thinking the worst of every situation and being so tired from overthinking all the damn time. Constant trips to the doctors to see if you can change your medication because it just doesn’t seem to be working, and always being a constant cycle of feeling so good for a few weeks and then everything coming and crashing down all at once. But it’s so hard to speak to anybody about it because it just feels like nobody understands, and you spend so much of your life just being unhappy. In recent years i’ve had so many ups and downs with my mental health, but i’m learning to love myself a little more and gradually get over the hatred that I feel towards things that don’t even really matter like my god awful legs and the way my skin flares up so bad, and i’m finally finding my voice. I have to remember that it’s okay to have down days and I should never beat myself up about it, even the happiest people have shitty days and I understand now that it’s not as abnormal as I make myself believe it is. I’m not at all where I want to be yet BUT I have come so far and with such great support around me. Anxiety is so much more than the word itself, and it feels so tiring knowing that it’ll always be there, often you can’t help but blame yourself. But we’re not alone. Mental health affects a vast amount of people and it shouldn’t be such a taboo subject now, it’s not something you should ever feel ashamed about.

Your mind knows exactly what you fear, and it’ll always try and play on that. But please use all of the strength that you can to not let it win. 

I never, ever want anybody to feel alone and i’m always open to helping absolutely anybody that feels they need it. Whilst it may not seem like it, speaking really does help. I can imagine, like myself, so many people are feeling the pressure to use all of this free time to better themselves and it’s okay to do that to an extent... But don’t push yourself too far because you’ll always end up back in square 1 trying too much, too soon.",03Jun2020,1

I am attracted to female bodies, I can get turned on by them, but I don't actually want to have sex?

At the same time, I also feel like I don't like anyone, honestly. I don't think I've ever actually felt romantic, and I've definitely never felt actual love. A lot of it is just me enjoying the attention they're giving me, rather than any actual feelings they may have for me. 

Am I a sexual aromantic or something like that? Straight with attachment issues? I don't know about all these different sexuality terms so if anyone has an idea if it has to do with a specific sexuality, or a mental illness, I'd appreciate an answer.

He’s smoking a cigar outside “here suck on this to help you become a man” first time I ever smoked. Next one we are on our way to visit my grandparents (fathers side) everything seems okay to me. Ten PM rolls around my mother starts yelling at my father something, something, I’m taking the kids (I have one younger sister.) I cry myself to sleep and way up the next morning in the back seat of the car without my father, just mother and sister. Next memory, I’m about five, I get a new sitter.  She Waves bye to my mother while greeting with a smile, as soon as the door shuts she drags my to the couch by yanking on my ear for the months she “watched me” every morning I new what.. or more like who waits for me. Next, I’m eight my uncle is five years elder than me gives me my first ruthless and unwelcome beating. I tell his mother (who is my grandmother) and I get whipped with a belt for “lying.” This double beating continues for two years and ended when I called my own grandmother a bitch, but still got beat on repeatedly by my uncle till I was fifteen. Next, I’m twelve. I’m falling behind in school. Teacher asks “is someone molesting you at home? Why are you so quiet and distant?” I replied I don’t know. My mother was called in for a parent teacher meeting. Same question was asked, same answer was given. 13.. I was kick out of middle school for cutting class, sleeping, and just lack of involvement in any subject. My mom was home that day. She threw out every article of clothing at the time, yelling at the top of her lungs “get the fuck out you worthless piece of shit, worthless and lazy like your father!” First time attempting suicide, I used a belt and the bunk beds I had at the time, failed. At the point before passing out the belt cane loose.  14, I’m walking home, someone tried to mug me and fractured my jaw. At this point in my life. I have been mistreated my damn near everyone I came in contact with (or so it is perceived in my head) I attended suicide again. 15, I get a call from my father, “I’m finally released from jail son, I’ll be home in thirty minutes.” 45 minutes pass “ I’m sorry I got turned around everything looks so different, I’ll be there in 10 minutes” 1hr later.. “ I’m so sorry I won’t be able to see you today” 16, I was told my father cheated when I was 2 and that what lead to a divorce.  This is the point when my psyche took the hardest impact. I find out I couldn’t trust any single family member. My mother was out of at job and I was told to steal money from her own mother “or else”. When I was 13 I was caught cross dressing by my mother, turns out she couldn’t keep a secret like she promised she would “ like omg I think my son is a fucking fag but he won’t admit it” being called a fagot or gay or a bitch by my mother was a regular thing there after. 17 I graduated high school a whole year and semester ahead of schedule. First time I hear “ I’m proud of you” even so by my mother. Some here on it’s been why aren’t you in College? You think being home is doing shit? Lazy mother fucker. I go back to school for general Ed. Oh what the fuck is that you thing your big and bad and can do what the fuck you want to do? You don’t thing you need a job to help me out after losing my job, having to take care of you guys without your dad yada yada she’s used the same guilt card times before. I quit school to work. Oh you think your shit don’t stink because you got some minimum wage loser job? You don’t think you need an education to be someone? You think this is it? I got fired so I went back to school, this time for computers, I love computers. Look at you! Waisting  fucking money on stupid ass classes that aren’t going to take you anywhere. Get a job and the script well.. rinse and repeat. That s only a portion of my passed I feel like getting out there there’s a ton more.. I’m 27 now. I can only remember my life not as a human but being a scapegoat for others. I was beat up to make an example out of by many people. I wasn’t really anyone’s first pick, just a last resort. I was bullied since I was in the first grade by what seems to me,to be everyone I had came in contact with. Adults... they were the just children that grew up to continue bullying. Remember in class being told “there is no such thing as a stupid question” well every time after hearing that I would feel confident and ask my question to be made fun of, by the whole class and yes my teachers too. My family did the same but.. with name calling. So much of it, I stopped trusting anyone that human. At the same time I became timid and shy. Fast forward to when I was 12 and that’s why my teacher asked if I was molested. My family has been hurting me and my feeling especially for so long that I was angry, so much so I projected all my hated for them onto everyone I met. Randomly, I would have girlfriends here in there. Never failed, when I would open up and finally be vulnerable “omg you’re so sensitive, you just like a girl but a guy” get dumped and repeat till my last relationship three years ago (24 years old) I’m still plagued with suicidal thoughts. 
I don’t have religion To turn to, I was seen as a weirdo for being to depressed for having nothing to be depressed about I stopped believing in religion all together, I read the Bible’s of so many religions that what I pieced together that is the same in every is that the people who suffer will be lifted into the heavens and all evil doers will eventually deal with some day of reckoning. Too bad.. it seems that I’m experiencing some sort of isolated incident. Ugh I lost my train of thought now. I had and still have all this pent up emotions. About 3 years ago when I was driving through downtown, I struck a homeless man crossing the street while I had the right a way, and with the Metro bus being of the left turning lane in the middle of the intersection I didn’t see him crossing with bike. I struck him and killed him. There were so many people that watch that Poor man get flung in the air and hit the ground. I remember being told “why were you going so fast you piece of shit” after the police did their investigation, they ruled it an accident. He didn’t have the right of way and I was not speeding. Killing this man even as an accident really fucked me up some more. After I got a new car.. I was close.. but I chickened out last minute.. I almost drove myself off a cliff. Just about a year ago I started really exploring my sexuality. As in really trying to figure out who I am. At this point I haven’t has sex for about.. 2 years before that it was a couple times in the span of 3 months before that I don’t really remember. My sex drive or lack there of is what made me want to explore. At this point I feel like a woman incased in the flesh of a man. I haven’t seen a therapist due to COVID and I do want some assurance if not some fucking help for a change. Theres a ton more but until I get the courage to post again...",03Jun2020,1
136,So my girlfriend has major self esteem issues and does not want to seem demanding or needy or anything. She and I have been together for two and a half years and she has mentioned wanting me to stop porn before. I stopped for around a month then went back a few times and then stopped again for around two and a half weeks until today. I do not want her to be upset with me or mad or anything and I know if I tell her she is going to say she does not care but in reality she does and she has told me sometimes she just tells me she does not care to avoid issues. She is sleeping right now and I need to tell her later I just worry and I know it was a conscious decision of mine and it was my fault and I enjoy it in the moment but hate myself for it afterward.,03Jun2020,1

Never get it during the day, or when about to fall asleep. I’m a light sleeper and always wake up once or twice. This started 4 days ago. 37 m, relatively healthy, have anxiety/depression, ptsd never had any problem like this before. Freaked out thinking I had a bug in my ear.

140,"It started maybe 3 weeks ago, major episodes of depression where I have no idea what to even do with myself. I will wander around the house at 3 in the morning literally choking on tears. I’ll even talk to myself because I just feel so fucking lonely and awful. Fast forward to this morning, I stayed up all night for the second night in a row because of paranoia and now I’m taking a shower. Have to leave to curtain semi open because of panic attacks, and bug start crawling out of the wall. Little tiny bugs. I look at the part of the wall where the shower wall meets it and there’s a dark hole, almost like the shower is coming off of the wall. So I cry and hurry as fast as I can. Next I’m out of the shower and I’m getting some coffee. Coffee tastes awful now. The taste hasn’t changed, I’ve just grown to hate the taste recently. I start to hear low, guttural growls. And hisses. And weird noises. Everything feels not real... it feels like I’m living in some lovecraftian horror story. Like I’m the only real person here. I’m the only real person. My sister is asleep in the couch, my brother in his bed, and my mom is sitting in the kitchen reading her bible drinking coffee but only I’m real. I fucking know someone is watching me. They watch me while I cut myself and they watch me wander around sobbing until me eyes are aching. And they love it and it’s entertaining. I’m going insane and I don’t know what to do. Every time I try and tell my mom she brushes it off later, of course I fucking predicted it because she’s a part of this. And every time I see someone from my family I get angry. It wasn’t like this a week ago. I just get so angry I could punch a wall. If this post gets removed then that’s a sign and I don’t know how much longer I can live like this.

141,"My mum has depression and possibly some other problems, but she refuses to get any professional help, claiming that she has to learn to get out of it on her own. Despite this, she is, in my opinion getting worse and has taken no steps to understand or change her behavior. 

She has said that the reason she doesn't want to go to a psychologist is because she has been to them in the past and they did not help her, even making her feel worse about herself. 

I am in no way suggesting that getting out of depression is easy. I myself have depression, but I just want to be able to help my mum and I know I can't do it on my own.

Is there anything I can do to convince her to seek help? Although I fear the answer will be no.",03Jun2020,1
142," I have a very good memory, I could recall memories from way up to 2 yrs old. I'm sort of sensitive to sounds to the point of I memorized all my neighbors footstep sound and could hear much clear than all of my family, so much so that if u were in the next open room based on the sounds I could mostly recognize what ur doin or what ur saying . I'm also emotionally sensitive. So I payed all that out not to brag but so u could understand.

Well as a middle child I've always been left alone to fend for myself. Mom's busy with my older sisters education and taking care of the baby. Dad is away for months. I'm not gonna say that I wasn't taken cared of properly I was being fed bathed properly, but I'm always last on the list, always , sometimes even forgotten. When dad goes home, when I was 2 1/2, Mind you I don't know him well. he started teaching me alphabets which I already learned from playing with the eldest so no need he moved on to name , no need done that. So he moved on to making me spell out words, which is by that time not my forte. I could dictate the letters from written words but could not read that much. That's when shit hits the fan, he gets frustrated easily, first he'd only scare me with his belt payed out. But when I get something wrong he'd tell and call me useless. One time he got so pissed off at me that he'd just outright hit me with the betl. If u cry I'd be hit even harder. Where's my mom u ask? She only told him to stop when she seen the bruises. I was a cry baby so it was normal for her to hear me cry. From that point on I started being scared and untrusting to adults, mostly male adults.

And when I finally started kindergarten my dad even became more strict with me learning basic math. Which is also hard for me so if get a lot of beating. I could say that I was one of the tomboyish girls during that time where I don't really care whine I'd be playing with but when my dad came home beatings started happening again, all I could think when I'm t school is when I get home he'll look at my work and then criticize me again and beat me again 

 It also didn't help that my mom doesn't seem to care, or maybe she's overwhelmed with chores and children but, children ain't dumb, I noticed that she was actually being biased. I tried making her life easier by taking chores my self, simple stuff like sweeping, doing the dishes or if it's simple cooking, by age 4 I could do that. But u see it wasn't enough. I'd only get recognize if another person points it out to her. Like how pretty my drawings are or how I do my chores. Trusting my mom wasn't also easy. She'd always forget about me, this happens many times, I needed like a new notebook or a bag, or shoes, what she'll do is buy what I said I needed for my sister and give me the hand  me downs. I know it happens to siblings. Sometimes she won't get anything for me at all cause it's out of her budget and talk me out onto ""just this month next month I'll buy u what u need"" then she'd forget it next month rinse repeat, until my sister again grows out of her stuff and that's what I'll have while she get new stuff. 1st grade and 1st yr middle school I'd literally have to use my cousins crumbling shoes for 5 months until she said , ur sister is graduating this yr, u can have her old ones next yr. 

And whenever my mom goes out there's always something for the eldest or the youngest. So I cope with that by having all my things used properly, mended my own clothes immediately cause God knows my seamstress mom doesn't have time to fix my clothes, but thanks to that I learned how to read instructions properly and assemble and disassemble machine and diy furniture. If I have new stuff I'd put it away properly just tucked where my sisters can't find it, another skill gained hiding things so my sisters can't find it easily. They'll always get the preferential treatment. It got to a point where if I have the opportunity to get new stuff I'd grab it. Organise , tuck it away immediately. Almost like hoarding. What broke my heart is when the new helper nanny came and discovered my hoard, she gave it to my mom which then she dispersed to my siblings. 

My family would also constantly move to grandma after the parents fight. One time I stepped in to stoop my father smashing a pitcher on my pregnant's moms head he pushed me and then I was the new target of his anger he condescendingly smashed that pitcher repeatedly into my head so many times that it left a dent on my skull after a week of swelling. Ever had a gun pointed at ur face? Well gee my good that surely pointed it to me, he even pulled the trigger, he was just messing around he said.

Wouldn't also help that my dad is emotionally abusive, he'd always tell me that I'm stupid, useless and all bunch of negative stuff about me if there's even a tiny thing he noticed me doing wrong.

This lockdown in my parents house made me remember all of that. Thankfully my dad isn't here. But I could see it again , all the unfairness mom treats me. Now mind you I've made peace with all of those but it still hurts.

Now I'm an greedy, insecure, emotional , paranoid, sensitive,  organized clean freak of an adult . And I'm still struggling with anxiety when i talk to male elderly adults , or people with power in general (like my boss supervisor ECT.) I'm a wreak. My father's negativity also rubbed on me, whenever I apply for a job all I could hear is how useless I am, even in childhood I suffer that. If always pops in my head. Until everything mixes together, to a thought of why am I even alive? Ur mom won't recognize ur accomplishments, ur dad thinks it pathetic, why don't u just kill urself?. I would always cope with that by smiling widely to laughing while crying, i know creepy but it kinda helps I don't remember where I read it but when u smile ur brain also follows being positive. 

These days my only problem is I'm too easily be upset, or annoyed, sometime for even shallow reasons. I don't like being greedy but it manifested again at home, this lockdown my unfair mom would always put the 2youngest daughters first to eat and get what they want. And leave the scraps for me. I baceame a greedy envy field glutton, if I can eat first I will if there's no food left I make one for myself what's bothering me is the quantity. I also gained weight. I don't like becoming a person like this. I don't want to be emotionally hurt again by petty things like this. Help how do I cope with any of my problem? I know this all sounds petty , I'm sorry for bothering. but I think I need more help. I wanted to be a better person for myself. Thanks",03Jun2020,1

145,"So, if someone out there could help me that would be great... anybody... I am a 33year old female diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder, PTSD, ADHD, major depression, acute anxiety, a little over weight but i still get some exersize in. I have had a lot of trama in my life. from alcohol abuse and being a victim of rape and domestic violence. I have been in and out of the phyc wards for about 12 years and even after I got sober and its been years now, I am still ending up in the Hospital for panic attacks and suicidal ideations. Every night I fear of waking up in the morning because I never know how I am going to feel the next day. I haven't experienced joy in my life since I was 17years old. I don't even understand why some people say they love their life because all life has given me is shits and giggles. Yeah I had fun but I really skrewed my brain up. It seems like as I get older it keeps getting worse and worse. I want to be happy so badly and I know I am severely depressed and that I need help... well, I have tried! so fucking hard I've tried. I've been in and out of every possible recovery/mental heath facility, you name it, I have probably tried it. My family has spent a lot of money on doctors/ specialists, but no one knows what to do with me. They just keep passing me from facility to facility. What do i do? Where do i go? Who do i see about this? I need your help. It's a life or death situation. I dont know how much longer I can go on like this. Don't worry I am not going to hurt myself and I know right where the ER is if I need it...(even though the doctors in the ER (no offence) have no idea what psychology is.) I'm just so frustrated and this is just how I feel and I wanted to see if anyone has any advice for me. My brain littaraly feels like its being tortured all day, everyday. I just want to sleep my days away. I am on a bunch of medications for my major depression but nothing works it only makes me tired. My perscribed stimulants do help a little with motivation but I mean I can't work because of this life. They even put me on SSI because I got so bad. Where do I find something other than a stimulant, an anti depressant or drinking to motivate me to enjoy life? Fuck I'm really going crazy here. There has got to be something else I havent tried. Talk/group/ individual/ therapy hasn't worked either... Seriously people, i would never wish this life im living on anyone in the whole world. Even if you were the most evil person, I would not wish what I have to go through everyday on you. Please give me hope that this invisible pain will be over one day soon I hope. I'm sick of lieing to people and telling them I'm ok when I am really not and I just say that so I stop worring people because it just seems to be the best thing for everyone since my parents are getting older and I dont want them to worry about me.

148,"Hi, during my time in high school I felt very motivated to study, I was able to study several hours straight, and I actualy enjoyed it. In my mind, the reason I felt so motivated was because of the goal of enrolling in the best college in my country (Portugal in my case), and I actually managed to get there.

At the beginning of my first year I felt excited, however, shortly after, that excitement ceased and I no longer had the same motivation like I had in high school. The situation got worse with the lockdown because of C0VID-19, plus, I began thinking about changing course and begin again in the first year in another course.

To make such decision, I planned on first completing all the subjects of the first year, than I would make that choice, the problem is, exams are comming, and I fell very unmotivated, I can barely study one hour without interrupting, and I'm increasingly more convinced of changing course.

My questions are. Is it worth it to continue studying knowing that I'm most likely going to start all over again?? How do I keep myself motivated in future situations, while in college??

All tweets, youtube video’s, posts, etc. go to either to read or watch later. But then I get so overwhelmed by everything in my bookmarks that I rarely ever revisit. I have hoarding disorder too so it’s easily to have piles and piles of things even online. I used to enjoy books a lot as a child, would finish it in a matter of a few days. Now I go months without reading books. It’s also one of the reasons I quit uni because I simply couldn’t handle it, it felt too overwhelming and I can’t remain focused. Whenever I start something, anything I just can’t seem to finish it and immediately jump to something else. I’ve always wanted to be a translator, subtitler or any of the sort but now mental health has been taken that choice away from me as well. Now I don’t think I have adhd or anything because I wasn’t diagnosed with it but it’s probably a byproduct of my depression, it sucks out all energy from me. I’ve never gotten useful help for it either and not sure how to improve it. It seems to be getting worse. And then my friends and family sometimes send me school stuff to proofread and then I feel guilty for refusing because I have a hard time saying no so I really have to push myself.

151,"I've never posted on Reddit before and I'm not even sure that this is the right platform to raise a question like this, but I'm going to give it a go because I'm in need of an answer. 

My sister Erin has attempted suicide at least half a dozen times and has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. My family and I have recently become deeply concerned by some dark signs in her behaviour that indicate to us she could be contemplating doing something to cause serious harm to one of us. Here's a collection of things we've noticed:

* A penchant for stories about **female** murderers (she recently watched a series of documentaries on the subject)
* A book in her room about a **female** murderer (This book was properly, properly gruesome)
* A large kitchen knife concealed in her bedroom drawer
* A tendency to engage in aggressive physical contact with her **female** siblings - the other party unwilling
* A cold, dark stare when she does not get her way (when this happens, she will sort of 'shut down' and go to her bedroom). 
* She appears to lack any compassion or understanding of other's feelings
* She does not appear to experience any true, stable, lasting happiness or positive emotion (she laughs manically and often, but it's a weird sort of amusement that I can't quite explain)
* She will readily, knowingly and repeatedly lie with and without premeditation
* My youngest sibling has stated **she** does not feel safe being alone in a room with her
* When she turned 18 two months ago she instructed her psychologist not to provide any information on her condition or feedback from her sessions with the doctor to her parents
* There are a lot of us (two boys, three girls, Mom &amp; Dad) and we're normally a happy family, but her presence often (though not always) is like a dark cloud on the rest of us 
* Our feelings toward her are such that we are all soon to install locks on our bedroom doors

Many of these things may not seem particularly terrible in and of themselves, but consider this as an aggregate and you may understand that we are very, very concerned - even scared. I'm particularly worried because something else has happened recently that I know will cause her 'evil side' to flair up. She may attempt suicide again, but I really don't want her to hurt or kill someone else. She hurts us all enough psychologically. 

Mom &amp; Dad don't want to ask her to leave the house permanently because we love her of course, she's our flesh and blood. Family. But alas, therein lies the rub. We don't know where to turn.

*My question is, do you think our feelings are justified? Commensurate with her behaviour? Or are we over-thinking all this? I'm not necessarily looking for a specific answer per se, but any well-informed and/or professional thought will be very much appreciated.*

Thank you",03Jun2020,3

My mom is one of my major sources of anxiety but in my family, communication is considered disrespectful backtalk and any expression of emoiona is frowned upon.

154,My therapist says I should try to acknowledge my achievements instead of focusing so much on my shortcomings so I’m just gonna brag for a second and I’d love to hear how some of you guys have improved!

My mom passed when I was young and my dad passed my senior year of college which was when I really lost it. I fell deep into drugs and ended up almost failing out of college and went to jail with a pretty serious charge. That was almost 5 years ago and I’m doing so much better! I finally got some help and managed to quit the drugs and started medication to actually help my anxiety instead of just hiding from it. I also got my record expunged and started working in the medical field. I finally got accepted to nursing school this year and I’m doing really well in my program. I also started dating the love of my life and we have an amazing relationship. Sometimes it’s hard to see past our shortcomings but it feels really good to acknowledge how far we’ve come,03Jun2020,1

I am currently doing research (paper and presentation) on ACOA for counselling. As an ACOA myself I think it's important to include lived experiences in my presentation rather than just reported stats. If you are comfortable and able, I am wondering if you would share a brief summary of how your experience has impacted you as an adult?

You can include whatever comes to mind, whether its the impact on current relationships, self-esteem, specific barriers, thoughts, feelings, negative or positive. I don't want to lead anyone to share something specific. Please share whatever comes to mind that you think is important for individuals entering the counselling field to know about ACOA. Feel free to leave your contribution in the comment section or send me a private message if this would make you more comfortable.

Additionally, if you are comfortable with me sharing your comment (anonymously) in my presentation please just let me know I have your consent.

I'm 18 in a few days, almost guaranteed a place at a good university, I know what I want to do with my life and I have family and friends who I know are there to support me. Yet I really don't see the point in living anymore. 


I've dealt with what most people I've spoken to have said is likely depression since I was 15 (its never been diagnosed and the only counsellor I've seen about it said that I was fine, apparently), but it's never gotten this bad. It feels as if there's nothing to look forward to and that only bad things are going to happen. Any thoughts of the future just fill me with dread and pessimism, nothing else.

159,"I only have a couple of friends. Years ago I disengaged from our larger social circle. I found that I had almost nothing in common with them. Once I stopped using alcohol and hard drugs it became more apparent. 
The past couple of years I find myself reaching out less and less to the two friends I kept in contact with. It's typically a month or more between our engagements. I often think about them but feel unable to reach out to them. It's as if there are two sets of hands on the wheel, so to speak. A part of me wants to maintain these relationships while another part of me feels cold, distant and paralyzed at the thought. It takes so much energy and concentration for me. That energy is dissipating more every month. The same goes for my professional and familial relations. I can't make new connections, can't maintain old connections and have no motivation to do so. I often wonder if I am self-sabotaging. I'm caught in this maelstrom and won't reach for the escape rope.",03Jun2020,1

I'll start working on something I'm really excited about for a few days but then I'll suddenly have no motivation to to do anything and think it was stupid to think I could ever do that.

161,"So... has anyone ever internally had a surge of an emotion that’s almost too much to control without physically feeling extreme tension? Mine are usually sadness, anger, uncertainty. 
My back and my neck aches because of how tense I am, and it’s exhausting. 
The tension and emotion then leads to a really horrible feeling of disconnectedness from loved ones around me, purely “get. away. from. me”. 
I struggle to talk about how I feel, not because I don’t want to, but because I can’t seem to string the sentence together to explain the feeling without feeling ridiculous.
Throughout a long portion of my life I felt as though whatever I tried to speak up about was dismissed and left me believing my opinion and feelings don’t matter and I’m now finding it difficult to speak up. 
I’m worried that I will push the people close to me away.

164,"I'm 28 years old, I've been struggling with depression from a young age and from anxiety in my early 20s, but now I'm much better with both.

The thing is sometimes I'm afraid of what the future will bring and if I will be capable to survive.

My parents are still alive thank God, I do good in life, have good income, apartment and so on, but there is this fear inside me that I might lose everything and be even worse than before.

It was so hard managing to get better - I quit drinking, changed diet, try to exercise moderately as much as I can, because in my early 20s I could barely leave the house due to anxiety.

Right about that time, I left my home because I believed that my relatives caused the problem (maybe true, maybe not), and then I was sleeping on the floor of one almost run-down apartment, and little by little I tried to improve, which was extremely hard at first, but right now I'm pretty content with my life, but this underlying feelings and sadness sometimes are still there and I don't know why.

I didn't had panic attacks for a long time, but today had a little one, which passed quite fast, but it reminded me how weak I was before, and how tough it was to get better, how much struggle it was.

So... today I just feel afraid what will happen in the future. How do you cope with such thoughts when you feel down?",03Jun2020,1

He also needs to tap things or lock doors a certain number of times in case something bad happens to me or his family. Rationally he is aware these are illogical, but he is too scared to stop.

He also freaks out that he is in denial about stuff. He suffers intrusive thoughts about being gay/bi and not knowing it, being into incest, being schizophrenic or bipolar, being a pedo and being unaware of it and being unsure if he's in the right relationship any time he notices another woman/celebrity and thinking attraction to anyone else means he's bad.

I made an appointment and I went to the doctor today to try and get some medication. She was the first person I'd ever told face to face about my suicide attempt in 2013. When she asked the last time I had suicidal thoughts, I had a moment of inner-struggle, trying to decide if I should lie or tell the truth. I stuttered out that it was last week, but there was no plan or anything like that. 

She gave me a daily doze of Celexa/Citalopram, and an as-needed prescription for Propranolol. We did some bloodwork, with results coming in in a few days, to see if there are other factors at work, such as vitamin deficiencies.  After a follow-up in 6 weeks, we will see where I am. She mentioned the possibility of a mood stabilizer at that point. 

The words bipolar were used. Personality disorder. She said we'd look at how I was doing at the 6 week checkup, and discuss further from there.

She said the medication helps most, but for some it does make the problems worse. And I sort of expect that to happen, because I'm just... I'm wrong. I think wrong. I behave wrong. I socialize wrong. I do everything wrong. I am just not wired the way I'm supposed to be.

I've also paid up three months in advance on the online counseling program, BetterHelp. I used it in March and it was great, but I had to stop because I was overwhelmed and finances weren't good. So I have my first session with my new counselor in 30 minutes.

178,"Hi. This is a throwaway account. 

My alias is JBujwal99. I'm a freshman in college, and I'm in the midst of my semester now.

I'm seeking some sort of counsel, or anything in general, pertaining to my current mental and emotional health. I don't know if emotional health is covered by this subreddit, but I'm trying anything right now.

I'd like to say I'm a pretty stable guy usually, but that's only because my many insecurities and fears are suppressed by daily, every day life. Like many people, I overthink a lot, which only further strengthens my everlasting insecurities and fears. However, I'm not the best when it comes to keeping it in check.

I feel like this is a silly thing to post about, but I'm ""reaching out"" per say because I need a way to cope with all of this. Quarantine has affected my health immensely because of what little social interaction I get, and now depending on a phone in order to communicate with my friends doesn't help either. Let me just get to the point.

In real life, people would call me an extroverted person who likes to talk with people, make jokes, and just have fun. And I do really, really enjoy those things, but I'm convinced a large part of why I've put up that mask is a coping mechanism for my overthinking. This quarantine has proven to me that, if left alone for long enough with my own thoughts, my overthinking will dig at me, eating away at my mental and emotional health if over a long period of time. I tried to counteract this by the use of social media to connect with new people, and also stay connected to my friends, but I find myself more irrational and more emotional than usual. Social media makes me incredibly angry whenever someone doesn't respond immediately even though I *know* that they're a human, they're not attached to their phone 24/7. I get tired of people way too easily because of small things even though I *know* they're just human and everyone has flaws. I get randomly emotional and irrational at the slightest things that would've never really set me off before.

It's probably good to mention that I also got out of a relationship just a few days before the quarantine began in my country (USA). However, I'd like to say that although I went into a small depression afterwards, I've successfully recovered from it and even learned a few things. 

Continuing on with my overthinking, I do think I've dealt with it reasonably well in the past. I have two best friends out of a small best friend group whom I go to all the time when I'm dealing with things (I already told them about all of this) but all they can do is support me as much as possible. I am thankful for their support. But regardless, my overthinking has still progressed. 

I feel as though I've been in such a low point regarding the degredation of my mental and emotional health since a long time, and I don't know if I'm just being irrationally stupid or if there's something wrong with me or if I'm just not dealing with things properly. 

Please excuse my ignorance about anything. I don't know much about mental or emotional health, but I feel the impacts of it for sure. If there's a name for this or if there's something I can do, please tell me. I'm reaching out for any help that I can. Thank you.

P.S. Sorry if this was just, like, a *mess* of words. I'm kinda just throwing my thoughts out onto the screen. I think I did okay portraying the message, though. Thanks.",03Jun2020,1

181,"Hi,

I have been seeing a therapist for a few months now to work through some insecurities, negative core beliefs about myself, and a few other personal concerns. It is still early on but I have been diagnosed with anxiety and adjustment disorder (from my childhood mostly).

I was going to post this on relationship advice but I thought it's not really about my boyfriend but about me and my emotions/overthinking.

I have always been very emotional, had a lot of insecurities, and am very good at overthinking situations. Recently, it's been affecting my romantic relationship, which is part of the reason I wanted to start therapy.

It usually happens two to three times a month. I'll be a bit insecure or uncertain of some things and either I won't get my way or a sarcastic comment will get to me that usually doesn't bother me, sometimes I'll just be emotionally hypersensitive without being provoked. Then I'll start taking different things that have been said to me or things my boyfriend hasn't done (he's not very emotional or sentimental, so sometimes I compare him to other guys, unfortunately) and putting them together and get myself all emotionally riled up. Which leads to a lot of overthinking and insecurity. Things like not feeling good enough, feeling unloved or forgotten. Feeling like a chore or burden to him. This leads to a lot of tears, sadness, and sometimes I will just isolate myself in bed and other times I'll be very irrational and bombard my boyfriend with calls or texts, trying to get some point across that he doesn't care about me or like me anymore, which isn't true but in the moment I lead myself to believe.

Basically, my extreme overthinking cancels out any good in my relationship for the days that I have these ""nervous breakdowns"" and leads to crying and resentment to my boyfriend when he has done nothing wrong.

Does this only happen to me? Am I having some sort of emotional outburst? Does anyone know what this is called?

I've learned some self-soothing techniques, but I only use them afterward when I'm tired of crying and feeling overwhelmed with my emotions. Often the following day I feel numb and like I don't want to interact with anyone.

I want some perspective on how I can prevent this and stop self-sabotaging my relationship with these outbursts that put my BF through the emotional ringer.",03Jun2020,1
182,"So the first time I got one of these ""fits"" that was actually noticed and documented online was about four months ago. I typed in, """"and over"", over and over again for six hours in a venting chat of a friend server on discord. Nobody talked to me, nobody was awake, but I still did it. Before I did it on paper or said it aloud to myself, said or wrote a word or phrase over and over again, or said and wrote things that had no meaning to others, gibberish, now I do it on the computer. I don't copy and paste, I type it all no matter how hard it is to type, and I never mistype it. I don't have the best memory of what happened during this periods, I just remember feeling nothing, I just remember things repeating, not the words I typed, but everything repeated over and over again. 

Eventually I started using the lowercase h more, I typed h over and over again. I changed my username and profile picture as well. h, hhhhhhhhhhhh, hear, and other things. As some profile pictures I used a close up of a chicken behind a cage, a close up of it's wing, I used a bowl of grapes, I used an image of a brown bulletin board with the word hear on it, I used a completely red photo, I used a picture of the old wallpaper, and  I used close ups of objects. I don't know if I change the profile pictures in the middle or not, or the username, I just see the after affects.

The times I have more consciousness and emotion,  I can go from hysterically laughing in joy, to threatening to kill others, to crying and breaking down. It feels like my head is being taken away, like I'm just watching behind a pane of glass. In front of that glass, is mess. A thousand thoughts going wild, but only one action being enforced. I can see everything happening, but I'm not doing it. I am, but my hands are doing it without me telling them to. I can look around and truly think with a clearness I can never achieve, but in front of me is a mess. I can hear it, it's very loud. Like a cafeteria full of small children, you can never grasp any one word or conversation. If I tried though, I might be able to force myself to do something, to break that looping, but I don't feel particularly inclined to do so.

Sometimes other things happen. I go into my kitchen, and open all the cupboards, utilities, and doors, even the one to the garage and the one leading outside, and I stand there. My mom has to shake me and ask me why I did all of it, I say I don't know. I walk through the dark house at night with a knife, or I flick the light on and off for a while until someone realizes and stops me. I just feel, blank the entire time, or when I have slight conscious I feel hysterical.

What is this. This might just be a normal panic attack thing, but I don't think it is. I have panic attacks and these are not anything like them. I feel like my head is slowly dithering away, like life will just collapse. Like maybe I'll just be left alone, in an empty white void. Nothing.",03Jun2020,1
183,"So I'll try to keep this short.

I've met my girlfriend almost two years ago and we've been together for over a year and a half. From the start, I knew she had some emotional struggles and here home situation wasn't really a help.

Now and then, she has her moments in which she feels really bad. Normally after a while, a couple of days, sometimes a week or two, things seemed to get better. This time however, it has been the worst yet and I'm really concerned. She says she doesn't know what's making her feel so bad, but I believe it's the sum of multiple cases:

\- firstly, her father died when she was 17, being terminally ill for the last 5 years of his life. She and her family haven't been fully recovered from his death yet. My gf really fears death and the thought I could one day, die as well.

\- she feels really alone in her family. Her mother, grandparents, uncle and his wife all work together in the same family business across the street. they all live next to each other so they almost always eat together during breaks, they travel together, live practically together, ... since she doesn't want to work their after finishing college, this has led to some breach between her and the other members of the family.

\- because the life of her family is busy and mostly centered around the business, life at her home isn't really cosy. She's often alone at home, lunch is prepared by a housemaid and dinner is almost never made, everyone just takes something from the fridge and eats it alone.

\- her relation with her family, and mostly her mother, is really bad. They often fight, and it keeps getting worse. Her mother is often very negative about her, has a lot of commentary and mostly bosses her around instead of actually talking likes persons, instead just giving her jobs and complain about the work she didn't do in the house.

\- at this point, my gf doesn't dare to go downstairs to grab something to eat. She is constantly afraid about someone entering her room, she's startled at the slightest sound of someone comming upstairs, ...

\- what doesn't help is that the last time she was depressed, when she was 16, her family made her break up with her boyfriend, made her delete all social media, changed her from school, refused her to contact her friends for weeks, ... She now fears they will do this again

Basically, my girlfriend is really unhappy at home and it growing apart from her family.

So now she makes remarks as ""I don't want to live anymore,"" ""I want to die,"" ""I need to get out of here,"" ... She also suffers from panic attacks and has heartache whenever stress rises. I'm really concerned and I don't know what to do. She can't even dare to leave her room, let alone reach out to her family. Luckily, a couple of days ago they heard her cry so now they've made a appointment with a psychiatrist, but not even a day later they treat her the same as usual, yelling at her etc.

We live an 2h travel from each other, with corona out and exams on the way, so we can't see each other. Currently I almost facetime with her 24/7, even when we sleep and study.  This is partly so I'm there for her, partly because I don't really trust her to be by herself.

I'm really concerned and don't know what to do. If anyone reads this and has advice, please provide it, I'm happy to hear it.",03Jun2020,1

He also freaks out that he is in denial about stuff. He suffers intrusive thoughts about being gay/bi and not knowing it, being into incest, being schizophrenic or bipolar, being a pedo and being unaware of it and being unsure if he's in the right relationship any time he notices another woman/celebrity and thinking attraction to anyone else means he's bad. I find it highly unlikely he is somehow all of these things be fears, and he is adamant he is none of them, it's just the fear of ""what if"".

187,"Hello everyone. 29M here.

As the title implies, I don't like myself. At all. I think I started feeling like this during high school with feelings of inadequacy that many people around me were very prone to strengthen every time they had an opportunity.

I don't really know where to start and I don't mean to take too much of your time, so excuse the cringy statement but... there's basically nothing I can do that won't make me feel like some worthless spoiled piece of shit. Even writing this makes me feel like that, my mind is telling me that this subreddit is probably full of people that have had it way harder than me throughout life, therefore I'm an intruder and a spoiled brat that just needs some venting.

I think I've had an easy life. Nothing really bad ever occurred to me outside of the stuff that unfortunately happens to most people (bullying, rejections, etc...). I suspect I've never really managed to get past the inadequacies I felt during my teenage years and now they've grown outside of my control (which is yet another reason to criticize myself, how come I haven't gone past this at 29?)  


I still live with my parents and I am always angry at everything and everyone. Most of the time, if they dare ask something of me I feel like punching a wall and start muttering things I really am ashamed of. I regularly wish my 5 year old niece would just \*\*\* so she would stop interrupting me or making so much noise. Dinner with my parents is bothersome because what the hell am I still doing in this house at 29? Then my father starts chewing with his mouth open and burps and sometimes food falls to the ground and I need to leave because I literally start trembling from anger. As ridiculous as it is, I started a diet a couple months ago just because of my father behaving like a fucking all-consuming machine when he eats, I went from 84 pounds to 77 and intend to keep eating less and less to distance myself from his behavior. That's kind of an irrational logic, I know. Fact is, he works 12 hours a day and that probably makes him hungry. I stay home all the time and therefore don't feel the same. I gave up on my job 4 months ago to become a freelance translator, so now I work from home, though I can't give me any merits for that. I've managed to find some jobs already but my head will never convince itself that this is gonna last, I've just been lucky and I fucking deserve to go back to the office like everybody else. It doesn't matter if I studies languages and actually like what I do now, ""i don't have the right to do this"" and the only reason why I'm doing it is because I was too tired of dealing with people in the office and decided to give up on them instead of making the effort to change things. And yes, I know I've changed things by doing something else and taking risks and whatever, but I sincerely don't think that's enough. I can't explain, my mind will always tell me I'm wrong.

I've tried to change things. Started psychotherapy 2 years ago, then became a member of the Red Cross, then did some giveaways online for charity. Nothing worked. I feel like an intruder in the Cross, they ""are all better than me"", I'm only there because I have no fucking direction in life and should be fucking ashamed of existing. I know what you're thinking, I know that when I criticize myself I'm irrational and only end up saying ""I suck because I suck""... but that sounds very convincing in my head.  There is nothing I can do that won't make me feel like this... let me make one more example, then I'll stop because I don't want this to be too long: 

So, since I'm home and decided to lose weight (remember, just to distance myself from my father), I started walking on the treadmill each day for 2 hours. But hey, I feel ashamed of having a treadmill because my parents bought it for me (it's also very expensive), so I should walk outside to stop thinking about that. But walking outside means wearing clothes. Clothes that mommy will have to wash, because I'm 29 and never even wash my clothes, ofc. So let's go back to the treadmill and wear only underpants for 2 hours (underpants that I will then put on after showering even if they smell because I don't want to give more work to my mother). But walking on a treadmill for 2 hours still makes me feel like a piece of shit. So let's read books while walking. I'm reading Dune right now. It's great and all, but... what the fuck do I need fiction for? Why don't I read stuff that will actually teach me something instead of wasting time with sci-fi? Why don't I read that New Zealand travel guide I bought months ago and still haven't touched? Also why do I waste 2 hours of time walking when I could be helping my mother with the housework? So I could maybe learn how to wash my fucking underpants?

I mentioned New Zealand. I decided to go there for a year (supposedly) to force myself to learn living alone and gain some self-confidence.... maybe after that my head will stop yelling at me?   
I was supposed to leave in 3 days, but then Covid happened and I've had to postpone everything to god knows when. I'm learning to cook in the meantime, but it's not like I have any merits for that. Again, I could save the world tomorrow and still wouldn't stand the sight of my stupid face in the mirror. And the worst thing is don't have a specific reason for that. I just hate it. It's stupid and I would never be so unreasonable when thinking about other people, but that's how it is. 

I'll mention relationships outside of the family now. I have few friends (but that's ok) but don't really get along with most people. They're too different. I get nervous around them, every movement of their face and every word they say can tell me they despise me. There's very few people that don't feel hostile to me. I'm very insecure around everyone, basically.

I'm sorry this was kinda confusing, I will stop here even without mentioning other important stuff. If you managed to read everything up to this point, thank you very much.",03Jun2020,1

For background I’m female, in the UK and I’m 23.

I’ve tried to start counselling a couple of times but I just never really know where to start. How am I supposed to deal with my problems when I have so many and they all affect me in ways I don’t know and can’t explain in a couple of introductory sessions?

Sooooo brief history: very clear signs of autism from nursery &amp; school reports but never diagnosed, sexually groomed online aged 12, bullied aged 11-14, binge-purge mid teens, self harmed 12-16, suicide attempts at 15 &amp; 16, sexually assaulted at 16 and 20, raped at 18 and 19, one of which involved spiking, plus large memory gaps age 5-12 which a psychologist suggested may be related to trauma, which matches up to dates of my ex-stepfather in my life, who I did not get on with but don’t remember any altercations with. After the rape at 19 I had a breakdown, didn’t leave my room at all for three months, dropped out of uni. Restarted uni six months later. Now extending my final year due to crippling anxiety.

I just don’t know where to start getting help. I’m on sertraline and propranolol but I need more help. Can anyone please give me any advice? I know this is a shambles of a post.",03Jun2020,1

191,"Hi, so while never formally diagnosed (I probably should have been) I have struggled with my eating habits for over about 6 years. I have done everything from over exercising, attempting  to purge (I could never do it correctly) and restricting. It's been a year since I have allowed myself to eat less than 1000 calories. I used to try to keep it between 300 and 500. And It was going really good. Until it wasn't. Around Christmas I started getting the urge to purge and restrict. I managed to make it through without getting sucked back in. I was doing fine until I started a new job. I switched to working night shift and I sleep through one meal a day and when I wake up I'm not hungry. So I don't want to eat. With this and constantly moving and lifting at my new job, I've noticed I started losing weight. And while completely unintentional, it ignited that little voice in my head that said ""But what if I lost more?"" I know the answer is professional help, but given the situation I'm in that really is not an option. Does anyone have any advice on how to stop wanting to go back. I fully recognize it was an awful time in my life, I was tired, sick and depressed. So why do I still feel the urge to go back to how I was ?",03Jun2020,1
192,"I've gone to multiple doctors (including 3 psychiatrists) and one psychologist over the years. 

First, it was some depression and anxiety. Took small doses of anti depressants for a while, which did nothing. The doctor told me to lose weight because I was obese.

Went to university, changed towns, was poor and feeling miserable, spent whole days crying, absolutely sobbing and gasping for air. At this point I had dropped every medication since my doctor told me to only take it for a few months. At the end of the first year, I went to see the university's psychiatrist, my first one. And he treated me beyond shit. Made me weigh myself in front of him and told me that that was my problem. Sent me home with some stuff to help me lose weight. I was devastated and cried the whole time I was there and the rest of the day.

About a year went by, I was still feeling like shit and extremely anxious to go to another psychiatrist given my previous experience. But I ended up doing it.

Went to the second psychiatrist (a family friend), who was very nice and told me to start taking some medication since I was feeling extremely bad about myself. Also told me that losing some weight might do me good, although he didn't say it as violently as the previous one.

The medication helped to some extent but I was still feeling miserable and numb. Just spent a little less time crying like a baby.

A year goes by, always taking the medication. I lose some weight, get a boyfriend, get a nice job, gain the weight back again but now at least I have some money to pay a real professional. I needed to be productive, to be able to focus during my job (being a software developer I feel like it gets impossible some times).

Went to my third psychiatrist, who was clearly well trained but had a very distinct approach. His whole thing was to trigger my problem. So I cried and had one of the worst panic attacks of my life. He never mentioned my weight by the way, I felt like someone finally understood that eating is my comfort and that I'm not depressed because of it (although I admit it doesn't help and can make it worse, but it's not the root of the problem). He told me to increase my medication and to be reevaluated in a few months. I was taking the maximum dosage by this point.

The next part I admit I shouldn't have done. This was about a year ago and I never got reevaluated. I have unlimited access to medication so I just kept taking what he told me (plus a bit of Xanax). Now, the thing is, I'm completely dependent on this shit. If I forget taking them for a day or so, I start crying and it takes me days to recover. If I take them everyday I don't freak out and I'm mostly able to do my job. But I still feel numb, depersonalized, sad, have some suicidal thoughts, anxious, everything. Just not to the point of being completely useless.

Thing is, I hate living like this and depending on these chemicals. I want to be a mom but I can't and don't want to take these pills when I'm pregnant. I want to actually fix this and not just hide behind these pills. I wanna stop taking them but I feel like it would literally make my job impossible and my life unbearable.

195,"I love my family, my daughter and my wife. But I dont feel like I can make them happy anymore, but it goes both ways. My happiness is based off thier happiness with me and as of late I used to make them proud and that made me happy which in turn made me more happy go lucky and gave them more to smile about. Now I've come to the realization that they all see me as a selfish and inconsiderate because I'm just trying to put a filter on life because I don't like to dwell on sadness and be unhappy about things or life. I like making the most of things, but i also don't lose touch with feeling and being apathetic I listen to everyones problems and put my headspace in thiers to best be of help when I can. All my efforts as of late have me losing my home, my job and having to restart in the midwest. Prior military city boy from Maryland, traveled the world settled down in cali and had to move to Misso. I'm starting to think my early exposure to sex might have something to do with my constant thinking and wanting of it... i was maybe 4-5 yo when it happened and it steadily happened from that point on. I cheated on my wife during her pregnancy and now she won't look at me the same. I promised her I'd never leave her, I'm a man of my word.

And feel like I can't be a good enough husband to her nor make her happy... i don't feel wanted anymore. We love eachother, but we're stuck in a quicksand of love. Always will love eachother, but we're falling apart and neither of us wants to leave the other and we have no clue how to fix things. We've talked to a marriage counselor that hardly helped... Now I'm back thinking about being single and stupid and young, but I won't leave her. I made a promise. What is a man worth without his word? My ambition, my libido, my self esteem and self worth are all in free fall and I just want to die.. I strongly believe and stand against suicide... but man... lately I've felt like im more than deserving of eternal damnation for cheating death if that's what's going to happen... at least then it would hurt... but not forever. Not as bad as having me around as a horrible son,  husband,  father, etc.... im 25 years old and im in something around 80k worth in debt... working agriculture for 10+ hours a day every day now.

196,"I’m not very good at writing sentences and my grammar isn’t the best but please bear with me.

I am 14 and I often hear things that aren’t actually there. It started about a year ago when I was getting ready for bed and I heard the voice of a man, his voice was a bit higher than usual and he talked as if he were on a cooking show. After this, it didn’t hear anything odd for a while until I started hearing a constant buzzing sound that sounded similar to a phone on silent mode which was really aggravating but I could deal, then I started hearing the voice of my late mother, wasn’t anything odd just her saying my name which was very upsetting if I’m completely honest. 

Since then they have gotten very distressing such as hearing my dad screaming at me for I can’t even remember despite him not even being home at the time, a deep male voice telling me how much he hates me and how exactly he plans on killing me (that one scared me and to be honest with you, I ended up running into the bathroom and crying for at least 10 minutes), and the most recent one was a male and a female voice, I couldn’t really hear what they were saying but it sounded like they were downstairs, I also heard footsteps going up the staircase next to my room. I wouldn’t know if this has anything to do with why I hear things but I got diagnosed with GAD when I was 11 and so hearing what sounded like intruders ended with me locking myself in my room and having an anxiety attack which was very not fun.

197,"First of all I hope this is a good sub for this post. I need some advice about how to help my Mom deal with an issue that's been bothering her for a little over a year now. Basically this all started around May 2019 when my grandmother passed. The will left some things to my Dad that really pissed off the rest of the family and created a lot of very tense situations. The main issue was the cabin that my grandmother owned and left it to my Dad. And his sister (my aunt) owned a cabin about 100ft away. Now the issue with the will caused all of my Dad's family to fight with each other, especially him. So when my Mom was at my grandmother's house to gather items my aunt lost her shit at my Mom for no apparent reason and ever since that day she hasn't been able to go to our cabin since they are right next door and we actually ended up having to sell the cabin that's been in our family for almost a century because of this tension. There's no chance of our families reuniting. The hole is dug too deep and too much has been said. But that incident where my aunt yelled at my Mom has been traumatizing her ever since. And she frequently mentions having nightmares of her screaming. And she will break down crying every once in a while saying how much it bothers her. I've tried giving her advice along the lines of occupying your mind and focusing on the good not the bad but she still mentioned having another nightmare just last night. I want to be able to help her but idk what to say. I personally don't understand how she can be bothered by this for so long. I've had friends and family I've known my whole life just go away because of a falling out we had and of course it sucks and I think about it from time to time but it doesn't consume my life the way it consumes hers. I just really need some advice as to what I should say to her or what I can get her to do to finally get over this. A grown woman shouldn't be this upset at some bitch yelling at her. Again I don't think her being upset is unreasonable but I think letting it take over her life and restricting her from going to our OWN cabin and causing her to have nightmares is just too much. Sorry if I didn't word this the best. There's a lot going through my mind and I didn't want to drag this on for too long. But I hope it makes enough sense that someone can provide some sort of support. I appreciate any and all answers.",03Jun2020,2
198,"Just to start off—I’m not very articulate when it comes to reddit. I’m fairly new and I haven’t used it very much, so honestly I’m not sure if this should be posted in this other subreddit I found (r/offmychest) or here.
To give an explanation to my title...it’s just what it is. My brother, who is 11 years older than me has filmed me in the shower with his phone hidden under our sink. I’m a girl, just to be clear, and I just finished high school. He’s done this to my sisters (I have 2 who are essentially the middle children, 7 and 9 years older than me) and he started with them. I’m pretty sure he’s done many other things as well. I remember waking up one night to him snapping photos of my chest (with his hand lifting my shirt up) in the dark while all of us should’ve been asleep (the four of us shared one bedroom before because our house doesn’t have many rooms and it’s normal for my family to share rooms. Thankfully, we cleared a room so he sleeps there now). I just pretended to be half awake and went back to sleep, rolled to my side and never spoke of it for years. Mind you I was 11. 
I think at this point in time I started to become...fucked up in the head. This was before I found out that he’d done the same things to my sisters as well, and I guess it just stuck to me. My brother is fucked up. And I’m fucked up for accepting it and doing nothing. 
A few years later the three of us (my sisters and I) caught his phone under the sink. That was the first time I found out that I was being filmed in the shower, and that my sisters were victims, too. My reaction to it was...minimal. I felt no emotion. We snuck his phone out, deleted the footage and placed it somewhere he’d find it. I don’t really remember how exactly I felt, but I don’t remember feeling much of anything. Just “so it’s not just pictures”.
That wasn’t the case for long, though. I started to get worried. And gradually, fear and dread grew in me and it’s bothered me ever since.
We told both our parents later on. We’ve done nothing. All of us just hoped that he’d stop one day and we would just watch our back. I don’t even want anything to happen. I don’t want to confront him. I don’t want my parents to be sad. I don’t want the family to be torn apart.
What makes me feel even worse about this whole thing, though, is how I don’t feel as if I deserve to be scared of my brother. He’s never done anything to me physically. Some months ago I thought of this exact thing. I don’t deserve to feel horrible. I still don’t believe that I do. My sisters aren’t even acting scared. It seems like the only person they worry about is me. But I don’t want them to worry about just me. Why don’t they say anything? Why won’t they tell me if they’re scared? Are they not scared at all?? Am I the only one who’s thinking all of this? If that’s so, then I shouldn’t feel like this. If they aren’t scared, then I don’t deserve to be.
I don’t remember the amount of times I’ve talked to myself. I can’t stop. I can’t stop talking myself down. I’m so fucking terrified, but I don’t deserve to feel this way. I’m so lucky I’m not being sexually abused by him, but I’m just so damn paranoid.
I don’t know if I’m depressed. I took 5 tests online—1 says I’m mildly depressed, 3 says I’m moderately depressed and the last days I’m severely depressed. I know I can’t fully trust these test as they can be unreliable, but I’m too scared to get diagnosed. I don’t even show most of the tendencies depressed people do. I haven’t eaten more or less, my interest in my hobbies haven’t dwindled, my sleeping patterns haven’t changed, etc. I’m afraid of telling my dad how I feel. I’m scared to ask him to take me to get diagnosed. In his eyes, I’ve always been strong. He always tells me I’m strong. He believes in me too much I don’t think I can let him down like this. But I’m so tired. 
I’m not suicidal, but right now the lines are so blurry. Like, I don’t mind if I die right now. If I get stabbed, I want to be left alone to bleed to death. In fact, I think I’d like to be stabbed. I feel like a shitty person. I want to feel the pain when I die. I deserve it.
I can’t count the number of times I’ve just stared into nothing, just talking to myself, crying. Because I know so many people in my life who have it worse. Even right now, as I’m writing this, I’m so hesitant to post it, because it feels like I’m looking for attention. I don’t know if people will believe me, but I’m so fucking exhausted. I don’t even know how often cases like mine happen. I don’t know what to do.
I’ve been rambling, I apologise. I just hope someone’s read this far. I feel so alone. I need advice. I need help.",03Jun2020,2

My whole life, I’m so hyper. Like to the point where I can’t sit still and be comfortable and relax because this anxious energy in my body just wants to go go go go. On a scale of 1-10 it can usually be a pretty high 8. 

Also, focus. It seems my awareness of my outside world is literally everywhere. It can shift from me noticing my fan on my body, to me getting severely lost in a day dream or a thought in a matter of milliseconds. 

Will ADHD meds calm me down or make this even worse? Have an appointment with my psychiatrist on the 16th and am going to talk to him about it.

In addition to the whole stress of dealing with corona and the fear that i may end up hurting my family if i get infected and unknowingly infect them , sth happened last week that i feel weird about . So i was attending a baby delivery and long story short the baby didn't make it and there was severe trauma to the baby which necessitated that it's head be severed and removed operatively , obviously everyone in the delivery room was distraught but they kept their composure . However i did not feel anything . Like i know i should feel sad if not for the baby like for the family but i don't feel anything .

207,"I've been having lots of ups and downs lately. Every time I experience a rough patch I just tell myself it'll get better soon but after about two good days I always come crashing down again and it's really preventing me from advancing at anything I want to accomplish. I'm starting to feel like I have no other option than seeking therapy.


The only problem is that I should decide whether to tell my parents or to go to therapy ""secretly"". My parents care for me a lot so telling them that I'm struggling would definitely hurt them and make them worry. I'm an adult so I don't need my parents to take me anywhere or book me a therapist's appointment, but it still would feel kind of bad to lie to them (due to lockdown I should tell them what I'm doing every time I go out). 


The only other option would be waiting to seek help until around September when I move out. I'm not sure what to do.",03Jun2020,1

Have you ever had a track of something suddenly jam and all you can hear is a single, unmelodious sound. It's the content of the track, but something has gone wrong, it's had a dysfunction and it has ground to a stop at a particular point and it just can't get onto the next bit. Not skipping, but a second of sound, drawn out for much longer than it was meant to be. And cos it was just a second, it stops being what it was, a voice or a beat or anything that made sense, but something loud and neverending.

This has been a problem for as long as I can remember and im curious...

I struggle with this a lot. I will become friends with someone, itll go steady, and suddenly I have this incredible love and passion for them. All I want is to be with them, spend time with them, talk to them, and just everything with them. I get attached and spoil them with love and gifts and attention and I feel like if i lost them it would be awful... and then one day out of the blue I feel so indifferent to them. I suddenly dont care as much, I feel apathetic, and sometimes they even bother me or get on my nerves when they're doing literally nothing? Sometimes even I hate them?

I'm experiencing one of the most devastating depressive episodes that I've ever had and i can't reach out , i feel so lonely and i totally deserve this , i have no life so why would i expect anyone to be interested , 

nothing is happening in my life literally nothing , and please don't suggest some stereotypical things to fill up my life cause i can't do anything , I'm too stupid , weak , mentally unstable , and i can't see myself anywhere close to the normal people.

That might sound like my normal life cycle , but the thing is i met a girl on Twitter almost a week ago ,back in the days we went to the same school and knew each other very well , that was totally a coincidence but we had a nice conversation and followed each other.

I found that she has so much going on in her life ,very popular and charismatic , and almost all her friends are , I mean they definitely have problems also cause life is a tragedy at the end , but at least they are not lonely freaks who either banging their heads against the wall or laying in bed wishing to die like me

214,"TLDR: I’m 23, I have no meaning in life, I’m pretty terrified I’ll never meet someone and I’m losing the will to keep plugging away. Considering packing my things and moving abroad, just so I can feel something other than monotonous boredom.

It all just feels so pointless. I joined the military when I was 18, hated it and ended up leaving at the end of my 4 year contract. I’m now 23, currently in training to join the police (UK not US thankfully) and I know it’s not what I want to do, I never wanted to, it’s just the best option available to me right now. I feel like I’d like to do something working in mental health as I do find fulfilment in personally helping people, but pretty much all routes into that field require university education, which isn’t an option for me. I have no idea what my purpose in life is, and I’ve never been good at anything. The only thing in my life that I’ve stuck to is my physical fitness because I love it, but I’m athletically extremely average, and that’s only because I work hard at it.

I feel like I’ll probably be alone too. I’ve only ever had an intense but brief relationship with one woman, and casual flings with a few others. In all honestly I fell in love with her, but it didn’t work out and despite my heart not wanting to, I understand we’re incompatible and she wasn’t the person I thought she was. She treated me pretty badly. Everything else has been casual and lacking of true emotional connection. My hopes of finding a life partner are so low, I can barely relate to anyone I meet. Modern relationships just feel callous and opportunistic. It feels like people look at potential partners as commodities rather than human beings, being judged on their “sexual market value” rather than the content of their character, with the option of a “higher value” partner only a swipe away. 

I think most people, and my generation in particular, are vapid, vain, narcissistic and void of substance. Dating apps have only reaffirmed this to me. I feel so disassociated with this selfie society, everyone is so obsessed with their meaningless fabricated image on social media. There’s not a single “friend” that I’ve made that I’ve ever forged a real bond with and I feel like I’m going through life with no meaningful connections outside of my parents. We live in a time where people will ask “how are you?” and aren’t interested in the answer. At times I just feel so lonely. What’s the point of life when you’re spending it entirely alone?

I think my lack of faith in finding a woman who I truly connect with affects my overall motivation in achieving what I thought I wanted. I’ve always wanted to create a financially comfortable life so that I could provide my future family with anything they want and need, but when I realise that I’m working for something that may never exist I just seem to lose all motivation. I saved up for a deposit for my first apartment, but the property prices where I live are so extortionate that the mortgage needed would basically make me a slave to the bank. Working to pay off the mortgage for a tiny apartment for the foreseeable future with no financial room to enjoy life outside of work, go travelling or take any entrepreneurial risks. What’s the point in a life like that? It all just seems so frivolous.

I’ve felt totally bored with my life for years. The only reprieve from boredom I had was when I went travelling with some of the money I saved, going from December to February, I had some amazing experiences, but that isn’t real life. I often think of packing my things and moving far away, somewhere like Australia or Canada. Maybe Spain as my Spanish speaking skills would come in handy. Just so I can get out of the hamster wheel I feel myself trapped in. Just so I can feel something meaningful. I feel awful too because I’m so lucky to be a healthy, able human being but I can’t help how I feel.

If you read all that, thank you so much for your time. I don’t know what I want to come out of this post, I just wanted to get this off my chest. I don’t really have anyone to talk to and I feel like I’m deteriorating every day.",03Jun2020,5
215,"Posted to r/depression too. Warning- mentions of self harm, depression and suicide.

 \-

You do not know exactly when you fell into the river of glum. Nor do you recall the first time you fully realised what had happened. All you remember is feeling the cold shock and your arms desperately flailing, hoping to any god that you were going to be saved. But your attempt was just that. An attempt. It took months before you completely sank but when you did, the drowsiness and emptiness filled the days while they blended. Your body constantly fought to keep the water out of your lungs but your mind wanted nothing more than to open your mouth and finally, *finally,* feel the sweet cool liquid fill your lungs so your pain could finally end.

You scream for help, in your own way. Air bubbles reach the surface of the water but people who rarely visit assume it's part of the lake, like it's usually like that. People who frequent notice the bubbles but decide not to acknowledge it; it cannot be that bad. They always miss the warning signs.

After months dragging on and hoping for your end, you finally reach the top again and you allow yourself to smile, a real smile. Your head stays above water for a while, you are not exactly sure how long. Maybe weeks? Days? The time is unimportant to you, you are just simply happy to be above water. You are so happy that you do not notice the pull of the current. When you do notice, it is too late. You have travelled to far to go back so you ride out the journey, terrified of whats to come.

When the journey is completed, you are no longer in the river. You've officially reached the ocean of depression.

Your head aches and you eyes sting. The salty water makes its way up your nose but you cannot do anything to pacify this feeling. Slowly, you begin to sink again. You are no longer free to scream, forced to suffer in incessant silence. Your air bubbles are now ripples but, once again, nobody notices. Your body aches so you stop moving so the pain dulls.

The ripples that used to be slight are now crashing waves which cause you discomfort, but you hope maybe they carry you to shore, so maybe, just maybe, you can escape.

You would do anything to feel fresh water again; anything was better than this. The stinging and aching ganged up on you, making you feel worthless. You think of all the people who face the same and you think of how weak you are. But truthfully? You're not weak. **You're not weak.**

After so very long in the ocean, you notice a bright light down deep into the ocean and you use all of your strength to swim down, hoping to find something to help. You swim forever eventually making your way to the light that you had seen. You are way deeper than you've ever been. You're now in the Abyssopelagic Zone - the official abyss.

But it's clear now that the brightness that had appealed to you was not a clear way to escape. It would bring you out of pain for mere seconds before it hit you again. Drugs, alcohol and self harm was a temporary fix. It didn't help you escape the ocean and eventually, you sunk deeper. The deepest layer. Hadalpelagic Zone.

Many people have visited and many didn't make a return. Most had ended it themselves. Most just sat there for very long.

When you reached there, you decided to stay for a while before doing anything rash. But the constant thought in you head had been 'how long will this last?'

I'm amazed at the results! I've never been one to exercise and always give it up after a week or so when doing it for weight loss, but now I'm doing it for my mental health I absolutely love it and look forward to it most days.

I've found that I can skip a day no bother, but if I skip 2 I feel a dip in my mood/mental capacity on day 3. Which is what leads me to my new problem... I have a muscle injury (I think from a looooong day of walking having forgotten to stretch before or after, oopsie!) And everywhere I've read about it recommends simply resting it for a few weeks till it gets better on its own.

220,"Does every hospital suck? Are there any good mental hospitals out there? Every hospital seems to have underpaid staff and too many patients to treat at once. Nearby facilities that either I or a person I know have been to seem to have the same issues. They're dirty, the staff doesn't care about their patients, and they are not getting treated properly. I've talked to a few people who were previously in hospitals and they all said they lied to get out. They said that they were happy so they could get out of the hell they were in whilst staying there. And every treatment group is the same. They all seem to be set up as addiction treatment groups. But not everyone has an addiction problem. These state hospitals are failing to help us. So many patients get readmitted after getting discharged. And some patients even end up in prison. The treatment for young adults and children should be prioritized because they are our future, but all treatment should change. After leaving the hospital I was still depressed, I just faked being better because I couldn't stand the screaming and the violence that I saw. There wasn't enough staff to supervise two groups. I made friends who ended up taking their lives because they couldn't be helped. These hospitals need better funding, but even with that funding, what can they do? Is it worth funding? At least they could make a few groups for people with different problems. In a large group, we feel even more unheard than we were before we got admitted.

I am completely disabled by obsessive thoughts and compulsions and constant doubt and obsessive categorization regarding every single thing I do. I haven't left the house in a year. I can't engage in any hobby, every single hobby needs to be a specific way. My creativity is stifled so badly. I can't eat most days. I'm just so miserable.

I've been battling this for about 2 years, it wasn't as bad before High school ended. I can't function anymore. I just need help. I haven't seen or heard of anyone with my severity of OCD so I feel extremely isolated. Only Howard Hughes and a lady I saw on Dr Phil a long time ago, and at the time of seeing that I wasn't as bad as this.

I am being supported by family. I could just give up. I've been working so hard for years, fighting compulsions, breaking obsessions by forcing new thoughts into my head.

223,"Hello, I’m back :3 Today I want to talk about health anxiety. I haven’t been diagnosed with any mental illness like try that, OCD or whatever so feel free to consider my thoughts invalid uwu 

Last year, I sort of had some health anxiety?? I had random head and chest pain which made me panic but it was nothing to worry about (duh lol). Then with the coronavirus situation going on, it came back but exclusively related to that and nothing else. This was mainly in March, I can’t remember if I made a post about what went on on Thursday, 12th of March 2020 but let’s just say... it doesn’t matter lol. So anyway, now that time has passed since then and I’ve not left my house in nearly three months, my “anxiety” related to the coronavirus pandemic has largely subsided (God is good :))

So uh now, I’m going to talk about eating disorders. I by no means am starting that I have an eating disorder. So yeah, I joke about when chatting with my mum and I tell her I’m fat, just a joke obvs and I don’t think it really. Like, I’m not the skinniest of people but I’m not TERRIBLY overweight. But I’ve definitely lost a lot of weight recently, methinks.

Recently, I’ve been worrying a bit about what I eat. There’s this supermarket chain where I live, and their tuna sandwiches are very good BUT they use white bread for it and if any YouTuber has taught me anything, specifically about white bread, it’s TheOdd1sOut (if you’ve seen his video about junk food, you’ll know what I’m talking about :P ). I’ve really always been taught that white bread is Not Particularly Good but in moderation, apparently, it’s fine in moderation. However, a few weeks ago, I was planning to have one of these sandwiches when I felt like I shouldn’t bc white bread... and I frantically started googling if it’s really bad and everything and eventually, my mum suggested that I simply remove the bread, take the filling stuff with tuna and everything and stick it in between some brown bread. So I did do that but I just thought I was so so stupid that I punched myself in the stomach right in front of her lol. I don’t really self-harm that much, tho I stabbed myself with a pen the other day.

But what am I getting at here? Well, I’ve started to have this bad feeling at the back of my head when I’m eating, even when I haven’t eaten THAT much (idrk, I’ll have to pay attention as to when I start feeling bad tomorrow at breakfast). Not just because I don’t want to become some sick glutton but also because I worry about if what I’m eating is doing me harm or not. I haven’t been eating chocolate much lately; on Mother’s Day (15th), Dad got a LOT of chocolate and shortbread biscuits and stuff and I ate more than I should have probably, I didn’t feel absolutely awful but decided to tone down the chocolate consumption. Since then I’ve had one straciatella yoghurt and two Kinder Schoko-Bons, all on separate days and that’s it in terms of chocolate. I don’t recall anything apart from that. I was going to have  an After-Eight the other day (they are very, very flat if you didn’t know) because my parents were having one each and they didn’t want to have one if I wasn’t going to and just as I was getting one out for myself, I had a random intrusive thought saying, ‘Giving in to temptation haha,’ literally just in a humorous tone and so my parents had theirs but I didn’t. So that’s that, thank you for reading, I will make another post on a different topic now :3

guys I have done something that I sincerely regret about a month ago  I told somebody in an online first person shooter  to  hang himself many times .If you dont play online first person shooters  then your not gonna fully understand this but the guy was rage hacking and was on the other team .rage hacking is a form of cheating in which your opponents automatically dies as soon as you press the fire button  if they can be shot in the first place of course when you are facing a rage hacker The 30-50 minutes of potential enjoyment is completely ruined by another person so I got frustrated and said something I shouldnt have said(hang yourself) and the dude typed ok thats fucked up I know he didnt mean it but thats fucked up

Sometimes this utterly irrational and ludicrous fear of him doing it suddenly comes to my mind ,since he is banned he is ignoring his account completely and thats not helping it either. these laughable thoughts keep haunting me and making me anxious and  they'v had a negative effect on my mental state .   for anybody reading this : it might seem obvious that when people say hang yourself they dont mean it and thats the case for all the other nasty shit people say on the internet when people are behind a monitor they say stuff that they would never say irl and maybe we should think about the receiving end of  the stuff we post on the internet I for one will never say hang yourself or anything like it  again",03Jun2020,1

I’ve now known her for almost two weeks, my most recent lesson was today and my next is on Friday (I’m nearly 16 and male btw)

She was giving me time to practise an exercise in the textbook today when I heard the standard sound of a screenshot being made.

When I heard the sound effect, I looked up at my phone screen and I was barely in the shot anyway... I feel like if she wanted to creepily take pictures of she had many much better opportunities.

241,"This will be long, but tldr down there.

I am a 22 year old girl. I am in a relationship for almost 2 years now. I had very strict parents (my mom is probably a narcissist). Here’s my issue.

I was never allowed to experience my teenager years just like everyone else appears to have experienced. I know that there were parties going on, but I was never allowed to go. Due to this, I was rather an outcast and thanks to constant undermining from my mother, I was scared of the other kids as well. 

When I was 19, I got into college and was allowed to go occasionally go out. The problem was, that my friends (that I made) wanted to party a lot. I was allowed to be outside only until 10pm or midnight max, so I have always missed the parts where the memories were made.

When I got into relationship, I was essentially just looking for a way out from my mother. We moved in together very quickly, which meant no curfew for me (my mother got bored of me soon  too, so she stopped caring). 

However, now I had a boyfriend. I couldnt just mindlessly enjoy myself and then wonder what happened. I had always to make sure that nobody got “too friendly” with me, because I would hate to cheat on my bf. Also my bf absolutely despises smoking, which is something I like to do when I drink.

I know my problem is very stupid. And I know that it’s so dumb that I’m literally bawling my eyes out over this for a week now. But now I see that I’m getting my first wrinkles. Graduation is coming (in here we have to take a big test, so lots of studying) and I’m starting to plan my future as working in my field, having a nice house and a kids. 

But I don’t see the part where I get to be me. I can’t see where I can enjoy myself. Where’s my period of going out, having random hook ups, regretting everything and whoring for likes on Instagram? I know it’s idiotic, but this problem seems to be bugging me more than I’d like to admit and I don’t know what to do.

Tldr - always had a curfew, now I have a bf. I feel like I’ve missed out a lot on life when I was a teen and now I’ve got past the point where I can still catch up",03Jun2020,1
242,Hello I’m 17m I’ve been contemplating going to therapy because I believe I have social anxiety among other things. I often disassociate myself from my family feeling embarrassed of them or just uninterested in talking with them. I have friends and often get afraid of losing them but I think I’m more scared of being alone and without any friends then loosing them individually. I’m also not sure how sad I would be if my family died. I believe I would feel sorrow but I’m not sure to what extent. I use to wish for some of there deaths which sounds horrible because I believed it would make my life easier. I can’t tell what is  wrong with me and often over analyze myself and others. I was a fat and and very introverted teen till a few years ago with no friends so that probably had an affect on me. At night especial when under the influence of weed I overthink every interaction I have with people and often think something is wrong with me I just can’t ever tell what is just anxiety driven fears or actually issues I have. I think I’ve gotten a lot better because I go to parties and have friends instead of being always alone consumed by depression and anxiety but I think I still have other issues,03Jun2020,2
243,"In high school I was getting bullied constantly I had no friends I was pushed down a set of stairs and the girl was getting away with it because she was mildly autistic (which was just an excuse) and more stuff I’m not comfortable sharing.

I was getting beat by my dad at home and really wanted to die but I was so angry I wanted them to pay for what they did and wanted the teachers to know how they failed me.

So one day I took my dads Stanley knife ( I didn’t get a gun for two reasons, 1) I didn’t want to accidentally hurt anyone who didn’t deserve it and guns are unpredictable 2) where I lived getting a gun is really difficult ) 

I made my peace I knew I wasn’t going to get out alive and that I was going to hell for it but I just didn’t care.

I planned to just wait outside the first girls class ( I got to leave classes early so they wouldn’t see me in the hall) then when she inevitably started something I’d stab her in the stomach and move on then go to the next girls and do the same.


Obviously it wasn’t planned out that well and I broke down in the bathrooms before the class started and cried I googled school annihilators and realised all the kids killed were hero’s nobody knew what they did to me.

Every time I watch a school shooting episode on stuff like greys or one tree hill, criminal minds or one of the many shows that cover this subject I cry and cry because while I never planned on hurting anyone who didn’t deserve it I see the effect it has on those experiencing them 

So I decided to wait till I was 18 and sue them because some of the stuff was definitely illegal I’m 19 now and sorting the plans to take them down legally 


I’m so sorry this is one of my biggest shames in life and I really hate myself everyday for feeling this way

252,"Growing up my mom had always been someone I was afraid of as a child, I would not feel comfortable at home and would want to spend time with my neighbours kids who my mom knew or my dad - as my parents were separated. 

As I aged my moms paranoia became more prevalent. I would not be allowed to stay over at my friends unless she knew the parents very well. I wasn’t allowed to walk to the bus stop around the corner. These behaviours all continued up until I was 18 years of age. When I started high school my moms paranoia turned into delusions that people were breaking into the house, following her at work. She had video cameras set up in the house at all times. She ended all of her relationships with her friends. She began to accuse her children, myself included of being part of “gang stalking” and being paid off by bikers to hide things in the house or raise her electricity bill so she would be forced out of her home. She accused her friends of doing this too. I was afraid of my mom. Sometimes I would come home from school and she would lash out at me for really small problems. accuse me of being lazy and disrespecting her by not cleaning even though she was organizationally a disaster and a hoarder. I never knew what I was coming home to. School became my only safe space as things progressed. I was lucky enough to be able to go away for university. 

While I was in school my dad ended up getting a form for my mom and she was sent to the hospital for psych assessment and passed all the questions and was returned home. I was told to not speak to my father anymore. And I never did again as I was afraid of her reaction. My brother left home at 20 and stopped talking to my mom since then because he was tired of feeling like a monster and unsafe in his home. 

This whole mess ended this year when unfortunately my mom passed away from cancer. The sad part is she admits to living with symptoms of colon cancer I.e weight loss, liquid bowel movements, having accidents and in the later part fevers and immobilizing pain for about 5 years. She never told anyone. She would drop hints that she thinks that she’s being poisoned because the dog would also have the runs. And she did not trust doctors. When they diagnosed her she was rushed to the ER as she was in so much pain she could not move, she had no choice but to go.  The doctors could SEE the tumour just by looking at her abdomen. It was way too late. She was given 6 months to live w/out 1-2 years with treatment.  She chose no treatment. Through the course of her cancer she kept saying she would get treatment then have me drive out to her and take her to the cancer centre and then have her say actually I don’t want it and then reschedule until next week. She did this for about 4 months until she was admitted into the hospital indefinitely. 

She would play me and my siblings against each other over the course of her illness. All while I felt sorry for her despite having such resentment towards her for such a confusing and scary upbringing. I am not left with myself trying to figure out the damage this has caused me now that I am alone. 

I just wanted to share my story of what I went through. 

If anyone else has a similar story I would love to hear it. If anyone has any suggestions on what I can do for my mental health I would also love to hear that. 

Mental health was a very taboo thing in my household, I just took the first step to see a doctor and now I am waiting for an appointment to receive psychiatric evaluation.",03Jun2020,2

256,"tl;dr: I feel deeply ashamed for having a couple of nice things.

I've dealt with this issue since after college, where I was able to obtain a pretty nice job after graduating when most of my peers graduated jobless into the great recession, and I'm not sure why.

For some background, I'm a first generation minority immigrant and my family and I crawled out from receiving food stamps to being pretty well off at the moment.  I'm now a lawyer, I make a good living, and I saved aggressively to pay off my student debt.  Even though my parents and mentors tell me that I ""deserve"" it - I feel incredibly guilty when I spend more than a little bit of money on myself.  By contrast, I feel fine spending money and splurging on my family and friends.  

For example, I can fit all the clothes I own in a single duffle bag, and when my parents gave me a nice watch (a Longines) for my birthday, I am constantly afraid that people are judging me.  I need to emphasize that **I don't fear being mugged, rather, I'm constantly plagued by the idea that the watch is ""too good"" for me** or ""above my station,""  even though it wasn't a particularly expensive watch. 

By comparison, I can't fathom how some people walk around with Chanel bags or wear Rolexes... I feel like I would die of shame.  The constant thought that keeps repeating in my head is: ""wow did your dad/parents buy you that?""  No one has ever actually said that to me, even though that is true for my watch.  It's gotten to the point that I just can't wear it anymore.

Is this just me?  Do I need help, or am I just making a big deal out of nothing?",03Jun2020,1
257,"Hey! call me Pillow.

(TLDR: I had them since I was small, I have real friends today, but I still have them with me, you can ask me anything about it, how did it commence and much more detail)

I won't be telling my exact age since it's personal information, but I will tell something that all of you can be open about in your opinions on the comment section.

like the title says, I still have imaginary friends, I have friends on my imagination that I interact with often, almost everyday.

since I was a child I had imaginary friends because typically I had no friends.

has I grew up my imagination started to become much more immense and creative to even complex than when i was a child.
these friends started to cheer me up, make me laugh and make me be more open to different interests, traits of myself and such.
they had helped me throughout all my problems and troubles with my life!

yes there was an immense problem of sadness through and probably loneliness but my same imaginary friends also helped me get into relationships and be more open to have more friends!

I'm not a social butterfly and I don't want to be one either, I'm fine with picking and choosing my friends, if I want to talk to someone I am up to talking and if I don't I'm not going to talk to them.

I already have friends and all to this day both real life and Internet, well more Internet than real life.
but I still have my imaginary friends with me, despite how sometimes my imagination also hurts me sometimes, you see sometimes I can see these red colored monsters with eyes on them looking at me intensely ,

because of this I'm afraid of the dark and although I love scary videos and stories, I rather hear them at day than at night.

I also bring you all up to tell that it's fine to have your own imaginary friends sometimes, again they have helped me through my life and I don't really know what could've been of myself if they where never there.",03Jun2020,2

263,"So, I’m an early teenager, and I can’t ever tell if what I’m feeling is just puberty talking or there’s something up with me. Most of what I’m talking about was going on before COVID. 

A lot of the times, I’ll feel really tired and exhausted for no reason other than the fact that I’m just sick of everything: school, my parents, my siblings, my friends (who I dearly love), the carpet, the morning sun, etc. I’ve been kinda just feeling like shit for most of the past six months. With quarantine going on, I feel like I’ve been locked into a hell hole of everything that makes me sad. A lot of tiny things make me ugly cry in my room. Sometimes, I’ll wake up, see an announcement from my teacher on my phone, curl up into a ball, and cry for maybe twenty seconds. I don’t usually cry for a long time, but I do it really frequently. 

I’m also a really nervous person. Like, really fucking nervous. Public speaking is a nightmare, speaking in private is a nightmare, people in general are a nightmare. Everything at school tends to scare the shit out of me. Sometimes, I get so nervous that I start tearing up. It happens almost every time a teacher talks to me, which they seem to really like doing. I’m a “model student” or some shit. Sometimes, I’ll get really nervous for no reason and find a little corner for myself to just tremble. I also get really jumpy and scared with hot flashes and an accelerated heart rate, which I’ve been told was a panic attack, but I don’t know. I find myself thinking about how terrible I am and how much I’ve done wrong, too. 

I actually started writing this post because my accidentally slammed the trash can closed because I was angry, and then my mom yelled at me. Just before that, she belittled me for flinching whenever she turns to me or raises her voice. I physically jumped and ran all the way to my room where I had a tiny meltdown. 

It might just be the fact that I’ve been so stressed. I know it’s not very much compared to so many others, but varsity and club swimming, my grades, dumb school drama, my family, and my expectations have really been putting a toll on me. I really wasn’t getting so much sleep because of all my homework I had to do once I get home from swimming. 

I used to be in a program for gifted children (I’ve gotten in touch with them, and it seems that we’re all angry gays), so my parents have the bar set up really fucking high. I used to strive to be absolutely perfect because that’s pretty much how I’ve been, but I can’t find any purpose in doing anything ever. I’m starting to despise school and teachers and my family who all expect so much. When my mom saw that I scored in the top 2% one year on a test after consistently being in the top 1%, she told me that she was disappointed.

 ‘Cause of that, just seeing a grade less than an A- crushes me. I know I sound like a whiny and privileged bitch, but I don’t know how people take it. The entirety of my *school career* or whatever, my grades were super high because I spent so much time working on stuff. So far, I’ve earned two 4.0’s in middle school. That’d feel pretty good if I actually was happy. I’m probably way too dependent on praise, but I just want my parents to sincerely tell me that they’re proud of me and my efforts. 

My parents, especially my mom, expect a lot from me, and they’re old-fashioned and traditional. I don’t really like her much at all whatsoever, but I’d like to think that I still love her. We get into what she calls arguments a lot. She really isn’t the brightest of the bunch, but she acts like she’s omnipotent. She can never be wrong, and I can’t argue at all because that’s absolutely disrespectful. We were in a Chipotle after a swim meet where I did well and my little sister was more sub-par. My mom was berating her and yelling at her because she was too nervous to order. I knew the feeling that my sister had, so I told to my mom to not be so harsh. She asked me if she had ever been wrong before, and I jokingly responded by saying, “Yeah, on last weeks homework.” That was a pretty big mistake. She straight up disowned me for ten minutes in a chipotle. What the fuck, woman?

Okay, back to mental health. I feel shitty about everything, I feel terrified of everything, and I feel angry at everything. I don’t think anything’s really interfered with my life, but it doesn’t feel good. I haven’t ever tried actually hurting myself, but I do scratch at my arms a lot when I’m nervous, and I usually wouldn’t really mind if a car hit me. 

I think this is a pretty okay summary, and thanks for reading it. I know this is a pretty long post, but I’d really appreciate a response or two from anybody. Just writing about this alone has made me feel a little better.",03Jun2020,2

This is just quick rant because I am stressed AF.

In an ordinary working day social interactions is something I conciously have to try my hardest. It doesn't come easy and sometimes it's tiring but its doable. After a breakdown in my teens/20s it's something I had to actively learn how to do.

But everything moving over to virtual environments has got me struggling again. It's so hard to read tone. One previously perfectly nice and reasonable team member has decided that whenever I have an idea and let people know that I'm going to do the work for it that she's going to do it at the same time then she gets uptight that I'm doing the work I said I was going to do. It's not in itself a huge deal but its bizarre enough that and I've no idea how to deal with it. The not being able to figure out how to address things and struggles to communicate is making me feel super powerless and rattling some negative thought processes. Some folk are kicking off to get their contributions picked when theres a few ideas on the table and I'm left not knowing how to even share my work because I'm paranoid about upsetting people.

I'm barely holding it together through the isolation. I know I'll be OK and the anxiety and constant crying will go away once I don't have to sit with my own thoughts all day. But the longer this goes on the more awkward it will be working with some of my colleagues.",03Jun2020,1

272,"Hey all. Ever since I was 10 years old I have been extremely aware of my own mortality. 

At age 10, I had my first panic attack. It always happened during math class for some reason. It was a feeling of dread and inevitable doom so devastating that it made me stand up out of my seat and almost throw up. I backed into things trying to escape my inescapable thoughts while the class stared. Then it ended after many dreadful seconds. After that, I had one almost every single day for a year. 

Back then, I brought upon my own panic attacks. I would get too deep into my thoughts and end up in this zone where I truly comprehend the pointlessness of everything. The mortality of me and the only person I ever loved, my mom. I would fall into a zone where I realize she could die that day, I could die that day, I could burn in hell for all eternity for not believing in God, and the actual infinite size of eternity and more. I would call this zone ""wave of realization"" when trying to explain what I was going through. No one understood. I started having them at home too. Minimum 2 panic attacks a day. 

I remember telling my sister that I wished I could sleep forever to stop this. I didn't realize that at age  10, I wanted to kill myself to stop the hell I was suffering all alone. I used to wish I was a dog so I couldn't comprehend not existing. I still do. 

Then it stopped. I had more control. I still had them, but very very rarely and only if I thought myself into one. I avoided those thoughts. It worked for years. 

But it's back now. 

I am 17, almost 18. It's much more complicated now. Now, I have come to even worse conclusions. 

*This life is the only experience that I will ever have for all eternity.* One day this will end and then it's nothing and I will never exist or have a consciousness again. That fucking terrifies me. Others take comfort in it. They say, ""Imagine what it was like before you were born."" That doesn't help. That makes it worse. Imagining an eternal state of nonexistence is what gives me the panic attacks in the first place. This is truly fucking it. 

Other thoughts that terrify me and get me in that ""zone"" where I know a panic attack is imminent is trying to comprehend the universe and how it was made, what came before it, how even IS everything existing, and what eternity is.

I don't believe in any God, haven't since I was a child, but honestly I wish I did so it would be easier to deal with death. No wonder humans made up all these gods. Genuinely believing there's another absolutely amazing eternal life with loved ones after you die must make the process a whole lot fucking easier. I wish I had that. I wish I had that so so bad dude. 

I wish I could force myself to truly believe, but that will never happen. I can't even imagine the hell I am going to go through as I near older age and the day I die gets closer, and even worse what I'll go through in my final moments where I am aware I'm dying. I hope someone drugs me the fuck up to the point where I can't know. 

I hope that when I do die, it is swift and immediate and I have no idea it's coming. Hit by a car, gun, explosion, in my sleep, anything that takes me out before I can even comprehend what's happening. That seems to be the only way. Note, *I am NOT suicidal and I DO NOT want to die.* I am simply saying I don't care when or how it happens as long as it happens so fucking fast that I won't have to suffer my own thoughts. 

It is so pointless typing this out, because I know nothing can fix this. That's what scares me so much. There's literally NOTHING anyone can do. It's going to happen no matter what. 

Can anyone else relate to this? I know I can't do anything to prevent the inevitable, but fuck, any ways to make it easier? I used to be terrified of an eternity in hell, but it seems I'm already there.",03Jun2020,1
273,"Hello! I am a 22 year old (F) from Saudi Arabia and now I moved to the UK for university. I have always had a love-hate (more of a hate) relationship with food all my life. I am thinking it stems from the trauma I've been through in the past as a child when I went to a school back in Saudi where my teacher probably had issues. She would check every child's lunch box..if a child did not finish his/her food, she would beat them with a stick and give them a big bowl of raw veggies and would not let them go home till they finished it, which is what happened to me pretty much for 3-4 years (pre-school and elementary school up to grade 3) when I attended that school, other kids strangely had no issues with eating food in front of her..while I would tend to take food out of my lunch box and hide all of it inside my bag. 

She would have this stick which she would use to beat me up with every time she found food in my bag. I told my mom to give me only 1 chicken nugget so I wouldn't have a problem eating it/hiding it when I wouldn't feel like eating it while she was around. My parents knew what she did to me and she still did not stop until I finally moved out of the damn school. 

Anyway, now I have a really unhealthy relationship with food. I am very underweight (39.5 kg, 5'3). I want to gain weight so bad but I cannot even finish my food on the plate, I always get full very quickly. I cannot eat in public/in front of people because it triggers my anxiety. I don't think I have issues with my body image (like i'm not trying to lose weight, in fact, i'm trying to gain it and the fact that it's kind of impossible for me to do that makes me hate my body). I don't know what's wrong with me :( it makes me feel so embarrassed and alone.",03Jun2020,1

I think people that say you just need to pull yourself out of it, it gets better, etc etc are just people who are too selfish to let you go.",03Jun2020,1
