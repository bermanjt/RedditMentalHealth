0,"TLDR; What kind of medical professional do I speak with first about stress induced issues both mental and physical. 

The last couple months I've been having a building stress/anxiety brought on by work and life. It is something I have not dealt with before \[31 M\], at least not to a point it started to physically affect me. It has gotten to the point I've had to call out from work a few times just because it felt overwhelming to even go in; and has been causing some issues like migraines, sleep issues, back pain, etc.

I spoke with my work and will be doing a 2 week personal leave that starts beginning of Jan. I also will have medical insurance for the first time in a while and need to find a new primary care physician for the first time in years. I am unsure though if I should speak to a regular doctor about this, or find a psychiatrist/psychologist first. 

Not sure if this is the right place to ask but figured it was as good a place to start.",30Dec2020,1
1,"I've been with a guy for 1 year and 2 months now (basically moved in with him at the beginning of quarantine back in march and we're living together in a rented flat rn), and I'm not in love with him. I've known this for ages now but things were fine until recently since we've been arguing more and it's becoming clearer that fundamentally, we're not ""meant to be together"" (I don't believe in love but I'm talking literally, there's something intellectually or emotionally missing that just means it can't be fixed with communication or whatnot.)

Thing is, for the past year, especially with the whole quarantine-as-an-excuse-to-be-isolated thing going on, he's been the main reason I've been more or less ok as someone who's been struggling with mental illness for the past few years; he's a very carefree, kind, patient and generally happy person, and has meant I've had to force myself to make food, and be at least *a bit* active most days, and not completely derail and spiral down in a self-destructive phase. 

But it means every day is basically me forcing myself to do things to be as ok as possible in the eyes of people who worry and care about me, and I don't want to live my life like that, and I'm at a breaking point where I need things to happen to feel alive, which I realize is probably an extremely toxic mentality to have. I feel like the being ""not as bad as I could be"" makes me convince myself too frequently that I don't need help, or that I'm not really unwell etc, and therefore keeps me in a constant state where I feel like I'll never completely recover.

So I don't know what to do. Is it a good idea to leave him despite knowing he's the only reason my urge to be as self-destructive as possible has not been acted on, mostly? Or should I suck it in at least until I'm a bit better mentally (which could be years down the line)? 

Also I know I'm incredibly selfish in all of this, but it's not an AITA, I'm just genuinely unsure of what is or isn't a bad idea.",30Dec2020,1
2,"People always asking me why I hate the Christmas period so much, and amongst loads of other things, I tried to kill my self on December 30th 2017. And I can’t help but wonder what life would be like if I never even attempted it. Or if I had successfully done it. 
Ever since that day my life has been going down hill dramatically and honestly I don’t even know what to do anymore. I have been on and off medication, on and off self harming, the last two years I lost my jobs in November, my mum almost died and almost 2 years later is still recovering, I have endless back and joint problems sometimes to the point where I can’t walk without an aid, no friends or family to support me, I’ve been really struggling with my gender and sexuality, I don’t know what I want to do career wise, I struggle with self esteem and confidence and body dysmorphia, I feel so ugly and stupid all the time and I just really hate who I am. 

I don’t really know what the point of me writing this up is, I guess I just need a place to vent, so my thoughts aren’t only stuck in my head. And just as I was getting settled with my therapist she upped and left for a new job, then covid happened. Also some nice words from some nice strangers wouldn’t hurt",30Dec2020,1
3,"Today I asked my dad for about the 100th time if I could see my best friend in person. He replied by telling me that I could, but only outside. Unfortunately, that isn’t really possible in our area right now because for the foreseeable future, the temperature will be bellow 0. 

I understand my dad not wanting me to see people because of the pandemic, but I feel like it’s reasonable to have one person that I’m allowed to see. On top of this, my best friend is also taking COVID really seriously and isn’t allowed to see anyone other than me (because no one is taking it seriously in our area). I had been hopeful that today’s attempt would go better because numbers have been down significantly in our area. Obviously this didn’t work out so well. When I asked my dad when I could see people in person again he said “in a month or two”. This is the same thing he’s told me since October.

I thought that maybe when high risk people started getting vaccinated he would let me see people, but it’s becoming increasingly clear that he won’t feel comfortable with me seeing people until he is vaccinated (which likely won’t be until spring because he is under 50 and nonessential). Both my best friend and I are really bad at virtual communication, and struggling mentally because we don’t have any face to face interaction. 

I just don’t know how to explain to my parents that the pandemic is important to me, but so is my mental health.",30Dec2020,1
4,"Hello everyone, this is my first post here so none of you will know me, despite that, though, I really need some advice right now.

I feel like there's something incredibly wrong with me, but I can't pinpoint it specifically, and I think that's making everything more difficult to put up with.

I feel like my entire personality is inconsistent, now what I mean by that is: often I act in completely different ways to how I act some other times, hell, even those other times aren't common, and they don't even work as a base for my personality since there's like, 5 or so other ways I act and probably more that I haven't even noticed yet. It's at the point now where I no longer know how to properly identify myself, like I'm entirely unnacquainted from myself.

To follow up on this, I also tend to feel incredibly detached from reality, with emotions either not registering or showing up for seemingly no reason and my life as a whole feeling like it's fake, or like it's not how it's supposed to be, like it's bugged or something like that and I've been given the incorrect one, sometimes it even feels like I'm just observing some kind of weird experiment.

I feel like I'm supposed to be a different person entirely, and that somehow I've been placed in some weird experimental model that hasn't been properly calibrated so it ends up as a mess of random shit that doesn't make any sense in conjunction with the millions of other components that have just been jammed in with no thought as to what that'd end up doing. It's like I was birthed into the wrong body, with the wrong personality, with the wrong upbringing, with the wrong childhood and with the wrong adolescence.

What's even worse is that I don't have anyone to talk to, my mum (I'm 15 btw so still living with her) just wouldn't understand, my sister wouldn't care, my other family members live too far away for me to talk to them, not to mention that I'm not particularly close with any of them, and to top it all off, I have no friends, at all, and even if I did then I probably wouldn't be close enough to them to talk about this kind of thing. I was thinking of seeing a therapist, but as I mentioned before, I seriously doubt mum would be understanding enough to get me visiting one.

I don't know if this post is too vague to help me out or not, hell I don't even know if it makes any sense to begin with, but I needed to put my thoughts down somewhere. Hopefully something comes from this, I don't know if anything will, but I can always hope.",30Dec2020,1
5,"I turned 22 around a week ago and had a full on breakdown because I feel old, sort of like my life has been wasted away?

7,"I [13F] have always had trouble staying in place or focusing on certain things. During elementary , I would almost never listen to what the teachers say and would fiddle with my pencils and erasers; the only reason I was able to get through the classes was because Id manage to focus when we did exercises.
This is something I always brushed off as me just being an energetic kid, until now.

For context , 2 years ago my mom took me to a therapist because I kept pestering her to. The therapist said I was very likely a precautious child , considering that my maturity was ( at that time) that of a late teenager (she said I behaved and talked like a normal 15-16 would) , my mom told her that I learned to talk perfect arabian (my first language) before even being 8 months old (my aunts also agree with that , adding that I spoke in an accent that nobody in my family had) and that I should take a test to be sure if I was one (which Im saving up to take as it costs 230 euros and Id feel guilty making my parents pay for it). This is important so that , if my mental age and physical age are proportional, you can help me by taking both the perspective of a 13 year old and a 15+ year old.


Since the beginning of 2020 , my short attention span and fidgetty-ness got exacerbated to the point where I would barely be able to concentrate when taking my online classes , would constantly get distracted by something else and would have some of my fingers start twitching if I forced myself to stay still too long. It also affects my sleep , if I try to stay still I start feeling extremely uncomfortable and have to move a bit either by changing my position stretching or even constantly wiggling.


This may not be relevant, but I also started feeling extremely paranoid during the end of the previous school year , something that has significantly increased this school year after we moved. Im terrified of going outside because Im very scared of being kidnapped or  harrased/assaulted , Im especially scared of men to the point where if I see one while the road is relatively empty Ill start walking as fast as I can to get to a more crowded area , pull out my phone and compose my mom's number  so I can click call if somethinf happens.
Im so scared that I carry scissors in my coat's pocket ocasionally.
This irrational fear also seeps into my dreams , I repeatedly have nightmares where some awful things like murder , kidnapping or assault either happen to me or Im the one inflicting it onto other people with always wakes me up terribly disturbed and nauseous.

My question is if this can be blamed on hormones or the fact that my brain is still developping, because I talked to my mom about this today and she said she would schedule a session with a therapist as soon as she can ( where we live the pandemic's really diminished) but I dont want her to spend her money on something that isnt set in stone yet ; I wanna be sure that this is 100% something I should talk to a professional about before she pays for it. 

Feel free to ask any questions ! Ill answer as much as I can!",30Dec2020,1
8,"How many of us are currently stuck inside the darkness? I’m sure we’ve all been inside of it once this year. 

Let me tell you, it’s a horrible feeling. Some don’t ever recover from this, they will take it day-by-day, *hoping* that they make it to bed in the night. Some of us are tired, deflated, unmotivated and simply lost. We can’t seem to find the joy in anything, we stumble across the easiest of tasks, we have zero confidence and our relationships with family and friends is deteriorating. 

We never asked for this. For some, it happened natural, for others, it was building up inside of them due to past experiences, failures, losses, mistakes and regrets. But, we didn’t ask to live everyday looking over our shoulder, living in fear, anxious for the next move and crumbling in fear. We don’t want this. *I* don’t want this. 

But, as I’ve always said, this isn’t your final chapter. This is just the first one. It’s only going to get better from this moment onwards. Living in a dark place is dangerous, it’s scary and you don’t know what could happen. Any day, you expect something bad to happen, it may be physically, it may be mentally, but you’re always on the look out, anxious. In the end, everything will clear up. You haven’t experienced your best day ever, yet. It’s going to come, you just have to hang in there. Hard work always, *ALWAYS* pays off. As you’re currently healing, do something for others, help out at a volunteering shelter, helping the elderly, donate to a charity, anything! From my experience, helping others in need, for the people who are desperately in need of help and support, makes you feel better within yourself. You’ll find that light that’s been lost inside of you for so long. Do you know that smile? The one you’ve been focusing yourself to show to others this year? Well, it will come back, this time, it’ll be naturally. It’s not as if *you have to* smile*, but more as *you want to* smile. Your smile has been away for a long time, it’s been replaced by tears. It’s about time we get that smile back, yes? 

In life, no matter who you are, you have to go through the darkness to get to the light. The darkness does not destroy the light, it defines it. It’s the *fear* of the dark that costs our joy and happiness into the shadows. When we are walking about on a fine Summer’s day, we see a black figure walking next to us... it’s our shadow. Even in the sunniest and brightest of days, you’ll still see your dark side. But, for many people, they’ve realised this and carried on with their life. Instead of stopping in their tracks and going home, they’ve made that figure it’s friend and because of that, it follows he/she everywhere they go. It’s all about the mentality. If you think negatively, it will take over your life. 

You’re a star, and every star are born in the dark and all the darkness dies in the light. 

Be that light.",30Dec2020,1
9,"Since this autumn I have not been working because of burn out related symptoms. However, I really liked my work and the work load wasn’t that high. Therefore, I think that my symptoms (exhausted, no concentration, insomnia etc) are not necessarily caused by my work. To be honest, I think that I couldn’t handle my personal stress anymore (due to a toxic/abusive relationship). As a result, I was overthinking everything and not able to work effectively anymore. Resulting in stress at work and, thus, the so-called burnout. Could it be that I do not have a burnout, but a stress/trauma disorder instead? 

I just would like to learn about your thoughts or experiences with this. In a month I will start therapy and discuss this.",30Dec2020,1

I have been with my girlfriend for just over a year now and we continue to be going strong and well, which I am very grateful for. 

However, she is a sufferer of anxiety, anxiety attacks and panic attacks so through the course of our relationship, I have tried to help her as much as I can, during her “episodes” (unsure of the correct time, my apologies ) and then discussing it with her and researching it independently.  

I just wish to better understand both the condition and ways to aid anyone suffering from it so I can better support her and ease her burden. And this brung me here...

If anyone would be so kind to share advice, tips or information about anxiety as a whole or anything I mentioned, it would be so gratefully appreciated and would help me so much.

13,I'm in an intensive therapy program for people with personality disorders and I'm making really good progress. But my individual therapist and I do not click. I've told him several times but he brushes me off and since I don't get to choose my individual in the program and I have to have an individual to be in the program I don't have a choice. I try my best to work with him even though I don't feel comfortable with him and I don't feel like I'm making any progress with him. Today though it went much further. He wouldn't let me not discuss our dysfunctional relationship after I mentioned that I still didn't think we were a good fit. We spent the whole session on it even though I had other important stuff I really wanted to talk about. He got belligerent and unprofessional in my opinion and I've been in therapy for 20 years and worked as an aba therapist. He said that if I couldn't have a good relationship with him it was a problem with how I interact with people and that I'd get used to him eventual and ended by implying that I'm just a patient and don't know what I'm talking about. It was extremely triggering because I've experienced medical abuse in the past as well as being told by sexual abusers that I'm just crazy and it's all my fault.

I was thinking of asking stuff like how to talk to my parents about this (or anyone for that matter), get help etc. and maybe even vent a little bit.

The only things I'm afraid of is thar she'll tell other people (although I don't think this'll be that much of a problem since her friends seem to have similar problems) and that she'll judge me for this (like why I would of asked HER help etc.).

20,"I am extremely delusional and I am getting cabin fever. I stay in my house all day and barely leave the house because I have an abnormal fear/phobia of women. I know that might sound like a pussy thing to say but this phobia is serious and causes panic attacks because I am so insecure because I fear as though women hate me and/or judge me the minute they see me because I am paranoid and overthink things. I get convinced that they are saying things about me or know things about my life and who I am because I get weird psychotic delusions and think I can hear them saying my name and insulting me which I know sounds psychotic now but in the moment in feels so real. I can't leave the house unless I have a friend with me so I can talk to them and look at them to black out these thoughts and I put myself down, thinking that if I am in the same room as a group of girls that I am automatically committing a crime and bothering them and want to run away and cry because of how nervous and scared I get around them. My cabin fever from not going out much is causing me to hallucinate and have really intense nightmares about random things like digging graves up. And making deals with the devil. I hallucinate and see things in my room like bloody hand prints on the walls. And I don't want to take any more meds because they don't take away my phobia and they have nasty withdrawal symptoms whenever I get off them which caused a few failed attempts. And always stop working after a while and always make me worse off than before when I get off them. I've had this phobia for a long time but no one took it seriously they only took my psychosis seriously and put me on antipsychotics even though I only had mild psychosis at first but my antipsychotics and antidepressants have actually caused symptoms of more mental health problems like symptoms of schizophrenia, imposter syndrome and manic episodes whenever my meds are changed, upped or reduced. My antipsychotics are actually the cause of my depression which made me need antidepressants. I know this because I got symptoms of severe depression shortly after I started taking antipsychotics. And then my antidepressants made me have extreme psychotic episodes which where never this bad before. I've also had slight sadism but was never an issue at first because I was never a violent person in general but when I mixed weed with sertraline it made me very hostile. Like 1 time after smoking some weed on sertraline. I found a key to guy's room that I lived, with, put a knife up to his throat in his sleep because I was so sick of him bullying me and terrorising the shit out of me and always stealing my possessions! And I was going to kill him but then decided not to because I feared the consequences of prison. Like this is fucked up and out of order what these meds have done to me, I had mild psychosis, very mild autism, slight sadism which I was told wasn't an issue. But this fear of women which makes me feel pathetic and worthless. Now I have a fuck ton of issues. And now I am infuriated because I now hear whispers pretty much every night when I'm alone in my own house. I've never hallucinated like this before nor was I this delusional to the point where I'm so susceptible to everything on the internet. It's been 6 years on meds and all's it's done they done is cause more problems. All this time I've been on these fucking meds and I've been on meds causing me more. They've made my weight go up and down from obese to anorexic even though my appetite is through the roof all the time. Whenever my meds have changed in way my testosterone has fucked up and gone from dangerously high to dangerously to dangerously low and then back to high to and back low again. And never a healthy level. I have stretch marks all over my body from how quickly I have gained and lost weight. When I was younger I went to the gym a lot. When my antipsychotics were reduced and I gained a shit ton of muscle very quickly and people thought I was on steroids when I wasn't and I didn't no why that happened but I got stretch marks on my biceps and chest because my T levels were dangerously high and then my meds got increased and my T levels went too low again and I lost it all. I also got gynocomastia within the first few weeks of taking my first antipsychotic and I didn't even know what gynocomastia was I just thought it was thought chest fat unless I lost weight and it was still there. When I first started taking sertraline which was my first antidepressant I became impotent and I didn't know why. I thought my friend had spiked my drink with chemical castration because I was so psychotic from mixing it with weed so I beat the shit out of him and practicaly scalped him by ripping all his hair out of his head in a in blind age while screaming at the top of my lungs ""you ruined my fucking life"" with no explanation. He had no idea no idea why I did. But then the next day one of his friends beat the shit out of me and knocked me out. I got off the sertraline. Because I was constantly throwing up when I was on it but then ""coincidentally"" my dick started working again when I got off the sertraline but I had still erectile disfunction. 6 years I've been on these fucking meds with disgusting vile side effects and didn't even know my meds were causing them and whenever I asked to get off them. They would say you have stop to them slowly and gradually but whenever I tried that, if I got a bit sad or cried because of my phobia of women which I was I too embarrassed talk about with god knows how many psychologists, psychiatrists, doctors, nurses etc. They would up my meds even when I told them straight IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MY MEDS BEING REDUCED they would just say but upping from will make you better again. But it wouldn't because no medication can magicly take away a phobia. So I had no choice but to stop cold turkey and go through a like a month of nasty ass withdrawal symptoms such as headaches, dizzines, light headedness, stomach pains, chest pains, diarrhea, throwing up, shakes, tremors, unable to talk properly. But then again ""coincidentally"" I was finally able to get it up properly but... I couldn't get it down or keep it down. I had to wank constantly because my libido was through the fucking roof. And when the withdrawal symptoms stopped I got erectile disfunction again. This is disgusting what the meds have done to me. They have destroyed my mental health, destroyed my brain and fucked up my hormones for life. I am more psychotic than ever, more depressed than ever, more anxious than ever to the point where my psychotic paranoia is mixing with my phobia and I am so susceptible to the internet that I literally believed that it was acceptable to be misogynistic and the right thing to do because I believed people on the internet like incels and MGTOW out of delusional thinking and I think there might be an embarrassing video of me on the internet that the police recorded after I broke into my neighbor's flat who has worse autism than me and demanded that he gives me one of the knives out of his kitchen so I can self harm with it and scared him to the point where he was crying in fear of me and he had to grab me a physically remove me from his flat and call the police. And I actually told the police to post the video. Even after they said about not wanting to post my private stuff that I told them online because I was in so much of a fucked up state mentally that I forgot about the racist shit I said about Christians and the homophobic shit I said and the sexist, shit and didn't even know it was sexist and the stuff I told them. I was only beeing sexist because I was in a so much of a fucked up state and I 100% believed it was not sexist and it was true because I was a in a fucked up state and I was believing my phobia was real and women were really evil and saying this fucked up shit. And calling my whole generation out for being sex depraved and slutty for having different morals about sex than me and for letting the music and the media get to their head and manipulate them into getting sluttier when I'm here allowing incels and MGTOW to fucking manipulate me. I'm not using it as an excuse, I am just explaining myself in a truthful honest manner which is what my r/guilt post was about. And I also then for some fucking reason and another fucking delusion think I have the fucking audacity to be going on r/sexism and talking about stuff I quite clearly know fuck all about in this state. I may have been in a bad mental state but that doesn't mean I shouldn't feel bad for what I did and said. That is why I posted the shit on the r/guilt subreddit. And I wouldn't be surprised if I'm already on the fucking r/quityourbullshit call out subreddit or r/inceltears already because of how fucked up the shit I was saying was. I even dmed a random fucking Redditor and told them about my suicide plan which didn't go according to plan. My life is ruined THANKS A FUCKING LOT MENTAL HEALTH!! And as I said I do not hate women in any way shape or form. I have a phobia of them that turned into something fucked up because I looked too deep into MGTOW red-pill to try to put myself off women to try to learn how to cope with being forever alone and it made my situation worse and it fucking failed miserably and then for some fucking stupid reason I decided to snoop around r/incelswithouthate to fucking black-pill myself for some fucking stupid reason. And on top of all that I bullied a pedophile who was suicidal on r/guilt to make myself feel better for basically going from a dignified virgin to a fucking incel. And justifying it by saying ""well at least I'm not a sex offender like this nonce"" that is fucked up with mental issues or not that is fucked up. I'm fucked up and twisted in the head. I even called my own mother and told her that I wished she aborted me. My head maybe fucked but I'm evil, I'm literally evil and I am the sick one and I am the depraved one. I am a nasty peace of shit violent individual who is the lowest of the low. Maybe I should kill myself. What do you guys think?",30Dec2020,1

I miss kissing my partner and feeling her warm lips on mine or having her whisper into my ear and feeling a slight tingling sensation in my ear lobe as she pulls away . Or the way we would hold each other’s hands until they got sweaty , only letting go to get a tighter grip . 

I miss seeing peoples smiles and feeling the emotions fill up your heart . Or being blown a kiss that you catch and put in your pocket . I miss just popping into your grandparents house because you where just passing , then spending hours drinking tea and talking about old times . I miss the way my partner would nestle her head in between my neck and shoulder when we would hug . Or just calling a friend for a spontaneous cup of coffee 

I totally understand why staying inside is relevant. We have lost so many innocent souls , god bless them and thank god for all the medical staff and Thank you for your work. I just thought some people may be able to relate to the emotional and physical deprivation the pandemic has brought. I fully understand there are bigger issues at hand , but I just wanted the Lonely people to know that I see you . Take care my Reddit family ❤️",30Dec2020,1
23,"I really don't know. After things got really bad last time I went to therapy, but literally she just asked how I was doing I'd say okay then leave. It was pointless so I quit going. I still don't have ways to cope. 

I used to cut, but I'm trying not to do that. I'm not really depressed.. idk what's wrong with me. I have a million things going on and now I'm being sued for something that's not my fault and I'm paralyzed. I mean paralyzed. I can't bring myself to clean, I can't even get up the nerve to take a shower. I take care of my son and that's it. I want to clean and bathe, and I want to get shit done, but I can't. I feel paralyzed. And that makes me feel like a failure and that's where I'm leading into depression.. but I don't feel bad because of depression, depression is a result of what's going on and idk what it is I'm just broke. 

I'm sure this is in my head but I feel like my husband is mad at me, in the past he's said that anytime something needs to be done I just shut down and say I can't and to him it seems like I'm being lazy while he works all day. The thing is it's true I am shutting down and I can't stop it and I don't want to be lazy I want to get everything done but everything is screaming at me at once and I can't even start I'm paralyzed. 

I can't go to the doctor either because the people who are suing me is the local hospital because the messed up filing insurance 3 years ago and I refused to pay for their mistake. I can't go to another hospital in another county till I get accepted to Medicaid and I've applied 3 times now. The last 2 times they said they never received an application (this has been since covid started and the first time I messed up the application).

24,"Ask I've learned this year I'm horribly about being emotionally honest like really really bad to the point where I will hurt myself emotionally trying to give other people what they want without realizing it and look back to realize I hurt myself and the other person because I dont know how to really say what I feel sometimes.

Does anyone have any advice on this? I see a therapist and its helped alot but I still wanna ask

To give a more concrete example a few months ago I got into a gaming group that involved and ex and I started to fall for her again and then started avoiding her really hard because she got a boyfriend and it was fucking me up. Eventually she confronted me about me avoiding her asking me when clearly very hurt, and my response was to lie and say it was just bad timing and what not because in my head it was better because she is better off in the happy relationship she is in without me involved and looking back on it I wish I would have just said the truth but at the time it's like I go into an autopilot threat management mode and I believe whatever I say even though in hindsight I was lying.

If anyone has words of wisdom I'd really appreciate it",30Dec2020,1
25,"So, I'd like to start by saying that no matter what, I've kept this attitude that no matter the hardships I go through, in the end I'll be feeling better, and I can attest to that helping me with things. I know I'll get to meet my personal goals and work on projects that I'll be interested in after I put in the effort, I know that, realistically, I'll be living fine, but it's just that sometimes I really just don't have anyone to talk to, so I'm a lot in my own head. This, alongside not really finding anyone to feel too safe talking to kinda resonates my own belief that I can't imagine myself spending time with anyone else right now, and it's making me feel lonely. Of course, I've gotten to spend time with people who are fun to be with or can help me (i.e. school therapist), and I do get to talk with them, but I seem to lose hope pretty quickly after our interactions most of the time.  


It's gotten better, since before all hope would drain away from me the instant we parted ways, well now it stays with me for longer periods of time. But what I've noticed is that when I lost motivation now I got completely lost; I've went lower than my lowest low in that regard, and it is the level at which I have been for the past month. It's **not** in studies (well, not the main part) -- feels like I'm always talking about them since I don't find much fun with what I'm seemingly capable of doing now. I want to be able to find experiments I can do, understand new things and make new projects, but at the same time I'm unsure about spending money on what could possibly be just a fleeting interest, though I feel very certain that it is that I want to be focusing on and it'd only be a few hundred dollars to spend on it, but also it's a lot more other things I'm interested in and it just goes on and on, not sure how much money I can put in anything until I could myself make money and just so many questions to deal with, -- it's more in self-care.   


I seem to treat myself badly and I'm very lazy, no motivation to be doing a lot of things, but not exercising or stretching makes me just feel worse - I don't want this. I just don't really like the conditions I'm living in, yet money is seemingly an issue for my parents, so I've always felt awkward asking for money on anything, something which you can see with my hobbies, since I strive to keep the money cost put into them at a clean flat $0. I always look for free alternatives: free courses, free online textbooks, online simulations over real-life physical practice, often helpful tools I go without, basically taking the hard route in studies, which has made me more able in finding free resources, I'll give it that. But there it is again, talking too much about studies. I tend to do that and ignore other aspects of my life, simply because it makes me feel productive, or that it is a worthy sacrifice. I've been told in the past that it is the only responsibility I have since I really didn't have to do any work with stuff around the house or anything, so I had to develop the need to take care of cleanliness myself, while studies I wasn't really interested in were forced on me. Now I found interest in cooking, in keeping things clean and found personal studies that I'm more interested in, but I still haven't found a burning motivation to exercise and workout, so I can't be feeling good enough to pursue my interests to make my environment a better place. This is seemingly the one thing I can't really find an answer to right now, so I just want advice from anyone who can help.  


From personal experience, I know how much better it feels like when I workout and keep myself active, and for what it's worth, I really enjoy it, but only if I'm already feeling good; if I'm already doing good, I don't find it too hard to do more. I know I can build myself up to that level, but the problem with why I haven't been able to is, I think, lack of stability and control in my schedule. It's a harmful constant loop of: messing up once and waking up late to school, now having an excuse for skipping class =&gt; finding more time to spend on personal studies but mostly ignoring school studies (because I want to learn it in more details, but school doesn't give me enough time to do that) =&gt; starting a workout routine at home that I want to follow because I understand it's something that will make me feel better and I just have the motivation to do so =&gt; get scared at the PE lesson when I have to perform with other people, mostly because I feel embarrassed =&gt; stop my workout routine, feel even more scared of school =&gt; have more of a reason to not want to go to school =&gt; accepting it entirely when I wake up late and just stay at home for the day =&gt; get lectured for not going to school =&gt; give yet another empty promise that I'll attend class =&gt; repeat. Just all of the motivation towards building myself up and working more towards self-improvement, all of it dies again and again and again as I go through this unending death-reborn cycle I have going with school. It has left me to this point, where I can't put in the motivation to start much physical activity, but I don't find it possible to avoid school either. And to think that in the absence of school I've been doing amazing last summer, I got myself to exercise substantially 53 out of the \~91 days of summer and I only felt a little bit bored. I was making progress on my own until the dread of a new school year started coming over me.  


There needs to be a compromise in all of this, that being of me putting in some effort into school as well, so that I can keep up and not feel shamed when I don't understand what's being talked about in history (since I skip those lessons) before I get to go on my own personal studies. It seems that I'm slowly reaching that kind of equilibrium, so I'm hopeful, but I also don't have any good proof that I won't just fall again down this spiral after not being able to juggle all these things together. It really doesn't help that the one advice I've gotten, and realistically the only path I've been told I can go on is to endure the mundane classes where nothing is explained in enough detail that I want to, especially when my class isn't even learning the stuff I wanted to in the first place (we had a vote between becoming a class focusing more on humanitarian courses or science courses, we chose humanitarian), so there's another puzzle piece to figure out how to deal with. And even then, I'm not entirely against it, but I would just prefer the latter.  


My entire mind is just all over the place all over the time, these few paragraphs are a lot but still not even all of what I have, with so many ideas to think about I can't find concrete answers to anything and I'm feeling stuck in place, but I'm slowly figuring things out. I think I want to change my class, but that would involve going to a different school entirely and then I'd need to move by public transport (which barely comes around here) to a school in the city, only then to potentially have bad teachers according to my own teachers (which could have bias or just not be accurate since their children are only really with the middle school teachers), but also the best option I have according to my sisters (which I tried to verify but I couldn't find any information after an hour of searching), but then I could just stay here since the only requirement for getting into university and doing the studies that I want is passing some tests (which I can study for myself, and I already am capable of doing 2/4 of them), but that would involve me needing to study lots of literature and history which I'm not totally against but then again I don't really want to?? But then I just really don't know, it's just a lot, but it's like I've been given months to think about and I only have confused myself more in the opinions of others. I want a place where I can find some help, this place is the best place I could find, hopefully I'll find a way out, I know I will eventually get better.

26,"emotional breakdowns have become more of a habit than something i have to think about. it just happens, on the bus, in the middle of class, or while listening to a song. something random pops up and i start driving myself crazy. the past three days however, have been oddly happy. ive hung out with my friends more often, and talked a lot more. its not like ive suddenly gained motivation for everything, but ive lost a bit of the sadness and frustration that usually haunts me when im trying to focus. and this all feels... wrong. like something inside me wont let go of the negative feelings, even for a day. feeling happy also makes me feel guilty. and scared. out of control. 

im trying really hard to describe how i feel rn bc i dont feel comfortable opening up this much in real life, but if i had to visualize it, i see myself locked inside a huge mansion. sunlight is beaming through the glass windows but the rooms inside are dark and moldy. i lean against the glass and observe how beautiful the world looks, and think about how maybe i could step outside and enjoy the view for once. im standing before the heavy iron doors now, the keys in my hands, but i cant find the courage to open them. i end up staying inside for the rest of the day-- it feels safer in there.

This doesn’t always happen, but I assume this is always brewing in my subconscious. I trick myself into believing I did or said horrible things. I also always assume the worst is coming for me.

30,"So for a little background, I’m 19, male, and I possibly have ADHD. A lot of what I’ve read really resonates with me, as I struggle on the daily. 

Something that’s frustrating is that my parents are very hesitant about ANY medical finances. It was a hastle for me to go to a therapist already and extremely difficult to go to a doctor. They are pretty financially well off too, so I don’t get why they can’t help me. My dad can buy a Porsche yet he can’t buy dental insurance. Speaking of which I haven’t had dental work in 3 years. 

I was diagnosed with anxiety earlier this year and the anxiety meds unfortunately didn’t work well for me. I was very exhausted all the time and it caused me to be depressed. 

So now I’m at a point in life where I’m begging my parents to see a specialist of some sorts that can diagnose me. The last two college semesters were very difficult for me, and I still can’t decide what to do for my career after changing my major 7 times 🤦🏻‍♂️. I need accommodations so I can get through school, but I can’t until I get a diagnosis. 

I’m just wondering what I can do. How do I convince him to just let me go to the doctor, or how do I get help. He has this stigma/expectation that since I am 19 and young, that I am fully capable. He says that if I just discipline myself I can fix my issue. And that I am choosing to live this way. How do I handle this mentality? 

Why would I choose to suffer? If it was as simple as a decision, I would not be suffering and struggling to do simple things.

Meditation only helps a little bit, but probably only because I'm not too good at it yet. I actually find that the best fix is crying, but I'm not usually suffering enough to cry. It's more borderline, and the crying just emerges after a while, especially if I listen to sad music. 

While anxious I can feel the pressure that comes with the anxiety in my head and all over my body, and my blood pressure can shoot through the roof. I'm trying to learn some ways to immediately calm myself down without meds or supplements so I can relax and enjoy my life worry free. ",30Dec2020,1
33,"(M13) I have a somewhat abusive relationship with my family. I have also always struggled with mental health. Both parents are professional gaslighters.

I have expressed to them that I dislike touch. They try to combat me saying that with stuff like “you let me braid your hair” or “you like when I massage your back”. The thing is, I’m fine with, actually, I absolutely love (non-sexual) physical touch with a s/o. That’s my love language, and I’ve told them specifically that That’s only my love language with a s/o. Today, after going on some errands, my mom reached over while stopped at a train to touch my hair (I was sitting in the passenger seat) I have nice medium length hair (for a boy) but when she reached over I flinched and said “please don’t touch me” she the threw a play punch at my shoulder and I repeated myself and said I would hit back, in a serious tone. She told me a few minutes later that I hurt her feelings, and honestly I didn’t feel anything. I told her that she can ask my dad why I’m like that, and that stopped the conversation altogether.

And honestly, no, no not everybody is kinda a nobody.

And/or don't do like you yourself need to message them 2 days after your original message or else they wont respond.

If the answer is yes, yes you have friends who know you are there, appreciate you and so on, then you are not a nobody you are far from beeing a nobody.

And now I personally yes I say I am a nobody and this is not completley true since I am still in my teenage years and have a family who knows who I am but they also kinda hate me partially.

But yet, I feel like a complete nobody. Today I tried multiple times starting a conversation on a discord Server I am on and guess what everyone was able to start a conversation with others just I, just I was ignored and that was not only on one Server.

Then I wanted to vent to friends about it since that is my usual way of coping. Turns out I do not have anybody I can vent to, not in reallife nor on Discord.

Now you could say well don't you have friends in reallife?

Yes and no, so.. I am transgender and I do have ""friends"" in reallife but they don't know that I am transgender and also where I live the youth is rather unaccepting a fact why I won't  come out at this time and also why those 'Friends' are probably no real friends.

3. Immediately after Christmas begin your mental breakdown.
4. Don't eat for several days because you are too anxious/depressed to leave your room.
5. Profit

Right before Thanksgiving I was in the hospital with a kidney stone - if you’ve never had one know it is literally one of the most physically painful thing you can experience. I have a family history of kidney disease and it was scary because it may mean I’ll have bad luck with my kidneys in the future. I’m okay now and everything looks good but it’s been weighing heavily in my mind. Will I get sick? Am I sick? 

They also found a small mass in my liver that is most likely benign but I have to wait until January to get an MRI to be 100% certain.

I work as a teacher and I’m in graduate school so I spent my entire Thanksgiving break trying to get caught up on schoolwork that I had gotten behind on because of having the kidney stone for a full week. I felt like I was drowning and was never going to catch up. Report cards were due, parent conferences were right around the corner. Teaching in the current environment sucks and I feel like no one understands how hard it is. And finals week for grad school with papers and projects were all due at the same time as all of this.

Then my grandmother passed away and very soon after that my father breaks the news that he has cancer. And TODAY my mother (who is high risk) ended up in the hospital with COVID.

It’s all too much and I can’t handle it all alone. But I am alone. I live alone. And I come home many days truly exhausted and the worst part of all is that there is no one here to greet me. No one here to hold me and tell me things are going to get better. 

The anxiety and feeling overwhelmed are things I’m all too familiar with, things I have tools for. And I know I have to allow myself to feel sad about the grief I’m feeling but I’m so goddamn lonely. I feel so alone. There are no arms to greet me at the end of a shitty day/week/month and I’m so sick of being alone and I don’t know how to work through it or get over it.

49,"We had a child on December 4 and my wife has been steadily declining since then. She has barely slept and I noticed a change in her personality. She had a break down on Friday and has been at the hospital since then. She will not talk to me or her parents and she thinks we're all against her and trying to take the baby from her.

She is completely not herself and she just called me asking how baby is, I said he's doing well. I asked her how she is and she said ""I don't want to talk to you."" She sounded like a completely different person.

She has postpartum depression at the very least. They think she may have had a bad reaction to zoloft that she started a few days prior to the breakdown but she was definitely changing even before then. Her doctor said she may have bipolar also and at least high anxiety, which I sensed already because ever since I've known her she's had some break downs and mood swings but this is on a whole new level.

I've had to extend my time off of work, my parents might be coming from across the country to help me out. She is supposed to be transferred to a mental health care facility tomorrow but they are providing limited information because she doesn't want to talk to anyone.

My question is how does this usually play out for those who have experienced it? Is there hope? What can I do to help her if anything? Any advice is helpful.",30Dec2020,1
50,"Throwaway account. I (17F) have been with my boyfriend (18) for almost a year. He claims he is bipolar but isn’t properly diagnosed nor does he see a therapist because years back he “went through 6 or 7 therapists, took several different medications and nothing worked” so he refuses everything now. Pretty often in our relationship and for as long as I can remember, he will get super upset with me over really petty things, like I was active but didn’t answer him, or didn’t answer fast enough, or made a joke that he ended up taking offense to, etc. Then he’ll start thinking of other reasons to be mad at me like things i’ve done or said in the past in arguments or such, and gets increasingly angry at me. He’ll ignore me, or be really moody and snappy with me, and when i bring up his actions to him and how they’re upsetting me he says he doesn’t care and to deal with it or something along those lines. And it upsets me especially as someone who needs frequent attention and reassurance because of my own mental health issues and childhood trauma. After I’m finally brought to tears and begging him to just talk things through with me he’ll finally apologize and call himself a pos and tells me he hates that he gets so angry over little things but that he can’t help it. Then we pretend like nothing happened and I’m left feeling like fucking garbage but just happy that he didn’t break up with me. Is he even bipolar or just an asshole? How can I tell if it’s his mental health or if i’m in an emotionally abusive relationship?",30Dec2020,1

52,"I hope this is in the right subreddit. 

As the title suggests, I really need help figuring out how to overcome a low self-esteem that has been low for years. It sometimes gets better, momentarily, and then comes back down with a loud crash.

I have attempted to raise it, by myself and with the helping hand of my partner (especially recently). But the thing that interferes the process is the tendency to compare myself to everyone and everything. And even worse - right now the thing I'm constantly comparing myself to *is not real. It is erotic artwork that has been drawn to be perfect, obviously.* 

My partner likes this content. I do too - or at least used to. I can't anymore - whenever I see it (often), the comparing thoughts pop up and in the matter of seconds I can't feel good about myself, I can't think anything else, I get depressed and I lose the feeling to engage in sexual activities.  I start having thoughts such as ""hey, look at that *insert erotic artwork.* He likes it. You don't look/sound like that. Therefore he doesn't like you. Him? Getting pleasure from *insert erotic activity* with you? HAH! In your wildest dreams.""

He always tells me I'm amazing, perfect, and that he doesn't compare me to anything or anyone. Most of the time these words just go in from one ear and out of another because my brain automatically starts to push them out and doubt them. I try to push these doubts out but I can't, despite trusting my partner 101%. 

I want to enjoy this content with him instead of getting sad and hurt and hateful towards by just seeing it. I need to get my self-esteem up, somehow, but I'm lost. I've given it so much but the process is always lost. I even realize how stupid it is to compare myself to something that isn't even real, for God's sake, but *my brain can't stop doing it.*

53,"This past month has been a lot (as has this entire past year), and I've found myself wishing I could scream from some kind of mountain top so that the entire world can hear me: ""I AM DEPRESSED!"" 

I think it's like a cry for help, and in all honesty I wish I could just tell my friends this and have someone help me. Whenever I decide to open up and be vulnerable with them about how I feel, instead of responding to what I say they immediately ask ""have you talked to your therapist about this?"" The answer is always ""yes"", I talk to my therapist every week... but sometimes when a friend asks ""how are you doing?"" and I choose to answer honestly, the last thing I want to hear is ""have you talked to your therapist about this?"" because then I feel like my friend doesn't want to hear what I have to say. And all that teaches me is to not be authentic with them. In the past year, I've found myself being less and less genuine so that when someone asks how I'm doing I just answer ""fine"" or ""okay"" and quickly change the subject to ask questions about them and their life. 

I'm tired of this and I'm tired of hiding how I'm really doing. I am depressed. And I wished I was really comfortable enough with my friends to say this to them. So instead I'm saying it on the internet in my first ever reddit post because I really really wish someone could just HEAR me.

One of the things I am grateful for is being blessed with a creative mind and artistic talent,
but it makes the visuals in my brain so painful and vivid.

As I grow older I learn that things that have happened to me are not normal, like sexual abuse and living by myself at age 7.
8 year old me never knew that my Mother wanted to kill herself, or why Mom and Dad didn’t live together anymore.
She never knew why her uncle touched her the way he did, and ripped the innocence from her soul.

8 year old me never knew that her mother couldn’t afford a bed for her, and why that was the reason they had to sleep together.
Or why her clothes were never new, and always came from the second hand store. Mother couldn’t afford diapers for baby me, and had to make her own.
She never knew what kind of abuse her Dad inflicted on her Mom behind closed doors.

She never knew why her cousin came to visit, to try and touch her;
But it was only normal, right?

The little girl that was me ten years ago grew into a woman with problems she can’t even understand. I can’t help but cry whenever I see her in my mind, small, and confused.
It never ends either, with having to lock my doors because of my Stepfathers alcohol problems.

She has been going to a therapist since the start of this year was diagnosed with PTSD. She can barely keep a job for even 2 weeks. Every time there is someone at the job who makes her work hard. One time I told her to not overspend on booze, she flipped out at me.

A few weeks back, her boyfriend broke up with her and her condition has worsened ever since. Now this ex told one of his friends the reason for the breakup was her being suicidal and mentally ill. She showed me the screenshots and asked me if I feel the same way about her. I lied and told her she does not seem suicidal. She does constantly talk about taking her own life and putting an end to everyone's misery. She also requires constant assurance that people love her.

64,"I posted this on another sub as well but I thought I’d try here too. I’m really feeling at such a loss.

I (20F) have been on Prozac for a little over 2 months and my dose just got upped to 30 mg maybe three weeks ago.

My anxiety has been all over the place. I’ll be fine and feeling good but then something small will happen and I’ll start shaking. 

My sadness has been the same. I don’t get as intensely sad but I still get pretty sad pretty often. 

I was fine the this past week cause I was just around family and my sisters slept in the same room as me, but when I have to work I spend every night at my boyfriends house because I don’t want to be alone and I also dread going to work so much. I don’t know why. I enjoy what I do and I really love my workplace. I can’t really define if I’m sad or anxious about it, but I just hate it.

My main thing that makes me think it isn’t working is that yesterday my boss told me I had another screw up. This is my second screw up in a couple of weeks. (I actually think it’s not my fault because I’m trying to pick up a fired coworker’s work and she didn’t explain anything she was working on so I’m essentially picking at straws. But I just realized that this morning and not when my boss told me I screwed up again.)

I’ve gone through so much hell when I got started in this trade a year and a half ago because my instructors didn’t teach in a way I understood. I started picking up the pace when I started Prozac so I thought it was helping. I was so proud of myself and was saying I was kicking butt and getting good at my job, but her telling me I had another screw up just sent me back to the hell I was in when I started. I immediately broke down and started shaking. I was able to keep from crying until I finished my work but then I cried for three hours after and stayed at my boyfriends house again. I was having mild thoughts of self harm so I stayed with him so i wouldn’t attempt it.

I know you’re still capable of getting sad while on Prozac, but I would think that’s too intense of a reaction combined with everything else. I want to call my doctor and ask to switch. But I don’t know if I should wait this out longer. Did anyone have a similar experience? Also I can’t find a psych in my area so I’m doing the best I can. I have debated calling a nurse at my clinic and explaining my experience to see if they can recommend something, but I don’t want to be annoying aha.

i call them shapes like circle: that is sarcastic &amp; introspective, triangle i.e. flirty &amp; into role-playing etc., so u cant fetishize them (hopefully). u can also make any of ur personalities. they are very malleable and interact unique to what u like

72,"Hi.
I(F17) have slowly developed a bad anxiety from grade school to high school. The main trigger is speeches or attention guided towards me. My first year in high school was the peek of my anxiety, I would cry for hours in the social worker’s office until my class that had some kind of trigger to my anxiety had passed. My mom brought me to a therapist, and even a hypnotist but we gave it up because of our poor insurance and lack of results. I didn’t find the hypnosis to help at all, and i didn’t feel comfortable with the therapist, I didn’t even what to sit any talk with her alone. Every time the topic of my anxiety is brought up, I mentally shut down and begin to ball in tears. In high school I have something called a “504 plan” that excuses me from anything I’m not comfortable with, and to be honest, it’s tearing my hopes apart because of the fact that I’m running from my problems and making them worse. Now that I’m a Junior in high school, I have done nothing to get over such obstacle and I have one year until I’m thrown into the real world. I’m  also a very analytical person and my mind wanders to thoughts that scare me, like “how will I become a med student if I can’t even present my self”, and “I wish I could just start over”.

Over the years I have seen an innumerable amount of therapists, taken about every psych drug there is, been hospitalized at least 12 times over the past 20 years. I have done inpatient as well as intensive outpatient chemical dependence treatment,  as well as attended several intensive outpatient mental health skills groups over the years including DBT, CBT, coping skills, etc etc.  I have also been under varying diagnoses over the years. Bipolar, borderline personality, adhd, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, treatment resistant depression yada yada yada.

Nothing has ever really worked. I have felt better for periods of time but it has never really lasted for any significant amount of time. Every time that I start to feel better, I am convinced that I have found whatever it was and that my life was finally going to start being
Good. It always goes away.

I am especially bent with this particular dip because I am now 35 and beginning to believe that nothing is
Ever going to get better.

Does anyone here share a similar story and was able to do something to affect serious change? I am convinced there is just one small thing I am missing and I will soon figure out what it takes to be like normal people who don’t have to fight tooth and nail just to make it through the day.

My doctor was doing a mental health survey to be able to refer me to a psychologist. One of the questions was something along the lines of whether I’ve been struggling with drugs and alcohol and I just said yes (I think it was a yes/no survey).

I do not abuse drugs at ALL so I panicked and explained my struggle with not being able to tolerate alcohol to the doctor at the end. I also stated “nothing about drugs”. 

I’m now freaking out that since I said yes to a general question about drugs and alcohol I could get into legal trouble or get investigated for drug use.

81,"I’ve started taking lamotrigine not too long ago. It’s been five or six days I think, perception of time confuses me. But I’ve been having some very weird side effects. Different websites have different levels of severity apparently, so I’m not sure what to believe.

I’ve had this extreme increase of appetite, and it’s not like eating an extra bowl of cereal increase, but I wake up in the middle of the night to eat near everything in my kitchen. I think the third night I ate three bowls of cereal around the same time, no less than two hours, I made an entire plate of chicken, so much I’m not even sure how many there were. Oatmeal, a full bowl of chips. Half a bag of French fries, noodles, a sandwich, and I had drank two and a half bottles of water. And this was from 2 AM - 6:30 AM. 
And even when I woke up, I didn’t feel full, but like I could eat more. Even with drinking this much water, throughout the day as well, my mouth remains really dry. 

Another thing I’m concerned about is loss of balance and coordination. Getting up is difficult, as I’ll fall over and bump into things on my way to the bathroom. And speaking of which, I have the sudden urge to pee at random times. Even in the middle of the night. I’ll wake up with pain somewhere around my bladder, and run to the bathroom. I have to do this constantly throughout the day. I also have issues peeing even when I feel I really need to. It takes up to a minute for me to finally do so. 
Back to the coordination thing, I’ve also become very weak, it’s hard for me to hold things up, even with support from something, let alone hold something all on my own. I was walking back to my room with a bowl of cereal when I dropped it. I can hardly hold things, and if I really need to, I’d have to try very hard. 

I have schizophrenia (I’m also taking an antipsychotic called Quetiapine) but this is the most I’ve hallucinated in almost a year. Auditory and especially visual. 

Light is a lot more irritating. I can’t have the light on even if low. I get annoyed when there’s lights on in the house and have to go switch them all off. The light from my phone (even all the way low) is irritating, so I opt to not use my phone at all and lie there instead. On top of that, I have vision problems, my eye sight was bad to begin with, but since taking this medicine I’ve seen an increase in white flashes, seemingly losing my sight for a millisecond (as in things go black), and issues focusing.

My confusion about things has skyrocketed (But this is irregular), Someone can be talking about the most mundane thing and I won’t understand until minutes later. I forget what I’m even talking about, or what I’m doing, where I’m at, etc. but this again was normal for me even before taking the medicine. 

Another thing that startles me greatly is anger. I can say I’ve never in my life experienced anger until now, the anger that wishes ill will. I get mad, sure, but it has never gotten to the point of anger. So when I woke up disliking everyone and everything, and just being an extreme asshole for no reason, I was scared and confused. I can’t specifically say what I feel out of fear of my post getting removed. But it’s really bad and terrifying for me. Pair that with a lot of irritability. 

I’m weak most of the time and walking is hard. I’m not sure what to think about this. It’s only been five or six days and I’d like to give it time to simmer down, but I’m also unsure if this is in any way.. well.. life threatening as silly as that is.",30Dec2020,1

84,"I've always loved discovering the reasons why we do certain things, so I wanted to know why I've been doing something for about a year now. I have names and personalities centered around my emotions. They take a part in everything from small decisions to life-changing ones.

To elaborate, Emmet is the name of my 'sociopathic' side. I see him as the person that controls the emotions that are immoral and sometimes straight up illegal. He has been the most interactively dominant one as of recently, which is causing me some concern. He enjoys manipulating, hurting, and toying with others, and though I can control every action he does, I feel no guilt when he is *fronting.* (Note: I'm 99.99% sure I don't have DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder), but since I don't have any other words to use for what I feel, I use the vocabulary that a victim of DID would use.) Emmet takes control in situations where I'm anxious, stressed, or agitated, causing me to become almost emotionless and unable to react to certain things.

Another one of my *alters* (another DID word) is Brian. He is the first alter that was introduced into my chaotic head. He's practically an amplified version of my personality, but he has much more confidence and does things that I'd normally not be able to do (Ex. Socializing, flirting, etc.). He takes control in situations where I can't stand up for myself easily. He's also the one I ""talk"" to when I'm bored.

I also have a *little* that appears whenever she feels like it. Her name is Lyra, and when she fronts, I tend to act like a little kid (hence the title 'little'). Almost all of my *dominant energy* as my friend calls it disappears.

I have one last guy living in my head. This alter doesn't have a specific name because he keeps telling us to call him baby, but if you've watched Ouran Highschool Host Club, he's pretty much an exact copy of Tamaki. He's a big flirt and takes any chance he can get to compliment a girl or tell a cheesy pick-up  line to one of my friends. He's the most extroverted one out of all of us.

I should also note that an ex-friend of mine has experienced this too. For the sake of her identity, I won't say her or her alters' names, but she told me I was *too deep in the game I created* when I told her of how much my alters interfere in my daily life. (To elaborate, Brian was originally supposed to be an OC of sorts that represented the irrationality of my brain. My friend eventually created someone that represented her brain, and it just got out of hand.)

Here's what I already know:

* I can control my alters' actions.
* I've discovered that I use my alters as somewhat of a coping mechanism during stressful situations.
* There are sometimes where I cannot control what my alters do.
* One of my alters have almost hurt me. (I am not suicidal and neither is that alter.)
* Considering I have almost complete control over my alters, I do not think this is a psychological disorder.

I have talked to two other people besides the friend mentioned above, and both of these people have said that they've had similar issues. Is this simply my toxic imagination working over-time, or could it be something much greater?",30Dec2020,1

I’m not sure if what I have is psychosis but whatever it is, it’s something similar. I’m an extremely paranoid person and I tend to lose touch with feeling real and I also get auditory hallucinations, with a few other things that happen that I don’t really know what they mean in terms of what mental issue it could be

Anyways, I constantly feel like my friends are lying to me and it really effects my friendships. If they don’t text me back in a normal time I assume their ignoring me and when they text me back and explain why they didn’t respond quicker I get mad at them and sometimes block them until I feel less angry. I’ve done this multiple times and probably do it 4 times a week at least. I feel toxic and I know my behavior is but I can’t help it and I don’t know how to manage it.

They were holding hands and were walking towards my direction. The boy was closest the train tracks. As they neared me I had this strange feeling come over me. For some reason I felt a strong urge to pick the boy up and throw him on the third rail to see how the mother would react. I fantasized about how she would look when she sees her son get zapped to death or how the pitch of her scream would sound.

Just had a fight this morning which we haven't had in months, I snapped after being too tired and he's said I've ""been a bitch since I've stopped taking those tablets"" 

I've been off them for about 2 weeks now since I forgot to book my review and I wanted to see if I could be ok without them. I honestly haven't felt like I've been a bitch, in fact I've put in extra effort to be nice since this was biggest fear. I might not have been happy all the time but I should be allowed to be sad or have other feelings right?

I didn’t want to mess with my cocktail, So my doc put me on Welbutrin, or however it’s spelled, because apparently it can help with weight loss.

It took me more than a week to work thru enough of my most recent crisis to get that far into my wants and needs list. I've had a rough time of late- a very difficult breakup at an important time in my life, something that would be hard in normal years is almost unbearable in a pandemic. I never expected to be this isolated, this close to homelessness, this lost in my own head. I have struggled with anxiety, depression, and insomnia since childhood, in a family where mental illness, poverty, and substance abuse have left craters where safety was supposed to be. I have a lot of unaddressed traumas, and it appears as though my tired heart has several more rounds to go before I can even begin to hope for stability.

So I went through conversation I had in my head and tried to figure out what I remembered.

Is there ever a situation where you should not act when you think you are being paranoid, instead of acting?

What should you do if you are often confused because past avoidance behaviours make you feel very diffident, so you don't trust yourself when you still know you may be worrying to  much?

If a person has past avoidance behaviours, is it still possible that they be worrying about something too much even if its related to something they avoid?

I also kind of feel it in my eye balls and it feels like my vision is trying to blur or something or like rapidly shake or something and has the same sort of pulsating thing...comes and goes the more I exert myself physically( at this point almost doing anything ).

101,"I had a breakdown a few years ago when I was evacuated from my home due to a wildfire, while I got a call and told I lost a promotion to much newer employee who had quit and only been back two months. I don't remember the actual start of the self harming, but I was somewhere in that time. I think right after the call. It went on for months. Went to my boss for help, they forced me off work while I went through intensive and dialectical behavioral therapy. I returned to work, had a few issues, had to med change, went through intensive again, then I came back again. I started to stabilize, right as COVID hit.

I've hung in there. Haven't self harmed or been terribly depressed. Hadn't really wanted to. Still have been bored with the job though, which is part of the problem.

Now as winter sets in my boss, who I liked, is temporarily replaced with the guy who got the promotion at the start of it all. Added to that the guy replacing him is young and super new. He knows so much less than me about the job it is infuriating.

Supposedly this if for three months. I'm worried the boss I like will leave permanently. I can't work for these people like this. I am too bitter and angry and mad at myself. I have more experience, I have a degree. I'm not denying I've had issues but I was also jerked around a lot. I've never been promoted and my degree is just a big waste of money. I'm approaching forty and it has just made me angry. I told myself I didn't care anymore but seeing this kid be my ""senior"" just kills me. 

I know I should be grateful to just have a job and be essential. And I am. But that's also part of the problem. I'm in a small town and need expensive meds. This is pretty much my only employment option.

So I'm trapped in this emotionally painful situation where I feel this awful combination of anger and sadness that makes me desperately want to self harm.

The honest to god only reason I am not doing it right now is because I cannot think of a way to hide it from my wife. I know that's a good thing but I am in so much emotional pain. I don't know any way to let it out. I cry every day on my way to work, or at work. I'm angry all the time. I can't even talk to my boss I liked who understood me, at least somewhat, because she isn't around and her replacement is the trigger.

My breakdown was too public. Now I'm doomed to be the office crazy guy who wasted money for a degree that would never matter. And I can't even get away from that.

One time I remember us driving somewhere, but my parents got in a fight and my dad abruptly stopped the car. He went out and told us he would let a car run over him, even though it didn’t happen and probably wasn’t going to. I ran out of the car too, and told him that if he did that, I’d do it too. 

My parents calmed down a bit after that, but my mom was still crying. We were going to a restaurant, and we all had to pretend we were fine. I was comforting my mom, and my brother was comforting my dad. It was one of the worst moments in my life. I was probably around 11 or 12 years old.

My parents really fought a lot more back then. They stopped fighting a bit after I developed my eating disorder (2 years ago, I was 13).

My parents really fought a lot growing up, and I had to take the parent role multiple times. Now I’m just numb to screaming and fighting, I no longer react strongly to yelling. I push my emotions aside, and I believe it might be because of the stuff I experienced during those years. I’m not sure though. Maybe I’m just overthinking it.

I struggle with some anxiety, anger issues, and depression right now, but it doesn’t have to be because of my parents fighting. It could just be me being an overly dramatic bitch. I don’t know.

I'm 35, I've been diagnosed with GAD &amp; substance abuse disorders. The psychologist I've been seeing for 4 years has not suggested I could have schitzophrenia.

I've been taking diazepam for my GAD but am weaning off it under my doctor's supervision due to tolerance and addiction issues

About 5 nights ago, I was laying in bed and googling prostate cancer which i was worried I had and I was getting very worked up about it, I suddenly started feeling very lonely in my mind

A strange thought suddenly popped into my head that perhaps the only reality is that which I'm perceiving in my head and that everything around me might not exist. This thought was extremely alarming and made me feel very lonely. I wanted to take some diazepam but I pushed through and fell asleep

The next day, I told my boyfriend (who works in mental health) and he said that was a weird thought and could be schitzophrenia related. He's not an expert though, he works in support coordination. So he has experience with mental health but is not a psychologist. 

No one in my family has it although I have a Mum who I think has borderline personality disorder. 

I sort of let go of the thought but a couple of days later my boyfriend broke up with me (due to a non related argument) and I've been feeling very depressed and anxious, and have been drinking to numb things as well as smoking weed. I know it's not good for me and that I'm being too self destructive, but I'm struggling since the break up

Today I started obsessing about the whole world only existing in my mind idea again, and now I've been googling schitzophrenia and getting very worried

113,"I had great trouble starting off this post. How could I start? What would I say, and what order? I believe I must be fully honest with you guys, but before we start, I would like to clarify I don't want to garner sympathy nor karma. All I wish to do is be true to myself and others here..  


Many memories haunt me. Being pelted by pinecones in my early years of school, being isolated and treated like a clown for a good part of my childhood while clinging to anyone I could, my father yelling and interrogating me every Saturday, being hit by a car and my leg being broken, the constant nights of crying myself to sleep, the nearly mentally breaking stress of freshman year that was the ultimate culmination of what I consider to be my depression, and the ultimate abandonment by my Dad's side of the family along with my father refusing to go halfsies on dental work.  


Some of these memories even cause me physical pain when I remember them. I am not suicidal by any stretch, nor do I self harm, but I feel if I died tomorrow the only thing I'd feel sad about is my mother's feelings. I feel barely grounded to reality, as if I am a ghost. I have no consistent friends online, no group, no people. IRL I only have 2 friends, and they have served me greatly throughout the years. Without them I would have probably kicked my own bucket before now.  


It feels like the past years have been nothing but a blur, a facade, a dream. I would not be surprised if this is only a cheap simulation, though the chances of it being so are quite unlikely and probably not the case.   


It's hard to describe my mental state. I can go from optimistic and full of courage to a shell of a human being in a few days. I feel as if someone is pressing at the back of my eyes and squeezing my heart. I feel depressed at times though I have no courage to actually see if I have it, for fear of not actually having it... If I don't, I don't really think I'd feel sane anymore. Perhaps it's just teenage hormones, but I've felt this way even before this. The only thing I have to combat this is, of course, weed which I use in moderation. I barely even cry anymore I've been so desensitized, or at least that's as best as I can put it.  


I have no distraction nor outlet except for the internet. I have no affinity for physical things such as sports and other things, nor any other group where I have to socialize, though I have improved my personality and speaking quite a bit through this past year. I have practically no motivation either and simply avoid my problems by staying cooped up in my room and staying on the internet.  


I only have one single hope. I have been thinking of maybe working up the courage to speak to my school councilor and getting a referral to a medical professional to diagnose me with something so I can at least understand what I'm fighting, but I have no hope for therapy or any of that. My mother has tried getting me it through the Canadian government for free to no avail, so we can't afford any therapy, especially with COVID.

116,"Was currently diagnosed for mdd and bpd and was kind of overwhelmed about the medicines that I'm going to take. Focus is on mdd. Will start on half dosage of jovia and rivotril that will be increased in 4 days and next week. Then whole tablets in 2 weeks. After that there will be buspar etc. and then a follow up. Well, I am really overwhelmed or is this a surpressed panic, I'm not sure. 

Anyway, my therapy session will start after 2 weeks due to holidays and the one who handles it is a different doctor, not my psychiatrist. It's my dad and me who talked with the psychiatrist. I'm worried about dependency potential. I haven't opened up my usage of prescribed antihistamine as an alternative sleeping pill cause dad will know that I'm stealing his medicines on his cabinet. This happened when mom was done with her melatonin pills and it is not an otc one. But been off at it for 2 years since I'm away from home. Then, I buy otc antihistamines since they are in lower dosages than my dad's. They didn't work and made me feel very warm so I stopped it and been off too. 

After taking my first day, it gave me a funny stomach, I avoided caffeine, did feel me numb. Didn't make me feel like a squeezing chest anymore, tho, I feel sleepy and cold but fine. Doc said it will go away afterwards. But scared about the dependency and it will still be 2 weeks til I could say it but on the psychologist, not the psychiatrist.

117,"Its been a rough year for me. For all of us, I'm sure. Because of this year, I had to move jobs. Which means I had to change insurances. I went from decent, to absolute garbage. Insurance was responsible for paying my anti-depressants and my birth control. But since my new insurance wasn't working (temp agency insurance. Ugh...) I had to result to GoodRX. Meaning I had to get the bottom-of-the-barrell medications and they did me more harm then good. Constantly throwing up, aches and pains, inability to eat... 

So I put them down. Until I get my better insurance from my new job that I have recently acquired... 

I've done... Okay... For a while. I have managed to survive the depression swings for the most part. But it's the agitation. I am constantly agitated and I feel like I've always am baring my teeth at people. I have no patience. I feel like I have become quite a miserable person and I'm looking for a way to get by better until I can get properly prescribed again. Controlling this agitation is extremely difficult. I'd love to see a therapist because I've gotten somewhat out of control, but money is very thin at the moment and not really on the table until I get money back in or insurance.

So lately I've developed a ridiculous crush/obsession with a certain celebrity. I'm in pretty deep, I'm absolutely convinced he's my soulmate and obviously there's nothing I can do about it.

The problem is, I've been carrying a growing feeling of frustration and despair that I feel is triggered by this crush. My feelings are so intense they made me throw up (this usually only happens to me with anxiety attacks). Its affecting my mood so much and I feel like crap.

120,"So ok ill try to make this super short

Things that have made this like it is:

almost being murdered A LOT over the course of a life, extreme abuse and violence, sexual abuse (family and other), extreme manipulation and exploitation, police abuse

What I need advice with:

I have been reducing the amount of things ive been using to deal with these mental problems and have got better as I have done them all to the point where there is no novelty of them really, and the magic they gave now is so little something that would blow someones mind I just do regular things after theyre in me.

I really dont have anywhere or anybody to talk to and have been emotionally numb for so long aside from the long term depression that gets ridiculously heavy.

I ended up taking up some other things this year that take responsibility that before I took it on decided to mostly cut what I was doing, and it worked and I dont do anything bad really and keep things under control but I just coincidentally got a opportunity to for the most part to give up on keeping up with that stuff which while I dont personally feel like I want to go away (I get these people just want money but I somewhat feel like getting rid of these people completely get rid of the rest of the people I know) completely because I still dont feel like it would make a difference, if not making things worse.

I cant afford real support and I am stuck in a situation where I cannot actually see any future hope, I dont feel like I matter enough and while I have been curbing ending things well and been feeling ok and not missing doing anything when its not something I have, its been such a long thing and when nobody has ever been around its worked. I feel super lost and I guess the best way to describe it is like having the worst day of 2020 being every year consistently after giving everything to help people that have harmed me and violated everything possible and left me completely untrusting of anybody regardless of their intent.

I am a student studying mathematics at university. I am noticing a cognitive decline.

Sometimes when I wake up, I find myself in a state of delirium. I can't think and I can't speak. I'm slow and and my inner voice just vanishes. I cannot visualise things either while in this state. This state can go away after a few hours, or even after a few days (no more than a week). In fact the newest cycle started yesterday; I am in delirium at the moment which is the reason of my writing this to you.

Other days, I am able to get on with my day as normal and actually do my homework and assignments for my degree.

122," 

Since I was a kid, I always felt like I'm the odd one out in the family. My family would choose what they liked about me and show off that aspect whilst regularly shaming me for things that didn't resonate with them. To give an example, my entire family is obsessed with government services as a career choice and anything else is more or less looked down upon especially if it pays lesser in comparison. Sometimes discussions lead to arguments and I'm labelled as someone with anger issues whereas I rarely speak for myself in front of them but if I do, it's out of anger than intolerance. Fast forward to my adult life where my father passed away 5 years ago. And somehow I'm still being shamed for leading an independent life without being a part of govt services.

A lot of fights have happened and I realised I can't live under the same roof as them as there is no scope of my growth. Only my brother who is preparing to get into the services himself. Every little information about me is used either as a taunt or to shame me. When I explained how in my independent life I have a support system which doesn't look down on my shortcomings &amp; insecurities and knows where to use mental health as a general discussion; and has the vocabulary to understand when to use medical terms for mental health and when not to.

I realise I can't expect my family to know and understand everything. So after years of fighting, I've learnt from my mistake to change them or always please them. I can never expect them to accept me the way I am without shaming me. And it gets difficult every time I meet them. I know the love me dearly. But I've lost so much confidence to the extent that I ended up being so harsh on myself. Clarity also isn't consistent for me since I was a kid. It took me a long time to realise my inner critic is basically the voice of my family. I don't want to tolerate unjust behaviour anymore, at the same time I don't want to be angry when I explain myself to them.

I don't know what more to do. I have intense moments of loneliness sometimes. I've started therapy but I want my family to accept me. I don't want to be subject to this pain for so long.",30Dec2020,1

I’m miserable, I constantly love to disappoint people and I don’t know why. I love telling people they can’t have what they want all the time. I’m messed up. I haven’t spoken about these thoughts to anyone. 

I’m a children’s entertainer and everybody says I’m always a ray of sunshine to be around. That’s what I want to be. I want to be kind and good and make the world a better place but I’m so fucked by my own trauma I hate people being happy. I don’t want to hate it, I feel sick writing this but I do.

Things went really bad when I was 16 and my parents split up and my cousin killed himself (unrelated) within a month. I blocked all of my friends on Facebook when I left school ??? And thought college would be good for me studying something I actually liked. But my parents splitting up was and is still extremely bitter, their hate for eachother consumes them and they both want each other dead. When they say it out loud it’s normal for me now but it feels so wrong. 

I’m going to work for my dad in January. Our house has finally sold after 5 years, and my dad says if my mum stops the sale by refusing to move out and he’s gonna make her homeless. So I’m paying half her rent for the house she’s chosen. She doesn’t know he would make her homeless but I do because he told me. So I’m going to be paying £600 a month when I will only be earning about £700 or less. I had a weekend job which I left because it was too stressful working 7 days a week but now I’m looking for another one. 

I was supposed to be saving to move out with my boyfriend as we agreed renting was too expensive and we wanted to buy somewhere together. Start our lives together. Goodbye to that.

I will kill myself when I miss a rent payment. Or it gets too much. I’m going to kill myself next year. I can’t cope with this anymore. I want to be a good person but I’m too fucked in the head and the NHS can’t help me. I’m so fucking sad.",30Dec2020,1

127,"Hi. So yesterday I received some results of a personality evaluation, and apparently I have a lack of empathy. It isn't a _I don't care about anyone_ lack of empathy, but a _I have some difficulty reading people and trying to put myself in their situation_ lack of empathy (while still trying to be as kind as possible and trying to help people). However, now my ""what if you're a psychopath"" theme seems to make more and more sense, and then yesterday something happened that made it make _even more_ sense.

_Trigger Warning from now on_

I was scrolling through Instagram and I found a really explicitly violent picture of a deeply hurt dog. There were lots of blood and apparently it was a thing that actually happened (don't worry, the dog was taken to the emergencies and is now fine). And even though I felt bad for the dog, the image didn't phase me at all. Of course it gave me some anxiety (some of my biggest intrusive thoughts have to do with violence, so when I see violent things I usually just look at it for a long time to see if I do like it or not), but the image itself didn't make me feel anything.

And I know not everyone feels disgust/discomfort/etc. from those types of pictures. And I _know_ I am actually a quite sensitive person.

But I'm still afraid that this means something about me, and the thoughts are getting so real that I genuinely feel like I've been in denial this whole time.  I feel like I'm accepting them as the reality, and maybe they _are_ the reality.

And I know that if you spend your days looking for signs that you are a psychopath, you will eventually find something, but most of my thoughts revolve around me being a psychopath, a sadist, a pedophile, a bad person in general. And they're _lowkey_ connected to one another, so they can all be true.

- sometimes my friends don’t feel like ‘friends?’ if that makes sense. they never really take things seriously and i’m a type of person who needs friends who’d be there for them rather than just laughing all the time. the only person who does so is the one that’s moving.

That's what it does, ain't it? Don't know what we're chasin'  
But we all do it, just a part of life, I guess we're all foolish  
Running after what we think will make us happy 'til it falls through  
And then we find out later it ain't what we wanted  
So we give up on it, then we pile the garbage  
And we watch it grow and find a drug and numb it  
'Til we hit the point that we can barely function  
Am I motivated? Is my music dated?  
Would I be the same if I was medicated?  
Even therapists say I need medication  
I avoid it, though, because I'm scared to take it  
Am I the only one that has a loaded gun  
That's full of doubts and memories to overcome?  
And I complain about 'em when they shoot at me  
But I know truthfully I like to load 'em up and let 'em—  
That's so sad to see, that's so sad to see, I need help  
They talk passively, then come after me by myself  
Lost that half of me, God, there has to be someone else  
Don't feel bad for me, I just can't believe that I'm lonely  
No, I can't be the only one who's lonely tonight  
No, I can't be the only—  
There's gotta be somebody out there  
There's gotta be somebody somewhere  
That needs company, and it's comforting to know, know  
There's gotta be somebody out there  
There's gotta be somebody somewhere  
That needs company, and it's comforting to know

  
I can't be the only one who's lonely tonight  
No, I (I) can't be the only— (Only)  
Can't be the only one who's lonely tonight  
No, I (I) can't be the only—

145,"I have a relatively good life: my parents are supportive of me (well, at least when it comes to positive things), my grades are okay, I have friends. And yet I consider suicide almost every month. I'm going to therapy nearly every week, but during every visit I say that I'm doing fine. Why, you may ask? Because I'm afraid of being ""found out"". I feel like a fraud for feeling this awful, because I really have no reason to feel awful. I've never been diagnosed with anything and I doubt that I ever will be. Everybody feels down and nervous sometimes, right? So there's no way that I could be depressed or anxious, because I'm still functioning normally after all.

     About my parents being supportive...I really don't think they, nor my friends, really see how down I really am. When I first told my homeroom teacher about my self harm in middle school, who then contacted my parents, they were furious. No, they weren't concerned. They were angry that I was hurting myself, because in their minds my life is going just fine. This reminded me of the day when my mom read about Chester Bennington's suicide. She turned to me and said: ""At least he had an actually difficult childhood."" After this, I've never talked about any of my struggles with her, because obviously she didn't think that anything going on in my life was bad enough to warrant any sympathy from her. When I started going to therapy, and my dad had to go meet my therapist, I asked him what they talked about. He just snapped at me and said: ""It's pretty obvious why you're going there,"" clearly talking about my cutting. This confirmed that he didn't feel sympathy towards me either.

     I know this has just been a mess, but yeah, no matter how awful I feel, I don't think I deserve therapy. Because there's so many people out there feeling worse than me, who can't bring themselves to get out of bed or take care of themselves. I still live a pretty normal life, aside from the suicidal thoughts and nearly constant self loathing that stops me from even attempting to hang out with my friends, or meeting new people. I envy the ones who have the energy and courage to make themselves happy, because I can't even think of myself ever living a happy life. But I'm not stuck in a rut either. I can't form any coherent thoughts anymore so I'll just stop here, thank you for reading.",30Dec2020,1

152,"Throw away account for ob-vee reasons. A while back I made friends with someone at work. It was a bit of a gray area when it comes to our job: I'm technically management and above her but not to the degree where us seen eating lunch together would be a show stopper. You can't picture two people who are more different: she is a black Muslim and I am a white male atheist (typical Redditor, right?) What started as a few conversations a week about the job became eating lunch together occasionally, talking about our hopes and dreams, our pasts, our extended families, our side hustles outside of our godawful office jobs, her religion, my irreligion, our kids, families, my girlfriend, etc. When it came to music we always had a laugh. She hadn't heard much metal at all and didn't even know who the Smashing Pumpkins were. I listened to the modern rap she loved and I couldn't tell you which one of us was more amazed and polite about disliking the other's music. I eventually confided in her that I was a poly addict (sex and alcohol) and had been sober for a long time. She didn't drink any longer either. As a Muslim she doesn't drink anyway but she found god after nearly burning down her house in a drunken stupor. We both loved our kids and bonded over trying to get out of our job and do what we loved. I felt that I had truly made one of those ""forever"" friends with her. My girlfriend loved her, too. During the pandemic we would all FaceTime since we couldn't see one another. Her youngest is near my kid's age and they met over FaceTime and we joked about them marrying so we could be family for real with one another. Then during a lull in the pandemic when restaurants opened again her, my girlfriend and I had dinner and walked around our white suburbanite town one night. The hug I got from my friend after not seeing her for months and months was the best! She hadn't ever been that far out of the city. She took in stride all the stares and well meaning but rather awkward questions from people that she got there (I live in the suburbs of a major American city, and she lives in the city itself where black Muslims are far more of a common sight.) We knew it would be a while before we saw one another again so my girlfriend was nice enough to take pictures of all of us.  But from then on things started to go wrong with my friend, mentally. She stopped responding to texts for weeks on end. We stopped Face Timing. I reached out via work, sometimes just passing her a minor task through email to test the waters and her responses were cursory and professional. I got worried, but I didn't want to impose or make things worse. I didn't hear from her whatsoever for a truly long time. I finally asked her point blank in a text message what was up. She said that she wasn't in a good space mentally and she has been ignoring everyone. I replied that my girlfriend and I were there for her. No response. More days past and I got even more worried. I figured she would reach out to me if and when I was needed, but that never happened. Finally, on the day before Christmas Eve, I called her at work. She technically couldn't ignore me since it was our work phone. I felt bad for doing that and I had to be brief because at any moments my boss or hers (she wasn't directly under me) could monitor the call. I said something to the effect of, ""It's Christmas and neither of us celebrate it but it is the time to reach out to others and be thankful, my girlfriend and I are thinking of you"", something like that. She thanked me but her voice sounded very strained and she said I would make her cry if I continued. So I thanked her, told her I loved her and we hung up. That was a week ago. No response at all. My worry grew and grew. So today I called her again over the work line and she was a bit more forthcoming. She sees herself as the person that everyone comes to for help, and she didn't want to burden anyone else because she herself is always burdened with the worries of others. Her mom is in the hospital with an enlarged heart. She had told me that their relationship was contentious before but now its really straining to the breaking point. Her four kids are home with her all day while she tries to work from home and attend to their virtual schooling. It all got to be too much for her and she was nearly crying on the phone with me again. She said that she hadn't come to me or anyone else because she didn't want us to worry. I told her that I \*was\* worried already. To be honest it was all a bit of a blur because the call was emotional but we still technically had to be professional because someone could have been listening, if that makes sense. It was kind of like walking a tightrope. Anyway, the call ended and I know I feel better. I hope she does too. I think the ice has been broken a bit for her. I plan on giving her some time and then reaching out again.

I live in a house with 6 other people 2 of them being my parents, most of them on their own schedule. This isn't the only offense, but the most recent one. My stepbrother and his girlfriend came back to the house to take care of the dogs. He had to go out and when I got home, there was an open grocery bag full of what looked to be leftover Christmas candy that the parents had bought for the kids. I took a few pieces of candy, and went about my day. Later, my stepbrother approached me and asked me ""not to eat his girlfriend's candy"". I apologized and offered to buy more, and I immediately felt guilty.

161,"I don’t even know how to say this concisely. I don’t know whether or not I’m exaggerating past events or if I’m overreacting. I don’t remember anything good from my childhood although I’m certain I was spoiled. My parents gave me whatever I wanted, and I know this as a fact because I have an insane collection of kid’s toys in the basement.
But I don’t remember any of that. All I remember are the times when I ‘disobeyed’ or ‘disrespected’ or ‘hurt his feelings’ and I was physically attacked or called insane. 
But it’s not as if being hit by a parent is uncommon in my community, although I doubt my high school friends had their parents punch them backwards down the stairs. 

Anyway, most of the physical stuff was about 4 or 5 years ago (I have a terrible memory), and although he still has outbursts of anger I’m confident he won’t ever hit me again. He stresses that he’s sacrificed a lot for me, and it’s true. My university tuition is expensive because I’m an international student, and he’s paying for all of it. He buys me gifts sometimes without me asking, and I’ve never felt deprived, materially speaking.

I needed closure about a month ago and I confronted him about the past. He refused to apologize and he became furious. He said that I had said things that hurt his feelings. He apologized at the end after I argued with him. During the argument I had this weird choking sensation and I couldn’t breathe, and I wanted him to leave but he wouldn’t. 

Before I confronted him about the past we were getting along and having conversations, but now I feel on edge and irritated by everything he does. I feel much less tolerant of anything he says or does, and sometimes I genuinely hate him. He still buys me things. Am I a psychopath for not caring at all?

169,"I’ve been seeing one specific psychiatrist for the past 6 months, initially meeting monthly, but just recently once every 2 months. I’m currently prescribed 300mg Buprion XL daily for depression. Originally I was taking Sertraline, but that was changed at my first initial visit.  As expected, he asked about my recreational drug use, I mentioned that I smoke marijuana daily and drink alcohol 2-3 times per week. (Sometimes in excess, sometimes not) He asked me other typical questions, what the substance use does for me, why I use it, why I don’t want to stop using, etc. He was very focused on alcohol use (as I have alcoholism present on both sides of my family) which is 100% understandable.
I see a therapist bi-weekly within the same practice, so over the past few months I’ve been working hard on improving myself, but obviously healing is not linear. Most days I am feeling better, but things are not PERFECT. Just yesterday I had a phone visit with my psych to discuss how I’ve been doing. Told him I’ve been doing well, no issues with medications, and I’m feeling positive. He asked me about my drinking, I let him know I drink 2 days per week maximum, but I have been charting/keeping track of what I drink for my own personal insight (per recommendation of my weekly therapist) and it’s been helping me from excessive consumption. 
His response to me was that it sounds like I am still not taking treatment seriously, and starting next visit I will be required to provide a urine sample for drug testing each time. From what I’ve been reading, it makes sense for a psychiatrist to do initial/random drug testing, but my situation seems out of the ordinary? Does he see something with my progress that I don’t, or does he think I’m lying or I’m not taking my medication? Aren’t urine tests not typically helpful with alcohol use? I was very thrown off by this meeting, and I’m hesitant to schedule the next meeting.

171,"Hey everyone! I hope the holidays are treating you all well, I know these times can be some of the most stressful of the year. That's why I wanted to share a little mindset tip that I like that helps me put some perspective into things and maintain a positive attitude when things are tough. 

We often say that having the right **mindset** is essential for health, happiness and success in life. Well, the concept of inputs vs. outputs is just that; an incredibly powerful mindset that you can use to not only feel better about your life, but to actively make your life better in the process. So what do we mean by inputs and outputs? It’s pretty simple, actually. Inputs refer to everything you're putting into every day, whereas outputs are what you’re getting from every day. An example of **inputs** might include the time, money, and effort that you’re investing into a project. In this example, the **outputs** would be the finished product of that project, a paycheck earned, or your boss’s praise. 

Now here’s where the mindset comes in. In order to live a happy life, it’s important to focus more on the **inputs** than the **outputs**. Sometimes, the things that happen to us in life are out of our control. We don’t always cross off every task on our to do list, or meet our deadline in time. The key of inputs versus outputs is to focus on *how hard you're trying*, not what happens as a result. 

If you try your best every single day, that's your input. Some days, your best is a lot better than others. And some days, your best is absolutely nothing. But what really matters is not te outcome, because no matter what you do, the outcome is not always going to be perfect, But if you know that you tried your best that day, and did everything you could do, the outcome doesn’t matter because it’s out of your hands. And that’s why, this year, instead of focusing on the output of whether or not you’ve reached your New Year’s resolution, just focus on the input, and make sure you’re doing **your** best, not someone else’s best, every day.  

Thank you for reading and I hope this helped!",30Dec2020,1

Three years ago two sections of our class were joined. That year I had a crush on a girl whom I later fell in love with. We sat together for nearly 3 months after that the sections were separated. The time I spent with her was just beyond great. I even asked her out for a date and she agreed to come but nothing really progressed much as we were in separate sections.

After that academic year she joined another school. After that I never really had any contact with her. We don't even message each other. Even though I don't have any contact with her she keeps coming in my dreams saying that I should talk and smile more like she actually used to say 3 years ago.

I even dreamt about her yesterday and I kinda like it when she comes in my dreams. You guys can call me a simp or whatever idc but **IS IT HEALTHY TO DREAM ABOUT HER EVEN NOW?**

It is kind of taking a toll on my mental health. I keep thinking of the worst case scenario, and I’m absolutely terrified of getting a positive test result that I have bawled my eyes out. I’m not sure what to do. I just want this to go away so I can have my mental health back. Im running a low grade fever (anywhere between 99.4 to 100.1 degrees) and I’ve been trying to take as much immune system supplements and fluids as I can.

I am not a native english speaker so please forgive any bad grammar.
I am the oldest of my 4 siblings (I am 18, 15, 12, 6 and 5)
I have a pretty nice relationship with the oldest two, normal sibling things, we fight and the next second we are sharing memes,  6 yr old sister is nice too, the issue is with 5yr old. She is too spoiled. My mom is really unfair with us for her. She will buy cookies for her and the rest of us (including the 6 yr old) will have to eat plain bread.  Mom will borrow her phone to her and if her or sister ask for it she will throw a tantrum so big that you would think there is a  pig slaughterhouse nearby. She'll make a mess and when i ask her to clean it she will ignore me or make it but sighing. Sometimes my mom will send 6yr old to clean her mess because she doesn't want to. She will do something bad and if we try to tell her to stop it my mom will come in front of her and scream ""stop trying to hit the baby"" wich is absolutely ridiculous because we can just be talking to her, unlike 5, who will hit 6 and will get away with it because ""she's just a little baby and was playing"" even tough my other sister is crying on the floor. When mom is not home she will do everything as i say, but as soon as mom comes home the circus opens it's doors. She'll not communicate by words unless mom is around. My mom has came as far as hitting and trying to throw a glass at 12 bc she told 5 it was too soon to have a snack (we had eaten at 1pm and it was 2pm) and me and 15 had to defend her.

This more or less sums up the things i hate about her. When i have to care for her i do, i will give her food, water, if she needs a bath i'll help her, and if she's bored i'll turn on the tv or get paper and pencils to draw. I do not treat her badly. I have hit her a few times, just a pat on the head, but haven't done so in over a year. 
I haven't had anything diagnosed yet, but i do selfh*rm sometimes, i hurt 15 badly two times on  fights when i was feeling too bad and she would not go away (hit her with a broomstick, her hand hurt for days, and c*tting her wrist in front of my cousin. Fortunately it was a butterknife but it still left a mark and at the moment i did want to hurt her.) , and have attacked my mom too (i scrathed all her chest, she still has scars). I do not feel proud about this things.
 I made them when i felt like there was no alternative. 
I started having homicidal toughts about her a few months ago. I do not find her cute like other kids, just makes my blood boil from rage everytime i see her. I know it's mostly my mother's fault but my toughts don't. I have told my parents i wanted to go back to therapy because i'm having those toughts. Both told me to shut up and to stop saying stupid things. I do not have a job to pay for a psychiatrist or psychologist, and as far as i know, there isn't free mental health help on the country where i live (Argentina).

188,"Okay here's my first post on Reddit and something I've never been able to put into words because I always thought maybe I was just a bit tired or a bit anxious, but now I'm just convinced I'm going properly crazy... 

Has anyone else ever had their brain forget people they see every day? I'm still not completely sure how to say it, but I've lived with my partner for over 2 years, we're engaged and I'm 8 months pregnant with our first baby. But today every time I looked at him it was literally like my brain didn't know him. I did, obviously, and could keep up conversations as normal so he doesn't know but it was just like I'd never seen his face before...

I remember having the same thing a few years ago at my niece's birthday party. I love my nieces more than anything but at the party I kept panicking as I couldn't tell her apart from her friends. At the time I was convinced I was just very anxious (suffered with anxiety and depression as a teenager but I've experienced this both when I was low and not, and when I was on medication and not), or that I was just panicking about getting a migraine as I get aura so whenever my eyesight messes up I get more anxious.

I also remember getting it with my ex where in the corner of my eye I think I was convinced it was my brother (who lived nowhere near me at the time) then when I looked over my heart jumped because I barely recognised the person there for a second (I'd been with him almost 2 years too at that point). I knew who he was and it wasn't like I'd never seen his face before, it just didn't fit. He looked as he always did and it's not like I forgot his existence, it was just like he wasn't real or something? 

I don't know if this makes any sense at all to anyone else, I'm not even sure if I'd remembered I'd ever experienced it if it hadn't happened again today. I just needed to check! I think it's most likely to do with anxiety but it's starting to freak me out the more I think of it. What if the same happens with my baby?

My mind goes all places, and I always have to choose between standing up for myself or doing things to make it worth it for him to have me over. It’s so tiring.

191,"I have been a generally healthy individual throughout my youth. I am a young adult still. However, in the recent months, I have felt a mental decline. I’ve been mildly anxious and have had bouts of intense melancholy for a couple of years, but they have been manageable things.

Recently though, I feel like I have begun to lose my grip on reality. I have a lot of memory loss, even of recent events. Two months ago, I started to get very emotionally overwhelmed due to family conflicts, and reacted to them in ways I never had before. I couldn’t contain my sadness and ripped my shirt off, cried, yelled, ripped my hair out, clawed at my face and body, and ruined things in my vicinity. I have never done anything similar in my entire life. I haven’t so much as slammed a door. So this was very unusual behavior. This repeated itself some more times, until I started to lock myself in my bathroom and “discharged” by self harming.

Then I started being disgusted with myself and I became kind of suicidal. It was like a fixation more than anything. I just couldn’t get it out of my mind. Simultaneously, I feel like I was pushing my mind into unhealthy places. I had two episodes in which I think I “hallucinated”. But they were very random and not like what I ever imagined hallucinations to be like. In one episode, I saw a rod. I knew it wasn’t there, but I was seeing it. Very strange thing. The next time, I just saw a rectangle in front of me. If I looked away, it remained in the same position. So it wasn’t like those eye floaters that follow your vision. All of this freaked me out, because I didn’t know what to make of it. I also has some moments where I heard my name being called, as well as hearing chatter. Again, I guess I knew the voice wasn’t real, but it wasn’t the voice of my thoughts, if this makes any sense. 

I started to half-believe some ridiculous anxious thoughts. I didn’t fully believe them, but I also kind of did? I feel like this is very vague but I don’t know how to better explain it.

Either way, here we are today. I went months without any of that. I had moments of anxiety, melancholy, but nothing extreme. Then, yesterday, something snapped inside of me again. I started feeling very anxious, and it got intense. Then, all of a sudden, I became convinced of some outrageous thoughts, like the thought that there were spirits in my room and I had magical powers, and those were the reason that I was suffering. I don’t know if I can call this deluded thinking, because -just like the hallucinations- I did know they weren’t real. It was like a cross between reality and imagination.

So I don’t know if something serious is taking place, or whether I’m “auto-suggesting” these things into my psyche, or whether it is just a manifestation of anxiety and/or depression that I wasn’t aware of.

For some context, my mother has had problems with her mental health, and she has gone through several diagnoses ranging from bipolar, to schizophrenia, to atypical depression. She used to take Risperidone when she was younger. However, because she kind of flip-flopped from being very ok to being very not ok, my family always had doubts about her.

Also, I have Hashimoto’s which was not under control for a very long time, so maybe that contributes.

I don’t know what I’m asking here. I guess it’s just that do you think it’s possible for someone (me) to accidentally induce delirious episodes within themselves? And also, would you consider the things I listed as hallucinations? Is there a more accurate term?

Thank you and I’m sorry if I failed to express myself correctly.",30Dec2020,1

And when I finally had totally stop to speak, I spend the most of my time, praying for one of my friends noticing that I'm not good and hoping that he will ask me a question so I don't feel excluded from my group of friends.

To be honest, I know people don't read in my mind and when they don't notice that I'm feeling awkward and lonely, I think that they don't like me anymore so I go in my corner, pretending that I'm ok because I don't want to be ashamed to speak about my sadness and I don't want to make them worry for me.

I don't have a really good opinion of myself, and when I do this, I see myself as a ""drama queen"", who is desperate for attention... And that's true... So it make me feel even bad to think of me that way !

This is my first time ever using Reddit so I’m not sure how it all works yet, so go easy on me please! 

I had a pretty hard childhood and I thought I’d share some of my experiences. 

I was ten years old when my mom had a complete mental breakdown, and I was there to witness the whole thing. My life changed forever on that day. It took years before she got a diagnosis (paranoid schizophrenic) and even after that, she still didn’t believe she was actually sick. I got taken out of my mom’s home and placed in my grandma’s home, whose wife is bi-polar. So moving from schizophrenia to bi-polar was not much of a relief for me at all. I spent four years living with my two grandmas while my mom suffered through the worst of her illness. She was sent to group homes, and hospitalized, and the male attention she was attracting was getting dangerous. It wasn’t until I was about 17 that my mom got stable on medication and came to terms with her illness. 

To top all of that off, my parents divorced when I was just a baby because my father has been addicted to meth since he was in high school and my mom couldn’t stick around and watch him screw up my life. My father has been in and out of jail my entire childhood and I can just about count on one hand how many times I’ve seen him in my life. 

It was a very traumatic childhood. 

If you’re interested in reading more about my life with all of that craziness and how I survived, I recently started a blog called Distressed and Distracted. Growing up, I never met anyone else who had a life like mine and I have felt so alone in the world for years. Now that I’m an adult, I wanted to share my story and hopefully help and connect with other people who have had a rough go at it too.

205,"First off- i am not self diagnosing OR asking for a diagnosis. My mom has been blocking me from getting a therapist but i’m finally getting one in a few weeks 

I have researched the symptoms of bpd and i have nearly every single one. There is definitely something wrong with me. I obsess, have what i call an episode at least twice a day, every day is agonizing. During these episodes i block my ears and close my eyes and if someone tries to talk to me i will lash out at them. i get so frustrated and i feel that frustration so intensely i cant cope with it. that’s just one thing. 

the problem: my mom thinks i am perfectly fine. which makes no fucking sense because she hears me sobbing incessantly every day and i’ve lashed out at her multiple times when i’m in an episode. I need help so bad but even after i get a therapist i know she’s going to be in denial if my therapist says i have any kind of mental illness. i really think i need medication if i can’t find coping mechanisms that work. i really really need help i don’t know how much longer i can keep living like this. I’ve told her that i have panic attacks daily and she says it’s nervousness. she tells me it’s because i eat bad and don’t sleep enough. she says that’s what the therapist will tell me. she keeps enforcing the idea that the therapy will be very temporary and fleeting because i won’t need it after a few sessions. that scares me so much. I feel so disconnected. 

so the main idea is I have been scrambling to find support by figuring out what is causing me to be like this and i really do think i’m borderline. but i really need to discuss it with a professional, luckily i’m getting that help soon, but my mom will deny any sort of diagnosis or screening.

I don’t think I used to be that bad at handling anxiety or stress in the past and I wonder how I did it.  I've always been a nervous person but now it's getting out of hands because I have more responsibilities and I can't let go of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

It probably going to sound completely ridiculous but I’ve been obsessed for weeks about mistakes I’ve made while doing my taxes this year. It was my first time doing taxes and in another country and I’m completely panicking and it overwhelms me even if I’m trying to fix those things. I feel so stupid. I'm paranoid about being prosecuted, having to go to jail, paying massive penalties, not being able to afford a lawyer if I had to… Sometimes, my rational self is telling me that I’m exaggerating but that voice is getting more and more silent and I can't seem to believe in a positive outcome to those troubles. Lately I’m finding it really hard to sleep, eat, to not cry, and I can’t focus on spending time with my family or doing something because it’s all I can think about.  

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been through some posts on Reddit trying to find tips on how to deal with these feelings and meditating seems to come up a lot but it's not easy. I tried it last year when I wasn’t feeling that badly but I don’t think it’s working anymore. I have a really hard time focusing on my breathing only. There are always thoughts interrupting me and prompting me to do something crazy like writing tons of drafts of letters or rehearsing conversations in my head imagining circumstances where I have to explain myself for those mistakes I’ve made.

On top of it, 2020 has been absolutely shit. I finished my studies, which was a relief, but finding a job is tough because I don’t have enough experience and borders are pretty much closed, so there aren’t really opportunities in my field whether abroad or here. I have very few friends and none where I live. We speak a bit once every few weeks and most of the time, that’s fine by me because I kinda like loneliness sometimes, but then I feel like a hypocrite when I wish I had friends to talk to. Friends that I can be myself with but I’m terrible at connecting with people. Same goes for relationships because I'm bad at dating and inexperienced and it's a bit of a shame at 25 years old. 

I feel like the most ungrateful person saying all that because I know there are people in worse situations who can’t pay their bills, who are ill, who are hungry and without a roof over their head…  I know I should try harder to feel happier.

211,"I (14M) have violent and lustful fantasies all the time, they aren't unusually gross or like BDSM but they're immoral and violent, I'm repulsed and ashamed by them but they're more intriguing than normal fantasies. I know everyone has this but mine are seriously fucked up, I would be instantly disowned by everyone I know if they knew what I think about. I torture insects, like holding a lighter under a taped-over glass with a spider in whenever I've caught one, to watch it panic and struggle, I used to collect dead wasps, I tried to kill some geese today with a hunting slingshot (failed), I laugh in bad situations, not in like a ""oh it's all I can do. I'll try to make light of it. It's a coping mechanism"", it's none of that shit, it's a menacing laugh, like when my friend died of cancer at 13 I thought it was a shame but I didn't cry and I just got on with my day, and when I saw everyone else in tears I started smiling and had to stop myself from laughing, I tried to hide it but someone pointed it out and everyone looked at me spitefully as if I'd just murdered a baby. Whenever my mum is in tears because she's worried about my mental health I start laughing. Whenever my mum accidentally hurts herself I laugh at her (like I do find it funny) while my step sister asks if she's ok. I don't think I'm a sociopath, I figure that at sociopaths tend to be stupid, arrogant, and egotistical, and I can admit when I'm at fault, plus I hate bullying and manipulation, I don't manipulate because I haven't had any need to, but if someone is manipulated cleverly I admire it and if something terrible happens in my life I'll also admire it and find it funny, because it's like something ""good in quality"" that would happen in a movie or smth, that's the best way I can word it. I have a lot of destructive hobbies like spend a lot of my time burning stuff and I'm slowly building an arsenal of weapons (so far I have: lighters and deodorant, a compound bow, a hunting slingshot, a hunting knife, a baseball bat, a maglite torch, an axe and I think that's it so far, I plan on getting a refillable lighter and today as I was playing round with a spiked pole I got the idea of getting/making a spear). I find gore satisfying, I watch loads of videos of people dying (again I know that's fairly normal), sometimes when I see someone I imagine them being hoisted up by a noose or me shooting them with a shotgun (but not so much anymore), at one point I had violent fantasies about classmates (which, again, aren't so common anymore) see my first post for more info, also I know I'll never do a school shooting or someone similar because it's pathetic and unoriginal, if I was going to kill someone I'd have to make it memorable and fucked up, but I'd never do that because of prison and my family would despise me and it'd fuck them up mentally.

Is it normal to create false realties of real events ??? its affecting my life how do I even control this?

213,"I am extremely delusional and I am getting cabin fever. I stay in my house all day and barely leave the house because I have an abnormal fear/phobia of women. I know that might sound like a pussy thing to say but this phobia is serious and it causes panic attacks because I am so insecure because I fear as though women hate me and/or judge me the minute they see me because I am paranoid and overthink things. I get convinced that women they are saying things about me or know things about my life and who I am because I get weird psychotic delusions and think I can hear them saying my name and insulting me which I know sounds psychotic now but in the moment in feels so real. I can't leave the house unless I have a friend with me so I can talk to them and look at them to black out the women that are around even though I know they doing wrong but the paranoia feels real at the time. And I put myself down not matter how hard I try not to, I truly think and believe that if I am in the same room as a group of girls that I am automatically committing some sort of unspoken crime and bothering them and want to run away and cry because of how nervous and scared I feel when I am around them which causes me more depression and self doubt. But I know it isn't womens' fault. My cabin fever from not going out much is causing me to hallucinate and have really intense nightmares about random things like digging up graves and making deals with the devil. I hallucinate and see things in my room like bloody hand prints on the fucking walls. And I don't want to take any more meds because they don't take away my phobia and they have nasty withdrawal symptoms whenever I get off them which caused a few failed attempts. And always stop working after a while and always make me worse off than before when I get off them. I've had this phobia for a long time but no one took it seriously they only took my psychosis seriously and put me on antipsychotics even though I only had mild psychosis at first but my antipsychotics and antidepressants have actually caused symptoms of more mental health problems like symptoms of schizophrenia, imposter syndrome and manic episodes whenever my meds are changed, upped or reduced. My antipsychotics are actually the cause of my depression which made me need antidepressants. I know this because I got symptoms of severe depression shortly after I started taking antipsychotics. And then my antidepressants made me have extreme psychotic episodes which where never this bad before. I've also had slight sadism but was never an issue at first because I was never a violent person in general but when I mixed weed with sertraline it made me very hostile. Like 1 time after smoking some weed on sertraline. I found a key to a guy's room that I lived, with, put a knife up to his throat in his sleep because I was so sick of him bullying me and terrorising the shit out of me and always stealing my possessions! And I was going to kill him but then decided not to because I feared the consequences of prison. Like this is fucked up and out of order what these meds have done to me, I had mild psychosis, very mild autism, slight sadism which I was told wasn't an issue. But this fear of women which makes me feel pathetic and worthless. Now I have a fuck ton of issues caused by these meds. And now I am infuriated because I now hear whispers pretty much every night when I'm alone in my own house. I've never hallucinated like this before nor was I this delusional to the point where I'm so susceptible to everything on the internet. It's been 6 years on meds and all's they have done is cause more problems. All this time I've been on these fucking meds and I've been on meds causing me more. They've made my weight go up and down from obese to anorexic even though my appetite is through the roof all the time. Whenever my meds have changed in way my testosterone has fucked up and gone from dangerously high to dangerously to dangerously low and then back to high to and back low again. And never a healthy level. I have stretch marks all over my body from how quickly I have gained and lost weight. When I was younger I went to the gym a lot. When my antipsychotics were reduced and I gained a shit ton of muscle very quickly and people thought I was on steroids when I wasn't and I didn't no why that happened but I got stretch marks on my biceps and chest because my T levels were dangerously high and then my meds got increased and my T levels went too low again and I lost it all. I also got gynocomastia within the first few weeks of taking my first antipsychotic and I didn't even know what gynocomastia was I just thought it was thought chest fat unless I lost weight and it was still there. When I first started taking sertraline which was my first antidepressant I became impotent and I didn't know why. I thought my friend had spiked my drink with chemical castration because I was so psychotic from mixing it with weed so I beat the shit out of him and practicaly scalped him by ripping all his hair out of his head in a in blind age while screaming at the top of my lungs ""you ruined my fucking life"" with no explanation. He had no idea no idea why I did. But then the next day one of his friends beat the shit out of me and knocked me out. I got off the sertraline because I was constantly throwing up when I was on it but then ""coincidentally"" my dick started working again when I got off the sertraline but I still had erectile disfunction. 6 years I've been on these fucking meds with disgusting vile side effects and didn't even know my meds were causing them and whenever I asked to get off them. They would say you have stop to them slowly and gradually but whenever I tried that, if I got a bit sad or cried because of my phobia of women which I was I too embarrassed to talk about with god knows how many different psychologists, psychiatrists, doctors, nurses etc. They would up my meds even when I told them straight IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MY MEDS BEING REDUCED they would just say but upping from will make you better again. But it wouldn't because no medication can magicly take away a phobia. So I had no choice but to stop cold turkey and go through a like a month of nasty ass withdrawal symptoms such as headaches, dizzines, light headedness, stomach pains, chest pains, diarrhea, throwing up, shakes, tremors, unable to talk properly. But then again ""coincidentally"" I was finally able to get it up properly but... I couldn't get it down or keep it down. I had to wank constantly because my libido was through the fucking roof. And then when the withdrawal symptoms stopped I got erectile disfunction again. This is disgusting what the meds have done to me. They have destroyed my mental health, destroyed my brain and fucked up my hormones for life. I am more psychotic than ever, more depressed than ever, more anxious than ever to the point where my psychotic paranoia is mixing with my phobia and I am so susceptible to the internet that I literally believed that it was acceptable to be misogynistic and the right thing to do because I believed people on the internet like incels and MGTOW out of delusional thinking and I think there might be an embarrassing video of me on the internet that the police recorded after I broke into my neighbor's flat who has worse autism than me and demanded that he gives me one of the knives out of his kitchen so I can self harm with it and scared him to the point where he was crying in fear of me and he had to grab me and physically remove me from his flat and call the police. And I actually told the police to post the video. Even after they said about not wanting to post my private stuff that I told them online because I was in so much of a fucked up state mentally that I forgot about the racist shit I said about Christians and the homophobic shit I said (which was internalised anger from people calling me gay in the past) and the sexist, shit and didn't even know it was sexist and the stuff I told them. I was only beeing sexist because I was in a so much of a fucked up state and I 100% believed it was not sexist and that is was true because I was a in a fucked up state and I was believing my phobia was real and women were really evil and saying this fucked up shit. I then started calling my whole generation out (Gen Z) for being sex depraved and slutty for having different morals about sex than me and for letting the music and the media get to their head and manipulate them into getting sluttier and dumber when I'm here allowing incels and MGTOW to fucking manipulate me. I'm not using it as an excuse, I am just explaining myself in a truthful honest manner which is what my first r/guilt post was about. And I also then for some fucking reason and another fucking delusion think I have the fucking audacity to be going on r/sexism and talking about stuff I quite clearly know fuck all about in this state. I may have been in a bad mental state but that doesn't mean I shouldn't feel bad for what I did and said. This is a follow up to the first post the on the r/guilt subreddit. And I wouldn't be surprised if I'm already on the fucking r/quityourbullshit call out subreddit or on r/inceltears already because of how fucked up the shit I was saying was on this whole site was. I even dmed a random fucking Redditor and told them about my suicide plan which didn't go according to plan. My life is ruined THANKS A FUCKING LOT MENTAL HEALTH!! And as I said I do not hate women in any way shape or form. I have a phobia of them that turned into something fucked up because I looked too deep into MGTOW red-pill to try to put myself off women and to try to learn how to cope with being forever alone and it made my situation worse and it fucking failed miserably and then for some fucking stupid reason I decided to snoop around r/incelswithouthate to fucking black-pill myself for some fucking stupid reason. And on top of all that I bullied a pedophile who was suicidal on r/guilt to make myself feel better for basically going from a dignified virgin to a fucking incel. And justifying it by saying ""well at least I'm not a sex offender like this nonce"" that is fucked up with mental issues or not that is fucked up. I'm fucked up and twisted in the head. I even called my own mother and told her that I wished she aborted me. My head maybe fucked but I'm evil, I'm literally evil and I am the sick one and I am the depraved one. I am a nasty peace of shit violent individual who is the lowest of the low. Maybe I should kill myself. What do you guys think?",30Dec2020,1

Anxiety basically incapacitates me, and my fears of rejection and failure are made of concrete.  I might be even more afraid of success(?).  And not to mention the certainty of contempt and pity.  In ADHD there's something called ""Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria"" - I check off every line of the description, although one psychiatrist told me ""Adults don't have ADHD"".

One major issue I have - **I cannot talk about it**.  Even out loud to myself. Causes a panic attack and emotional breakdown, just like writing this is doing.  (I guess I need an email or chat therapist?)

I cannot emphasize this range of fears enough.

220,"The title says it pretty well honestly, but I still want to go into a little more detail. I haven’t actually ate for like 4 days now. Like, I have, a little, but I puked it back up not even 10 minutes later. 

But it started 4 days ago, and at first I didn’t worry, bc sometimes I do just go a day without eating. It was a little weird, bc normally I just never feel hungry but I blew it off. 

The second day I felt like I was starving, so I made some chicken nuggets, and the whole time I was hungry, but when I was taking them out of the oven I felt completely full. But I ate them bc I knew I needed to and I didn’t want them to go to waste. I puked them up not even 10 minutes later. And I didn’t eat for the rest of the night

And then on the third day (so yesterday) my mom made my favourite meal, and I was really excited, but the same thing happened. And I felt horrible bc my mom took all that time and then I just didn’t eat it. I mean, I did, a little bit, and then I puked it up. But I just told my mom my stomach was hurting and that was it. She took my temperature and I was fine so she told me to not worry about it and just take some medicine. So I did. But my stomach wasn’t even hurting anyway. 

But today, once again I made chicken nuggets (I love chicken nuggets if you can’t tell) but I ate a few to see how it would go down and the first few stayed down, so I made the rest. And then like 10 minutes later I puked them up. So I had to throw out the other chicken nuggets bc I couldn’t eat them now. 

And you know, clearly I need to eat. It’s been like 4 days. I probably should’ve been weighing myself now that I think about it, but it is what it is. And I don’t have any idea why. And the only thing I can think of is it is a mental problem, bc physically I feel fine. I don’t feel hot or cold, I don’t have a temperature, I haven’t changed my diet, I haven’t gotten new medicine, I feel fine. So idk. Does anyone know what this could be? Or have any ideas?

221,"I know it is a huge cliche, student who procrastinates haha. Maybe that's why people don't take it seriously, maybe that's even why I didn't take it seriously. And maybe because in the end I usually got my stuff done. Even though I took twice as much time for my studies as the rest, there finally is an end in sight and I am writing my BA thesis. The problem is that my procrastination gets out of control.

We have four months and the deadline is on 02.02. But even though its supposed to be around 50-60 pages I didnt even start the first. I didnt even decide about the chapters. I did work on it, I had interviews done that I need and I transcripted them (even though not really well). I read through some literature. But I didnt even grasp the whole concept of the theory that is behind my methods. I half-heartedly started analysing the data but I am lost. I am not able to structure my work in any way. I am not able to think straight. And I am feeling more and more anxious about my thesis every day, which just makes me avoid it more because as soon as I start I realize how much is still ahead and I cant handle it and stop working on it. I am staring at the documents or the books and can physically feel my body resisting to work. Its like walking up the escalator in the wrong way.

I have been treated for Depression/Bipolar II (still up for discussion) and possibly ADHD for almost five years now. Have been working on my bachelor degree for four. I am honestly tired of whining about how I cant get anything done, the same time I am unable to change anything. My physician has a lot of smart ideas of how to beat procrastination, and I do as well, but also none of them work reliably and I think there is a big fat underlying issue I have to address.

I have a lot of mental health issues that create a few big hurtles in life. They're hurtles I've never really been able to get over. The biggest one is some pretty bad depression that stems from a bipolar II diagnosis, the others are some external factors that I didnt have control over.

Throughout my whole life, I've just kinda been dropped. No one has taught me anything about how to 1. Do adult things and 2. How to have a healthy enough mind to do said adult things.

These have really come to light in the last few years after I graduated high school. I dropped out of college and kinda flopped around like a fish out of water, and still am.

Everyone's pressuring me to move on, which dont get me wrong I get 110% but they're just going about it the wrong way.

When I tell them I need guidance they say I should just figure it out and do it anyway. I cant do that, im not at that stage yet. Trust me, I've tried. And its not like they're nice about it. They're downright mean, nasty, and demeaning about it.

I've tried therapy. I'm still going, but my therapist sucks. All of them have, its not like this is my first rodeo. I live in a pretty rural area so its the only office thats within a reasonable distance and its still a bit of a drive.

223,"I've dealt with this theme for quite a while, but it got worse after I found out (yesterday) that I have some lack of empathy. This absolutely crushed me because 1)this might mean some of my intrusive thoughts are not intrusive at all and very much true and 2)maybe I'm not a kind person after all.

This is making me analyze the shit out of so many situations and I've been discovering times when I helped people because I didn't want them to get upset, because other people would try to help and so I should do the same, because I felt like ""oh this is my obligation, I need to help them"" and even situations in which it was like ""ok so if I help them, they might start thinking higher of me"" (this happens mostly with the girl I love), instead of helping out because of plain and simple kindness. And now I feel like I have never helped anyone out of kindness (which is probably not true, but I can't even tell anymore). Bedsides, if I don't feel upset when I see someone crying on social media or in a movie I start thinking ""what the hell is wrong with me?"" and other things like that.
And lately, when I do something good, I just always tell myself ""see? you're a good/kind person!"" and I do good things to prove to myself that I am in fact kind, and not only out of compassion and love for others. 

This is making me so extremely sad because I always valued kindness so much, always felt like I was a kind person (_hell_, my favorite characters are usually the kind people), and now I feel like that's all gone. I feel like I'm only kind to feel good about myself or to look good to others, and I just feel really sad (and a little bit desperate).

I recently joined a writing prompt community. You write up a short little prompt and then others use that prompt to make a story. I always felt like I wrote good prompts but they were mostly ignored. I put a lot of time and thought into why things worked the way that it did in that scenario. Meanwhile there were people who could literally write two lines of a prompt and everyone cheered and praised them for it. It just got really frustrating and completely killed my motivation.

People where pissed off and I went away for the day because I didn’t want to be there and be in their way and had to get food. A friend came to visit and I told him about what I did and how people where reacting and calling me names and making mock, i was upset at that and at what an idiot I was. I was having problems with mental health after a really shitty break up and things happening back at home. I felt so out of the gorup and uncomfortable and spent a lot of time alone. I was told I was being horrible by spending time alone and not wanting to join in all the time and for being quite. I told my friend this too cause I just felt uncomfortable being there and so disappointed at what I did.

I still have so much guilt over what I did as one person in the gorup was really affected by it. I didn’t apologise better and make it up to the gorup, they had over heard me venting and weren’t happy I spent time with my visiting friend.

I know I was in the wrong and still have so much guilt at doing it and not making it right sooner.

Hi, I’m applying for a new work opportunity and one thing my supervisor has encouraged me to do is make note of certain instances when I’ve been witness to and/or involved with violent scenarios, and how I reacted/coped with whatever happened.  

I’ve made a list but won’t post it here in full here since it is quite graphic and might upset some people, but generally would these be considered normal (if unfortunate) situations or something my doctor might want to talk about in more depth?  

Mercy killings of critically wounded animals (I’ve killed a pigeon, a bat, rabbits - adult and kittens)  
Vehicle crash fatality (dog, happened less than 4 meters from where I was standing)  
Violent attack on stranger (witnessed someone getting kicked to the ground and threatened with a large knife)  

I’ve also been witness to several other less violent / more domestic situations like someone getting slapped and shoved, screamed at, that sort of thing. Over the course of several years and I’ve taken it in stride, sometimes I have nightmares of a certain theme (my own animals in busy street traffic, for example) but in the moments these incidents took place my adrenaline was normal and I didn’t suffer any anxiety or other difficulties that I remember.  

Note: I love animals and have never/would never hurt anyone or anything without good reason like self-defence or mercy like above. My thinking is that if I'm alright with what happened then it's fine? I've gotten unexpected reactions from family/friends about some of these which is making me wonder now, and possibly over-think it.

231,"I'm sure this gets asked all the time, but I would really appreciate any guidance at all. My brother has bipolar and substance abuse issues. He suffered a traumatic event yesterday. He has since tried to get help by calling 911 constant and attempting to check himself into the county mental institution, but they turned him away because he isn't suicidal. Is there a free phone or online counseling service that won't immediately tell him to call 911? Anything at all would help. Also, perhaps just an informative stranger through the AA program to listen on the phone. It's so upsetting that it is this hard to get someone real help when they are in crisis. Local mental health places are a phone loop telling people to call 911....",30Dec2020,1

233,"This is hard to explain to people but I’m so confused. Basically I’m having a hard time believing myself? What made me post this is I get really bad migraines and they’ve gotten progressively worse over the years, to the point that I’ve been taking excedrin most days out of the month. Christmas day it was so bad and I was in excruciating pain for most of the day, medicine wasn’t helping. Obviously this isn’t good for me, so I want to go to the doctor. 
But as soon as I finally made the decision to make an appointment today I started doubting myself? Thinking maybe my migraines aren’t even that bad and I’m just being dramatic? Even though when I’m going through it I tell myself I need to make an appointment immediately and I can’t live like this. 
These situations where I doubt myself over obvious things have happened before though and I have no idea why. It makes me feel crazy. Why am I doubting reality?? Am I literally losing my mind or am I rightfully calling myself out for just being dramatic? I feel insane because I don’t even know what to believe.

TLDR; i’m starting to have less empathy and not enough energy/motivation to respond to anyone, i get easily irritated at my friends texts, i feel less human. i was just happy last week. am i mentally unstable? do i need to see someone?",30Dec2020,1

My Dad left us his house and bills while he is with his Girlfriend. Haven't seen him in the 5 months I've been back. Mom passed away in October, and Christmas my Girlfriend broke up with me.

She made a remark that I didn't seem to be taking it too hard, but I am... I don't cry for anything. When mom passed I didn't, when I came home I didn't,  when Girlfriend broke up with me I didn't.

240,"Long story short the day before my scuicide attempt my Religion teacher was talking to us about sins. We ended up talking about scuicide. I asked my teacher Why she thinks scuicide is a ""sin"". She told me that only cowardly people take their lives bacause they are not ready for the ""judgment of god"". I find this very very sad. Ive been rescued from my scuicide attemp about 2 weeks ago and it is a very hard decision to make, and certainly its not cowardly. Its very hard leaving everyone behind and its even harder when someone calls you a voward because it makes you feel worse then you already do. The whole reason I tried to take my life was because of hate and feeling alone. No one wants to be judged on that. I recently spoke to my teacher again and I felt really sad that she still thought that if my attempt worked I would have gone to hell.

245,"A few years ago I had a nasty break up with my first partner and it was incredibly toxic to say the least. I had been going through some serious serious issues with my mental health and took it out on them. I was emotionally manipulative and just overall horrid to be around. Eventually I worked through it and my ex and I are good friends now. 

But sometimes I question if it is really possible that I have changed. I have been in a new relationship for about a year and have been very happy. My current partner says they have seen drastic improvements with me and that I am definitely a better person now. For some reason I am convinced that I have fooled myself and them that I’m different. I am hung up that yes even though I don’t do toxic things anymore and yes i’ve worked through my depression and anger issues that that person still exists inside me. That someday I could just lose control and go back to how I was.

I spoke to a wonderful volunteer called James. I said I didn't really know how it works and he just said ""It's simple, you talk and I listen"" he reassured me that they can't give advice. They won't tell you not to cut and they won't call the police unless they seriously need to, they also can't see your number. They can simply listen and offer an ear. I spoke calmly about my struggles and my life and he listened for like half an hour. I honestly nearly cried he was so reassuring and spent so long with me even though I wasn't in desperate need. I came away feeling a lot better and promised to call next time i feel like cutting.

I've never called a helpline before as I thought it would be very scripted but he just got me talking about family, my partner, my house and other things. Really got my mind out of a bad place so honestly just give it a go. The worst that can happen is you feel no better

253,"Not sure if this is where this goes, but Imma ask anyway. 

I (17F) have had what might be auditory hallucinations since the end of my eleventh grade year. I’m not even sure if they are hallucinations even. It started out as simply hearing voices when I started to doze off as I fell asleep at my co-op while waiting for my mom to pick me up. That I just brushed off as me falling asleep and half dreaming. 

A few months after that I heard a voice from my phone one morning, I was putting it down to get up and I heard a distinct male voice saying “Fuck” or something along those lines. I, of course freaked out and went to my oldest sister (19F). I thought that someone had somehow hacked my phone and was watching me through it or something.  She went through my apps, deleted any odd ones and gave it back. And I pushed it to the back of my mind. 

A few months back, I had another episode, I was up way to late, (like 2 AM, which might have contributed to it) I put down my phone to finally sleep and this time I heard a woman’s voice saying “thank god, she’s finally going to sleep.” I didn’t mention this to anyone, and I forgot about it. 

Today, I came home, and went up to my room. As I entered I heard a very loud buzz, but as if someone was making a buzzing sound (and doing it badly) it only lasted a second. But it freaked the fuck out of me. I called for my family, but they didn’t hear me, and that drove me to tears. I know I sound like a big baby, but I was alone in my room, scared shitless of a sound coming from my bed and noone could hear me in my mind. Plus I have been paranoid before that people have been watching me in my room, or stalking me. 

My family finally came in, and when I told them  what was going on, they just sort of, dismissed it. I mentioned that I had heard a buzzing sound, and they tried saying that it was raccoons in the ceiling (I knew it wasn’t, he scuttles not buzzes) or that it was the electrics, (I have barely any wiring in my room). I kept trying to explain that that wasn’t it, but they just kept ignoring me. 

I have given up, they were talking about how, I might have subconsciously heard something like the buzzing and am making the hallucinations up on my own. (But they make it sound as if I’m doing it on purpose) And I’m really starting to spiral. 

Basically, I’m asking if there might be something wrong with me. On past occasions, I’ve been tired, or nearly asleep and that can cause Auditory Hallucinations I’ve heard, but this last time, I was completely awake. My parents aren’t the most open to the idea of Mental illness and I wanted to get other opinions before I press the matter, Thanks.

I do understand how important it is to have loving, supportive friends, family, partners, relationships etc., but the fact is, YOU are the only person that wakes up in YOUR body and YOU are the only person that goes to sleep. 

These past 9 months of quarantine have been interesting, with lots of time for self awareness, solitude, to sit in myself and be with myself. I have learned a lot, I still struggle. I am healing &amp; I still hurt. I am getting comfortable with my identity, I still struggle with dysphoria. It is all apart of the life of being. The life that yes must have its downs, to know what the ups are. To know that the downs only last for a little while and then there we are, bouncing back up again. It takes time.

Sometimes I feel too secluded and wanting to chat with someone I used to talk to, or someone that has been removed from my life by God and the Universe that I want to check up on just because I feel lonely. We must be present with ourself in those moments and realize that **WE MUST NOT MOVE BACKWARDS BECAUSE WE ARE FEELING LONELY.** There are 1000's of people on the internet to chat with if needed, but realistically in those moments it might be best not to message anyone at all and just sit. 

I love speaking with people, I love conversing, I love communicating and experiencing different perspectives with like minded beings in other places in the world, but as well as I love my space and time for me; to paint, to journal, to meditate, to be outside, to play video games or just solely to sit.

Find whats right for you and focus on that. Connect with people that have unconditional love for you, if you are looking for people like that, go look, they are there and here. All around. I wish you a day of health, happiness and healing. **Together, Separately.**

266,"I've been feeling a lot of overwhelming emotions since Christmas Eve. It felt like time stopped and I've been reliving the same day over and over, except all my feelings were heightened with each passing day. Everything is intensified, and it could very well be PMS, but my mind has gone into overdrive on negative, looping thoughts.

At this time of the year, especially after surviving such a horrific year all around, it's hard not to reflect back on all of the things that have happened. Given that the majority of things that happened to me were negative (losing my job and having to move back in with my parents at 28, hence losing my independence; failed relationships at an all time high; not being able to do anything with my life and feeling like a burden and a failure at once), it's also hard not to take these things to heart and dwell on them.

Yes, I've passed my board exam to get certified, AND finished my thesis to get my Master's degree, but aside from that, the only thing going for me is being able to focus on my health and fitness.

In saying that, I realize how much more privilege I have than many people in the world, and cue the guilt.

On top of everythinf I need to process, I get the added guilt of not feeling thankful all the time for what I have (health and family), which then pushes me to suppress all those negative thoughts and feelings because I don't want to be any more of a burden on anyone by expressing them, 'cause ""many people have it worse, you should be thankful"".

I was authentic and honest. I was free on the internet. Free to fuck up and restart. Free to explore. Free to express myself. Free to try stuff out. In my case it was better than real life

These days I'm starting to feel actual hate towards the internet. What is this shit? I'm just mindlessly scrolling through reddit, Facebook, Instagram and Youtube. I'm lucky if I can get myself to mindlessly play some boring game. There are still moments where I have fun, but they are rare. Maybe an hour from 11 hours doing mindless shit was actually enjoyable.

Everything seems fake. Polished. Copied. Everyone wants clicks. Everyone wants to get famous for the most basic crap. Everyone wants to be positive. Anonymity? Oh please. Instagram pretty much automatically connects you with all your ""friends"". How? No idea! Clickbait everywhere. The same memes Everywhere. Everything is predictable. It's like some shallow simulation. At least there are some trainwreck influencers!

IM PAYING YOU GUYS SO MUCH MONEY PKEASE FIX ME?? my entire groin went numb the other day for HOURS and they still won’t look into it. i’m suffering so much and they think everything is psychological. i can’t stand being written off as crazy by every medical professional i’ve ever seen.,30Dec2020,1
271,"I have spent the last few years with with bad record for mental health. I've tried to play it down compared to how I actually feel and to reasonable effect (probably not a great coping mechanism but I get by). Some of my symptoms I assumed were mine and mine alone. That was until last week when I got fairly drunk and tried to explain what one of these symptoms was to my partner. I started to tell her and before I could finish she shouted ""brain zaps!"" . I was very confused. She explained what it was and I read up on it. I swear I thought she was just taking the piss out of me! Turns out she knows more about what's happening with my head than I do. Man, sometimes if I don't laugh at shit, I'd be in trouble. Anyone else got some story like this?",30Dec2020,1
