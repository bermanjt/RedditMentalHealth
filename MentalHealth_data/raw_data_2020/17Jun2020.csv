I have been supporting others mental health my whole life but never my own I feel like I am a failure because of my grades, whenever i try to talk to someone other than my therapist i always get shut down because they say  ""that I look to happy all the time to have mental health problems"" all I do is help others but i am slowly going crazy in the head and need some advice from Reddit I know you might think I am saying this for attention but i am not please someone tell me how to help myself before I try again",17Jun2020,1
1,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons

I just don't know. My depression has returned after about a year of improvement. It just really sucks. I feel incredibly lonely and am so full of self-hatred. I don't enjoy any aspect of being alive. I just want to be done with it. The only reason I never did it before was because I didn't want to hurt my friends or family. But I feel like nobody really cares anyway. Nobody ever checks on me. If I don't reach out, it can go months without receiving a single text or call from anyone unless they want something. Last year I didn't even talk to my parents for around 4 months straight. I just feel worthless and incapable of living the life I dream about living. I'm so tired of this routine and working a job I hate just to barely scrape by. I graduated college but can't do anything in my field until I go back and get my Master's degree. I am so bad in social situations that I'm afraid of any job where I have to interact with people. For this same reason, I've never had any kind of meaningful relationship. I've only come semi close once but it ended up being very toxic and only worsened my depression. I just feel so tired of it all. I don't know what I'm doing and just want to die. I'm probably going to hang myself in the coming weeks.",17Jun2020,1

3,"Ok first off, I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder in 2017 and I was given meds, mom thought using unnatural medicine was wrong, she took me off it (i was on lexapro and seroquel), I was put on seroquel in the psych ward when I wanted help and told my counselor I was suicidal and had homicidal ideations. My family guilt tripped me about it, it made me feel bad now I keep completely to myself. But anyways, anxiety, I keep having panic/anxiety attacks almost daily, I’m lucky some days and don’t have any, but I don’t know what triggers them or why they happen, it’s just all of a sudden my hearts beating fast, I can’t breathe and I feel like I’m burning up and start hyperventilating and crying. I can’t figure out why they happen or what caused them but I need helping getting them to stop. How do I find the trigger of them?

Second, I keep, I’d say blacking out for hours on end and I come back a few hours later and I don’t remember what I was doing or where I was and it freaks me out cause last week it happened again and my mom asked me what I was doing in my room cause I was making loud noises and she said she checked in on me and I was sitting at my desk listening to music, and I don’t remember any of it, and my mom told me she was sure I wasn’t asleep and my friend made the joke of being possessed and that made me paranoid and now I’m paranoid rn and idk what it is, idk how to stop it, I don’t want to self diagnose so once quarantine is over and I go to my therapist I’ll talk to her about it but I just need to know why this happens and what it is. Thank you if you read this, I’m struggling and I need help, thank you.",17Jun2020,1
4,"Hi, I'm not sure how it ended up getting so bad that I need to ask for help but here it is. 

I'm a stable, loved and cared for guy with a great gf, great friends, good job and whatever else you might imagine that you'd tag a smile on. I was abused/tortured by my dad as a kid but that's it and lately this is getting to me.

Suicidal thoughts have been with me since as early as I was 5 or so I kind of grew up with them and never really took them seriously cause I just thought everyone has them. Recently I've had them everyday and there is absolutely no reason to have them in my situation. I presume I misunderstood the whole idea of being mentally healthy and that a good adult life doesn't necessarily mean that you are happy.

Should I see someone or talk about it? Or maybe I am just paranoid and it's totally normal?",17Jun2020,1

6,"Mental health

I am 17 years old and I need to talk to somebody who will understand me as a boy and not talk all of this crap about mental health and say we are here for you etc. I just want to be happy and make sure that I have a good life.

7,"I’ve been smoking weed for a few years, and I’d say for the past 2 years or so, I’d smoke weed every night, all night until like 2 am. I’ve been on cipralex for about 3 years for anxiety, but it’s destroyed my libido. So my doctor added Wellbutrin to help in that department. It didn’t do nearly enough. I was smoking weed to help boost my libido and my appetite, as without cannabis, they are pretty much at zero. My doctor decided to try and taper me off the cipraex, to see if that worked. I was on 10mg, and I went to 5mg, which I’ve been on for about 2 weeks. Everything’s been going smoothly, until the other night. I smoked my regular weed, masturbated, and after I was done, I started feeling weird, and ended up having the worst panic attack of my life. My speech was all fucked up, I was slurring my words, couldn’t form sentences, was shaking, I thought I was having a stroke. Ended up calling an ambulance, and the paramedic said it was a panic attack. So now, I’m wondering if it’s the weed. I’ve been smoking the same amount and the same kind for a while now, so it’s weird it just hit me now. But now, I’m too nervous to touch cannabis, and I also would like to take a small break. But I’ve grown to be very dependant on weed. I have OCD, and weed was part of my night time ritual. Now that I don’t have it, I feel...empty, bored, hopeless, and depressed. I’m so used to smoking, and doing the same things every night. Now I don’t know what to do. Everything is boring again. I have no energy, and my depression is the worst it’s ever been. I’ve been almost at the brink of wanting to self harm. The only thought which brings me peace is suicide. That thought scares me, as I pretty much have nothing to live for. I know I have a hobby and stuff, but my depression has made everything just...meh. Weed helped boost that, and now, I have nothing. What the fuck am I supposed to do now?",17Jun2020,1
8,"Hello! So I have a problem that I feel has been blooming for a number of years now. I have no genuine empathy or compassion. I can feel pity and obsession, which I have mistaken for the former two numerous times, but I cannot feel (or even fake) compassion most of the time. It pains me to say the phrase “I love you” to the point where I ended a relationship over it, since I could not tell my s/o that I love them. I can, however, feel compassion towards animals, babies, and elders. It’s strange. I genuinely cannot wrap my head around this. I wonder if it has something to do with human instincts and finding those groups to be cute or something. My guess for this issue is that my grandparents showered me in so much love that I became over saturated and numb to it. My family does tend to throw the phrase around a little more than the average family, my grandparents especially.

My other dilemma with empathy I feel is related to the compassion issue. When I was younger, my grandmother had anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, AND depression. She was VERY emotional because of this, and I took the blunt of it most of the time. I feel like her excessive sadness has not only been passed onto me (be it nature or nurture) but has also made me entirely numb to other people’s sadness. I will stand like a deer in headlights when someone starts to cry, my only thought being, “Damn. I hope they don’t cry on my shoulder, that would be nasty, haha.” I also have issues with feeling bad for current events because of this. If I see a news story about people dying or otherwise suffering, I feel... you guessed it.... Nothing! I realize this is absolutely despicable, and I find myself to be quite an awful person because of this, but I literally cannot help it. I WANT to change. I need to know how to help this. Is there any treatment available? I read that identifying the trauma is a big key issue, but I have no trauma. None. It’s not repressed- there is nothing TO repress. I’m literally just a person who’s spent way too much time in the clouds and can’t find a way out. I daydream quite a lot, as I am an artist and I enjoy thinking about my creations, so I feel like losing touch with reality so much has worsened my mental health. But I can’t help it. With the world crumbling around me, why wouldn’t I want to live in my little dream world?

I don’t necessarily need a diagnosis for this issue (though one would be appreciated) but rather a solution. If anyone has any suggestions for reconnecting with my emotions, I would appreciate it so much. Thanks.",17Jun2020,1
9,"I'm new to Reddit, this is my first post (reposted and rewritten). Please be gentle. It may even be prudent to say ""trigger warning""  even though I'm not going into details.
If I'm in the wrong place, please let me know.  I originally posted this in dating over 40, as I'm 42, but this really has more to do with mental health than dating. 

I'm seriously damaged sexually.  Multiple assault survivor.  Beginning At the age of 6 to the age of almost 8... when my best friend's dad got ahold off me... At 19 i was drugged by my boyfriend. At 22 i was beaten and stripped but not raped. With each event, my boundaries disappeared a little more. Promiscuity became the answer, can't rape the willing.

I'm the girl that dates the r/niceguys.  I've accidentally dated multiple pedophiles, multiple perverts, and many sweet losers. I seem to have no standards that i require anyone to live up to.  I spend all my time trying to make everyone else happy.  For years i was proud that my existence was justified by my willingness to please

I married a man that was excited by my promiscuity, and for 18 years we've been the best of friends and happily in an open marriage. We've always been perfect for each other. I'm a loyal, caring, loving, can cook, and am a decent provider (now that I've gone to school). He was a fantastic provider and encouraged me to go to school and get an education. 
Along the way, I ended up in an almost 5 year relationship with a man that I'm still in love with, despite it being over now for nearly 2 years, and the boyfriend not really being that good of a guy.  The chemistry was right, that's about all.  

That man, spent the entire time teaching me that who I've always been is actually ""broken"". He spent all this time showing me that while it doesn't have to be about sex, that sex can be extremely passionate, mutually gratifying, and enjoyable.  I've described him as ""the best vanilla ice cream anyone could ever have"".

Then, almost 2 years ago, when my husband retired for medical reasons and needed constant care, my boyfriend decided to end things. Said that he respected my husband too much to steal his wife, and dumped me even though there had been no talk of such things. 

Hubby and i rarely have sex, because of his health issues, but our marriage is still very open. I am welcome to have a boyfriend.

However, I no longer know who i am.  Promiscuity has always been a defining feature for me. My mindset change is affecting my marriage, and my search for a new boyfriend because I'm no longer am happy with no foreplay, no passion. 

Because now I'm educated, have a professional, respectable job in a small judgemental town, and spent the majority of 5 years being told to respect myself more i just don't want to be passed around anymore. I'm craving so much more that random, disconnect sex with no intimacy.

However, now, as i look for a new boyfriend, all my old habits and hunting grounds have stayed the same.  Tinder, POF, okcupid, all result in nothing but so called ""nice guys"" who, in the end, are looking for the Old Me.

I don't know where to go or what to look for to find another one that encourages me to respect myself, but will accept that my husband isn't going anywhere.

Maybe it's not possible?


Edit: i have started therapy with a therapist i have high hopes for, unfortunately, I've only had my first appointment with her. 

I'm a firm believer that therapy only helps those willing to help themselves... I just don't know where to start",17Jun2020,1
10,"*I am not trolling, I just don't know a lot of science about mental health.* 

Nickocado Avocado is a mukbang Youtuber. A mukbang is a South Korean trend that started in 2010 and it is where people record themselves eating ungodly amounts of calories. 

**I have seen videos about Nickocado Avocado**

* Abusing fellow mukbanger (Stephanie Soo)
* Verbally and physically abusing his husband (or ex-husband. They keep splitting up and getting back together so it could change when this post is posted.). Nick's husband is Orlin. When Orlin fights back, Nick acts like the victim. Nick puts the blame on Orlin.
* Mental breakdowns (he said he liked the attention)

Nickocado also says that he thinks junk food rots his mind and attitude. Is that true?

11," Goddammit, I can't believe I'm actually considering letting go of something that used to make me so happy. I've been taking dance classes for almost ten years, but I've been taking a break for several months now because I can't handle how anxious it's been making me. My body image issues go beyond just thinking I look ""fat"" (although that is part of the problem as I am currently recovering from an eating disorder). I literally am repulsed by my body, especially anything ""sexual"" such as my boobs or any ""womanly"" curves. I can usually manage my issues if I wear SUPER baggy clothes and avoid mirrors; however I can not do this in dance class. I spent my last few dance classes just trying to hide that I was having an anxiety attack. I managed to keep myself from crying and hyperventilating until I was able to get to the privacy bathroom, but I'm scared I won't be able to do that every time.

I really want to go back to dancing, but it's torture for me to have to wear a form fitting dress and look at myself in the mirror for an entire hour every week. I also don't know what to tell my teacher. I am not comfortable sharing my real reason for quitting, but on the other hand I have known her for almost half my life, and I don't want her to think I've lost interest if I don't come back because that's not the case at all.

Any advice on this situation would be greatly appreciated",17Jun2020,1
12,"If you consider nightmares as a horror genre I would say my dreams are more of the thriller variety. I’m still creeped out and sometimes a little scared by them. But they aren’t horrifying like my nightmares were when I was a kid. For example, had a dream where I bought a new face from a guy and didn’t have the money to pay. So I ran and he chased me and tried to get the $400 I owed him. I only had $60 so he said he would be back. Then in my dream I went home, and the front door was being knocked on rather hard, I ran upstairs to grab my gun. And loaded it, screamed into the void “identify yourself” but the void revealed two shadowy figures. I couldn’t pull the trigger, as they came closer it was revealed to be my brothers with creepy smiles on their faces. I woke up after they revealed their faces. I have continued to have weird dreams like this that put me on edge. I wake up in a weird mood too. Could this mean anything since it started out of nowhere.",17Jun2020,1
13,"Like many, for me this year has been a turbulent time for my own mental health. I have come to the decision to go actively come off all types of social media and have messaged the important people in my life how they can contact me for the foreseeable future.

I have found social media beneficial to keep in touch with people and get back in touch with people I haven’t spoke to in years due to lockdown but feel this is the right time to reflect on myself and how I can move forward in the future.

I was the happiest outgoing kid but yet sometimes something would come over me and Id push everyone away and get depressed. Eventually it all hit at once and the past 2 years of my life have been the worst, I was the complete opposite of who I was and no one seemed to care. I haven't even been to school or talked to people I knew for years in 2 years and everyone I meet I assume is gonna hate me so I dont give them any chance. However!! I think Im finally coming out of it and just living my life as its short and doing the things I enjoy with people I can be comfortable with and trying to let new people in. Having no one was really hard because everyone loves you at your best yet wants nothing to do with you at your worst because they dont want to deal with that negativity and maybe thats just how life goes. If anyone wants to talk about stuff or even just wants a new friend to get their minds off things I'm always here and open to everyone I'm a very non-judgemental person. Mental health is a very common thing and yet so hard to see so don't think its not normal or be discouraged. For a long time I thought I was weird or didnt belong here just because I struggled with mental health and self esteem but trust me thats not the case. Its also normal to not want to or know how to speak about things which is fine aswell just know things get better lads and the right people and things to make you realise that are out there for u!!

21,"I’ll start with a little bit of background information;

For the past 3 or so years I’ve dealt with very intense and abrupt mood swings, a growing fear that people can hear my thoughts and are watching me (this started about 7-8 years ago, it first developed when I had a fear over it and it’s spiraled into paranoia? I’m not sure if my fear would be classified as paranoia, I don’t want to be insensitive towards people that deal with actual paranoia), as well as an unhealthy amount of thinking (and crying/getting angry) about a traumatic experience I had almost five years ago. 

Less severe symptoms would include a lack of interest/motivation to do things I used to be so passionate about, lacking an emotional response to what people tell me (which happens quite often but not all the time, I don’t understand why sometimes my emotions are so intense, and other times I feel nothing at all), and me involuntarily acting like a little kid when I get really angry/sad/stressed. I try to hide the little kid one when I’m in public tho, I don’t want to be a freak. 

And now back to my original question; Am I deserving of psychiatric help? I want to see a psychiatrist because every time I have a mood swing that makes me sad, it’s always overwhelming and I feel so desperate for help, but whenever my mood switches back to being content, I feel so stupid for even thinking I need or deserve help. I’m not sure if I should see a psychiatrist or not, I’d appreciate some outside opinions.",17Jun2020,1
22,"Sup everyone.

So my buddy who Ive been living with for a few years now seems to have some sort of tick/cumpulsion. 

It started a few years back when it looked like he ate something sour all of a sudden. His eyes would kind of flutter and then close and he would stammer for a second or two before continuing as normal. 

Fast forward a few months and he would start making this snorting kind of noise every few minutes or so, replacing that stammer/flutter I mentioned above. That snorting noise (although still there) for the most part has graduated to a gulping/grunt sound, usually in rapid succession. It seems compulsive and random, but I've never wanted to bring it up in fear of not conveying my concern correctly or making him feel self conscious about something he might not be able to control. Whatever this is seems to be developing and changing over time. Should I mention something and talk to him about it or just continue to look completely past it as if it isn't happening? He has a girlfriend who I live with as well whom I assume notices everything I do, but everyone acts as if nothings happening as far as I can tell. Should I approach her about it? Maybe it's just not my place?

Any advice appreciated. Thanks.",17Jun2020,1

Okay, first thing first, I've been talking with a friend and half-jokingly said about how I really, really think that I won't live past 30, nothing like I have concrete plans to end it right then and there, it's just that I'm constantly tired, I already think the age I've reached (24NB) is pretty good as it is. And the prospect of living a long, constantly exhausted life just doesn't seem all that enticing.

Once again, there are no serious plans on ending my life before I reach the 30s, this is all me just being plain and honest, I don't see myself living much further past that age because honestly I just haven't planned much for it. The problem comes that after saying that, I had a small realization for myself.

I kinda don't wanna celebrate birthdays anymore. I just don't feel like it's a celebration cause for me, they don't cause me any stress and I'm happy to see my family whenever my birthday comes around, but I just don't feel happy pretending that it's been yet another happy year and that this one will be better.

It hasn't been happy, and it hasn't been much better, not for a long time anyways. I just don't know how to approach this new feeling? Should I talk about it with my family? Close friends first? I just need something so this stupid thing doesn't eat me inside the moment my 25th is approaching.

26,"I'm a 50-ish male who has held various high-level engineering positions in the tech industry. Unfortunately a combination of life events and over-work led to stress, anxiety, panic attacks and finally exhaustion, I suppose what could be described as burnout, in 2017.

I sat in a Starbucks one lunchtime and decided I'd had enough and needed a career change. I started training to be a counsellor (psychotherapist) - I've still got a couple of years to go before I'm fully qualified. And here's my problem; Money is running a bit low at the moment, and I've been approached by a headhunter about a well paid opportunity in a tech company. The usual high-level position with loads of responsibility.

Taking the position would mean giving up on the counselling course, as I doubt I'll be able to take time off to pursue it. And my wife would be delighted with all that money coming into the house. But, I can't think clearly enough to make the right decision here.

I'm terrified that taking a position like that would be a major setback for my mental health. But I'm tempted by the money.... if I could hold it down for a year even it'd be a nice amount of cash.

this ex frequently called my friends and i sluts, would shame us for body counts and dressing in any way other that completely modest. i’d have to approve outfits if i was going out, id have to tell him who i was with, where and why, and there’d be a multitude of conditions. 
i’m not saying this makes what happened excuseable, but i think this is what led me to do something so out of the ordinary. 
i drank copious amounts that night with my friends, to the point i remember very little of the night. 
i woke up the next morning in a strangers bed, still in my pants but in a t shirt that wasn’t mine. i didn’t feel like i’d had sex, but i was terrified none the less. i felt overwhelming fear, and horrific amounts of guilt. i immediately left and have never contacted this person again. 
i don’t believe i’m the type to do anything of the sort, however my drinking when i was with this person would get out of control the few times i was given permission to do so. 

I’m in a loving and happy relationship now, and i don’t even look at anyone else, but i can’t help but have anxiety over this situation, am i a horrible person and is this relationship doomed to fail? i couldn’t bare to hurt this person, and i don’t think i will, but sometimes late at night these thoughts keep me up and i spiral. 

thank you in advance",17Jun2020,1
28,"I don't know what to do anymore. I am 19 years old, I was first diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 15 or 16. I went to counseling and got on meds. I moved away for school last year and was the happiest I have ever been in my life; I was finally in control of my brain and kicking all of my worst mental habits. Life was fantastic and the future looked even better. I was completely off my meds by March and I was so proud of myself and my progress.

Then everything happened. With COVID-19, I had to move back home and I have been here now for 3 months. I miss my friends, I miss my life, I miss my city, and I miss my happiness. I am back to square one with my depression and anxiety, but this time it seems so much worse because there are actual tangible things in the world to be upset and sad and distressed and scared about on top of my regular brain things. Being back in this depression is my worst nightmare. I find myself just constantly wishing I didn't have to exist right now. Existing is painful. I'm so lost. I just had to get this out.",17Jun2020,1
29,"i've been feeling like this for about 3-4 days, and it's gotten bad enough to where im starting to feel kind of insane.

before this started i was just living my normal, boring quarantine life. i was talking to friends on discord, playing minecraft, drawing, browsing twitter, and watching youtube.

i ended up doing this on a daily basis, which seems unhealthy. i dont know if it is, but that's my guess.

one time, i was in the bathroom on my phone. and then my mind put this question in my head, ""what the hell are you doing with your life?"" i stopped doing what i was doing and sat there, on the toilet with a blank stare on my face. i was like this for about six minutes.

i got up, and went back to my room. i tried shrugging it off. it worked, kind of. i felt this again the next day. 

later that same day, my mother and her boyfriend got me dinner. it was my usual order from taco bell. three meat and cheese burritos, and two cheese rollups. i could only eat two burritos. normally i would eat the whole thing. but this time i couldn't.

my mind felt empty and numb. i felt like crying, but i couldn't. i even felt like collapsing, but i didn't.

i don't know what emotion i feel. i understand people have routines and habits. this doesn't feel like that though. it feels like a cycle. i don't want to do it, but my body has gotten so used to it that when i try and do something else, i stop after only 15 minutes.

i want to do something else. i always think stuff like, ""oh, i forgot, i really want to do this"" and ""i want to do that, it'll be fun."" but it never happens

i feel like i can't even control my own body. like, it's gotten so used to my daily habits and has developed a mind of its own based on that.

i want out.

i want to be free.",17Jun2020,1

I realized how miserable my life has been since the quarantine began, I have no way of sustaining the expenses of having a disorder. I know that my disorder is real because there are days when it is very obvious. I don't look like I perceive myself in the mirror, I know, but sometimes it is very difficult to differentiate what is real from what is not. That girl is so fat and horrible, but I can't stop eating, I don't want to stop doing it. I have broken the scale and cannot measure my waist again.

31,"Hey Reddit, 

My best friend in the world (also my only friend in the world) has fallen into a sort of... depression/body dysmorphia.  She hates her body but I love it, shes perfectly healthy... possibly underweight already even. (shes really skinny and smoll) Yesterday, she posted something on her snapchat story along the lines of ""why cant I be happy with my body? Why am I so stupid? Why am I not society's definition of beauty?"" 

When I asked her what was wrong, she wouldn't tell me so I had one of her other friends (one that shes never met irl, an online friend) talk to her. She told him everything easily while i barely got a &gt;!damn!&lt; answer out of her. 

Sometimes I feel like I'm not a real friend to her. Like I'm dirt to her. My own anxiety has been going up because of this Corona thing, etc.  I feel like she doesn't even like me, like im just a burden to her that she doesn't care abt. 

I asked her again today ""whats wrong, plz tell me"" and she told me ""popcorn"" she's obviously not taking me seriously and shes taking her internet friends really seriously.  I feel like she never liked me and is only now showing it. 

Am i to blame? Is this my fault? I was only trying to help...",17Jun2020,1

This concept of this short film is as follows. *""When a worldwide outbreak hits a small town, the whole town goes into lockdown allowing no one to leave their homes. Five friends are restricted to just video calls to keep their very tight friendship strong. Only thing is, each friend has a different issue at home from domestic abuse, drug addiction and suicidal depression. The fight of keeping each other safe while not being able to be in contact with each other shows the struggles this lockdown has put upon their friendships and personal lives.""*I am looking for anyone who is willing to come forward with their stories to help me write my characters correctly and well. I fully understand that these are very sensitive subjects and I will keep all posts or messages confidential if you want me too. I would really appreciate anyone who is comfortable and willing to come forward to me and help me out. The story for this project is a very real issue that has happened during these lockdowns and quarantine. Thank you again for anyone who is willing to help me.

33,"Okay I came here to talk about some things I’m experiencing and have experienced for as long as I can remember. I generally feel very disassociated from the world around me and find it hard to focus on the things that are actually relevant to my life, but get so lost in activities that allow me to escape. For example at school, I know I’m very smart and creative and could do well. I just find it so hard to apply myself, same at the internship where I work. I just can’t find the motivation to care about things that involve people other than myself. This has manifested itself in my relationships as well. I have a lot of friends, but (and this may sound bad) I don’t really care about or particularly love them a lot, and I don’t feel like I can tell them about my problems or the way I feel. I don’t even talk to my mom about my problems. I used to self harm, and to this day nobody knows. A lot of people want to be around me and live vicariously through me since I do a lot of exciting and reckless things, but there’s nobody around me who I feel like I can sit down and have a talk about my feelings and shit (which is why I’m on reddit for help lol). And I don’t think this is an issue with not having found the right people, since I’ve been friends with a lot of different types of people. I feel that I have to keep up this exterior of a fun party girl who’s a little bit kooky but not too kooky or people will be put off. It’s just very draining for me. I used to think I may be a narcissist, since I tend not to consider other people ever lol. But I don’t think that really fits me since I have times where I have extremely low self esteem and even see myself as evil. I’m not really sure if any of this makes sense at all but I’m sure someone else feels this way. It’s really hard for me to live a normal life since I’m just so wrapped up in myself, I tend to behave irresponsibly and recklessly. And I know that what I do is seen as wrong by others, but I just can’t see it as wrong myself. Another example of this is shoplifting, i steal something almost every time I go to a big chain store. And I know it hurts the workers and most people see stealing as morally wrong, I just don’t see it as a problem and I know that’s a problem but I don’t want to change. Anyways this is a lot but if someone could try to point me in the right direction that would help?? I just need to be able to function and have a career and maintain relationships but right now I just cannot.",17Jun2020,1
34,"So I (26f) self harmed again, last Monday. Before that it was... 4 years I think. I didnt think about it for a long time. I dont talk about it with people, I think its generally a hard conversation to have about how my brain reacts with overwhelming panic to stress triggers when there's people with real problems working hard to overcome them. My mental health is a real problem for me, but I'm working on it.

35,"Maybe lying isn't even the right word. As long as I can remember I have always had this need to have secrets - things that are just for me. 

As a kid it was things that I knew i wasn't supposed to have. For example, when I was about 8 I had a jar of peanut butter in my closet and would just use my fingers to eat a big huge bite every couple of days. I took it because my mom got mad at my sister for dipping her fingers in the peanut butter jar, so I decided i wanted to hide the jar. I liked that it was something I wasn't supposed to be doing, even if it wasn't even a big deal. My mom eventually found the jar and I got in trouble, but then I just found a new secret. 

As a teenager it became porn, and when I got to college it became me telling small lies about my life to my roommate, or sometimes I would just go a week without doing homework or going to class without saying anything to anyone. Small things just to get the rush of having done something wrong and it being a secret. 

Eventually I met a girl and we got married and then eventually divorced. One of the first things that we would fight about was my little lies and secrets. My ex-wife was pretty religious when I met her (she eventually mellowed out and became an atheist but that is another story) and she was VERY anti-Game of Thrones, so the first secret I had from her was reading all the books and then watching the show when she wasn't with me. It was never anything huge or relationship shattering, but it was little things that I knew she wouldn't like. I had to have my secret. 

I have now been divorced for 3 years. I live alone and I am very depressed. I have gained like 40 pounds this year, I dont really have any friends, and all I do is sleep, watch TV, and go to work. But honestly one of the things that has been nagging at the back of my mind is that I don't have a secret. I havent had a secret in a long time now and it has been just sitting in my head taunting me because I don't even have anyone to have a secret from. All of my family live mulitple states away and I dont talk to them much. I literally can't have a secret right now. 

I am not really sure what the point of this post is, just to vent I guess. I know I need therapy but I can't really afford it right now. Sorry to ramble so much, this was just something I needed to put out into the void. Thanks if you read this far.",17Jun2020,1

40,"I've never been diagnosed with anything but I'm fairly sure I have depression and anxiety and I think its the anxiety that is causing this, as it only happens in situations where I feel the most anxious.

Simply put, for about 10 years or so now I've felt like a passenger in my own body, I have control but it just feels like I'm watching someone else control it, everything feels surreal as if it doesn't exist and there have been times where I've felt like I've lost consciousness but I didn't. I know its not a physical illness or at the very least something physical that I could potentially die from because not only have I experienced this for 10 years but I've also had an ECG to check my heart as well as tests to make sure my lungs are good as well as all the other generic check ups you get.

I don't always feel like this too, and times when I'm generally happy I don't experience it at all, I don't experience it when drunk too. I know I should see a doctor or psychiatrist about this but I don't see the point if it does happen to be what I think it is.",17Jun2020,1
41,"I’ve been in and out of therapy for over ten years now. I started in highschool because I was actively trying to take my life and reached out for help.
My story isn’t unique, I had a challenging life growing up but I didn’t realize it wasn’t normal until I was older. I’ve also repressed my emotions as I wasn’t allowed to express myself emotionally, and would often be punished for it.
I’ve been doing the work, got away from home. For good jobs. Learned how to drive and bought a car. Stepped out of my comfort zones. Learned to say no (kinda wip) , exercise often weekly. done everything I can to improve my quality  of life . I’m getting older and I feel myself getting angrier inside . I’ve had trauma . I’m still working through those I guess but it’s taking a toll on me emotionally and mentally. I’m angry every day. It’s to the point I want to be left alone when I get home. It’s not fair to my spouse, we have our own issues but I know I play a part of it .
I try being present and letting things go but I feel so overwhelmed and stimulated I want to start pulling my hair out and rocking.
I’m so shut off emotionally I don’t find joy in things anymore at all. This COVID has been a real strain too bc my spouse is working from home, but the whole time I was working out in it w very limited staff so overworked and overstimulated . I feel like I try to explain myself. But I just get hit with “how can I help?” I can’t answer that question. Or I get hit with “I want to avoid you.” I don’t want that either I just want to be respected when I’m feeling drained. 

I will be going back to therapy , because at this point I don’t see much of a choice. But does anyone have advice ? I am having a hard time sharing my space with someone at home and also dealing w work. I feel incapable of fulfilling my job at work and my role at home.
I also feel like I’m not understood when I do try to explain it. I’m pretty verbal so I do try to use my Insight to express how I’m feeling and grow from it I just worry I’m doing more damage to myself and my home life. We’re also overwhelmed as new home owners and I am not at home enough to provide help with tasks around the house and when I am home I just could care less.  I also feel like when I’m venting people take it personally even tho I keep saying this isn’t about you I’m opening up. So I don’t feel comfortable opening up anymore 

I dunno , I’ve recently opened up about my last abuse and trauma and it’s freshly outed . I just want to be at peace and not bring people down around me.

I’ve been diagnosed w extreme anxiety disorder but they also tried to diagnose me with bipolar which they ruled out. Mainly I get overworked when too much is thrown at me I become overwhelmed and cannot focus and get angry . I am a perfectionist too and I also feel like I don’t pick up well on social cues so I need direct answers or I won’t get it, just didn’t know if anyone else could relate ? And if they had advice",17Jun2020,1

My wife has history of suicidal tendencies and such. Well this weekend she got super paranoid they I have been watching her and stalking her threw her apps and such. Well I got her calmed down and thought everything was good

Well today I woke up she says I went threw her phone and shit which I never did. I couldn’t control her and I left and took myself out of the situation. Well she drove to my dads house and almost took a gun. I ended up calling the cops because we didn’t know if she actually took one. So I finally talk her into going into the hospital. She hasn’t called me or anything and I’m super worried she hasn’t really been this bad in a while 

Also my dad and brother just want me to turn my back on her and I refuse to do this. I’ve known her since middle school and I love her. They told me if she really wanted to do she would have done it. They said I’m just being used. So I left there house and came back to my apartment.",17Jun2020,1

46,"I’m gon apologize for the rant here in advance, I just am frustrated. There are so many other things in addition to this I would like to talk about, but this is it for now I guess. Sorry in advance, you can’t say I didn’t warn you. 

I have been diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses (Anxiety disorders, clinical depression, PTSD), and each one has its own painful stigmas and stereotypes. But one that stands out to me, that has been given little effort to understand by many, is social anxiety. I feel like it’s largely swept under the rug as being “all in your head” and “your fine, you are overreacting” etc. when in reality it’s much worse then a bit of normal anxiety. In reality It’s like everything I say, every small movement, even how I breathe feels like its being judged constantly. I feel like people are watching me or ignoring me on purpose. It feels like everybody has some malicious intent with me 24/7 and there is little to no things I can do to ease it. It makes me feel like I’m missing out on my own life, but I’m too afraid to try. I hate when people tell you they are “socially anxious” because to a degree that is normal anxiety and that’s okay, but they downplay those with severe anxiety. They say you’re overreacting, they don’t understand your habits and mannerisms you’ve developed, it’s annoying. When I say “they” I mean even family and close friends, well especially them. They don’t stay up until 6 am wondering if that thing they did last year hurt somebody. They don’t avoid their own best friends that they’ve had since fourth grade and family because you don’t want to lose them once they find out about certain parts of you. You hide your interests and hobbies and don’t joke around in fear that someone will judge you for it. Talking comes so unnatural for you yet you crave interaction. You cut yourself off from the world and come off as shy, and when you do try people call you an asshole for not responding to them right away/responding in a way they don’t like. It’s so much worse then being anxious for a big event or a family get together. Its so much worse then being anxious about going to a new school or social situation. I get that that is a thing, and it is also very real, but this is deferent. It’s constant. It’s paralyzing. It’s debilitating. It, along with the other aforementioned illnesses, have ruined my life so far. I’m tired of the stereotypes.",17Jun2020,1

48,"A little background: I’ve know my friend “Landon” (25M) for a few years now. We met at our college theatre department. He’s in school for playwriting, and I think he’s pretty good at it. He’s straight out of a Leave it to Beaver episode. Pretty old fashioned when it comes to dating (saving himself for marriage, treating girls to proper dates, pretty chivalrous), and presenting himself. He’s super sweet, and pretty good looking too. At first we were really just acquaintances. I had a small crush, but I got over that. We somehow became best friends, though we’re pretty opposite. I(26F, btw) am a little more “rowdy” than he is, but I bring him more out of his shell, and he keeps me grounded and humble. 
After we became really good friends, he went through some troubles. Girl troubles (hasn’t really been in a relationship, and has had trouble dating in general), feeling like he wasn’t worth it, always feeling like people were criticizing him, a lot of stuff. He’s has suicidal thoughts before, and I’ve helped him through those. But now it’s getting a little tougher. 
He’s been good for a while, more happy and joyful, but today he was hit with some news, and now wants to kill himself after he graduates from grad school. He learned that he has a disease that pretty much prevents him from ever having sex. And to top that off, not many people liked his new play, that was basically his thesis. I haven’t read all of it, but it didn’t seem as good as his other plays. It wasn’t bad, but I know he’s capable of better. Well now that this all has happened, I don’t know how I’d be able to completely help him. What advice could I give him, or how can I best console him?

I remember I would do fucked up things like choke my dog when I was a kid but not really overly cruel, I think out of curiosity or when I was angry, and I'm fucking scared that I'm a psychopath.

And even recently I remember just being sort of mean to my dog a bit, but not as excessively as when I was a kid, but now I'm afraid I'm some kind of evil psychopath, like I remember I think feeling a bit of guilt for just like not letting my dog out because I was tired but then like saying in my head something like ""it's okay you're just taking a bit of stress or anger out on the dog"" or something like that to rationalize it. Oh my god, I don't fucking want to abuse or be mean to my dog, but I'm so afraid like what if I am an animal abuser or a psychopath??? This is so fucked up.

Ugh, even recently I remember doing stuff like pinching my dog's ear or messing with him by using my flashlight on him, now I'm really scared that I'm a psychopath or something.

Why dont you instead of being a curt unprofessional, let me know professionally that my appointment I am eagerly awaiting with dr jones, is unavailable and then introduce me to the ACTUAL dates I can speak with her. I had a wonderful two minute conversation with her where she had told me her background, and I am very excited to work with her. However, as the director of billing, you can suck an egg.

this led to me postponing help-seeking for 13 years. I've grown used to the torture of my mind. people around me see that I'm still alive, and think that I'm coping, but I'm struggling to hold on. I don't have the courage to take my own life.

72,"For background, growing up, I had a rough childhood emotionally. I used to be physically abused too, not anymore. I would be gaslighted a lot, and manipulated. There was a lot of screaming and anger. No stability or consistency. 

I have developed severe trust issues, and can’t trust anybody. I can’t open up to anyone emotionally, and I have an abandonment fear. And when it’s triggered, I get anxiety attacks. My hands will start shaking and stuff. And I’ll start having nightmares of being abandoned. Sometimes if I feel like somebody is trying to hurt me/has hurt me, I’ll distance myself. Sometimes I’ll even treat them poorly if I feel like they don’t care, or are gonna hurt me.But I don’t want to be a bad person, it just kinda happens, and I always feel guilty after. One time I treated my friend poorly because my one other friend was treating me poorly. And I felt bad.

I have a lot of built up anger, and I just contain it all in. I stay mad/sad for hours. Sometimes when I get super mad, I’ll pinch myself, and have thoughts of punching people, as bad as that sounds. And I can mad at people over little things, but it depends. Like I’m still mad at this one girl for correcting me.  I’m still mad over that 6 months later, I know it’s stupid, but I can’t help it. Sometimes I can be happy with people, but if I feel like they hurt me, I can like them, but I may start to not like them again if I think about what they did in the past or something. 

At one point of time, my self-esteem was horrendous, I used to call myself stupid, worthless, etc, and be upset every day. I’m not really like that anymore. But sometimes my self-esteem isn’t really good at all. Sometimes I start thinking about how I may not be good enough for certain things, or blame myself. Sometimes I can get sad out of nowhere. I’ll start thinking of sad stuff like death, and start crying, but sometimes this only just last days. Like I only feel empty/sad for days. Usually something triggers it. Sometimes I feel empty a lot, but maybe I’m just bored lol.

Somebody is waiting for you to shine, to gather you in their arms and hold you. And maybe you haven't found that person yet. Maybe you're still in the dark tunnel, and you have nowhere to go. Maybe the light flickered out a long time ago, and you were left in the dark. You're scared, and you're hurting. You're searching for someone, anyone, to love you. It's lonely in that dark tunnel, isn't it?

But that person is there. They are waiting around the corner, waiting for you to take a deep breath and take just one more step into their arms. They could be anyone - maybe it's me, maybe it's the friend you were never really close with but would like to get to know them better, maybe it's the man you saw walking down the street who smiled at you with joy.  *Somebody loves you.* 

You are beautiful. You are amazing. You are so strong to have stayed in that tunnel without collapsing. It amazes me! You are brave to wake up every day with this weight on your shoulders and keep on marching. And it's hard, isn't it? I know just how hard it is, my friend. Shivering in that tunnel alone, hurting and there's no one there to take the pain away. But I see you. We all see you. And we love you! I love you. You are not alone, no matter how much you may feel that. There are so many of us in our own separate tunnels, searching for someone who will love us - we know how hard it is. And it's okay, my friend. It's okay to be scared. It's okay to cry. It's okay to let yourself be vulnerable. Because I love you, we all love you! We love you no matter what. No matter how alone you feel.

I have a poem I want to share with you, by Sara Teasdale. I want you to take a moment, wherever you are, and take a deep breath. In through your nose, out through your mouth. And again, another deep, deep breath. Yes, that's it. I want you to see us outside of the tunnel, all of us who love you. And then I want you to know that there will be rest, my beautiful friend. There will be rest.

**""There Will Be Rest""**

&amp;#x200B;

*There will be rest, and sure stars shining*

*Over the roof-tops crowned with snow,*

*A reign of rest, serene forgetting,*

*The music of stillness holy and low.*

*I will make this world of my devising*

*Out of a dream in my lonely mind.*

*I shall find the crystal of peace, – above me*

*Stars I shall find.*

82,"Being in a healthy marriage or relationship is a lot of hard work. It obviously requires efforts from both ends – parties involved in the relationship. Every time your relationship hits big rocks, you can turn to couple counselling or [couple therapy](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/couples-therapy/). There have been times when emotionally focused couples’ therapy has worked wonders in finding issues that lie beneath your emotions. Emotionally focused couples’ therapy is known to be one of the best therapies opted by many couples. Most of these therapies are only seen to restore the relationship to where it was before. However, the theory behind emotionally focused therapy programs is to make the relationship even stronger that it was before.

The emotionally focused [couple therapy Mumbai](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/couples-therapy/) practices applications of the New Testament linked directly to how we should treat and act towards one another. There are times when we forget what our roles are. Psychotherapy is the best practice used to perform emotionally focused couples’ therapy, which can be done through conversations, artwork, drama, music, or therapeutic touch. Psychotherapy considers a number of philosophical approaches during therapy.

The term psychotherapy is interchangeable with the term counselling – commonly used by most of the people. One of the most important benefits of psychotherapy is the client and patient confidentiality. This is important because there are many personal details that are shared during these therapies. In today's world, thanks to the advancements in the technology, the therapy sessions can be conducted face to face, over the phone as well as over the internet. The thing with these therapies is that they work differently on everyone. There is no limit to time as to when a person or in the case of couples’ therapy people, will be cured and feeling better. If couple A finds their solutions in a month, couple B might take 2-3 months, depending on their ability to seek help and will to understand the troubles. As the name talks for itself, the emotionally focused couples’ therapy is ideated for a man and a woman; in short, a couple. Emotionally focused therapy can also be taken into consideration for the entire family. For people who see their family falling apart and are smart enough to do something about it, it is a must to sign up for a [family therapy](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/family-therapy/) session in which the whole family can participate together.

When seeking a therapist to counsel you, it is extremely important to make sure you do not just focus on the cheapest therapist just because you do not want to spend a lot on the therapy. You must find a therapist that has been in your shoes before. Somebody with a good experience and who can help you talk, listen, and understand. An experienced therapy would be better than someone who has no idea of how you are feeling. However, before everything, you need to remember to set your priorities in line and live up to your role.

However, through all of this I started a jewelry business randomly and have been known to stay up all night just making jewelry. And I’ve signed up for many programs just to keep my brain busy. I keep going YOLO and buying a lot of stuff and I am obsessing over my weight too.

I don’t know what the heck is wrong with me but I would like some stability because I have a lot on my plate and I can’t stop moving it feels like ugh.",17Jun2020,1

97,"Recently, I (18) think just because of everything happening in the world, I've started to feel myself slip into a depressive episode. I've had depression, at least since I was aware that that was what it was, since I was 15 because of a medication, but I wouldn't be surprised if I had it longer.   
Today was a new low for me, recently I've been feeling depressed because I feel like I am losing my friends, even though I don't fully think I am, I can feel myself distancing from them, and I feel very alone because of that.   
Today, my mom and I also got into a fight, and it was so stupid because it was over butter, but she started to randomly yell at me about how we were out and I had used the last of it (I did not) and because of that I kinda fought her because I didn't understand why she was yelling at me. So I went down and got butter, and she followed me, which kinda annoyed me cause what's the point in her following me down when she just yelled at me to get the damn thing, and as I was taking things out of the freezer to get to the said butter, I put something on top of it and something fell, and then she started to yell at me saying I threw something and that it fell off of the freezer. I got mad that she said I was throwing the stuff when I didn't, and yelled at her about how I didn't do that and how I didn't need her to hover over me, which then pissed her off more. We got into a fight about it, and she ended up telling me that she didn't care if I went to college of not, and that she didn't care if I learned how to drive. She also said she wasn't going to do her taxes for me to apply for fasfa, and wasn't going to give me documents my community college needed, and that she wasn't going to take me to my driving lesson that was supposed to happen tonight and that I had to figure it out myself. When she said this, I just broke down because I already feel like I'm a useless adult because I can't drive and don't have a job, and I feel so helpless because I have no idea how to get myself out of it. After she said that, I just started to ignore her and she went back upstairs, and got her stupid butter and put everything away I took out, and I looked behind the freezer to see what had fallen off, and saw that nothing had.   
After I put it in our kitchen, I went upstairs to tell her, and I apologized for what I said because I said some things that I shouldn't have said, and I also tried to tell her how I didn't like how she just started to yell at me for no reason, and how she should have just asked me to get it, and how it hurt my feelings that she said those things to me. I wasn't able to say very much of it though, because she started to yell at me again saying that she had to do a lot of things and how she didn't do anything wrong and how I was in the wrong. I just went into my bedroom and cried for at least an hour, and I just wanted to disappear or sleep for a long time, and at some point, during that time she also made it so that my phone didn't have data.   
Later I again tried to talk to her about it, and how it isn't ok for her to just lash out at me like she did and yell at me for no reason, and how what she said was very hurtful. She again just tried to defend herself and said that she is very busy and doesn't have time for my crap, and ironically said that I needed to stop playing the victim and realize what I did wrong and move on.   
From the events of today, I feel really drained and honestly more depressed than I felt before. Also, sorry this is so long, I just needed to write out the whole thing that happened.",17Jun2020,1
98,"Hi on tik tok I found this video that described a mental illness but I forgot the name. 

It’s the insecurity of thinking that the people around you believe that you have a disability (mental disability of some sort) and that’s the only reason they are nice to you even though you do not have one. 

Does anyone know what this is called? Or anything similar?",17Jun2020,1
99,"I remember I was in 2nd grade. A new kid with asthma said if he cried, he would die. One day during circle time, when we were all crowded together, I got up from the front to go my desk and accidentally stepped on his finger, and he started to cry. I then started crying because I thought he was going to die. My teacher sent me outside the classroom to go sit in the pod. When she came out to get me, I refused to go back in, because I was so guilt ridden and I was afraid he was dead.

She grabbed me by my ankles and she drug me across the floor all the way back to the classroom while I’m crying and flailing around.

No one did anything about it. Lol",17Jun2020,1
100,"So, to keep this simple, I'll just say I (17yo) have been put through regular sexual harrassment at age 15. After I got out of that abusive relationship, I realised I am now uncomfortable with most touch I do not initiate myself.

Fast forward some time and I recently got a boyfriend. And that's good! The problem is that he insists he will touch me (hugs, caressing, spooning, that kind of stuff), but I don't really like it. It makes me nervous and I'm super conscius whenever his anything is near my private areas, I freeze and can't focus on anything else and I just want to move away. 

I told him that it makes me uncomfortable, but he insists he will do it anyway and also that it'll help me get used to it again.

Should I let him, or tell him again to stop this?",17Jun2020,1
101,"I have anxiety. Particularly health anxiety.
I have some medical issues that are being investigated. Of course, I've Google and my symptoms pin point exactly to cancer. Every time. I'm convinced that's what it is. There is no other explanation.
I have been in a state of panic for about a week now. Like a very prolonged panic attack. It eases a little at times but it's still there. I spoke to my GP and they prescribed diazepam (valium) which I have taken before. It helps a tiny bit, for about an hour at most, I feel euphoric, I feel like I'm powerful but also evil but I like it. Then I'm back to square one and I'm pacing, shaking, paranoid, twitching, talking constantly, like I'm wired but exhausted. I can't go on much longer. I feel like I'm in a crisis but organisations don't care unless you want to kill yourself which I don't.
I just feel like I'm losing my mind. I feel like I'm in this bubble in my own world and there's no one else here and sometimes I let someone in but I'm not sure if things happening are real.
I can't see how this can stop until I've had my medical tests done and received a diagnosis.

The fact of the matter is I have inattentive ADHD and the biggest struggle that I have been dealing with is the forgetfulness. I haven’t been able to go see a therapist or get on medication due to it being to expensive/not having health insurance. It makes me feel like I am going insane I don’t remember any details of conversations that I am paying full attention to. I can’t remember what I did that morning. I can’t remember points that I wanted to bring up with someone during a conversation. I literally feel like I’m going crazy.

106,"Growing up, my sisters and I would be physically abused by my mom over small things. There were very strict rules set on us. My mom was so obsessed with keeping me inside the house, that I could never step foot outside alone. She was also an extreme hoarder, so I would spend hours of my free time walking back and forth in my hoarded house. I would have to listen to her yell and rant for hours, and I couldn’t escape it. 

My mom would take her anger out on us quite a lot, and I would have to sit through or witness my sisters being beaten, because I was so small. I could never hit back or call the police when things would go too far, because my mom would threaten me saying she would beat my ass even harder. She would try to also guilt trip us by pulling out bible quotes saying that we would burn in hell if we hit her back. What made matters worse was that I was always picked on at school until I graduated, and I felt like I was never happy growing up. 

Once I grew bigger, she stopped hitting me and my sisters, but I was left feeling so distressed over these memories. I would act out when I was alone, and instead of displacing my anger and frustration onto others/objects, I would self-harm by punching myself in the head. 

I dropped out of college because I was feeling very depressed and struggling with these flashbacks. I’ve had the luxury of staying with my parents for a gap year, but my depression and these flashbacks have become much worse. 

I’m typically a quiet person and I don’t like talking to anyone (especially about my feelings), but one day I went into my mom’s room and started telling her how depressed I was. I was telling her about all of my flashbacks, and all she did was tell me to get over them because she had it much worse as a kid. She started saying how I was selfish and how I was going to burn in hell for thinking such things. 

I felt worse than before, so I left and went back to my room. She ended up barging in and splashing me with holy water, pinning me down and trying to perform an exorcism on me. She was chanting prayers and telling the ‘demons ‘ to leave. I felt horrible because I don’t think she actually listened to what I was saying. 

When my dad came home, my mom told my dad everything that happened. He suggested therapy, but she started screaming at the top of her lungs that I was tearing the family apart, and how a therapist would just “drug me up” and make me even more depressed. She then started to threaten my dad saying she would divorce him and take all of his money to spend with her new boyfriend, and so on. 

It’s been a year since this happened, and my headspace has probably been in the worst condition it’s ever been. I was punching myself all the time, I kept having flashbacks and uncontrollable tics. It just drove me crazy that I was living with the same woman who ripped chunks out of my sister’s hair for not being able to swallow a pill. 

Yesterday, I was feeling angrier than before and I tried letting it out in my workout. I practiced piano, meditated, etc. I did anything to keep my mind off of it. I even tried sleeping on it, but my mind was still racing even in my dreams. 

When I woke up, I was angrier than before. I did the same things to keep me occupied, but my flashback was more vivid than before, and my blood started boiling at how powerless I felt. Instead of punching myself, I smashed my head through my door repeatedly until it was broken. 

My parents walked out of their room and tried asking what was wrong, and all I did was start cussing out my mom for all of these years. She denied that she ever touched me, and I was so angry that I proceeded by smashing my head through a window. It took my dad hugging me to calm me down. 

I don’t know why I snapped like that. I’m not a violent or aggressive person, but this episode was so bad it made me act like one. It was very dumb of me, yet I still did it. My parents probably think I’m crazy now, so crazy that my mom is finally willing for me to go to therapy. 

I feel very ashamed of myself and I don’t really know why I lashed out like that. I feel horrible because my dad already has enough problems to deal with. He just sounded tired and disappointed in the aftermath. 

Why did I snap? I’m very confused and I just wish I could escape from this all.",17Jun2020,1
107,"ive been stuck thinking about my recent girlfriend as of late. our relationship was toxic and she was a manipulative narcissist who *literally* got off on giving me panic attacks. the particular memory which i have been stuck reliving is the day i attempted suicide. 

quick note, i have anxiety, depression, and adhd. i also have panic disorder, and was diagnosed with it while in this relationship. she would coax me into panicking, use the panic attack to leverage her power and make me more dependant on her, then gaslight me into believing that it was all my fault. this caused panicking to become my gut response once my anxiety reached a certain level, causing a ""depressive spiral"" as i call it. back to it then

when she was mad, and if i had bought her something, she would give it back to me without looking at or saying anything to me. whenever this happened (quite often, might i add) i knew that i had fucked up in some way, and it would instantly send me into a panic attack. usually she would give me some of her attention, just enough to keep me thinking i could fix things (i never actually could), but this was different. i remember crying and begging and pleading for her to just acknowledge my existence. her friends were with her and so eventually she decided that to lighten the mood for them she would make fun of me. i remember seeing her and her friends laughing at me on the ground, i dont remembed the words but i remember the image. a symptom of my panic attacks is self harm, i dont do it consciously, its just really hard for me to control my hands when im panicking and so they sometimes try to hurt me. so i was cutting myself with the edge of a wristwatch in front of her and her friends out in public, i know thats my fault, but she couldve done anything but what she did next. i remember asking her if she wanted me to die, then she said ""theres a bridge right over there, why dont you do it?"". after that i just remember falling to the ground with tears in my eyes, then i remember being on the railing of the bridge with three people pulling me back from jumping off it. i remember very vividly how it felt to be fighting back, it was really scary because i just knew that i wanted to die. for a moment, all that i had ever wanted in my life was to die, and in that moment this truth was almost fulfilled. i didnt get why the same people who were laughing at me just moments before were trying to save my life now.

after being pulled down, i could barely see straight and i had noticeably reduced control over motor function. essentially drunk, but with suicidal depression instead of euphoria. i somehow got onto a bench with her, i put my head in her shoulder to cry because i just wanted comfort from the person i loved most in the world. she pulled away im disgust and asked ""who said you could put your head on my shoulder?!"", she then proceeded to call me dumb and make me feel like a moron for everything that had happened. later when i was in the hospital she msgd me saying she was dumping me, then she stopped responding to all messages. they had to give me so many drugs to get me to go down, i was fighting i wouldve done anything to see her. fast forward a week and we're back together. sad thing is, she keeps messaging me every month or so, i cant hold off forever and ik eventually ill crack and see her

We have decided to take some time apart to try and work on our own mental health.

I don't really want to know if people think this will work or not - every relationship is different and every person is different and so it's kind of impossible to know.

Sometimes I get it when I just think of something that reminds me of the fact I might be a cuck, do i get this because it's actually making my feel inadequate or it's making me think of the fetish which turns me on? i have moments where I have a constant groinal response that never goes away because this is literally on my mind 24/7 it doesn't. even stop in dreams. It feels like actual arousal with my dick tingling to the thought of this being true. I used to lose an erection I had from something else when thinking about these things but now I keep that erection. There were moments where I was confident that I wasn't a cuck and I think that the groinal response made it go away but maybe I'm making that up. Was I just actually suppressing these feelings which is why they went away? Can I cure this fetish? Sometimes I get it looking at other guys which makes me think Im gay but it could also be the fact that they remind me of this fetish or make me feel inadequate. If this is OCD can i uneroticize this fear? I get this in dreams and I've almost came. I feel like HOCD isn't real if you get a groinal response then its actually just suppressing your sexuality. If some people don't get the sensation and others do then it has to be real right? Please don't tell me that I'm actually a cuck I will not be able to live with myself it literally makes me sick.

113,"I have a close family member who has conversations out loud, which in and if itself is a normal phenomenon. 

But when repeated back to him this person doesn't recognize the dialogue, and states that it doesn't match any of his inner thoughts from within that moment, so much so that he questions that I've heard him correctly.

For example, he got out of the shower and started a conversation with himself after singing for a bit. He went on as if he were two people about the how he shaves, and then started mentioning how good ""you look"" an uncharacteristic way. When he came out, I said his little self-hype routine sounded cute, and he politely insisted he was singing. I told him that I also heard singing, and that maybe I misunderstood the lyrics, asking if it was a song about shaving or looking good, and he was confused, stating that the song was about anarchy. 

I wouldn't normally be worried, but he does have at least one family member who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and he exhibits these tenancies during times of extreme fatigue, illness, or high stress, leading me to believe it is something he normally has the capacity to manage. 

Not to mention the textbook adult ADHD.

I've mentioned to him that he may want to speak to his physician the next time he has a physical, but he seemed unconcerned. Which is understandable because it isn't affecting his life to a determent at the moment. 

I speak aloud from time to time, but I always realize I'm doing it, and anytime someone repeats what I've said, I recognize it as part of my inner dialogue. But he doesn't at all and it's always about weird shit that doesn't match his outward personality.

118,"I'm curious to see what other people have gotten out of psychotherapy, especially for depression. What was the single biggest benefit? What were your goals and did therapy help you achieve them? How? 

&amp;#x200B;

Read on if you'd like, but that's my main question. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been depressed on and off for my whole adult life, and the past four years have been particularly bad. Without boring you with details, it is mostly cliché existential-type things that get to me, like death, the passage of time, the absurdity of life, etc. I am also mega stressed in my day to day life, but can't see a way out of it for the time being. 

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from taking SSRIs (which I still take), I've seen several counsellors/therapists/whatever over the years (in more than one country). It started out with on-campus counsellors (the kind your university tuition covers), public health care counsellors, an online CBT program, etc., and most recently a private paid-for psychotherapist. I've never really been sure what I'm meant to get out of it, aside from feeling like I must ""need"" it. But it hasn't ever really helped much. At most, I liked the person and was able to ""vent"" a bit with a stranger, or they've given me a bit of food for thought about something. At worse, I felt awkward and obligated to make it seem like I felt a bit better.   
I'm in a place now where I genuinely don't know what to do next. I'm a husk of my former self, and my life is suffering more and more every month. I am not suicidal, but feel like I am at serious risk of losing my family, job, etc. My doctors know I feel this way. I take antidepressants. I just spent a load of money on another therapist. I feel like I'm at the end of the road. What do I do next? I don't have the money to keep looking for the ""right"" therapist. Is it something I am doing wrong?",17Jun2020,1

But every time I try to help or make any suggestions I get ignored or brushed off, then I get upset that he’s ignoring me and he says I’m aggressive and he can’t talk to me about anything cos he gets shot down.

Talking with my friend the other day he told me that maybe I'm still not over it and that i should get the help I need. Do I really still need help? I just want to be able to love myself as I am.",17Jun2020,1
125,"Then I was 10, I failed in a scholarship exam. The reason for the my poor result was the video games from the 90s. I knew it. I was stuck to the video game for a year, all that produced a sudden depressive thoughts in me. What would I do to kill myself? I plugged the power connector of video game into my mouth. Yeah, the DC connector. I didn't know that DV, 2Amps society won't kill me. So stupid of me. I still remember the day and the exact spot.  I was scared as fuck when I inserted the connector into my mouth. But nothing even happened. I came to know that this much current won't do a thing to me when I was 13. By then I had my friends and my gang, so never had those feelings again. Poor 90s kid, couldn't even sure alone!",17Jun2020,1
126,"Recently for whatever reason, I’ve been feeling super down. I don’t feel motivated to do school work that I would normally just chug through. I’ve found myself sitting in class not paying attention, and just thinking. Thinking about what exactly? I don’t really know. There haven’t been any recent events that might’ve caused any of this, but it’s getting to a point where I won’t sleep not because I’m not tired or sad, but because I just don’t want to. I feel like being alone and away from everyone and everything. Is there anything anyone can suggest to just help me feel a little better? If you need more info just ask. Thanks to anyone",17Jun2020,1
127,"I'm 25 and was diagnosed with depression when I was 15. When I was 18 I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I'm in some form of treatment about 70% of the time these 10 years, if I also count wanting or looking for treatment it's about 90%.

My quality of life has increased a lot, but I still suffer from dramatic mood shifts and spiral sometimes. But honestly, I'd say I'm at an average health level. But when I feel pressured or have to work I completely lose my shit again.

Caution: I live in Germany, the system is a bit different here, but you will get the general idea.

Crisis after crisis happened whenever I tried to get into work, so finally the government labeled me as unemployable for 12 months.
I could go for full on long-term disability and long-term disability, but I don't want that yet. But just knowing that it's possible and that it's always an option for me is so relieving. Now I can look for jobs with much less pressure.

Is this also possible in the US?",17Jun2020,1
128,"With everything going on in the world it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and to let current events cloud your mind, so sometimes you need to get away from things and that’s okay, take time away to take care of yourself. If you need to take a break from social media, do it! If you believe it will help! ☺️ 
If you do, here are some ways you can keep in touch with family and friends:

- FaceTime/Text: Schedule times where you and your friends can FaceTime each other or just casually text them, talk about how their day was, what they’ve been up to, etc. It may seem like an obvious thing to do, but it really helps in the long run!

- Discord: Discord is a great place to keep in contact in with friends and family! You can create servers and chats for specific topics or planned events, you can do anything from talk and send funny images, to video chatting, to role-playing games like DND with custom roles given to each person on a server. 

Things to do while away from social media

Unfortunately, with everything on there isn’t really much to do outside because of the virus, but there are still ways to stay entertained while stuck in quarantine.

- Go on a bike ride 
- Catch is on your favorite TV show 
- Play some video games
- Cook
- Learn a new skill 
- Watch some YouTube
- Binge movies 

Remember, taking a break from social media for your mental wellbeing is not selfish in the slightest, and you want to do everything in your ability to be happy and healthy!",17Jun2020,1
129,"Okay, so I already know this isn't going to get a whole lot of replies but I was really curious if anyone knew maybe what the fuck is happening to me lol. For the past 6months-yr I will occasionally get this weird feeling of debilitating anxiety, nausea and dissociation along with flashbacks (sounds like PTSD, right?) but these flashbacks always contain like... 

-Cartoons I can almost remember, it's like this constant feeling of ""I know this... I don't know the word for it or anything about it... but I KNOW this.""
-Memories of people from when I was really little
-dreams I've had throughout my whole life
-random shit that I can ~almost~ remember. 

So I will be sitting, watching TV and say like... a draft comes in or a certain noise happens outside my room, my brain will sometimes just shut down and go into this state of nostalgia, nausea, anxiety, and dissociation through these random flashbacks. I would chalk it up to PTSD if the flashbacks had any relevance to being traumatic but they never are. This isn't to say I don't have PTSD from other circumstances but those flashbacks have a very different effect on me. 
BTW this all started after I dropped out of college 4 weeks in, my dad evaded the FBI in Mexico for 3 months, my uncle was creepy asf and paying my tuition but also holding it over my head and verbally abusing me over it, I had a lil mishap with a man I didn't know in college-moved back in with my boyfriend's family, his whole family was splitting up bc his moms a cheater lmao, and my whole life was 100% falling apart. It very well couldve been my body being unable to handle the stress I was under and just deciding ""here bro you haven't seen this in a minute chill out"" 
Like a form of dissociation just 100x worse? 

TLDR; PTSD but minus the PTS..? bro idk",17Jun2020,1
130,"My mother never liked anyone that I was in relationship with. Noone was good enough for me according to her even if 4 out of 5 of them were absolutely perfect in the way they treated me. I had thousands of argument with her and my father asking them to let me live my life the way I want with the people i want by my side. I even ended up having panic attacks and psychical symptoms because of stress.
I'm 28 yo (f) and I am going to graduate from medical school hopefully after these last exams. This is my second school,i  graduated from nurse school too. I am very anxious and i feel very pressured. 
So this morning i said that I hope I could have someone to help me out during my exams and my mother said that if I was in a relationship with a doctor I would have someone. This might sound like not something special but consider that 1) I am already stressed with my exams, 2) we have history in arguments for this specific reason about all of my relationships (my present one is an engineer student) and 3) My boyfriend has proposed, so he is not even my boyfriend any more, he is my fiance.
She knows that he has proposed and i said yes but she never considered us as engaged.

131,"Before you say anything, yes I have spoken to a doctor and a few therapists/psychiatrists  and unfortunately did not make much progress. (Also as per subreddit rules, I mention that I am living in the US)

The reason I post here is because I am hoping to make progress on this internal problem of mine I have had for several years. Maybe even receive advice from people with the same problem as me.

The things I like are forcefully associated with things that disgust me so whenever I think of one, I think of the other.

I cannot enjoy much in my life anymore because of this and the memories of these associations are permanent almost. I have to be careful about setting aside time to enjoy hobbies because they may be ruined by a stray thought or a random incidence that disgusts and gets forcefully/permanently associated with it.

Can't like ice cream because every time I think about it, my mind forcefully conjures feelings, thoughts, and images about....disgusting things I shouldn't really state here but you get the idea.

I've already visited therapists and looked for self help but I seem to have bad luck when it comes to these things. I am unable to find helpful information on this.

I am hoping someone here is able to offer advice on this specific situation. Is there a subreddit that can help me with this? Books or videos or anything?

Ive always been a bit of an anxious person but in the last few months my paranoia has gotten extreme and is destroying my life. I constantly feel people hate me and are speaking about me badly behind my back, i worry one day ill realise its all a sick joke and no one actually ever liked me or that im really just a crazy person they talk to to be nice and my brain just makes up the rest and its not all really there, people assure me this isnt true, but i can barley sleep or eat from the stress it causes me, its damaging my relationships and exhausting me, i feel like im at breaking point, my brains so loud and busy and full of intrusive thoughts and ive stressed myself out enough to be experiencing some hallucinations especially when im tired (people running out, or standing behind me or hearing my friends talking in sentances i cant understand when im home alone). I want to speak to a doctor again but im scared they will lie to me or not bealive me, a bit of a year ago i was given depression and anxiety medication but i got scared they might be placebos and threw them away. Has anyone experienced anything like this and can offer me any advice on how to deal with it myself or how to overcome my fear of the doctors?

I couldn’t tell where I was, my vision wouldn’t stay straight, my heart was pounding. I couldn’t stop shaking. I can’t explain the way I was feeling. It lasted hours. I had to have my friends walk me home I was so paranoid. When I finally got home, I tried to calm myself down but I couldn’t do it. At one point I convinced myself that my teeth had turned inwards and my jaw broke. I’ve never been this paranoid before. Can someone help me figure out what this could have been?

134,"For background, growing up, I had a rough childhood emotionally. I used to be physically abused too, not anymore. I would be gaslighted a lot, and manipulated. There was a lot of screaming and anger. No stability or consistency. 

I have developed severe trust issues, and can’t trust anybody. I can’t open up to anyone emotionally, and I have an abandonment fear. And when it’s triggered, I get anxiety attacks. My hands will start shaking and stuff. And I’ll start having nightmares of being abandoned. Sometimes if I feel like somebody is trying to hurt me/has hurt me, I’ll distance myself. Sometimes I’ll even treat them poorly if I feel like they don’t care, or are gonna hurt me.But I don’t want to be a bad person, it just kinda happens, and I always feel guilty after. One time I treated my friend poorly because my one other friend was treating me poorly. And I felt bad.

I have a lot of built up anger, and I just contain it all in. I stay mad/sad for hours. Sometimes when I get super mad, I’ll pinch myself, and have thoughts of punching people, as bad as that sounds. And I can mad at people over little things, but it depends. Like I’m still mad at this one girl for correcting me.  I’m still mad over that 6 months later, I know it’s stupid, but I can’t help it. Sometimes I can be happy with people, but if I feel like they hurt me, I can like them, but I may start to not like them again if I think about what they did in the past or something. 

At one point of time, my self-esteem was horrendous, I used to call myself stupid, worthless, etc, and be upset every day. I’m not really like that anymore. But sometimes my self-esteem isn’t really good at all. Sometimes I start thinking about how I may not be good enough for certain things, or blame myself. Sometimes I can get sad out of nowhere. I’ll start thinking of sad stuff like death, and start crying, but sometimes this only just last days. Like I only feel empty/sad for days. Usually something triggers it. Sometimes I feel empty a lot, but maybe I’m just bored lol.

I have Asperger’s, so that already comes with some of its struggles. I get anxiety a lot. Over little things, but I don’t know if I have other problems too. And this may sound stupid, but that’s what I’m worried about. Having other problems. I’m still fairly young, and I can’t really get a therapist on my own",17Jun2020,1
135,"Hey, so lately I've been feeling really ""meh"" about things. When I was severely depressed one of the main things was not enjoying anything and not wanting to do anything and I'm a little worried I'm falling back into that. 

My financial situation is quite bad so after being declined any kind of government help I have contacted an agency about being a TA. They love me and my experience and educational background but the problem is many schools around are still not opening yet so I'm kinda just waiting for that to happen. I have my own business that I started in January but that went to hell as it involves close contact with people :( 

So I am basically just passing time at the moment, playing a lot of video games. I try and keep my flat clean and tidy to make me feel like I'm accomplishing things but even that has kind of worn off a bit and there isn't much to clean now. I like to write and stream but I haven't written much in a long time and find it difficult to start &amp; get in the zone. I have barely streamed at all for the last month or so as I just haven't felt like I'm in the mood or that it wouldn't be fun or that people wouldn't enjoy watching or what I'm playing. I don't really know what to play anymore because the games I do play in my own time I don't think are worth me streaming (Destiny 2 I play but I don't know much about the weapons etc, I mostly just play it to run around and shoot things, and Sims 4 I'm a bit all over the place with my saves). As for social stuff I live with my partner and we play destiny together pretty much every day and then he goes to work in the evening for his night shift so I kind of go to bed and watch movies. I have some close friends that I often message on facebook/discord since I can't really hang out with them in person at the moment. 

I don't really know what I'm looking/hoping for with posting this... I guess I just wanted to vent a bit that I'm sort of losing a bit of meaning to my life. I have some creative projects that I work on rarely. I think I tend to find reasons to not do things and then finding motivation to do things gets difficult.",17Jun2020,1
136,"I suffer with severe mental health and I have for years. I didn’t have a great relationship with my mum so I moved in with my dad at 14 and after a year of not speaking to her our relationship began to repair. We still have our arguments but I began working with her on our family business in December. Yesterday she told me she planned to move to Spain with my grandma and my dog. She told me I would run the business from the UK with my alcoholic and racist uncle who was employed with us just this week. My heart broke. We ended up having a massive argument, I had a panic attack and couldn’t stop crying, I felt as though my life was being pulled apart. She called me selfish for acting like this saying she needed a better life! I called her selfish for moving abroad! She then kicked me out of her house. I spent the night contemplating killing myself as I was so overwhelmed, emotional and angry but my dad calmed me down. I’ve come back to her house (to work) this morning and we sat in silence for hours, my other family, aka my grandma and my uncle have both slagged me off over the phone. Eventually we ended up talking and my mum told me my behaviour and attitude was horrendous, she said she understood but I’m sorry she clearly dosent! She said I was making it out to be her fault which I said it was, and when she asked why I told her she was ripping my life apart. She then said in a very spiteful tone “there we go it’s all about you again”... I should point out I’m 20 years old and live with my dad, but due to my mental health I’ve created this safety bubble and now I don’t have that😭 

My mum currently lives next door to my dad, which is how it’s been my whole life! I go over every day and watch tv, work, go for lunch and days out with my mum and play with my dog. But if she moves to Spain I can’t do that, my life will literally change so much and I’m scared! I don’t want to lose my dog, she’s the only one that keeps me happy when I’m very depressed! I just.

137," A few months ago, a Reddit user by the name of [u/Auroraglint](https://www.reddit.com/u/Auroraglint/) wanted a painless way to commit suicide. They posted it on [r/Advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/) and I gave them a painless method by using a bathtub and razors. Shortly after my comment, they replied with a thank you message and said they will return if they decided not to commit suicide. They never returned and the user was deleted. Even the post was deleted by the moderators so that it could go unnoticed unless someone uses an internet archive tool. They were an active user on Reddit with a lot of posts over a long period of time so it was definitely not a throwaway account.

138,"After my siblings passed (I was 1 at the time) my parents divorced but both dotted on me big time. I was the golden child - whatever I want I got, my shit didn't smell. The slightest effort was rewarded with praise and hero worship. Constantly told I was smart, it was drilled into me that I was smarter then everyone else my age.

I'm not a psychologist but being 40 years old now looking back I can see that it setup this mindset, which was reflected in my report cards ""can do excellent work if he applies himself"". As school got harder I just applied myself less. I developed a fear of success *and* failure and just went middle of the road I guess.

To this day I talk to people like they are dumb, I have this feeling of superiority, that is totally unjustified. I know it, I see myself doing it, I know I don't have anything to back it up. In fact in skill sets outside of playing video games I am severely lacking in every aspect. Weak at math and so on. 

How the hell do I break out of this toxic behaviour that has been my goto for 40 years?

Not acting that way is a sustained effort and easily ""forgotten"" the next day or even the next hour.

The sad part is (maybe I am delusional) but I found weed use is helping my mental health but certainly killing my motivation in the office. I've been thinking alot that shrooms might be some sort of catalyst to crack my toxic ego but that can go south if I have a bad trip.  I havn't smoked weed since high school and never tried shrooms.

141,"For a bit of background: I am 21y/o female with anxiety, depression and ocd. These issues all came about when I was 10 to 13 years old.
 
For the past year, I have been going through these weird ‘moods.’
There are 3 moods: 

1)I feel impatient, irritable, and act on impulse. If there’s something I want or that I think will help me, I HAVE to get it. I need to find a way to make it possible. This mood makes me worry a lot about the future. And with the impulse that this mood gives me, I make rash decisions. For example, applying to a job, or considering moving to a different town, looking at houses and applying for different courses without a second thought or any consideration. Sometimes I will have dark thoughts in this mood e.g.: self-harm or suicidal thoughts. No intention of acting on the thoughts, but they come up out of nowhere.

 
2)The Second mood is a bit nicer. But still intense. It’s sort of childlike, carefree, and free spirited. When I’m in this mood my attitude is ‘screw it, I’m young, I want to be free and have fun.’ During this mood I can be a bit reckless. For example; quit jobs without a second thought, etc. I wouldn’t say I’m on top of the world when I’m in this mood, but I’m definitely able to think more positively about everything, and actually get things done like daily chores.

 
3)The third mood is how I want to feel all the time. I just feel like… Me. I feel balanced. If I feel ok that’s great, if I don’t feel ok, that’s ok too. I accept the feelings as they come up. I feel more like my true self. I’m calm, collected and balanced. I can finally hear myself think.

 
 
I know no one can diagnose me. But I was wondering If anyone could tell me if they think this might be something more or different to anxiety and depression. I’m not sure whether to talk to my doctor or not. I guess the fact I’m aware of the moods is good, but the problem is they are so intense that I make decisions based on them, and then when I come out of those moods I’m stuck with the consequences. Can anyone give me any advice? Is this normal for my condition? Or should I speak to my doctor? Any help would be really really appreciated. I’m struggling with these mood changes and just want to feel balanced.

142,"okay so, i don’t really post stuff on here, so if i suck at explaining all of this i’m sorry. 

i have dealt with mental issues starting at age 11 due to a lot of issues with my parents. father left when i was a baby, mother has been a drug addict my entire 18 years of life. 

at age 13, i started dating a guy who was 2 1/2 years older than me. we dated on and off for about 6 years and he was extremely verbally abusive; sometimes physically. i was in therapy from age 13-15, where i was diagnosed with manic depression and general anxiety disorder. they prescribed me prozac, though i couldn’t tell you if that worked at all because i hardly remember. 

i’m now with my current boyfriend of 6 months and living with my grandparents. recently, though, i’ve felt my mental health has been dropping at an alarming rate. i have dealt with self harm since age 11. i have been incredibly irritable, lashing out over the smallest things, feeling suicidal, you name it. my moods go from 0-100 in a matter of SECONDS. 

i will make up the craziest shit in my head. slenderman is watching me, my boyfriend hates me and is going to break up with me. and these things i fully convince myself of. 

something new, however, are the voices i hear late at night. weird shadows on my walls. i constantly feel like i’m being watched and will even talk out loud to whatever presence is there. i really feel like i’m going crazy. i told my boyfriend this, and he mentioned paranoid schizophrenic. he’s really into psychology and studies it religiously - could that be a possibility? 

i’m writing this on no sleep, so i’m sorry if it’s a bit messy and all over the place. insomnia has been a bitch lately and i haven’t slept in a little over 24 hours.

i would really appreciate if someone could shine a light on this. my grandparents are highly religious and against therapy and medications. even though i’m 18, i don’t have my license because i’m too scared to drive, and they would probably kick me out for “rebelling” against them.",17Jun2020,1
143,"TW: sexual assault, mental health

TLDR: had a mental breakdown and started hearing voices that revealed trauma I was not aware of. I can’t tell if there’s something truly wrong with me or if there’s some truth in my madness.


I recently had a mental breakdown. It started with ringing in my ears and feeling like something was crawling into my ear while I tried to sleep.

It got to the point where I couldn’t fall asleep for 3 days. By the 3rd day, it was the full moon and my spiritual group was facilitating a meditation ceremony. I joined in and at the end of it, I felt compelled to continue my spiritual journey.

I left my partner that night to move back home where it’s closer to like minded people. My partner, being the sweet and caring woman she is, allowed me to stay and rest at her place before I left.

That’s when it started. I tossed and I turned, but I couldn’t fall asleep. Then I felt a wave of pins and needles wash over my body from my head to my toes. I felt vulnerable so I started chanting to try and get even just a wink of sleep. A little after I started chanting, I started to hear chanting coming from my partner’s bedroom and I assumed she was watching something or listening to chanting to sleep.

By 4am, I heard someone moving around and I thought her mom had come home so I left to avoid the awkwardness.

Bear in mind, I honestly felt that I was being called for a divine purpose so I drove in silence and chanted in my mind.

Not long into my drive, I started to hear classical music. I thought maybe some wires got loose and my radio was malfunctioning. The radio was off but the music kept playing. I could even change stations but again- the radio was off.

Then I heard voices. It was my dad and step mom talking. He was annoyed that I was calling him at 5 in the morning. It was so faint but my dad was saying something about how my signal is so much clearer. I glanced at my phone and it was off. He hung up and soon later, I had called him again. With my thoughts. It couldn’t have been. I honestly thought I was either hacked or it was 5G.

I kept accidentally calling him with just my thoughts to the point where I had to actually use my phone to call and see if this was real. Guess what? It was. I actually called my dad with my thoughts and heard his voice through my car stereo. It didn’t even register that I called him in my call history.

I freaked out and by the time I got to my mom’s place, I had accidentally called some stranger who was trying to help me change frequencies on my phone but I could barely hear him.

Every thought I had was being projected into phone calls. I ran into my mom’s place shaking and panicking.

That’s just the beginning. So much more happened. I have to summarize at this point.

I got tricked by what ever spirits and pranked. They tortured me mentally and made me look like a fool. They said it was my karma because I killed somebody in a different reality and that I will have to kill myself. If I told anybody, then those who I care about will die. They wanted me to isolate myself away from love.

I ended up at my sister and her boyfriend’s place. It was my sister’s boyfriend who I killed in that other reality and his friends were out for blood. However, I am not that person. I am a different version. I felt so much remorse and desperately wanted to end the pain, anger, and hate.

I found a loophole and ended up staying. I asked if they knew anybody who could exorcise me. I don’t know if my mom said something or it just organically happened, but they ended up having a ceremony (I did not ingest or smoke anything) and I was shown truth. That I’m truly an asshole but I have the strength in me to break the cycle and be humble and more caring towards others.

In my visions I saw that for many many life times I was an evil person who killed, raped, and did atrocious things. Those versions and past lives didn’t care to repent and just pushed it to the next incarnation until all of that karma landed on me.

They called me the benevolent one. The one who could stop this cycle. Thousands of voices started swarming in my mind, fighting with each other and trying to control me. I started talking to myself and tried to take control.

They said some horrible things. By the time I went to bed to try and sleep, they told me I had a golf sized tumour in my brain and that I had to immediately go to the hospital or I will die.

By 2am, I woke up in sweats and panic. They told me I needed to call an ambulance immediately. I worried my sister and got her to drive me to the hospital where the voices panicked me into raising my voice at one of the hospital workers.

They gave me Ativan and left me in a room. I overheard the nurses trying to find reasons to lock me in the psych ward. The voices filled me with paranoia that I won’t ever get out. Then they laughed at me and revealed that they wanted me locked up so I’d kill myself because they thought I was too weak to be their leader. 

They pushed these awful thoughts in my head about everybody I care about.

Okay that’s enough back story. Some of the things the voices said to me were very disturbing. I want to explore these revelations but I’m not sure if it was just my imagination or if there could be some truth.

The one thing that is really bothering me is that they told me my first girlfriend drugged me and let someone fuck me while I was passed out for money. I was only 16-17.

I don’t know if this is true or the voices wanted me to feel completely alone and that I couldn’t trust anyone. This is just one example of the horrible things that they said happened to me.

At this point I really want to believe that they were just playing tricks on me but I honestly feel like it could be true and I don’t know what to do with this.

I’m really confused and want to explore these thoughts and “memories” but my psychotherapist won’t see me until I’m stable and on meds. I started medication but I’ve been trying alternative methods of grounding myself back to reality because I don’t want to be dependent on pharma. I don’t know if this is even something I want to put my energy towards.

It’s been bugging me because the more time passes, the more I try to make sense of what happened and I feel like I’m dismissing an important message.

It could be schizophrenia or some other mental disorder, but I don’t know how to explore this in a healthy manner without seeming crazy and being pumped with medication.

I believe that there is some divine truth in this experience mixed with my own mental instability and that’s where I’m confused.

The voices are gone now and I have managed to ground myself but I still think about what the voices told me and it’s really bothering me.

I don’t know what to do at this point. I can’t talk to anybody close to me about this because it’s very disturbing and I don’t want to worry them but it’s eating away at me.",17Jun2020,1

145,"I (M21) have been taking a long look at myself lately and I think I lack empathy. I've felt this since I was a kid but never really understood what is specifically wrong with me. There are so many memories from my childhood that I remember feeling bad because I was not feeling what I was supposed to feel. Whenever I saw something on the news/media/real life that was awful or sad for other people, I couldn't feel anything, even when it happened to people really close to me who I really loved. When some of my close relatives died I felt so bad I couldn't feel anything inside me and that I had to forcefully bring myself to tears and act like I cared in front of others. This has been a recurring thing in my life when I see people caring or feeling sad about something, I started acting like I did too just to fit in. I know this makes me sound like a terrible person but I was a kid and I didn't know any better. For the better part of my life I just brushed this off to the side thinking that I was just burying my feelings, that I was just looking at life in a very objective point of view, or that I was just not that emotional. But as I got older I knew this was not normal, that hinding my personality and acting in front of everyone in my life is unhealthy. But I also recognised that people categorised this as a bad thing, and when I tried to research about this online, I saw that lack of empathy usually stems in sociopaths/psychopaths but I don't have the other tendencies of these diagnosis. I don't feel the need to hurt anyone or anything, I don't feel joy when someone is hurt, I just feel numb. I might sometimes put myself first and think about or do things that would benifit me over others, but I never did something just for the sake of it. People don't like someone or feel comfortable around someone who doesn't feel empathy, so I just continued doing what I have always been doing.

Now I started realising that this is a big disadvantage in my life. I'm afraid I won't form any meaningful relationsips with anyone, and even if I did I don't want keep acting fake my entire life. It's exhausting for me to keep up this charade but I fear that if I don't, I will lose all my current relationships with not only my friends but also my family. I've been taking some phylosophical classes recently and apparently ethics can be learned by ""practice"". So I started thinking about my own situation; is it even possible to learn empathy? If so, how can I do it?",17Jun2020,1
146,"I've always been emotionally all over the place. I remember clearly being told I was way too emotional for my own good. I was also a wierd kid. I would sit for hours staring st a spot on the wall but I was really inside my head playing. I could create whole stories and play characters while my toys lay on the floor in front of me. 
I digress
I have been trying to work out what's happening. I know I get anxious, also depressed. I do this thing with anything that is worrying me where I run it over and over in my head and can't think of of anything else and I get upset first that can last days, then frustrated and angry when this happens I will get irritable and short tempered and sulky but needy and unable to reach out to my partner because I don't think they want to be near me. Then I get angry and flat I put on a mask that is stone faced all day and in private or at night I can't stop muttering to myself angrily. 
The only way I can escape it is to either distract my brain with something which works for a while or sometimes I can turn all my feelings off but then I am cold and like a robot and I want to sleep all the time and can't talk to anyone. It's ruining my relationship and hurting my daughter. I think she thinks I'm ignoring her when I'm shut down and can't anything.
I've tried to go to coucelling a couple of times both times I was in the middle of obsessing over a problem so I couldn't see anything else at all so basically all I did was tell the therapist how m7ch of an arse my partner was because it was a relationship issue I was currently stuck on. I came out the other side feeling embarrassed at my ranting and anxiety kicked in and I couldn't go back to that therapist. 
The last one I just couldn't call back to book a second session and I don't know why and now it's a 6 month wait to see someone there as they have a waitlsit so I blew that too.

It seems as if I can't get better at anything, as if practice doesn't make perfect in my case.
I've tried multiple hobbies, I've tried being specific and trouble shooting my self to see what exactly it is that I have to practice. I've tried being methodical and keep my expectations low and just enjoy myself but nothing helps. No matter how much I practice I never get better.

People tell me to stop comparing myself to others and just do what I enjoy but I've found that never feeling like I'm at least decent at something takes away all the joy. What's the funin doing something that I suck at? What's the fun in doing something if I can't see any progress? I want to feel that I'm good at the things I do. It seems as if the usual way that works for normal people doesn't apply to me, whenever I try to set goals and practice there's never any achievement.

And yes, I've tried different things to try to find what I'm ""naturally good at"" but it turns out I just suck at everything and it breaks my heart.

I have a Panik disorder (agoraphobia) and as soon as I come in contact with people (in real live or over the phone virtual meetings etc.) I become extremely tense and start sweating.
I slowly started getting better with handling the panic inside my head that I can basically have contact with people. But I am still sweating so much...if I have to talk to a friend I will be mostly fine, because they know of my problem( I can change shirts, and in general I sweat less around them but still), but once I have contact with someone that is not one of my 3 closer friends my shirt is drenched in sweat after a few minutes, which makes it almost impossible to work on my phobia/ makes it worse .

Well because maybe I think I’ll look better or my face has changed ah how stupid am I to think like that.Id always look in the mirror at school and my friend would always say ‘stop looking in the mirror’ thinking I was so full of myself even though that wasn’t the reason.I know I’m overreacting but it hurts so much like theirs not one part of me I like whatsoever and that’s from head to toe and I don’t even like my personality.sometimes I’ll wake up in a good mood or be happy when I listen to happy music but I never last long ,no distraction ever does.However this week is just worse like I enjoy going to sleep so I don’t have to think or worry but I hate waking up because I’m sick of repeating the same day and I’m sick of seeing myself.

162,"Yesterday I finally to my therapist about something that was on my mind for quite a while. I'm somewhat scared of my father. For example: I get really anxious and panic when he's close to me in the kitchen and when I'm somewhere with him I do this weird shuffle to make space. I also get uncomfortable when I notice him eating something (which is a problem in general) and when I hear him breathing. In last three to four years I kind of remembered weird things from my earlier childhood I'd forgotten (I'm 17 now).
I learned how to shower and bathe alone really late. In primary school my dad still bathed with me and washed my hair, both naked. I remember touching his, you know what, but the context is blurry and I think he told me not to, but I'm really not sure about anything regarding that besides that not much happened.
There was also this thing about 'fondling'. He often wanted to run the back of his hand down my face, which I wasn't comfortable with. When he took me on day trips or got me something that made me happy I let him do that because I wanted to give him something back, show I was thankful. I was brought up showing graditude and being respectful towards you elders, so i felt like I had to. Same goes for a goodnight kiss on the lips. My therapist told me that even little kisses on the lips from parents to children were weird, which never occured to me.
Despite being brought up without many restrictions I always felt (and sometimes still feel) very dependent and homesick whenever I was at a sleepover and I still feel the need to label myself a child. Sometimes I just feel like i need get out of here, my parents' house and I'm nervous typing this right now. 
I feel guilty and stupid for my feelings and for making a fuss about these things, but I know that won't help the situation. I'll meet up with my half sister in a few days and talk to her about this and some other family matters. Maybe she knows something I don't or has similar feelings about some things.

164,"A little backstory:  


I'm 25 and live in Manhattan, and have been without a job since December of 2019. I was a contractor who's contract ended and I was to join another firm in March. However, due to COVID-19, the role never came to fruition and it was involving an industry that became decimated due to the pandemic. Since then, I have applied to more than 175 jobs, have barely gotten any responses back, and haven't had any social interaction in person other than my roommates.  I've reached out to more than 100 people on LinkedIn, edited my resume more than 20 times, and have been desperately trying to find a role every single day, for hours on end. Since gyms have been closed and that was the main release of all my pent up energy and stress, I haven't been able to workout properly since March. I've lost more than 30 pounds of fat and muscle (and now I'm scrawny and thin), my hair is starting to fall out, white hairs are appearing, and my depression and anxiety have gotten so insane to a point where I will have full-fledged nervous breakdowns on a weekly basis because of my inability to get a job.   


I've screamed at my parents multiple times asking if I can kill myself because I no longer can deal with the constant rejection and feeling like a failure, I've lost control and collapsed in tears in the fetal position and cried myself to sleep at least once a week, I've lost the motivation to take care of myself, and all I do now is sit on my computer and focus all my time and effort into applying to jobs.   


My worst tendencies such as self-harm have resurfaced, I have bruised myself and caused bleeding, and the more I get rejected, the more I feel like a failure. My antidepressants are no longer working, I am unable to sleep properly, my skin has aged, and I feel like my body is falling apart because of all this stress. I don't know why my friends are able to handle the situation better, but I feel like I'm losing my purpose. I'm tired of the false hope that every job posting I apply to provides, to only be ghosted or have no clue if I'll get a callback. 

What should I do? I'm thinking of going to see my parents for the first time in three months, but they live in an area where I have no friends, nobody to hang out with other than them, and I feel like I'd be just as miserable. What should I do? If this continues for the next 4 weeks, I know for a fact I will probably jump off my apartment's roof. I can't deal with this anymore. I need a fucking job, I'm tired of feeling worthless, I'm tired of not being able to work out, to see any of my friends in person, to have a routine, and I am seriously afraid I'm going to end up doing something that's not reversible.

168,"Hello,

Recently, I got shocked to realise how my brain changed the way it seems to work/respond to certain situations and I was wondering if I can find any advice here. I have been struggling with my job for a while now, feeling demotivated to do anything and finding it so hard to get myself to do any tasks. To describe the feeling it was like any task is overwhelming to me and my brain loses focus and starts racing and stressing which just makes it worse. This feeling causes me to not want to even attempt the task and makes it constant battle with myself to even start working.

I thought it was because I was just not interested in my work and that's why I was finding it so difficult to focus but today I played a computer game first time in a long time. I used to love games and could spend hours reading the theory, which builds would be best, what the characters do etc etc. Since this time it was a game I never played there were a lot of unknowns. And the game was quite complicated. I instantly started feeling the same feeling of being overwhelmed at the idea of learning all those things, got stressed and couldn't enjoy the game at all. It's as if my brain wanted to escape the complexity into something simpler. But I don't understand why, since I used to love to explore the games and they would only bring me joy not stress. I used to love complexity to some extent too. Learning difficult things would bring me joy and I used to be a very good student.

I have no idea why I changed like that... Does anyone have similar experience? Is there a name for that? And what are some ways to fight it?

I'd love to go back to just calmly approaching complex and challenging things whether they are games or learning new things. With my current state of mind it seems impossible to learn anything new, even if I'd like to.",17Jun2020,1

176,"Dear Reddit,

Due to the sensitive nature of this subject: I decided to make this a throwaway account. I am not a native English speaker, so excuse any sentences that are sloppily put together.

The reason for this post is due to the escalating decline of my father's mental health, and we as a family are not sure what exactly is going on. My father is unwilling to try out any medicine or seek out any professional help, which leaves us powerless and confused in an ever-worsening situation. His general profile would be:

*59 year old male*

*Blue collar job*

*Married for 35 years (36 years in a relationship)*

*In nation of origin together for 5 years, in current country of residence for 30.* 

*Oldest son is 32, youngest is 21.*

*Everyone in the family is alive except grandfather, grandmother has early signs of dementia.* 

My father has become increasingly more incapable to lead his life as is, and to treat the people around him normally. This started about 4 years ago and has been steadily growing worse. Four years ago, or ever since, nothing specifically happened that I could define as a 'genesis' to this problem. I will list the issues that are escalating below:

1). My father becomes arbitrarily enraged and verbally aggressive over a variety of events happening in the household. From the thickness of cut tomatoes, the decision to watch another episode, to the cleanliness of the kitchen or the leaving behind of a glass. He has no history of OCD or any cleanliness-related specifications. He is not shy to demean or insult relatives over their incompetence, lack of intelligence, spoiled-ness or uselessness as mother/son/uncle, etc.

2). If he is addressed or spoken to, regardless of tone or timing of the day: most of the times, my father becomes enraged as well or shuts down. He either starts to loudly exclaim to leave him alone, or he completely ignores everyone in the room. Especially when there are situations that involve guilt or mistakes, such as forgetting a grocery item or a deadline, he loses his temper. It makes no difference whether you address this in an accusatory fashion, or merely mention it in passing. 

3). For all affairs pertaining to the household and family, he feels blamed or wronged. Without mentioning a party, he'd immediately jump to yelling or insulting as if he is a blamed party. He has a strong tendency to make every situation about himself, hijacking conversations about other family member's tragedies to complain about his own current sad situation. He has a strong victim narrative and a constant sense of being attacked. Something cannot go wrong, without him either partly feeling blamed or attacked implicitly by others around. 

4). My father has an obsessive tendency to describe fantasies of departing from his current country of residence and to return to his homeland, leaving everyone behind and going off the grid. Whenever situations escalate, he would resort to threaten his family that he would disappear and depart tomorrow because he can't take it anymore. He ignores the imminent birth of his grandchildren, his existing children (one still requiring his support to finish his education) and his (house)wife. He uses these threats against his wife primarily, trying to subdue her in fear of her longtime partner/chief financial contributor departing. Since 3 years, he no longer can guarantee being around his family in times of need. Changing his explanation from ""I'll be far but close"" to ""You'll never see me again"", from ""I will drag my child through college"" to ""He is old enough, he can handle himself"". These constant changes to the narrative makes life seem unstable. He also mentions divorce, suicide or abandoning his family a lot. Same for his decision to stay around for his upcoming grandchild. Sometimes he's important enough to stay, but later that day, he is going to leave us all anyways. 

5). He forgets appointments, promises or conversations entirely or partially: changing his perception or substance of his words within a couple of days or even hours. Long-term agreements regarding debts, payments, housing, education, family or their marriage post-children have changed almost consistently. He has sold items, destroyed important items (a tree in remembrance of our deceased dog, or old material from his children, etc) or sold family items (our boat, a model gun, etc) without any consultation or even in defiance of agreements. Even though he forgets them, he has a tendency to accuse his wife and my brother (eldest child) of manipulating him. You cannot hold him accountable without a total meltdown happening. He forgets and changes past events so much, that we suspect that dementia might also be a factor. His mother has it too. See point 3.

6). He has increasingly radicalized perception of the world and hostile opinions about other countries, his current country of residence, the people, the culture, etc. He is comfortable wishing death upon entire groups of people in relation to 'cosmic karma' for geopolitical events that hurt his homeland in the past. He furthermore expresses hostile ideas such as scratching a car with his key that is parked too long in front of our home, that X person should be hanged, etc. Any nuance previously held in his worldview has been entirely evaporated. 

7). He obsessively demeans the hobbies and interests of his relatives and friends, from insulting the quality of the media we consume, the music we listen to or the activities we have. He does not support any (creative) life decision nor respects different opinions, actively seeking out opportunities to express distaste.

8).  He sleeps in marathons in both the weekends and workweeks. He goes to work at 6:30, comes home at 5PM. After dinner, he usually sleeps between 5:40PM - 11PM, and then from 12AM to the time he wakes up in the morning. Sometimes during weekends, he'd in addition also sleep in the afternoons.

9). He expresses a consistent unwillingness to go out or meet any people outside of the house, and does this as well. He complains about guests, friends or family visiting aggressively and rejects any proposals pertaining to family activities or visiting other places. Every time his presence is expected to a degree we cannot leave him home, getting him to join us requires excessive convincing or fighting. He has been losing friends consistently by simply not contacting them anymore, this includes friends from his homeland or in other countries.

10). He is increasingly unable to maintain normal conversations without his attention fading onto something else, him getting enraged or him repeating the same point excessively. Sometimes this also turns into him ignoring you, or changing the subject entirely. If you demand an answer or state that he has already told something, he would also grow mad. His friends are starting to complain about this, expressing openly that he is becoming annoying or repetitive. 

11). He no longer does anything physically affectionate to his wife and children (hugging or sexual/tender activity to his wife, etc) and sleeps in a separate room. Whenever anyone wishes to touch him, he roughly removes your hand/arm and expresses that he needs to be left alone, that he is being suffocated, etc. His lack of affection prompted his wife to accuse him of having an extramarital affair, which he reluctantly denies. 

12).  He no longer listens to music, watches any media or has any hobbies of his own outside of working, sleeping and 'existing'. Any initiative to do what he was previously interested in is met with rabid opposition (see point 9).

While this situation is too complex to describe in bullet points, the general backdrop of all this is that we see a man that no longer communicates and behaves like he used to: and acts with increased aggression and incompetence at adhering to basic social norms or father-related expectations. He has been through a lot for sure. But relative to others and his former self, his inability to normally converse and behave is disproportionate. 

On the other hand, he has not filed for divorce and has refused to do so even though we've all told him we'd accept it. He has been repeatedly told to leave if he really wants to, but stays. He is the figure in the family with the financial means to entirely abandon us and sustain himself, yet he does not do so. The fact he sticks around and refuses to *actually* leave, makes us suspect other reasons than just ""an unhappy marriage"", etc. And for the record, there is no history of extreme marital conflict/cheating or fallouts between family members.

177,"I'm struggling with having a remotely positive self-image.

A bit of background - young(ish) adult, currently living overseas in the EU. Graduated from university, but never really found anything in my fields of study for a variety of reasons (can explain more if necessary). Currently practicing everyday to improve in language and one of my fields. Trying to take a step every day for future prospects (e.g. email to a grad school, work on a job application, etc.). Have struggled with some depression, but I've remained functional (showering, having a job, etc.).

The problem is... I virtually never feel proud of myself. I never feel like I do enough. Last night, I worked like a dog to finish up a couple of files so I could submit for a job application. It seemed like they turned out alright and I submitted everything. Then after that... I just broke down in tears out of shame that I knew I wasn't good enough. I had just worked hard, put forth my best work, have been improving, but I just broke down in pure shame.

Technically I had a little formatting... not quite error, but something I could have done better (with about the same importance as... idk, putting the date on a letter) and I could have further refined some things. But we all know that speed is important when applying to jobs as well. And... I don't think that's really the problem. I think even if I could have corrected those two things... I would have had the same reaction. I would have found something else to be ashamed over.

Does anyone have any advice for this? Stepping back, I don't think shame was the right response to have, but I don't know how to be proud of my self or happy with myself.

Thanks.",17Jun2020,2
178,"I don't know how I'm going to voice this out, but I'll try.

Quick backstory on my previous therapies:

- I've been to therapy twice in my life, the first one I don't really remember, because I was really young then, though my aunt told me about, which is why I know, and the second time I remember, because it happened back in 2018. The first one happened, because my aunt was concerned that I washed my hands way too much (and I mean like every few minutes), and while I don't do that any more (though I still wash my hands a lot), I do remember being in second grade, and taking an hour or more in the shower, because I was showering in the highest heat possible, and repeatedly soaping my self at least 5x, because I wanted to be really clean. I don't take long in the shower anymore, but I do take my time when it comes to my post shower routine. The second time I went to therapy was because I was suicidal ever since I was 10, and early 2018 I slit my arm to know what that feels like, and because I felt a rush in my body, which made me feel like doing it, though the slits weren't deep enough to the point it would scar or anyone would notice, because I was just after the quick feeling. I stopped going to therapy that same year, because I felt like I didn't need it anymore, because I wasn't suicidal anymore (I still don't feel suicidal, but I'll go on about me later).

Me:

- Ever since I was a little kid I've never felt emotion/empathy for others, and I don't know why. I just could never see myself in other's shoes, and even though my Catholic grandmother raised me to have empathy for others, I still can't do it, and end up lying about having empathy for others. I also lie a lot, and even though I don't have to lie about something, and even though I'm not hiding something when it comes to certain things, I still lie about it, and I couldn't stop myself from doing so, though I can be honest from time to time, and the only reason I'm confessing right now is because I'm confident no one I know irl is on here.

I also could never be authentic to anyone, and I couldn't hold a long term connection with others, and I meanconnections in general, I've never been in a relationship (I don't want to), but I find myself not having friends, because they're temporary to me, and will eventually leave. I actually don't even know what the ""real"" me is like, because of all these ""masks"" I show to each different person I interact with. I have my own hobbies, and this ""mask"" I speak of is a different version of me to fit in with different people when I'm outside (mostly school), and though I hate talking/socializing I still do it, because I feel like I have to, and it keeps me from looking like a nobody. 

I have been described as ""vain"" by some of my family members most notably by my grandfather (dad's side), because I apparently spend too much time with my grooming. I do find that I like myself more above everyone else, and I do find myself constantly manipulating others for my personal gain (also to make my self look good), and I know don't have to do these things, but just couldn't stop myself from doing so, just like with my lying. I don't know, but I guess I'm just narcissistic, which is also the reason I don't want to be in a relationship and long term friends, I just put myself above them.

My temper is also bad, and though I can keep it to myself when others are present, I always find myself swearing and screaming when I'm alone. My temper has always been bad ever since I was a child, and when I can't do something, whether that's something like origami or something art related, which I'm awful at btw, I always did break whatever I was making and threw it away.

I would never really do stuff like this, especially online, but this one is new, and I was debating with myself whether I should mention this or not, but recently I've been having homicidal fantasies. I had them with people I hate when I was younger, but this time these fantasies happen even with random people I see on the street, and I don't know why. I never thought of taking action, and everything homicide related is completely in my head. I recently found myself watching lots of stuff related to gore like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Ted Bundy Doc on Netflix, gore sites like bestgore, and etc, which fuel these thoughts more, but again these are completely in my head, and I don't intend in taking action.

I know that I could open up to my family like I did with my suicidal tendencies, but the only reason I did that was because I felt like doing that for change to happen, but for the rest from my lack of empathy and emotion, lying, and more I just feel like that couldn't be changed anymore, and I don't want them to think of me in a different way when I tell them all this + the fact that I don't believe in any religion, which I feel will fuck things up even more, because of how religious they are.",17Jun2020,1

183,"( I cuss a lot here so if you don’t like that then don’t read)

I had an online friend who randomly started blocking me on all the social media platforms we had each other on not too long ago. I’m pretty sure the reason why she did this is because I no longer allowed myself to be her “therapist” anymore. (I realize that our friendship was one sided and she only liked to talk about herself). 

Well the last time we texted she went on her usual bullshit about only talking about her problems and not giving a single fuck to ask me anything. She was going on about how this one mutual friend we had once randomly blocked her on all social media (how ironic) and I comforted her for a bit (fuck my dumb people pleasing ass). After a while though I had the courage to open up to her about the fact that this once “mutual friend” of ours is a huge piece of shit and basically preyed on me sexually. When I told her this she seemed unphased based on her replies. She basically acted like it was no big deal and then talked about how she still can’t believe that this person blocked her for no reason. Like excuse me? I just fucking told you that this person is disgusting scum and you’re worried about the fact that they blocked you? 

Then she changed the topic to talk about how depressed she was that her boyfriend had recently dumped her. I tried to bring up what I just told her and I even asked her “do you even care?”. She again seemed unphased and then clearly lied to me saying she did. She then began talking about her boyfriend again. At that point I was done. As a final attempt to get her to come to her fucking senses I asked her why she had blocked me on this other social media we were following each other on and she said “oh I don’t know about that” and yep, that was that. I left her on read and felt extremely disappointed. At first I couldn’t really process it. But now (2 weeks later) I’m finally realizing how much a piece of shit she is and I’m really angry. 

I’m tired of being hurt by people. Starting with my own family. I’ve been abused and hurt by people my whole life that I became a hermit because of it. I have social anxiety and agoraphobia and don’t like going out much. I already had major trust issues but now with this Idek. I feel my mind is starting to sink into even more darkness than it’s already been these last few years. I’m tired of people.

And I barely have any friends as it is so to lose someone from my already small circle is really triggering my fear of abandonment even though I know I’m better off without that scum. 

Another thing that I’m pissed off about is that I have a tumblr blog and I have about 3k followers and no one even gives a shit about my personal posts, but as soon as I post something “aesthetic” I get notes for that of course. And before anyone says anything, I know I shouldn’t expect people to give a fuck about me but it still hurts so much to be ignored. Idk why people ignore me but I’ve seen other people on that website say the dumbest things and they get lots of attention for it. I feel like people probably see me as this lunatic since I’ve talked about mental health on there before. Idk I’m just so angry and I feel like everyone is fake now. I’m really tired and done with people",17Jun2020,1
184,"It's been a tough few years for me.

Me and my brother were both subject to abuse since we were kids: my older brother was always scapegoated whenever I misbehaved, on top of the general disinterest and lack of encouragement we were given. Our parents hate each other (they hate each other today and they hated each other back then too) and always argued; it was never a stable household. 

Fast-forward to three years ago and both me and my brother were struggling; it was a crescendo of the years of neglect we had faced and we had both couldn't cope. It was around that time where I had my first mental breakdown: I had already been doing poorly; my parents had already moved me from my previous secondary school when I was 12 due to behavioural issues (mostly caused by my parents arguing throughout the week consistently over the most trivial things). My grades had been fine up to this point (despite me never studying and relying on video games to distract me from my bad home life) but due to a variety of factors I finally cracked. Almost out of the blue, I started to struggle with day to day tasks: I spoke slower, I thought slower, I was emotionally distraught, I felt awful. I told all of this to my parents who - instead of trying to help me - decided to gaslight me instead and act indignant towards a 16 year old because he was asking for help when he was struggling. Every day I would wake up and feel miserable, an utter shell of my former self that paced through life like a corpse. My grades plummeted while my parents said that nothing was wrong with me, saying that they thought nothing had changed (despite all evidence pointing to the contrary). 

I spent the next three years struggling also; the misery fluctuated with stressful situations, but never really went away. I devoted a lot of time pondering on what was making me feel so poor, and made progress very slowly. I noticed that whenever I woke up before my parents (my sleeping schedule being the mess that it is) I would feel comfortable and have some of this horrid anxiety leave my body, culminating in one instance where I felt like myself again (before my parents both woke up and the feelings of misery and anxiety came back). Only on my Gap Year (a year taken before university in the UK, typically to develop oneself or to partake in opportunities like travel) have I had the time to realise what has been going on in my family. I realised how much of a narcissist my mother was, constantly changing the narrative whenever it's to her liking (this has been especially toxic when it has involved my university choices) and gaslighting me whenever I point out her bullshit. My father isn't much better, doing the same thing he's been doing since I was born (sitting at home all day watching TV and getting into arguments with my mother). 

I've spent the past couple of months contemplating this heavily, waking up to the abuse and seeking help; it's been a source of major anxiety, combing over years of abuse and trying to understand it. I actually started to feel motivated however, coming to terms with the past and trying to break out of an anxious stupor. Sadly, I'm still under the same roof as my mother and father and am still financially dependent on them. 

This has all lead to me having another mental breakdown, similar to the one I had just under four years ago. I realise now how much my mental health has been impacted by my parents. All of the years of confusion, of anxiety, and of low self esteem make sense. I understand how my abusive parents combined with my other stressors contribute to my poor mental health and the stagnation of my personal development (I've become such a misanthrope these past couple of years and I'm thoroughly ashamed of it).

I just want someone to understand what I've been going through these past couple of years. I know what I've wrote is likely very confusing (my current stress level is pretty high) but I just want people to know what I'm going through. Any help/advice would be appreciated.",17Jun2020,1
185,"Hey guys- it says no soliciting here, so please delete if not allowed.

But I am considering starting a podcast that only talks about the random funny moments that can happen when living with mental (or even physical) illness. I have been dealing with MDD and GAD with Panic attacks since puberty and my spouse has OCD. Though it can be a struggle to communicate sometimes and we have our difficult moments- there are some moments that make us laugh. I it might be a good way to de-stigmatize mental illness and create a positive community where we can bond over positive things.

SOOOOO - what I wanted to know is- are there any (anonymous) stories that you would like to share here and/or with me on the podcast? I'll start!!!

So my funniest panic attack (in retrospect, obviously)::: I was living in a small city in Guatemala, and needed to go to the bank to change American money for Quetzales (Guatemalan money). This was years ago before there were a lot of options available for getting local money overseas. So it's this huge process that I've done before, where you have to wait in line for like an hour because it is the only bank and is so busy all the time. I have to bring my passport, have every bill inspected, sign papers, etc. It was a huge process and something I had set aside essentially a whole day to do, with travel included. Meaning- once I began this process, there was no bailing on it or I would lose a whole day.

(Just a bit of background on me- triggers for my panic attacks are food or health related things- especially my blood sugar) So I'm standing in line for over an hour already and I'm hot and I'm starting to feel trapped because I'm now in the middle of the room with people everywhere. I feel a little woozy maybe, so that triggers a full-on physical panic attack. I mean, tunnel vision, numb teeth, body tremors, weak knees, cold sweats, nausea, confusion, THE WORKS! So, now I'm the only American in this place and I stand out because of my height and complexion and I do what any seasoned Anxiety person would do. I sit my ass down on the floor in the middle of this bank and start fanning myself. I eventually laid down completely and EVERYONE starts to ask me what's wrong, if I'm okay, that the heat is too much for me, etc. Which makes it worse because Attention! Ack!!

So I'm laying in the middle of a bank floor in the middle of Guatemala with full body tremors, praying I don't shit my pants, puke, or pass out. But let me tell you - I was NOT going to bail on my money adventure for a panic attack. Luckily it passed before I got to the window and my day was not ruined.

190,"Pasting the comment I made in another sub I feel could help

I think most people are at least okay with their situation. What really happened to mentally ill people is that they lost the gene lottery and/or they got abused one way or another so much they developed unhealthy coping mechanisms that shouldn't be but are used in non-threatening life situations. 

Those mechanisms are not appropriate to the severity of what's happening but they work so they are ingrained in their user's(s') mind so much they don't know what else to do, but the problem is they take too much energy so either the user retreats to recharge or they keep going but can't face another situation that would trigger the coping mechanism again or else 

That's why therapy is important : it teaches what is or not normal, or at least what a sane person would think and do, and what is not. It is also why medicines/drugs alone don't help much on their own. 

Anyway, I kinda learned that thanks to that one Steven Universe Future episode where he goes to the doctor and they tell him what is probably wrong so for those who don't know that show, check it out (and yes, I'm probably older than their young target audience but it didn't prevent me from enjoying it).",17Jun2020,2

he opened up to me about his tough home life and i’ve always felt like we really connected. the thing is, i’m asexual and aromantic (something i only learned last year) and i don’t want him to get the wrong idea that i like him or anything. i haven’t spoken to him now in like two months but the reddit post was from a few days ago. he knows i deal with self-harm and various addictions so i really want to reach out. 

the thing is, i’m really depressed right now and i’m going through my own shit. i don’t know how to be there for another person when i can’t be there for myself, you know? anyways, these are just my thoughts i guess. i know i should text him. i probably will. ahhhh.",17Jun2020,1
204,"As someone who has personally dealt with mental health issues, I found being diagnosed so helpful, it helps me understand why I am the way I am, and gives me 'validation' in a way.

I just found out someone close to me who is quite young has been struggling with self harm, weight issues, and I suspect anxiety, and I was wondering is it useful to encourage them to see a doctor or would it be more helpful for them to maybe do things more 'holistically' like talking therapy, friends family, healthy eating, exercise etc,

Like at what point do you need an official diagnosis and this is something you're probably going to be dealing with for the rest of your life but you can manage your symptoms or can you just work on these issues without necessary defining them or labels

I hope that made some sense",17Jun2020,2
205,"Hello and thanks for the attention.

I'm a student (23f) and haven't been living at home for five years now. I don't visit often because I don't feel relaxed and at ease at home (like I very much do in the city where I'm living on my own). I hate being at home because it is messy and mostly dirty and also because my family is very disorganised (they never finish anything they start). That's why I have decided to just not come home very often and create a new life for myself. But recently, I have been feeling anxious and frustrated whenever I just hear from my mother via phone. She often tells me about horrible situations which are going on on the estate (e.g. yesterday she told me that our mom cat has left her kittens and doesn't want to feed them, and they still don't know how to drink the milk my mom has given them) and she constantly acts incapable of fixing things on her own. It is like she is paralysed which is, in turn, making me frustrated because the solutions to her problems are simple, but she just does not know how to apply them. I just end up being frustrated because I can't help, or feeling guilty because I don't want to leave the life I'm building for myself to come home and take care of my family.   
Is there a way to resolve this? Or do I just continue living with these feelings forever.",17Jun2020,1

Sometimes when I'm under very stressful or anxious situations I have these episodes where I'll feel completely numb and need to hurt myself. I'll usually cry for hours and be pretty incoherent- for example have a hard time walking and pulling myself together. At first I thought it was a panic attack.

I went to bed at 10PM and my body woke up at 12:30AM and I couldn't go back to sleep and I felt like shit this whole morning because of it. This exacerbated my anxiety issues even more and it just HAD TO HAPPEN the day of my interview. The worst part is I know I would've done much better if the interview was yesterday because I was on my game during my entire preparation and I'm a great interview when I am able to get a regular night of sleep.

223,"I've been to GPs and psychs since I was a teen for my symptoms and they tried 2 antidepressants ( sertralin and desyrel), both made me worst as they did ease my anxiety and restlessness but gave me additional symptoms such as increased brain fog,lethargy, suicidal thoughts ( when I've never been suicidal ever before) and oversleeping. I've tried Propanolol for anxiety too ( did nothing for me).

I live on energy drinks because it's the only thing that helps me.

I'm a male, 24. I currently don't take any medication. I did my own research and I think I might have ADHD ? A friend got diagnosed with it and we have similar symptoms.

My symptoms are :

\- Recurrent boredom and a need of constant entertainment. If I do nothing for a day for example, I get depressed and anxious. Lockdown has been a nightmare, I've hit a new low with depressive thoughts.

\- Random bursts of motivation that die out quickly, they will last a few hours and I will get so much done, then it's gone. Then I get frustrated, disappointed at myself and lash out at everything.

\- So many ideas. So many things I want to do but I will start, get bored, give up. Start something else. Repeat. It's a battle against myself to get anything done. Now I have a lot of performance anxiety, because I ""know how it goes"".

\- I feel depressed but because I feel like I'm not living up to my potential because nothing I want to do gets done. I don't hate my life or myself, I hate the fact that no matter how well I organise my days, it's a constant struggle to not have the schedule go completely south. My symptoms got worst over time, I used to be a very active kid but I guess nothing unusual stood out to my parents, then as a teen I became very rebellious ( excessive partying,attention seeking behaviour and troubles with authorities) and as an adult I got my shit together so to speak but as the responsibilities pile on I'm seeing my shortcomings more.

\- Really bad mood swings and getting frustrated quickly.

\- I can't stay still : I've lived in 3 different countries, I'm usually not staying in the same place more than a year. I can't work in an office or I get panic attacks after a couple months so I became a freelancer. But I can't settle down anywhere, I start hating it.

As I've lived with those symptoms, I did develop depression : low mood, etc. But depression came after  them, I feel like my depression is a product of not being able to function without it being a complete struggle.

I moved to Japan when i was 13 and it started to happen more often. I didn’t have any friends not even acquaintances. I would imagine myself going back to my country and seeing my old friends again. I would imagine them speaking to me and I would respond back aloud. This time it would happen when I’m just simply walking, bored in class, showering and anytime I don’t really need to pay attention to something which was most of the time. Sometimes I would start imagining them saying they miss me. I would just start crying and talking to them telling them how much I’ve missed them. 
My family and I don’t really have any sort of relationship aside from being related. We don’t talk about how we feel, since I really don’t have anyone to talk to. I would imagine I’m talking to my parents and opening up to them, I start a conversation with them, I would cry and tell them I need someone. It gets intense sometimes that I don’t just tear up. I sob. 
There are also those things like imagine I’m being interviewed, but I think everyone does that. I think that my experiences and depression are the main cause of why I’m talking to myself. I’m fully aware that I’m talking to myself but there are times where I get shocked about what I’m doing and think to myself if I’m mentally ill.

I never defended myself from them or anyone who attacked me, since my mother is a very strict feminist and always told me she’d kill me if I ever touched a girl, even to defend myself. During the last couple of years I’ve been getting more attracting and fit, so some girls contacted me over social medias asking me to send them nudes and sending me provoking pictures. A year ago, a girl texted me saying she wasn’t feeling good in her life and wanted someone to talk to, so I stupidly accepted, we started talking about depression, I talked about how I went through it and even attempted suicide at some point. She kept asking about me and said she was very lonely, she sent a picture of herself (obviously not herself) and told me to send her a picture of me, which I stupidly sent her. Then she started saying I looked attractive and stuff and said she started touching herself and wanted me to touch myself too. She sent me a couple of videos of her touching herself, so I ended up responding with videos of me, for which she threatened to blackmail me (even though she asked for them repeatedly). I blocked her, deleted any social media account and went completely offline. I was already very hesitant about girls back then, but since that episode I’m completely terrified and can’t even look at girls anymore, since I’m scared they may abuse me or put me in trouble.

So I've always been told I'm smart since I can remember and that I'm likable, and very very argumentative I guess. I always just threw away or procrastinated through my homework in school, while getting 80-100 percent on tests. I've always been told I'm weird. Some girls didn't want to sit on the same chair as me. I pathologically lied basically until 8th grade. Getting suspended for several times for several things. My parents and grandparents and even my nicest of family always said I had issues. My dad never smacked any of my younger siblings like he smacked me. After a lot of stuff I genuinely wanted to know what it felt like to kill somebody, my behavior scared people, I got put in a social exclusion group in high school my last days before I was expelled. I got my GED. I did a bunch of psychedelics and got over the wanting to kill someone part of my life but made a stupid post saying if you banned guns I could still stab up a school. The psychiatrist I talked to said I had Anti Social Personality Disorder (psychopath/sociopath) But I genuinely feel empathy. I also feel she twisted my words, this post is long enough but she purposely nitpicked to prosecute. I was getting out of the mindset she diognosed me with, I guess some showed through?

I've been told I'm too smart for my own good by several people, I've been asked several times if I was autistic or have Aspergers or ADD/ADHD in a serious sense from different people that didn't know each other. because I have trouble finding something right in front of me or don't know where something is that seems obvious to most people or where to set something, I've never had a job where my bosses didn't call me ""something special.""

242,"about 2 and a half years ago i was in a poly relationship, with a guy and another woman, we were all identifying as gender fluid at the time, however i was the first to come out to them. we’ll call them tod and amanda. 

i mention the gender because of what slowly started happening. 

after i came out and openly started talking about making my wardrobe more manly. maybe 2 weeks after, amanda started saying she was questioning, and then came out, and not even a week after we went to the mall and she blew $500 on clothes that were very, very masculine and wore everything MAYBE one time. after i left, she went back to identifying as female. 

she still lives in my area, tod moved thankfully. they were together a year and some months when i was added to the relationship, and stayed together about another year after i left. i was in the relationship about 5 months or so. 

one day, my fiancé and i were at the mall and they were in a store we were in, i immediately froze, started crying, and couldn’t move until they both paid and left the store, with my fiancé desperately trying to calm me down. 

amanda was controlling, we couldn’t have certain friends, we ALWAYS had to be over at her house if we weren’t busy, and she constantly asked us to do everything for her. tod had it the worst; if she asked him to make her bed, and the blanket wasn’t 100% perfect she’d flip out and storm outside and would be mad for at least the next 2 days. 

i don’t know if she and or the relationship really messed me up THAT bad, but if it didn’t i feel like i wouldn’t have the reactions i do. it’s very annoying and weird to me i get like that. i don’t know what to do about it and i don’t know how to fix it.

I have been well for a while now but over the last week my auditary hallucinations have been very loud and I keep falling into the trap of believing they are real. As well as believing my wife is cheating on me and almost buying a spy camera to  ""catch proof"" I've been working as a security guard and that means time alone at night with my crazy thoughts. Relapse could jeperdise my marriage and changing medications from pellerperidon 100mg to something stronger like olanzapine which I was on previously would be debilitating as I would sleep for 15 hours a day aswell as the extreme anxiety I get interacting with people when I am that tired.

245,"ever since covid 19 hit canada i’ve been in this depression like state where nothing interests me, nothing seems fun anymore, nothing makes me genuinely happy. i feel like i’ve run out of things to entertain me and i just feel sad and weak, even walking up the stairs feels like a mission, i feel like someone is grabbing onto my brain and squeezing it as hard as they can and won’t stop. i don’t even have the energy to reply to texts and snapchats. if someone has any tips about getting over this plz lmk, this is really frustrating me as before the pandemic began i was actually getting a whole lot better (i’ve dealt with mental illness and trauma before) and now i feel like i’m all the way back at square one",17Jun2020,1
246,"As of this morning, my boyfriend began inpatient treatment for the illnesses he’s struggled with for a while. It was a very sudden decision by him and his family but it was voluntary. I found out last night and luckily got to see him in person this morning to say goodbye. Due to COVID, no visitations are allowed. I’m also unsure what his contact privileges are. Therefore, I probably won’t hear from him at all during his stay. He will be there for at least a week but potentially longer. 
I’m struggling with my own emotions even though I know that this is what he needs. Any advice or reassurance is welcome and appreciated.",17Jun2020,1

248," 

(keep in mind that I'm 13 ,please) Recently I found out about this type of animes that's called lolicons, and I found out they were basically stuff for pedos. I started saying how it's wrong, and then someone told me that hating lolis might make me a pedophile, because hating pedos might be my mask of hiding that. And I've been thinking about that for two days, I feel like I'm a monster. I would never EVER touch a child in that way, I have never thought of a child in that way, but I fear that I might be a pedohpile. I started crying thinking that I'm a psychopath or a serial killer.So I searched online ''How to find out whether or not you are a pedophile'' And this thing came up with the title POCD, and read it through. I always thought OCD was basically obssesive cleaning and stuff like that.

Then I watched a video about OCD, and I realised ''Wait, this happened to me before''.

Last month, my mother told me that she liked the way my friend sings (14 is my friend), and somehow my brain told me ''Your mother is a pedophile for liking your friend'', I cried for nights and waited for it to go away, it went away like a week later.

Last YEAR, I thought that humans did not exist and they were just in my mind. For a whole month I suffered and cried everynight, hoping it was not true. It eventually passed when I went to school and kept my mind busy.

Two YEARS AGO, I lost a friend due to OCD. I thought that she was obsessed with me just because she hugged me. I thought she wanted to do stuff to me. SO I ghosted her. My mother always asked me why I don't want to talk to her, and I didn't want to tell her because I didn't want her to think like me.

The thing is, it hurts me, it makes me want to take a knife and just smash it in my head, and I'm afraid to tell anyone because I know that these things aren't true, but my mind tells me they are...I don't want to tell my mom to go to a therapist becuase she'll want me to explain why, what can I do,please?",17Jun2020,1
249,"When I was a sophomore in highschool I felt really alone. I really wanted a friend or something but I couldn’t seem to make one. I thought that I wasn’t a good enough person or I didn’t have a good enough personality for anyone to like me.

I began to try and change the way I think and processed things. It was/is really sad but it’s the truth. Anyways I tried for a couple of months to change who I was and I sort of developed this persona type thing where I process things differently than I normally would and I act different than I normally would.

Anyways a year and a half later I still can’t get rid of this “persona.” All I do nowadays is play video games because when I’m “disconnected” I feel like this persona is least noticeable. 

When I “reconnect” I feel like the only thing I can think about is executing my persona to perfection in every situation. It’s really hard to describe but it is fucking miserable and I don’t know how to fix it. It feels like I am the only thing that exists and I just focus on executing my persona. 

I can’t really describe how it feels but it’s horrible and I can’t live like this anymore. 

I seriously need help I’ve been thinking a lot about killing myself lately. I don’t want to die but it feels like I’m the only one in this situation. It feels like there is no answer. I can’t live my life this way. 

Although emotional support is appreciated it won’t help me. It won’t change the pain. I need the pain to go away. I need an answer or to be pointed in the direction of an answer or a fix.
I really desperately need advice. My life depends on it.",17Jun2020,1
250,"For some context, my mother last year underwent radiation and surgery to remove her breast tumor. Ever since then, me and my dad tried our best to support my mother. But, she's often talking about how she wants to stop working, she complains she can't eat anything, she constantly has mood-swings and lashes out at us, she isn't proud of her new body despite the fact that the doctors used implants from other parts of her body to shape her new ""breasts"". She feels deformed even though nobody notices the difference before and after. Just recently, we noticed her memory problems have started occurring more often than a usual amount. 

I have told her countless times that she should seek professional help about what she can and cannot eat but she always reads and references 'those' articles. She doesn't even trust my knowledge as a Pre-Pharm student. I want her to also seek a therapist as well but I don't know how to bring it up to her. It's especially hard cause I don't know if these offices have a translator ready for her to talk about her problems, because I don't think she wants me to accompany as her translator anymore. My dad is all in support of this, but he's scared of mentioning it to her because she already gets offended by my dad's actions. 

An example of a mood-swing, I was talking about the BLM and how I want to join,  but I don't want to expose her to the virus. But the discussion became much more heated and after the argument she threatened to my dad that she wants to go back to Vietnam and doesn't care about what happens to me. So I stopped talking about this matter cause she'd get much more upset. 

She gets upset at me and my dad all the time because we are able to speak Vietnamese in the house, thereby she can clearly express to us. However, my brother--who doesn't speak Viet at all--she treats him like a little angel cause she thinks he's unaware of the problems. 

So with my back against the wall, I don't want to hurt her anymore than I've already have. **So my question is how should one treat someone like my mother? If you were my mother, what do you want to hear?** I live in the United States. 

I'm upset with how she is treating me and my dad, and I want to just leave the house. However, I'm not going to be angry at her for her actions. With 1year and a semester left in school, I just don't want anything to escalate during this time. I get it, me and my dad may not be doing something right and can be wrong on some points, but she blows our mistakes out of proportion. I am confused and don't know what to do.",17Jun2020,1
251,"Hello friends Thank you in advance for any insight into my questions, I will keep the text as brief as possible while explaining. . . 

I’m on 2 medications and have been for a year and a half. Medications are sertraline and bupropion (not to be confused with buspirone)

The sertraline is for ocd, anxiety/depression, bipolar type symptoms 
The bupropion was for quitting smoking and helping to level out drowsiness from sertraline 

I no longer use nicotine in any form 

To my question - I would like to drink coffee once in a while or drink a beer but I’ve been very hesitant to do either. The whole time I’ve been on these medications I have completely abstained from alcohol. Once in a while I have coffee and it makes me feel fantastic and then the next day I feel horrible so I keep drinking coffee until a few days later when I’m extremely irritable and depressed or anxious even with the coffee. So I suppose coffee is out for me? Any ideas why I would react so poorly to such a common thing? What do you suppose my reaction to alcohol would be? 

I’m 30 years old and used to be a regular alcohol drinker.

Thank you -

252,About a year ago I starved myself for a month because I was absolutely terrified that somehow food would kill me. In between meals I would collect myself and understand it was irrational but every time it came time to eat all of that went out of the window and I was terrified it was either undercooked and I would get food poisoning and die or maybe someone poisoned my food. I wouldn’t eat canned food in fear that maybe something got into it that shouldn’t have. Every time I would cook myself a meal I would really try but eventually I would just end up throwing it away. I ate like 4 or 5 times that month and afterward was 100% convinced I was going to die and made myself puke it up. What could have been wrong with me?,17Jun2020,1

254,"Okay, this might be a long one. I (30/f) have had issues for years. When I was around 12 or 13, I began picking at my skin. Don't know why, but I've done it all these years and now have scars all over my back and face because of it. Guessing it's some sort of compulsion. For years and years, I've felt as though I'm lazy. Always struggled in school. Was almost held back in the third grade. Stole my teachers purse in the fourth (still not sure why the hell I did that). 

I was aimless in college. I took a bunch of courses over the years (procrastinated on assignments but was able to pass exams). Finally dropped out without any sort of degree. I wasted my financial aid taking courses that had nothing to do with my degree. I've been trying to self-study and learn a new skill, but I can't read a book (if it's educational) without getting extremely tired and calling it quits. I have extremely thin skin. I've cried at work for things that looking back shouldn't have made me cry. And finally, I get anxious really easily. There's always something wrong. I always think of the worst case scenario and my stomach is in knots. Even the simplest exchange with a new person is difficult. I mask it well enough that most people have no idea that I'm nervous.

I know I should get help. But I really don't know where to start. I'm uninsured but I can afford to speak to a psychiatrist for now. I'm just afraid of how it will be perceived by my family. Or that the doctor will simply confirm that I really am just a lazy good for nothing who's looking for meds (I've never taken any meds or gotten evaluated).",17Jun2020,1
255,"I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression 3 months ago and struggled a lot with suicidal thoughts since the quarantine. I tried couple of medications, sertraline, trazodone for depression + insomnia and clonazepam. Sertraline made me really depressed and no energy, trazodone gave me bad stomach issues and clonazepam helped with anxiety but my anxiety and depression skyrocketed when I didn't take the medication (even though it was less than a week of taking it so it couldn't have been dependence on it). And then about of week ago I started taking Abilify (aripiprazole) and so far it's been the best out of everything I've tried. It could be that I was just working more than usual but i haven't have had very bad side effects other than occasional wave of dizziness. There would be moments at work where I would start to get an anxiety attack or suddenly lose the motivation but it being a retail nature and a stressful job, it's something to be expected. I haven't actively thought about suicide for the past 5 days I took the medication, but then could be from just being busy and exhausted from working 40 hours vs. 20 that I usually work. So things were ok, I was tired of going to work every day but other than that I would say my mental health has been relatively stable. 

I had my counseling session today and it was good, it wasn't particularly upsetting or anything. But every single time my counselor says ""I care about you and I want you to live a happy and long life,"" I don't want to. I don't care if I die tomorrow, I don't really want to be happy (I don't even know what makes me happy) and I don't really want to live that long. I've been in the slumps for weeks, there were 2 incidences where I would have attempted suicide and I finally feel ""better"" but I still feel that way. Apathy might be the right word. This is the most motivation and energy I've had for 3 months, my best friend stopped by my work yesterday and made me so happy but I just don't care. I don't particularly look forward to the future but I can finally think about it without panicking or starting to cry. I've been feeling more positive about going back to school in the fall and just getting my life together again but that feeling is still there. 

I've been reading about anxiety and depression trying to make sense of it and trying to understand why I feel or act certain ways. But it's a pretty complicated subject and even harder to diagnose. My psychiatrist mentioned that there might be something more than just anxiety and depression but he doesn't know yet. Is this feeling normal with depression or is there something more complicated?",17Jun2020,1
256,"I feel really helpless right now... I know I need therapy and help and I just ran out of my antidepressants but I can't get myself to do it. I can't get myself to do anything. I want so bad to help myself and get better, and I know what I need to do I just feel like I CANT do it. My room is unrecognizable, I binge drink almost every single night. I get stoned a lot. I just want the feeling to go away and to just focus on the stuff that matters like getting up on time, showering, making sure my floor is visible, making 3 meals a day. Because I am not going to be able to start my business or work on my skills and pass my classes or indulge in the art and reading I love to do unless I take care of my basic needs first. But why is it so hard? why is it SO hard for me to get out of bed or just simply even form a thought. Even writing this I feel like I'm not making sense or able to get my whole point across. It's weird because I've been diagnosed with anxiety/depression but I don't really think that's what it is. I know I have anxiety but I think my attention span and my mood swings make me think I'm not depressed. I feel everything. I am not numb but I want to be. Everything is a big deal and I can never stop talking or thinking. I hate being me and it becomes so exhausting that I can't move. But all I want to do is move, and to help myself, and to do the things I want to do but my brain just feels overwhelmed and I constantly want to cry or scream but sometimes I can't find the voice to do it because I am so tired. even though I sleep 12 hours (of restless) sleep every night.

257,"When in a happy/normal mood, I downplay how I’m feeling and act like I’m unbothered and try not to smile even if someone tells a joke.

258,"I suffer from depression and anxiety, much of which has been manageable until recently when I met this friend, who suffers from extreme anxiety. Part of what made our friendship so strong was that we were able to bond of our anxieties because we had a lot of similar triggers. We looked out for each other, reassured each other, and just checked up on each other. However, it got to a point where the friendship was turning toxic. 

It became really emotionally draining to deal with my own mental health issues, but also to constantly be there for them. Not that I didn't want to be there for them, but it was really hard to not let myself go and dig myself a deeper depression hole with her. I couldn't take care of myself while I was taking care of her so much. 

I've since distanced myself from her for a bit, and recently found out that she's been going through a really difficult time. I feel incredibly guilty for not being there for her but at the same time, I physically and emotionally could not do it anymore because it was so incredibly draining. 

I don't want to feel guilty or feel selfish for having to distance myself, but if I can't lift myself up, how can I lift up another person?",17Jun2020,1

“warm bodies” 

have you ever lied next to a warm body
but still felt cold 
felt that there was a distance between you
greater than space

i’ve lied next to warm bodies 
that had no meaning 
just a warm body that only brings me to feel more cold

you are not just another warm body
i welcome your warmth 
your scent 
the smell of comfort and a cool rainy day
i can feel your presence even when you are turned around 
i hear your still breaths right before you drift off to a deep sleep

i feel safe
your warm body offers more than just warmth to me
protection
care
comfort 
it’s been so long since i have felt this safe 
the feeling is almost unrecognizable 

your warm body has meaning to it 
as i pull myself closer to you
i melt into you 
our bodies becoming one 
i steady my breath to match yours 
and each rise of your chest bring me deeper into your trance 

i stare at you sometimes 
when you are asleep 
you look so calm 
the same look you always wear 
but your smile is gone 
you are at peace now 
this look is what you give me when you are just listening 
to me
to my problems 
it’s not hard to read your face because i am not scared of what it might say 

your eyelashes are long 
and your lips form a soft part in between them
your eyebrows -no matter how much you talk about them
make me smile 
your face is immaculate 
but nothing compared to what’s going on inside your head 
inside your heart 

sometimes i run my fingers over the lines your face makes
i just want to remember incase you leave too
i push my hand in between your hip and your pelvis 
you move 
i remember that you are here too 
and that you said you wouldn’t leave


my eyes are shut now 
i can feel my body relaxing 
i didn’t know i could do that anymore 
i imagine your smile as it flashes across the back of my eyelids 
and as i drift off i wonder only one thing 
what do you think of the warm body lying next to you..",17Jun2020,1

I’m currently staying at my dads on his sofa in his one bedroom bungalow. Today’s been difficult and I miss my dog and in a way I miss my mum too.

264,"I’m all the time starting new craft projects and hobbies and buying all the appropriate supplies, just to never use it.  It makes me want to go out with friends. I’m the happiest i’ve ever been. I want to drink, even if its alone. I want to party and have fun. I make impulsive decisions. I’ve gotten tattoos and made drastic apperance changes in these states. 

The most worrisome to me is that I lie. I make up these stories and then I tell them to others. These stories portray the acts of sexual adventures, wild alcohol-related stories, things I would never do in real life. And i live these stories for 2-3 days at the time. Detailed enough that no one has ever questioned me. When I say I live it, I mean I spend hours running thru conversations and situations, even doing research, pretending i’m living out those lies in my head usually while pacing in my living room listening to music. I have done this for years, but its only in the last 2 years that I impulsively tell others about my fictious life. It worries me that these lies are becoming riskier. They involve my best friends, grad school, everything I care about. 

I can’t get over this feeling of living a double life. I’ve been pretty good at keeping them seperate. My family and half of my friends, know me as a shy, quite person that never steps out of line and is a straight A grad student. The other half of my friends think i’m a promiscuos alcoholic that sleeps around and parties all the time.

266,"...as well as something else I can't even begin to explain.

This, more often than not, happens with my immediate family, like my mom, dad, and siblings. I've experienced this with a person I considered my best friend of ten years.

To explain further, this usually begins for no reason. Somedays, it happens all day. Other days, just under an hour. I will go off on my family and say things I don't mean. Sometimes, I will initiate an argument and shutdown, only escalating it further. I don't really realize the impact I had on my family at that given moment until the argument has died down enough, or I place myself into a different environment entirely. Then comes the remorse; I mean, I get suicidal, scratch myself, and just all-around mad at how I acted, calling myself ""worthless"" and telling myself ""my family will be better off without me"". Sometimes, I even resort to cutting. These past few times, I would get a belt.. and you know what comes next. I was, and am, miserable when this sort of thing happens because I don't mean it. I can't help it.

A lot of the time, I will get so upset at my friend for hanging out with someone else. I will fall into obsessive thoughts, like, ""Oh, she doesn't like me anymore - I'm getting replaced - I'll just kill myself since no one cares - She's the only person I care about, and now she doesn't even care about me."" It would get so bad, that I would subsequently plan my death, hurt myself, among other things. The last time this happened, I saw her in a picture with her other friend, and I just got so mad, then depressed, it lasted well over a month. I know that people can have more friends, but something in me doesn't understand that, and it's so irritating! I know the way I think isn't right, but I can't help it.

I get these triggering moments that can cause my thoughts to be negative and cause me to draw back from people. I was on a trip, and while in the car, I had a ten-minute episode of me just wanting to kms because my friend was going away for her birthday with another friend.

It can just be at random times where I will get those types of thoughts. I'm not sure what triggers them, but other times, there are obvious triggers.

Another time, I was flipping back and forth from wanting someone in my life in a matter of minutes, and then I said some shit that ultimately removed them from my life completely not realizing what I said and the weight of it until it was too late.

All in all, I don't know what's up with me. I know the way I think isn't normal. I shouldn't feel like taking my life will satisfy me in any way. I shouldn't want to take my life because someone is being a normal human being, with multiple friendships. If I think about them hanging out with someone else outside of the bad days, everything is completely fine, and I don't get upset like that.

Does anyone else experience this? I'm so lost at this point. I don't want to feel like I'm the only one anymore.

EDIT: Thought I should mention that I have no diagnoses, have never stepped into a therapy office, and have never taken any sort of medical tests.",17Jun2020,2
267,"Okay so this is the first time I'm posting something on reddit so sorry if this isnt the best..

Basically, I need some advice or someone to talk to at least as I am having a bit of a hard time at the moment.

As of recently me and other people around me have become aware of my anxiety and the effects it is having daily. I get so nervous going anywhere and constantly feel like people are looking at me or talking about me and judging me and it stops me from going out often. I am 18 and I feel like I should be getting out and enjoying myself but I think this is so difficult as I'm not comfortable with myself so idk how I can be comfortable around other people.  I get nervous meeting new people and get worried I will lose those I have as I feel I'm not good enough which starts a whole other issue with trust. 
I have a boyfriend who I have been with for a year who is amazing but I feel like he doesnt fully understand how I feel sometimes and I get extremely nervous that he will cheat or leave me eventhough he has NEVER given me a reason to feel that way, I realised this is probably  due to my  anxiety and the way I feel about myself. It's also so bad that I csnt even go to a shop or  a restaurant without getting stressed and anxious which is why I usually have someone else do it for me .

It's gotten to a point where I feel really down and really useless and havent got anyone to talk to who would really understand so I could really do with some help.

I am a guy in my early 20s. I have always been a shy, withdrawn and insecure person...until I started to live on my own about a year ago for 6 months. I became upbeat, happy and funny. I had no problem talking to new people and I was a social butterfly. At the same time I also spiraled out of control sometimes and may have acted in quite cringeworthy ways, looking at it in retrospect.

272," I’ve been dealing with double standards basically forever between my sister and I. My sister is 3 years older than me, but she makes it seem like she’s 20 years wiser and so smart. That she's always right and I don’t know any better. She’s always telling me what I'm doing wrong, repeating it again and again as if I didn’t know. But the thing is, she does those things too.

Like for some reason it really bothers her that I have free time now since I’m still a student and its summer. She has work. It makes her so jealous she constantly has to say something. She’s always complaining to my mom that I’m sleeping too much, or spending too much time playing video games, or on my phone too much. Sure, I’ve been sleeping more, and spending more time playing games, or on social media or whatnot. But I’ve also been doing other stuff, and she’s well aware of it.

I’ve always been applying to lots of summer programs and working on updating my linkedin, cover letter, resume, all that jazz. I’ve read a ton too, and reading even according to her isn’t wasting time but apparently it is when I read. I’ve been catching up with friends I haven’t talked to in forever. I’ve been doing MLH hackathons and working on developing a plan for an app or website I want to build to help address COVID. I’ve baked and cooked some stuff, and helped my mom bake and cook some stuff. And just last week I started my summer classes and I literally have an essay due tomorrow but instead of writing it I’m too busy trying not to cry. So yeah I have more free time, but I’m actually not wasting that much of it. But of course she only sees what she wants to see. She only sees that she’s more busy (apparently) than me. I try to argue with her, tell her all the stuff I’m doing, but she doesnt wanna hear it. My mom yells at me to stop arguing. Oh yeah thats another thing in this house, not even calm debate is allowed for me, because I shouldn’t be arguing in the first place. Of course, the others can, no biggie. The funny thing is my mom always takes my sisters side, and lets her go on and on about everything “wrong” with me. But if I even once say my side of the story, even begin in, then Im the equivalent of an ungrateful b\*\*\*. 

Interestingly enough, my sister often spends “work”  hours on her phone. Slacking off when she should be on slack or something. Sometimes she takes naps for hours too. 

Yesterday morning, I went to help my best friend’s family move. I was there from 8-about 11am. I hadn’t slept well the night before, and I was tired when I came back, so I fell asleep after 12 and woke up around 2 for lunch. According to my sister, though, I was asleep for “half the remaining day.” What?? Even?? And she made a big deal out of it, and when I clearly demonstrated how wrong she was, she wouldn't take it. And I got in trouble for “arguing.”

My sister always tells me to go help my mom with house and kitchen stuff (when I would anyway). But if I tell her to, or ask why she’s not doing a chore she was supposed to do, I should stop being “jealous” and “mind my own business” (agreed by both my mom and my sister).  

Also, my mom and sister keep telling me that I don’t know how to live with people, or keep a good relationship with them, or be grateful. That I can’t even talk properly and respectfully with my family. Excuse me, but everytime I try, all that \^\^ happens. They say that when I’m a mother, my kids wouldn’t talk to me for support or help or any conversation, they’d go to the dad. Which is a low blow. Honestly, i dont even want to be a mom or have a family, and they know that but yeah whatever insult floats your boat, fam. It still stings and they know it. Hell, I hope I don’t have kids. I can’t even stand up for and care for myself, how will I do it for kids? 

Also, my family stops at nothing to put me down. When I was a kid, they'd call me stuff like ""brainless"" (an insult courtesy of my sister). When I was even younger, they would tell me my sister would be a CEO and I'd be her maid. They expect me to know things and when I don't they yell. They say I'm ungrateful. They say I don't know how to take initiative, or talk to people, or that I'm too insecure (negative feedback loop much ha). All the damn time. 

Gosh, I don’t even know what I’m writing anymore. It’s been like this always to an extent, but it’s been getting worse. And yeah my dad always agrees with my mom and sis.

Maybe I am in the wrong. didn’t know it could hurt so much.",17Jun2020,1

276,"When I got home today I sat on my porch and cried. It wasn’t really a sad cry. More like tears if frustration. I can’t even pinpoint why. There’s so many reasons. Not just for me but the whole world deserves a good crying session. Sometimes I think of my emotional capacity as a dinner plate. And I visualize all my baggage I carry around with me as food. There’s been very few (if any) times where I feel I have had room for more food on my plate. And for the longest time now I’ve felt like my plate is overflowing, and the food at the bottom is just rotting while I keep adding more to my plate. I have good moments in life. Where I kinda forget about the overflowing, rotting plate. I cherish those moments more than my friends and family might realize. Anyways, I shared a little bit with all of you. Now it’s your turn. How’s your dinner plate looking? 

Also, I feel like this could be a really good arts and crafts thing to do with kids. Like get a paper plate and have them fill it up with what their worries are as if it were food. It might be really insightful to where your kid is at mentally and emotionally. What do I know though, I don’t even have kids!",17Jun2020,2

278,"when we went to the doctors for my anxiety a few months ago she said to the doctor that she knew a lot about mental health and that she had 'worked with it in the past', this sort of struck me as strange as the only experience i could recall was when she worked in an old peoples home with dementia patients. i didn't mention that comment but believed her anyway or thought she maybe phrased it wrong. But then we were having dinner a few weeks later and she said that anxiety wasn't a mental illness and its 'just a thing' (?). shes the kind to say things like 'oh i have ocd because i need that to be symmetrical' but when i explain what ocd actually is she rolls her eyes at me. In a conversation recently i brought up the comment she made at the doctors and she said that since she worked as a bar tender she had talked to alcoholics so she understands depression, but anytime i mention my anxiety she tells me to stop fishing for pity.

At this point I feel pretty confident knowing that my behavior is my own and know that that just isn’t me that I could do better. This has only come after months of working on myself and trying to figure out who I am first.

Recently though I feel like I want to date solely to prove this though, or just generally to prove to myself that I can be better for a sense of finality I guess. Is this a bad mentality to have while dating? If so any advice on how I can shift it?",17Jun2020,2

i’m a teen who struggled a lot with mental health. anxiety, self harm, that sorta thing. it started when i was around 13, and has recently started getting better now that i am 17. because of my struggle with my mental health, my relationship with my parents has always been complicated. they never really understood what i was going through, and because of this failed to respond correctly. they mostly forced me to do things that didn’t make me feel any better, or just tiptoed around me at all times. we never spoke about it directly, or really mentioned feelings at all during these times. more recently they mentioned that they knew i was having a rough time (it was noticeable) but didn’t know what to do. 

i’ve thought about what i’ve wanted them to do instead, but i’m not really sure myself. 

so, parents, siblings, or individuals who have struggled with mental health/have known someone who has struggled with mental health,, what do you think is the right way to respond? what “should” someone do in a situation where you know someone is struggling mentally?

my mom then refused to believe that my problem was with my mental health so she took me to a nutritionist because she strongly believed i was feeling depressed because i don’t eat enough vegetables?? so then i started eating heather &amp; she put me on some vitamins.. it’s been so many months and nothing has drastically changed. i felt a bit happier for like a month but now i’m back to feeling shitty.

294,"It could be due to a mistake I made at work, which usually leads me to believe in just going to be fired (even though I’ve never had any warnings or genuine concern that I would be).

Maybe my GF asked me to plug in her Fitbit, and I forgot to do it and then later said she wasn’t mad but “disappointed” because she really likes her Fitbit. (We have a cat separation going on and if they contact each other they fight, we both work from home so it’s a lot easier to hand it to me to plug it in rather than opening the door all the way. The cat situation is a work in progress).

Often times things like these lead me to believing I’m a useless good-for-nothing. These usually cascade into thinking suicide would be easy enough, I couldn’t disappoint anyone anymore once I die (after they get over the disappointment that I committed suicide, of course).

I know I also have ADD tendencies, get distracted constantly in the middle of someone talking, usually end up not even listening to half of what they said (which also causes me to “forget” a lot of conversations, though mentally I wasn’t there to begin with). Or maybe I’ll be asked to do something and then get so focused on a specific task that I forget the things I agreed to do.

Like I could say “yeah I’ll take the trash out after work” (I work from home). But since my home computer and work computer are next to each other, if I don’t recall that information in the span of a couple minute after getting off I get lost in something and might completely forget about something I already committed to. This obviously leads to relationship problems which, on the lightest side I feel like we might break up just because I’m a constant disappointment, and she’s be better off.

301,"So hello. I am a 21 yo female. I am very confused about my diagnosis and can't seem to figure anything out. I've become extremely frustrated with mental health and I just have to vent a little bit. So:

1.All my life I've been extremely shy and anxious. My mother describes my first depressive episode at 2-3 years old when my parents divorced . My dad used to be a cruel and abusive man, more to my mother than me.  I have reoccuring nightmares of him beating my mother to this day. But I loved him a lot when I was little and him leaving was very painful. Now he's better btw. But he used to push me, buy me smaller shoes cause they were cheaper, let me starve, let me dress myself at 3-4 yo and make fun of me. He always made me feel like I don't deserve help or food and I still carry that low self image and self pity to this day. 

2. I have a very weird relationship with things in general. I just can't put my finger on it and it drives me nuts. I always take things way too seriously and can't ever find a middle ground. I always take things to the extreme. Always. And I just can't have a normal relationship with people to this day. A romantic relationship is not even in the graphs. Sadly for me, the character from The Office I mainly identify with is Michael Scott. I have mild anger issues, I am extremely attention needy, I always take my relationships with people way too seriously, I am obssesed with being the best at everything and having people know it and pretty much just Michael Scott without the insensitive remarks to people.

3. I can't feel(?) time(?) I can't. I have a very weird relationship with time. It's very hard for me to focus on actual existing and I just let time pass by me while not taking anything in.  During this pandemic and summer vacantions I tend to isolate myself in my room and basically just do nothing. Just letting time pass. I lost months on end doing nothing and daydreaming. And even if I were to do something like scroll Facebook, I would be way too deep in my head to actually be aware of what's happening. 

4. I am caught between being overly sensitive or insensitive. If somebody is in distress, I just can't feel for them usually. I am a horrible friend and I feel like shit for it. But at the same time, when I do relate to something, it is extreme and I just can't let go.

5. Went to a psychiatrist at a mental health hospital last year.  The only reason she took me seriously back then was because I was frozen and couldn't move properly, which happens sometimes when my anxiety flares up.  She didn't give me an actual diagnosis in person. In my country, idk about others, we have some codes for diagnosis and I had to search up the codes on my prescriptions to find the diagnosis. Basically depression, anxiety and personality disorder(only had the last one like 2-3 times).  I tried to open up to her about a few things and she ended up dismissing all of them because indeed they were not so severe, but it made me feel horrible. Those things are: some form of sexual abuse (when I was a child, a neighbour's child pressured me into taking my pants off and having him perform some kind of oral sex on me, which his mother saw and I had the blame put on me), self harm (I was scared to cut deeply on my arms, so I don't have very obvious scars, but I do have a few worse one on my legs) and also my relationship with food (I used to starva myself for days on end). I know these are not very serious compared to others, but for me it is very important and the way she dismissed these things was just a hit to take. The medication she gave me was a real help tho.

6. Went to another psychiatrist. Couldn't continue going to her cause she was a private business and very expensive. After consultation, she diagnosed me with depression and anxiety and maybe a personality disorder. I was considering having one, but hearing her say that felt so validating, finally felt like I wasn't just fucked up in the head cause I'm just shitty like that, but there was an actual thing wrong that could be fixed. 

7. Been to 3 therapists.  The first one was too scary, loved the second one but our schedules couldn't compromise and the third one was a just-think-positively kind of approach, which is just... what. In the end, couldn't bond properly with any of them.

8. I also lied to the therapists and psychiatrists. I don't kbow why. I always lie without intending to.

9. I have always been pretty gifted when it comes to intelligence, which ofc I take HUGE pride in. Because of this, going through school was a breeze for me. Always would spend my time just daydreaming under incredible stress instead of studying and just studying in the last moment when my anxiety would reach levels high enough to make me stop daydreaming. But since I started medication, I lost that last-moment-study-impulse anxiety and I am just left with the daydreaming and doing nothing. Which is extremely stressful. I can't believe it, but I miss that kind of anxiety. 

10. Related to working. Working and just doing stuff stresses me out so much. Now that the anxiety driven motivation is gone, I am left with only regular anxiety which makes me freeze when given one (1) task. I am not lazy, I am just straight up terrified of doing something and it not being perfect or goof enough. Hell, I had to write a documentation for a project and all I could think of is how the professor would think I am so stupid and hate every word I wrote as I was writing them.

11. Regarding depression. I am experiencing it as more of a numbness and a complete disasociation from everything rather than sadness.

12. My very few friends always make fun of me and my intense mood swings -it is friendly and I laugh too because I realize how intense I am-. I can go from hot to cold to green to cold to crying in a a very short time and due to stupid reasons. 

So this is all I can think of right now. I apologise for the long post and badly organised ideas. And for grammatical errors too, English is not my first language.

 The reason I wrote this is basically because every time I went to a new therapist/psychiatrist, I just couldn't talk about all these things I am confused about to get some answers. I just want it all somewhere out there. And even better if people can give me opinions because I love hearing other people's opinions. I just wanted to vent and hear anything anybody would have to say regarding my situation. Have a nice one c:",17Jun2020,1
302,"I have struggled with depression for the majority of my life. Most people feel a full range of emotions... I don’t feel like I do. I RARELY experience joy or happiness, but I regularly feel sad and hopeless. Lately things have been really, really difficult. I moved across the country with my partner, with no job, no friends, and no mental health support. I thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. I was so wrong. My partner broke up with me, saying that my constant talk about depression and thoughts of suicide are exhausting to deal with (trust me, I know). I don’t want to hurt those around me, but I do not want to continue living. I don’t know what I’m looking for from this post, but don’t know what else to do. I feel so alone. 

I’m also 10 weeks pregnant, which is scaring the hell out of me. How can I be there for a child when I can’t even be there for myself? What if I put all of these thoughts and emotions on them, and create another human being who feels like I do? I would never wish this on anyone, let alone my own child.  Has anyone dealt with depression as a parent or had a parent who struggled with depression?",17Jun2020,1
