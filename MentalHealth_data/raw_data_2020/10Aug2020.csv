1,It wasn’t until here recently and after a ton of research and looking back I think (strictly speculation for now) I might have been dealing with schizophrenia. I’ve always been depressed but up until the last couple of years I never really had a reason to be. Even at the age of like 8-10 I remember wanting to take my own life simply because I didn’t like myself and felt I just didn’t deserve to live. I’ve always heard voices occasionally and I knew that it was different from internal dialogue but it was never anything threatening or like “kill this person” type stuff. It was always just idle chatter. It’s also hard to motivate myself. I have so many things I want to do and accomplish but I can just never find the energy or drive. I’m also paranoid as shit. Constantly looking over my shoulder. I get scared because I think at my job they’re always watching me on the cameras (in hindsight they probably do).  And that someone is out to get me or people are always watching me. I live and still mostly depend on my parents (I pay “rent” and pay for my car and other things) but they don’t really believe in mental illness. I don’t really have any friends or people I can reach out too. I don’t know if I should just try and find a doctor or if there’s even an online alternative. I would just like someone to give me some sort of idea on my best course of action while I’m still young and in control. Also I feel like I should add that if it wasn’t for pot and thankfully now it’s legal where I’m at. I probably would have killed my self by now. Thank you if you actually read this whole thing. Sorry for any badder grammar. I’m really high. God bless,10Aug2020,1
2,"Hey, 

I am 23 years old. 2020 should have been the year I would graduate for university. 

What I got? I lost my internship so could not graduate and I lost my job I did besides studying.

I am just done with this corona hysteric thing. You can think of me what you want, but every day that passes in this bullshit world like it is in 2020 makes me more believe the entire COVID thing is a big hoax. 

I miss my life like it was in 2019. You could do anything you wanted. I cannot even go to the gym anymore or go to university. And all this bullshit social distancing. I don’t believe in it anymore. I wasted an entire year I could have worked, getting experienced or go on a road trip if I wanted to. 

For young people like me this can be killing for my career and my future. 

First ok I followed the rules, but this is taking way too long. There is no indication to me this shit will ever end. We will never get back to normal, and it makes me sad and angry. 

Just stop with all this bullshit and give us our normal life’s back. But I don’t think that will ever come back. I don’t have motivation to life in this world. 

I would rather die tomorrow than living in this world rules by a stupid virus for my entire life. We will never get back to normal, normal life died dec 31th 2019.",10Aug2020,1
3,"I am a 20 yr old female and have just moved back to my Uni City from my home town as the semester is due to start. I struggle from Depression and Anxiety, I am unmedicated at the moment but my plan was to go back onto medication soon. I literally moved back for Uni on Monday. Yesterday I went out to the shop, which is a 3 minute walk from my flat, and on my way back a car hit me so hard that CCTV shows me flying and doing a flip in mid air.
Somehow aside from some tenderness on the right side of my head, general scrapes/tissue damage and a broken finger I am fine physically.

I've been making jokes about it all day with my boyfriend because idk what else to do but he is now asleep and I'm distraught. I cannot process what has happened at all. I dont even remember the collision. Medical professionals and police have both informed me that I am lucky to be alive, never mind the fact that I'm barely physically affected. I read a few hours ago about a 6 year old boy in Manchester who has been knocked down and killed today. I can't process why that didn't happen to me and why it did to him. I cant process how I deserve to be here and he doesn't, I can't process what happened at all. I'm pretty much terrified, I'm not sure what of but I can feel my fear. Its probably not helping that I couldnt sleep well because of pain in my head but I just can't process any of it. Why am I totally fine? I'm not complaining or anything but... I do not understand. I'm very confused, and distressed. Also, the person who hit me was a taxi driver and I know they will now lose their job. In a PANDEMIC. I feel so, so horrible and just confused and stressed and I really can't find any resources to help me deal with what has happened because when you Google accidents all the results are to do with dual car or car-bike collisions and not pedestrian collisions.",10Aug2020,1
4,"Yeah, ik it sounds crazy. Let me start from the beginning. Today, he and I had an argument about money, let me give some background. My dad is very very cheap, he dreads spending a single cent for anything. While I don't care that much about money, it's not like I waste it. I just spend it when I need to. Back to the present, we were arguing and he was getting increasingly loud, so I did the same. Tempers flared, he said some shit, so did I. Suddenly he came at me like a bull but I move away, tried to take me down but he couldn't. After that, he said in the calmest voice I've ever heard from him ""I wish you had died at birth like your brothers."" This hit me heard since my mum miscarried many times before she had me. At that point I was just hurt... badly. Finally he said that he would kill me one day in a more angrier voice.",10Aug2020,1
5,"This summer took a harder toll on me than I thought it would. I didnt realize how much I relied on school to keep me happy and focused.

This summer almost broke me, but I'm at the edge of it. My mental health is extremely bad, I'm pretty sure I have some kind of severe depression at this point. And there's really nothing I can do about it.

The problem is that school starts again in 2 weeks, and I'm at such a horrid state. If I can't get my act changed, school is going to be extremely bad for me regardless of how much it distracts me.

I can't even take care of myself anymore, or my room or anything. I can't do anything anymore.",10Aug2020,1

7,"hi i just wanted to start by saying that i’ve only been to a psychologist or whatever once. he prescribed me prozac on day 1 and then my dad never had me see anybody else because he doesn’t believe in my mental illness and i’ve never had health insurance. it’s been 3 years since then. i’m almost 21 now and i know self diagnosis is bad but i don’t have much of a choice and it helps to research. anyway  i’m pretty sure i have dpdr and the last 2 months or so it’s taken an extreme hold. i haven’t stopped dissociating the entire time and i’ve pretty much cut off all of my friends and romantic interests because i’m tired of pretending to have emotions. i want to have emotions and i know when i should be feeling them but i just don’t and pretending i do is hurting me and the people i love. 

so now i’m cut off from almost everyone i love and i’m silently suffering in a twisted augmented reality. sometimes hours pass in 5 minutes sometimes 10 minutes feels like hours. sometimes i’m just spectating my life for an entire day and it feels like i have no control over what i do in that time. sometimes i’m only aware of what’s going on in this dissociated state and what i’m doing and what’s happening around me completely melts away and it’s almost like i black out. i feel extremely uncomfortable during sex because i intensely dissociate before during and after it happens. 

idk what to do. idk if i’m the one who’s alien or if this world around me is fake. i want to feel. i want the delusional thoughts to go away and for real thoughts to come back",10Aug2020,1

13,"Hey everyone!

First off, I want to thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope that you're all doing well and staying safe and healthy. 

I guess a bit of background. I'm going to be a senior in college, and if it weren't for these circumstances, I'd be so looking forward to my last year learning, growing, making memories and having fun. 

Now I'm still stuck inside, having to worry about the safety of my family and friends. It's been throwing me into a deep depression wondering if this pandemic will ever end. 

I'm quite the extrovert to my core, so I've always loved spending time outside the house and doing fun things like partying, going out to dinners, going on adventures, etc. The pandemic has made it seem like all of these things are taboo now. And I totally understand that these sacrifices are for the greater good, and I will do everything in my power to crush this virus from wearing a mask to social distancing as much as possible. But most of the time nowadays, I can't help but feel like there's no hope anymore. Like even if we get a vaccine, this virus will never go away and I won't be able to enjoy half the things I used to in the same way or at all, ever again. 

Things like video chatting with friends and stepping out occasionally have been alright, but they only go so far. Video chatting is never really on par with actual human interaction, high levels of which I sorely miss. So many articles I read on the internet highlight how the virus will never disappear and social distancing will likely be incurred until 2022, and I don't know if I can deal with it for that long. I've had plenty of nights where I've just cried in the bathroom for hours on end, and hoping that someone would reach out (I tend to reach out to people a lot for support). A lot of people say on social media to take care of your mental health, but they don't actually want to reach out to say ""are you doing okay?"" 

I don't have a senior year to look forward to and it just seems like the worst of times are dragging along with no prospect of getting better. I was wondering if anyone out there can relate to this or have any advice/optimism? I'm normally a huge optimist and have been in the early months of the pandemic, but I feel like now I'm becoming a pessimistic wreck in thinking that life won't get any better or fun again. The last time I had serious depression like this was sophomore year of high school, when I was almost committed suicide (although I'm not seriously suicidal anymore). 

Hope everyone stays safe and well. Please take care of yourself.",10Aug2020,1
14,Anyone have any tips for when you just feel like you are in a negative place and how to clear the cloudiness and heaviness you feel,10Aug2020,1
15,I had a realisation. I'm going to die one day. we all are. there is no eternity. i don't know if heaven or hell exist. i don't know if the theory of reincarnation is real. but if it is. the thought that life is nothing more than an endless cycle of live die live die live die. over and over till the end of eternity. i try to push these thoughts back to the corners of my mind but honestly the thought that i'll just live to die AGAIN is one of the most terrifying thoughts i've ever had and that's saying a lot considering my constamt thoughts of suicide and self harm. I can't believe that i've been losing sleep over such a simple thought.,10Aug2020,1
16,"felt like writing down how I feel and what’s been happening, just everything

-trigger warning

In a few hours I’ll be in my new school, new people, new whatever
I have to find an apprenticeship which will be mixed with school on Thursday-Friday. Choosing what job to do is also very difficult for me, I had a job interview earlier this year at a hair salon, the man said he doesn’t want people like me (I was very nervous and anxious) I think he saw me as unstable or some shit, made me feel liek shit ngl

Lolol maybe I’m rlly unstable but sometimes I act out of impulse (in a dangerous way)

I don’t think working would make me feel any better, probably even worse even tho I’d get money every month.

I’ve already been in a psychiatric because i tried to kms in march(?) I think (wasn’t the first time I tried it lol), I was there for 2-3 months but it didn’t do much for me. Tbh I kinda wanna die, I don’t want to deal with life, no one would care if I was dead anyways, got no friends and my family is broken apart too. Maybe my dad would care but I still wanna die
This probably makes me sound selfish, I think I am

I know that I’m running away from my issues but that’s just how it is, you have to work to be successful and I don’t want to work for that,,, maybe I’ll drown in drugs if I’m still alive by then

I don’t do drugs, I only smoke when I’m really feeling pressured 

Wait weed is a drug too right? Bruh
I’m kinda dumb as you might’ve noticed🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️

I’m just tired of everything, tried to think positively but it doesn’t work

Guess I’m boutta tell my whole life story


I’ve had depression for like 2 years maybe? 2018/19 was the peak of it, maybe it never disappeared completely, I feel perfectly fine when it’s vacation bc there’s no responsibilities to take... no school too...
But when there is I have no motivation 
Since I’ve started 7th grade it all went downhill, as I said in a few hours is my first encounter with the new school (10th year)
I had a long episode of self harm, which left permanent scars. I’ve been clean for like a year now.


Ngl not being alive sounds like the best solution to me. But even for that I don’t know. My dad is liek the best dad ever, I don’t wanna tell my therapist or someone else that I’m feeling the way I do, I feel so nervous anxious that I’d rather die than confront my fears(?), I probably won’t find any friends either in he new school, my best friend that I’ve known since 2nd grade has left me because of no particular reason? I didn’t do anything to her and she couldn’t even say it into my face that she doesn’t want to be friends with me anymore? My old classmate told me that she said that in front of the whole class while I was staying in the psychiatric. She knew I was hurting, I didn’t go to school from March to the last week of school and maybe that’s a sign that I’m not feeling well?? She knows how it feels like being depressed... or did she only fake being depressed? She lied about trying to contact me multiple times, she fucking lied to her mom AND my dad. I’m trying to forget abt the things I had done for her, but it just makes me so mad. 

Everyone thinks I’m 24/7 pissed or mad, most see me as an emotionless human-being because I don’t know how to react to things, or bc I don’t speak much. Even when I have my neutral face on they would think I’m mad... 
I always tried to be more open but it seems like it’s never enough, there was always one person who used to make fun of my name bc it sounded a little like there was the n-word in my name. But I cnat change my name just like that? I’be thought about it and asked my dad but he said no.
I’m probably insecure idk


I should be grateful abt my life, I’m not poor or anything like that, not at all, my grades were good too but that’s in the past

I’m so selfish 

My mom isn’t living in Switzerland anymore, she had to go back to Thailand when I was 9 bc she only caused trouble.. she was addicted to gambling and stuff
I don’t like my mom, I won’t forgive her for hurting my dad so many times and just using him, he genuinely loved her but she didn’t care, free food, free rent, free everything. She didn’t work either. My dad worked his ass off everyday for 12 hours and that’s all she gives? Nothing? She couldn’t even prepare food for me, she lived a good life here. She stole my money too. She seems to not care about me either, she didn’t even congratulate me on my birthday, when I was with her all I heard were insults of me being too fat, I think her was the reason why I started developing an ED too. I don’t want any contact with her.

I kind of feel bad for my dad, he had to go through all of this and then he had to raise a pathetic kid like me

I keep on forgetting more and more stuff, it would be nice not forgetting so much of your memories.

Idk what I’m saying I’m just blabbering some shit

I don’t think I’ll ever be genuinely happy
I don’t want to live like this my whole life long 
I’ll probably die alone too
I have no dreams I want to achieve 

Only if I was a little more open so many things would be easier, but that’s just life eh? 
Well, I don’t wanna deal with it, so I’m just running away from it


Tbh I might try to kms again out of impulse

Maybe I deserve to feel like this.


Don’t wanna get help from pRoFessiOnaLs bc day by day it makes me hate it even more

19,"I'm fucking done with my family's bullshit. Anytime I do anything, someone will jump down my throat and berate me for doing said thing. For ex: I wanted to eat something so I went into the kitchen, I saw the chicken made for dinner and put some on a plate. The second I sit down my sister barges in the room and looses her shit because she was saving some for my dad. The way she explained this was her freaking out, not explaining, and demanding I give her my plate. I refused not seeing the point of her causing a commotion. My mom then proceeds to send me to my room for not immediately giving into my sisters will, and rewarding her freak out. So I had to eat in my room, and after I left to take my plate back and put it in the sink, I was told to say there for the rest of the night. Firstly I'm 18 so she's not really in the place to do that, but its her house so whatever, I comply. She then proceeds to come into my room and degrade me for not having a full time job and moving out (again I'm 18 and already working towards it). This basically proves the hypocrisy, and favoritism in my house. So yeah thats where I am now. I wanna die. I've been borderline suicidal before and she wants to pull this shit on someone who's already clinically depressed and not well off (cause of her and my family) What do I do? I'm already determined to move out and get out of this toxic environment, but that will take time, so how can I cushion the blow of this terrible situation?

23,"I’m (M 28)

I want to get help with my mental health, but I feel I don’t really know exactly what to tell a doctor without rambling on and wasting their time. Me seeking help is long overdue and I’m scared because I don’t know what to do exactly. 

I tend to get really anxious and get mad over small issues that when I eventually think through more clearer I regret, and feel like I’m an idiot for getting so worked up about. 

When I start getting these anxious thoughts I get weird feelings in my chest and it scares me, my heart starts pumping and it’s like sometimes I just want to tell anyone who looks at me weird to F off. 

Sometimes I feel like everything is absolutely amazing and I have an awesome life, and other times I feel like the complete opposite. I want to clarify I don’t have suicidal thoughts, or desire to take my life. More so, I feel my life is stuck in a hopeless rut and nothing will be better. 

I consistently make up scenarios in my head that are the worst case scenarios. When I eventually start thinking clearly I feel like some paranoid idiot for thinking my made up scenarios could be the truth. 

I get these awful intrusive thoughts. Usually about dying or bad things happening. I feel like my brain is always fixated on bad/dark things, sometimes it gets very overwhelming and I just cry. 

The only time I’ve discussed mental health with a doctor was after my mom died. He told me there’s nothing I can do to deal with my problems, other than take medication. I’m hesitant to do this. My mom abused her medication and it really left me with some bad memories. I feel I’m scared to take pills cause they can completely change a person. 

My relationship of the past 5 years essentially ended because I wouldn’t do anything to cope with my anxiety and depression. I’ve been by myself for a few months now and I feel myself sinking deeper. I want to do something about it cause I don’t want to keep living life like this. 

How should I got about telling this to a doctor? Do I look up an anti-depressant online and ask for a prescription for it? Are anti-depressants what I need? I feel like I’d rather get this awful anxiety/anger under control more so than my sad thoughts. 

Do I need prescription drugs? I’ve avoided them my whole life, but I feel this is the solution I have to pursue now. I smoke marijuana daily. I found it helps me when I’m feeling stressed and anxious. My last doctor was fixated on this solely causing all my problems, do I stop smoking marijuana? I feel it would be difficult for me to give it up, when it’s one of the only things that helps. 

Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all who’ve taken the time to read this and respond. Any and all comments are vastly appreciated. I want to start living a better life, and I just need some direction on where to start.",10Aug2020,1

In sitting in my room and i am breaking down because its been brought to my attention that this thought thats been stuck in my head for the past 4+ years of my life is not in any way normal. Ive believed that every important person in my life has had a secrent information ring of sorts where every message or word i say is carefully transmitted to each other and that they do this to keep me away from everything real in life and wish to trap me in a small false bubble of reality. I have never talked with anyone about this but while i was having a breakdown i just texted it to someone without thinking.

They pointed out to me that this seems to be delusional but i cant stop believing that its true in my other post you can see many other symptoms that ive felt and i have no clue why i think and feel most of these things but i know that they wont stop.

While this is a mostly self diagnosis, whatever is wrong with me has been hindering just about every aspect of my life. At certain points throughout the years I would finally break down and try to start receiving treatment but due to lack of funds, I always ended up at a government ran mental health facility and gave up for various reasons (therapists I didn't click with, appointments for therapy changed from every week to every two months, rushed diagnoses within 10min of meeting someone, etc.)

Thankfully, my husband has received better health insurance recently through his job and I now have a wider net of possibilities on where I can go to recieve help. Problem is, it's so confusing....

Between counselors, therapists, and psychiatrists, I'm not even sure where to begin. The one good thing about the above mentioned facilities was that they were all under one roof. Then there's the issue of some places not offering certain therapies that may help (like CBT etc.)

How many hours do I have in said game? Almost 100 hours. How many hours do they have? Approximately 400, 380, and 250+ respectively. I watch them in awe, envy, and fury (with myself) that they do it with ease. I try the same songs and I don’t struggle. I fail and it kills me. Not being good enough literally hurts in my chest sometimes. This is just one thing. There are so many others. No matter how good others may think I am. One failure means it’s not good enough. If this sounds silly, I agree. It’s ducking stupid to me and I wish I didn’t feel this way. I can’t enjoy anything without measuring myself against someone else. And if there is no one else, I IMAGINE someone better. Imagine how well this works in relationships. It eventually doesn’t. Also, I tend to ask myself, “Who do you think you are that you shouldn’t have to try, struggle, and fail before experiencing success?” Again, I know it’s stupid.",10Aug2020,1
39,"I have a problem with leaving my bed. The simple act of taking out my earbuds and existing in the world causes me immense pain. I tell my parents this but they don’t seem to get it. They tell me each and every time “all the professionals say to get out of your bed.” I just can’t. It’s plain and simple. I’m on like my fourth antidepressant and I’m having no luck. I’m unsure of what to do. 

Going back to school is so terrifying to me. I’m afraid I will have to drop out of high school. I still have unfinished work from last semester. I don’t know if the problem is anxiety or the pain that leaving my bed causes me. The idea of having such a big responsibility while I still have unresolved mental health issues is really scary.

44," I will try to keep this short because I am aware that this is a super complicated issue.

I'll start with the basics.

I struggle with loneliness and had struggled with it for a very long time.

I also struggle with mental issues but I luckily have a psychology degree and go through therapy and I have pretty much whatever strategy I can think of and the determination to keep myself afloat even though it is not easy.

I do admit that I am not very adept when it comes to social skills, mostly because of poor upbringing and trauma. But I have been learning on the know-how bit by bit and most of the time, I had to learn them the hard way - heartbreaks, rejections, ghosting, you name it.

At first, I thought that the fault was me because I had been rejected, neglected and bullied and abused all my life that the only reasoning that I could think of is that I am the problem.

Truth to be told, there is some truth to that because I know that I am not always sure how to approach another person, let alone not knowing the millions of ways that the person might react.

But I kept on pushing through and realised that the problem was not me but the other person because they do not have the stomach to be open or geniune.

And sometimes, I end up continuously ruminating and wondering if I did something wrong or whether I did something to push them away, or whether they a actually hated me to cut me off like that.


Yet, I persist and persist and persist.

But .... it hurts. A lot.

I feel that people have no gratitude or dignity at all and I feel that the social media that we rely on today makes this bullying too easy. 

Funny how we are supposed to feel connected with the technology of today but in reality, it pushes us away and alienates us and pick and toy with each other like toys or stuff we buy in a store room based on what we see on a profile and throw it away when we do not need it anymore.

Too many times, I have tried and tried and tried again to approach other people on social media, sometimes with shitty results or in ways that in hindsight, I later realised that it was not a good idea/method.

I use Instagram to post photos (i like photography) and approach others whenever i see a good photo and 80% of the time, they give only a seen or simply a like and a gentle thank you which I know that it means that they do not want to talk.

I keep recalling the years of me making mistakes of me approaching others but I later realised that I might done it incorrectly because the people involved maybe thought of me as a creep or a weirdo (but never really had the stomach to say it out right and so I still end up in a stage where I am guessing whether I actually am a creep or not)

I have used dating apps (mostly Tinder) and no matter what approach I use, whether the genuine hello or the creative approach, 70% of the time we get no reply at all.

Or the worst part is when you think you are going so well, the communication feels genuine and real and all of a sudden ... the other person disappears.

(I admit that I jumped the shark too quickly before or took it too fast, sometimes out of desperation to avoid letting my loneliness get to me. Sometimes, I thought things were going well but I might have acted the wrong way in the eyes of others. Honestly, in hindsight, I can never know for sure what happened and why)

It hurts so bad when that happens and it makes me paranoid and scared of what to say next. And the worst part is that this has been happening a lot for the past few years and it makes me wonder if I am actually the problem all along.

* Sometimes I ended up double texting just to see if everything is ok.
* Sometimes I simply gave an honest message (yes, I am that kind of person. I refuse to simply walk away from something without being deserved an explanation or at least speaking from the heart about how I feel or to genuinely ask if everything is all right). This is the part where I mostly get blocked or still get a seen and no reply.
* Sometimes I ended up cancelling my Tinder account but ended up restarting it, hoping for another try. And again, again and again.

This perpetual cycle of me trying to best that I can to have a decent human connection is tiring and has a lot of effect on my entire soul, mentally, emotionally and spiritually.

Too many times I felt less than human because of this when I try to approach myself in the most genuine way possible and treat the other person as an equal.

It is like a really twisted game of chess. Interacting with another human being has become the same as walking on eggshells where you are worried or continuously overthinking about every move you make because you do not want to risk a bad outcome

Most days, when I feel continuously alone, depressed and hopeless, as much as I have my own strategies to counter these, I feel tempted to look on my phone, aimlessly scrolling or waiting, hoping to get a notification or something. Sometimes even continuously look at others' profiles online as though seeing their faces gives me a sense of hope.

Too many times I feel like I am being the instigator of a conversation and not the other way around.

I do the best I can to not appear needy or desperate or creepy yet in these situations where things feel so bad, that I have every compulsion to be needy and desperate which I know pushes people away.

So this is where I stand most of the time.

In many cases, it feels like I am going around in circles or stuck in a complicated maze where every path is an elaborate puzzle that needs to be solved.

* If I approach myself in a non-genuine way, I might risk being rejected for it
* If I approach myself as honest and genuine (which is the approach that I use), people can still potentially reject me because not everyone has the courage to do the same.

Be funny. Be genuine. Be open-minded. Be whatever ... you still get rejected, ghosted or blocked for whatever reason that the other person can think of but never have the stomach to tell you why.

It feels a lot like I am being bullied yet I keep coming back, hoping to try again and hoping to achieve a decent and genuine human connection.

It is a tricky situation really. You want to be friendly but you do not want to be portrayed as a creep.

Yet whatever you do, you can easily skip from one side and the other.

Same thing with other dichotomies of social media.

* You want to be honest but not some asshole.
* You want to be welcoming but not pretentious.
* You want to be exciting but not overbearing.
* You want to be geniune but not weird.

Too many times it feels like you are walking on a rope and you try to avoid falling off.

Again, I am aware that my skills in social interaction is not that adept but I learn the best that I can.

It just really sucks that social interaction these days have become more like an overly elaborate puzzle where one tiny mistake can have serious repercussions

It is exhausting really.

It is laughable too on how we are in this position and we are the ones who put ourselves in this situation.

I keep doing my best to avoid doing the same thing or fall the same trap. I don't want to ghost others if I do not feel a connection but I aim to walk away or walk our own paths in good terms. I aim to be honest, genuine and sincere. Still, for some reason, people can reject you for it.

It makes you feel petty, little, embarrassed, voiceless and really frustrated but you do not know why to whom you want to be frustrated to.

It is a heavy burden to carry and a big toll for the sake of genuinely wanting a decent human connection, whether friendship or possibly a relationship of whatever kind.

I can potentially talk about a hundred of other things that I had to endure over the years all because I do not want to feel invisible (and yes, I am aware that loneliness is also in my head. I try to keep that in mind).

I feel that most people are not appreciative of how much effort it takes to just feel like you are treated like a human being, no matter how geniune you try to be.

It feels like you are being treated like a toy or a device that a person can simply manipulate and use and throw away when you dont need it anymore instead of a thing that actually has a soul.

I know that chances are that I could be doing the same to others and probably am not aware of it but I try to keep an open mind to avoid doing the same even though the rest of the world probably does this a lot.

45,"I have a friend who I am worried about their mental health. They are one to keep things to themselves and bottle things up a lot, and they have even admitted that. I’ve asked a few times if they are okay and I let her know she can always talk to me and she said ok but still she doesn’t much. I don’t want to be too pushy but I am worried with everything she has going on, it is really affecting her mental health and she isn’t talking to anyone about it. I almost want to suggest therapy but I don’t want it to come off as rude or it seeming as though it’s coming from out of no where. They never bring up their feelings or mental health but I can tell they are struggling. They also currently don’t have health insurance so I know that’s probably not even an option. Whenever I ask her she will brush it off and say everything’s fine when I know it’s not, or she will say something but not much more.

I also struggle with mental issues but I luckily have a psychology degree and go through therapy and I have pretty much whatever strategy I can think of and the determination to keep myself afloat even though it is not easy. 

And I am well aware of how complicated it is to fight against mental problems, let alone multiple. Many times it is like an onion layer level of maze-like puzzles (sometimes going in circles even) hat it is never clear which path or approach is correct.

And in many cases, it is also a double-edged sword (multiple sharp edges in some cases), where no matter what path you take, you are going to end up getting hurt or some consequence of some kind anyway.

48,When something happens it’s like everything goes blank and all I can think about is what happened and my brain goes 100 miles an hour and I can’t stop. I just wanna run somewhere.

49,"I know it seems kinda selfish to state that since she is the one that probably struggles most but I do need to vent. Since quarentine we've been living together, she used to live on her own since she was about 27 so not that long ago. Before that she used to live with us (me and my mother).


My mom asked her to move out because the last time we lived together she got so agressive towards me that she trew a vase at my head and I had to go to the emergency room and get stitches.


Now it seems that this nightmare is back, her. There is always someone screaming at my house (either her or my mom screaming at her). She tries to get into huge arguments with me all the time about the most stupid things. She has hit my mom several times, I feel that since I am older now she is a bit more scared to get into phisical fights with me. I feel that my mom enables her behavior because she always complains that I don't do the stuff the way she likes thats why she gets angry. ""She is not crasy, you are the one that stress her out""


My house rules:

I can't open or close the door that leads to my room past 8 pm because my door is too loud that will wake her. So if I am at my room I have to stay in if I am out of my room I should have gotten in sooner.

I can't turn on the microwave when she is around because she hates the sound of it, I can't ask her to leave the kitchen, I have to wait for her to leave on her own.

My room and hers share a suite so If I want to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night I can't turn on the lights (because the lights enters her room from the bottom of the door) and also can not fully close my door (because the sound of the doornob is too loud and that will wake her)

I can't turn on my Tv past 8pm because thats too loud for her

I can't exercise anywhere in the house anytime because the sound of me doing burpees annoys her.

These are just a few ones. There are plenty more...
I also would like to state that she is half-deaf. No. I am not kidding.

I feel this pressure within myself from the time that I wake till I go to bed again.

I am so stressed that sometimes I can't feel my arms (I talked to my pschologist and she said that this was from stress).

I am not the kind to scream when I am mad or cry when I am sad so I usually say what I am feeling but since the way I do that is frigid I feel as If they don't acknowledge my feelings.",10Aug2020,1

51,"I am seeking for answers from people who can help me please. It is very complicated, but i will try to make it short and sweet. My wife was a pot smoker until she got couple of psychosis. These psychosis i believe made her have 3 panic attacks. This period was pretty tough and unstable because I was noticing a lot of abnormal behaviours from her. You started to develop some fear from random people and she start to Believe people want to hurt her. She was saying that she can smell bad people and can see the devil in them. At certain point she was thinking mail man was following her. Regardless all that, she believe i have something to do with all that. She believe i am causing this. I am causing her insecurity, fear, mental instability... at certain point she believed that I was installing cameras all over the house and I try to poison her. The thing is she doesn’t feel like this with her family. She feels safe, she feels ok and not a single problem “as what they told me. With all this being said, I don’t know what is happening in her head when she is with her family. She left our place to go live with her dad “temporary”. She says that she went through alot because she had 3 panic attacks but she doesn’t recognize or believe that these panic attacks were caused by psychosis...
I somehow started to believe that she is schizophrenic but maybe it is too early to say that. 

The question is,is it normal someone with those symptoms can feel “safe” with their family and not safe with their life partner? What can explain that? I am so confused and not sure what to do at this point. Is it possible that if someone is schizophrenic can have certain feeling only with specific people or specific situation or places?

I’m not diagnosed with anything, but I’m sure I probably would be, if the idea of talking about my feelings and internal struggles with a complete stranger didn’t completely terrify me. I guess you could say that I have really bad social anxiety. Talking to people makes me want to run away, so I pretty much do what I can to avoid any sort of social interaction. I feel it’s better this way, to save myself embarrassment from saying something dumb or sounding awkward. I feel like it’s getting worse as I get older. Even when I’m with my husband, I can’t seem to put my thoughts into words. I stumble and misspeak; I’ve never had those problems before. And we’ve been together 11 years, and he’s probably the only person I can feel comfortable around. I’m becoming so uncomfortably aware of how awkward I am, and how others see me. I always thought that I was hyper aware of my differences and inadequacies. I always thought that I was just a quiet girl, and that everyone just saw me as a quiet girl. But, now it’s so obvious how different I am/ always have been. How people see me as less than, weird, dumb, awkward, like there’s something seriously wrong with me mentally. Idk maybe there is. I know there is, but that doesn’t mean that I want people to see me in such a negative light like that. It especially kills me to think my coworkers see me like that. I work and carry that with me all day, then I come home to chaos. I have a 13 month old who I’m trying to wean off breastfeeding, and a 4.5 year old asd son. I’m struggling so bad right now, but the baby wants to eat, my oldest has therapies to go to, my husband wants to spend time with me, my house needs cleaned, the dishes need done, so does the laundry, the list goes on. At the bottom, “make time for yourself.” I never really get that far. Everyone else gets what they need from me, though. Most days, I can’t handle doing the housework. I get completely overwhelmed just thinking about it. But, the mess stresses me out as well.  I can’t get through a day without losing it a couple times. Whether it’s yelling, because the kids keep dumping toys all over the floor. Or retreating to my room to have 2 quiet minutes to myself, before the baby starts crying outside the door, because I left. Then, it’s time for bed, and the whole process starts over again.

61,"So in short from I was 4 to 19 I would ""play pretend"" or ""act"" like an anime character mostly from the show Naruto with my siblings almost 24/7. The only time I'd be ""myself"" was around my parents or the public (at school with friends ect) but I did this so much that my mom startes to catch on and called me weird when I was 17 but didn't say much because she didnt want to make fun of me. After my dad unexpectedly passed away on June 26th 2018 when I was 19, I slowly but surely stopped acting like anime characters for good. I now am engaged to my fiance and am studying in nursing school. 

The bitter sweet part was that looking back it was the happiest time of my life. Being a kid and growing up into a teenager and just truly 100% acting like anime characters all day and night with my sisters. It was almost like a movie too. Like a fantasy world that made me comfortable and joyful. We would even change animes and act like their characters too it wasn't always naruto but majority of it was. And we'd play pretend of more than one character. We would fight battles together or just lounge and act the drama of the story line or make up our own dramas that were sometimes out of character.

It’s depressing to me and I often find myself unmotivated and exhausted with living.

Today explained to my mom that I have this condition and my dad was interjecting our conversation but wasn’t present. Somehow we got into the conversation around relationships and he looked over at me and said women should be beaten when they raise their voice. I told him that I was beaten by my ex and that when I heard him say that I took it that he was ok with my ex beating me. I asked him why he said that and he ignored me and said I should leave him alone to watch tv. My mom and I walked about and she was apologizing for his behavior and I couldn’t help but feel so sick that she has to deal with this... I saw her get beaten multiple times as a kid and be emotional abused all throughout my life.

I wish so many times that my mom and dad had a better relationship and that I could have grown up seeing that. This makes me depressed and honestly it makes life feel so so pointless.",10Aug2020,1

65,"Does anyone else go months without any strong emotions then just rage hard for a day then go back to little to no emotions? 




*If more information is required*
Today I woke up fine then within about 10 minutes I was livid. With everything but, specifically my husband. What's most infuriating is today is the first time in well over a year at least that my husband has spent a day with us. I got up before everyone as the usual morning process is, everything was my normal and then after I chugged 32 oz of ice water it was like I was supercharged angry but, I couldn't even fully articulate what was wrong. I wandered around my neighborhood on a walk trying to calm down but I just kept getting angrier. A list of things that infuriated me on my wander:

-- Neighbors left their dumpsters on the sidewalk completely blocking it, I had to walk through a big puddle.

-- 5 visible deer were grazing in the field near the end of my neighborhood, as I walked past them, a middle aged man and woman pulled up behind me in a truck, honked and yelled at me to leave the deer alone. I was not messing with the deer, they were probably close to 500 feet away from me plus, I'm not a dumbass.


Normally, I would just brush it off but, today it was fuel.
Anyway, I have just been raging all. Day. Long. My husband doesn't respond well to strong emotions. When I am angry, he likes to further intentionally push buttons, match my level, or go nuclear. Today he mainly just intentionally pushed buttons, which I think was to make me encourage him to never, ever spend time with us. He kept saying, ""you're always angry! You're so bitter and angry all the time!"" And that is definitely not true. He would not know how I always am because on average I see him for 7 to 10 hours a week.

I appreciate you reading this, any advice or tips are appreciated.

As Coronavirus spreading across Australia, and they are worrying on Manga from Japan banned in order to protect their children rather than protecting them from the virus.

I was deeply worried seeing all my favorite animes banned left and right. We have an Explosion in Beirut, America is reaching 5M cases of Coronavirus. And now Australia, worsens the Coronavirus epidemic, and focusing on FICTIONAL BOOKS.

This is like 1984 and Fahrenheit 451.

The Outbreak of COVID-19 made my mental state gone downhill. Why would the world curses different cultures? They cannot comprehend between the Normies (people doing normal things), and the Weebs (people doing anime and stuff). My mind is completely in pain and I have absolute hatred on Australia for banning Anime &amp; Manga. No psychological case studies were found on anime ban and psychology.

Taking these manga away is worth billions of dollars wasted!!!

Banning on Anime and Manga is my worst mindbreak on my mental psyche. 2020 is keep getting worse and worse. I've been worrying too much already, but I need psychological help to deal this situation. All things from the Australia government are scandalous, unreasonable and unnecessary since the Australia fire began or Coronavirus began.

TLDR: Censorship is bad for me and my mental health. Stay Away from Boomers and Karens that are hating culture including Video Games and Anime.

So I just found out seeing things like faces and creatures out of the corners of my eye isn’t a normal thing that happens to everyone. And I’m kinda idk I guess in awe about it. I’ve lived a long time thinking that this happened to everybody.

But I guess not. Let me give some background, Ive got OCD but I don’t think that it’s connected then again idk. I live with intense fear and paranoia and until a couple of hours ago I thought this was completely normal. I guess you could even say it’s become so bad it’s dangerous.

I am broken beyond recognition. I am nothing like I used to be. I am numb and indifferent most of the time. And if I'm not numb, I am uncontrollably angry. Rarely I breakdown and cry all night, but every time I cry about my trauma I end up feeling guilty. Like I deserved everything that has happened to me. I feel like I am unworthy of love or a bright future.

Whenever something that could possibly be a big issue happen, I desperately want it to happen. I tested negative for cancer. But I was hoping I had it. I had a terribly realistic dream and I thought I was having a seizure(which would ruin the specific profession I'm going to college for) I hoped that it was a real seizure so that my life would be ruined. 

I stayed in an emotionally abusive relationship because I felt like I don't deserve to be treated better. He made me cry almost everyday and I refused to break up with him because I wanted to hurt. Why do I want to hurt? I hate being in pain, truly. That's why I'm so numb. I purposely and actively try to not feel anything. But the way I act makes me think that I want to hurt.

90,"Hello to everyone who is reading this(sorry for the bad spelling/grammar), so my mum just got out of an extremely abusive relationship with my father that lasted about 28 years I believe, now I'm only 12 so I grew up with this thinking that it was normal. When they were fighting they would yell quite a lot, witch is why I cry when ever someone yells at me, and he throw stuff at her and tryd to hit her and he would also hit himself alot, I remember when I was about 7 he smashed a plate across his head. I would always cry when they were fighting while my older siblings tried to comfort me. Their relationship lasted for so long because he emotionally abused my mum. During this time he wouldn't let my mum pursue her dreams, she wanted to be a nurse but he wouldn't let her because he thought she would cheat on him (now she is a nurse which is really great) by now I got used to it, but a couple months ago my mum invited him over for dinner because she wanted to stay on good terms with him so he could still see us kids, everything was going fine but he started saying that he couldn't live without us and that he had to be with her, my mum kept rejecting him and saying that their just friends, but he wouldn't take no for an answer so he started to get aggressive and started trying to hit her so my 14 year old brother had to intervene while my 22 year old brother just watched. Now me being a scrawny little 12 year old (who would've been thrown in the air if I tryd to help) ran into my room closed the door and called the police because that's all I could do to help while on the phone to the police I was shaking uncontrollably and trying to find something to defend myself with if the worst were to come, I could hear yelling and I was absolutely terrified, my mum was in the kitchen balling her eyes out while my brother was trying to make him stop, so I ran to the kitchen to comfort my mum and I had I frying pan ready to hit him over the head if he came near her, my mum rang his perants to come over, eventually the police got to the house and restraind him and put him in the car, we got questioned by police and we got a restraining order, and his parents didn't even care about us because they don't think he can do anything wrong and they blamed it all on my mum. Now about a week ago he called my mum's mum and threatened to kill her and us if my mum didn't get back with him. And we moved towns because we didn't feel safe there and cut all contact with him except for my eldest brother who ofcourse had to ruin everything and tell him what town we are in, I have insomnia because I don't sleep and when I do I wake up at random times, like I'll go to sleep and then wake up 6 different times, and I have nightmares about him or somebody breaking in, every little noise I hear I think that it's someone breaking in and I get terrified. Me and my brother have not gone to school yet because we're not mentally stable so we're going to see a therapist. I have suicidal and homicidal thoughts, there isn't many specific people that I want to kill I just want to kill people and I don't know why. Now stuff about school, I struggle a lot at school and I won't pass unless I get extra help, in sixth grade i got my mum to ask my teacher for extra help and she basically said that I wasn't dumb enough for it. And when I try to answer a question I usually get it wrong and get laughed at so thats why I never answer questions. And I was seen as the lazy shy kid because I always had a note to sit out in PE but I'm not lazy I just sat out because everyone was watching me and if I messed up I would get so embarrassed and get laughed at, not to mention body dysmorphia, I just have really bad anxiety but the teacher's couldn't simply ask if I was okay, witch I'm not. I don't have motivation to get out of bed and my mum always says that I should get out of my room and be more productive but I feel safest in my room where no one can judge me. The first time I told her that I was depressed she said ""everyone is sad"" and now she gets mad when I tell her nothing. I have therapy and I'm really scared because I find it hard to talk to people and I can't tell her that I self harm because then she'll tell my mum and my mum would get mad.

91,"So after 12 years of keeping this a secret I have finally came out and told my boyfriend what happened to me between the ages 8-11. He suggested talking to a professional or at least getting some advice on where to go next. 

So between the ages of 8-11 I have been sexually abused by 2 of my older sisters. I will call them sister 1 and sister 2. 

So sister 1 who is 7 years older then me used to ask/ make me give her back rubs and slowly turn onto her front and getting her to rub her chest too which I was never comfortable with. She also wanted to try kissing on me this happened once or twice a month for the 3 years it happened. 

Sister 2 was a lot more abusive in what happened. She was 3 years older then me. It started out in a similar way but the major difference was we shared a room. So as I say it started out in the same way but it slowly progressed to touching down there, her touching me and me touching her, both of which I was totally against and was tricked into doing. 

After a while sister number 2 made ‘kisses’ happen down there which I made clear I did not want to do but she said she would give me sweets and would also tell me that she would tell my parents I had done something and like any child I did not want to be told off by my parents and I felt I was tricked into this being a normal thing. 

This happened with sister 2 every other day for 3 years. I don’t remember why or how it stopped. I’d like to mention too neither of my sisters knew about the other. 

The after effect of this I feel has been astronomical. I have extremely struggled with mental health ever since. I have been though so much with my
Mental health, I have gone though self harm to bulimia to planning my own death, but have always managed to over come these. I feel this is where it all stems from and every time I get in a good place these memories come back and I just can’t ever get over this whole part of my life. 

For me especially with sister 2 I feel I’m stuck in this circle where if I try anything new sister 2 has to join me and I can’t have anything to myself. I don’t even know if she remembers what she has done to me but every moment of every day I see her or she try’s to spend time with me I feel hatred towards her and myself and I feel my troubles with mental health are the only things I have to myself but lucky my boyfriend try’s to keep me on the right path. 

I feel like at some point this is all going to come out especially since I have kept it a secret until tonight. I know my boyfriend won’t tell anyone else long as I don’t want him too, but I feel 20kg lighter after telling him tonight. 

We talked about what the possible outcome of telling my family would be and I just don’t know about it. My dad is very understanding of my mental health but not fully there about the right and wrong ways to help me. I feel like if I tell my family about what has happened they either won’t believe a word I say or will cast me aside rather then the other 2 sisters. Past experiences with my family have led me to that conclusion, with past mental health issues being made to be my fault and rather then addressing the issue they would rather just point the finger all at me. 

My boyfriend suggested talking to a therapist who has trained in this area and just even see their view on it and how to handle it. I really don’t want to lose my family so I don’t know if to just live with this secret forever or break the family up and see if it makes me feel better.

so, i (F17) was diagnosed with depression/anxiety back in 2017. From then to late 2018 i was trying different meds and nothing seemed to be working and so i got admitted into a completely different kind of psych ward with a ""no meds for minors unless completely necessary"" kind of attitude. my mom super loved this idea and so I've been off since then .

Fast forward to now I've been in therapy for about 2 years learning coping mechanisms, how to get through depressive episodes alone, out of anxiety attacks, calming my body down and it takes an incredible amount of mental strength. Honestly I'm not sure how I'm keeping it up - except for this incessant fear that if i give up, everyone around me will be upset/shocked or bot even believe me.

I kind of lost hope in finding help in other people, because everytime i reached out, it only helped me to a certain point before i came crashing down again. I feel like I'm in limbo between ""i give up, I'm done, i don't want to fight anymore"" and ""stop being dramatic, you're fine, toughen up""

I'm not going to go into too much detail unless someone asks, but at the moment I'm being supported by my father, I'm (very poorly) dealing with grief from my mother's passing a few years ago, I have major anxiety and depression and my dad wants to retire at the end of this year. 

He's made it clear that he won't leave me out to dry, especially considering the things I gave up for my family, but that would mean that I move with them when they leave and pretty much stay with them. 

I desperately just want to be able to look after myself and live my life, or any kind of life for that matter. 

I've been seeing a psychologist, but if I'm honest I don't feel like that helps beyond having someone validate how I feel and telling me what I've decided to do seems like the right path/a good idea. (I don't have any kind of support network of my own)

I'm considering seeing a psychiatrist, but I don't think I can afford that treatment. I was diagnosed as bipolar II years back, although I was never really confident in the diagnosis as I was on a multitude of medications for years and I couldn't even fix my insomnia/hypersomnia and I just felt hopeless. I'm still open to it as a valid diagnosis, I just can't afford to waste that kind of money on a mistake is all. 

I got my TEFL (teaching English as a second language) certification long before the pandemic hit, but I couldn't function, as I still can't, and now naturally the market is over saturated.

I'm disabled as well so getting a regular job doesn't work for me (I've tried, years ago), even if I could actually get up in the morning.

Get a liver test, hormone test, thyroid test, and scan your body daily for physical symptoms, and keep a log of what you do and how you feel: even stuff you eat can cause anxiety and depression. And I dont just mean that junk food makes you feel depressed and guilty: you could literally have allergies to food that antidepressants cant prevent and you might have the allergy for the rest of your life.

Hormone imbalances can easily cause depression. MANY Women have reported significantly improved mood and anxiety when going on the birth control pill- even if they never plan on having a baby.

There are so many confounding factors : get a Seasonal Affective disorder lamp and try using it to see if you have a circadian problem. Try blue light glasses at night. Try an air filter, try measuring your humidity in your home : high humidity can cause mold in the air which can cause further allergies.",10Aug2020,1
99,"We both deal with mental illness. His is more specific than just the general depression and anxiety we both suffer from. We’re long distance and it’s tough in general, but it’s becoming really hard for me when his mental health dips. Not because he doesn’t have the energy or right mind state to give me attention, but because it hurts my heart to see him going through this. Every time he tells me something is off and he’s having a rough time, I know what’s going to happen. He’s going to get through it like a trooper, mostly on his own because he prefers it that way. We’re going to say “goodnight” or “talk to you later” and hang up or end the text conversation. And I’m immediately going to start tearing up and become a wreck. I care too much about him and it’s so hard seeing him go through this. I spiral with thoughts about all that he has to deal with and it breaks my heart and how I can’t help it just disappear. He always bounces back but until then I just stay upset and can’t make these extremely troubling feelings go away. Does anyone has, or who loves someone with, mental illness know how I can shake these feelings and comfort myself when I can’t directly comfort him? I just feel hopeless and left to drown in them. Ways to distract myself or make myself feel okay and comfortable. I get incredibly emotional when this happens and it’s often. No real conflict happens between us.

101,"Hello Reddit, 

Whilst I fully understand that so many people have it a million times more difficult that me, I still believe that everyone's mental health is important no matter how small it may be.

I have never been diagnosed with any form of condition relating to mental health so I will refrain from 'self diagnosing' in order to respect those who have been clinically diagnosed. 

For context, I am an 18 year old male living in the UK. 

One of the main things I struggle with is my mind constantly working at 100mph meaning I overthink and stress over stupid little things that aren't worth 10 seconds of my time.

I also struggle with self doubt and doubting whether the people around me actually like me or whether I am just one of the crowd that will be forgotten before long.

I have done stupid things in order to distract my mind from these things such as drinking ridiculous amounts of alcohol until I black out, taking drugs, or going out driving at dangerous speeds. The latter is the one coping method I am most ashamed of, because it puts so many other people in danger not just myself. 

I told all of this to my best friend a couple days ago and I am so glad I did. I never imagined how supportive that person would be of me. Even when I broke down in tears in front of him, he sat and he listened to every single word I said. Last night I sat and thought about that and cried again because I never thought I would have a friend like that.

I am sitting down with my parents tonight and I am going to do the same thing as my relationship with them has become so stretched to the point I am no longer living at home. 

I am not suicidal, but there are times that I no longer want to be here, not everyone will understand that, but I know someone will. Every time I feel like not being here ,I think of everyone that I love and that love me, and I stop and say to myself 'Today is not the day, there are too many people and too much to leave behind.'

To anyone who has read this far thank you for reading my story, I have left a lot out because I could write for hours on this.

And for anyone that is struggling or thinking about ending things, please don't, people love you, people care, and things will get better.

Thank You.",10Aug2020,1
102,"I’m extremely antisocial due to my anxiety. I don’t have friends that I talk to on a regular basis so I’m lonely all the time. It’s gotten worse because of quarantine (although I’d rather be alone than spread Covid). In an effort to get more social interaction, I tried getting back into online games where I could talk to people there. Big mistake. People are toxic as hell and since I left first person shooters a while ago (because of the toxicity), I’m not that good. That, plus the fact that I won’t fight back makes me an easy target. I got flamed super hard today. My entire team started berating me, calling me dumb, telling me to kill myself, and the like. I know that they were just looking to assert themselves as a bunch of alpha males and looking for a scapegoat to blame for loosing, but I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. I get really frustrated when my lack of confidence in my abilities keeps me from achieving results (which was a large factor in that game), so I can’t help but agree with some of the sentiment. I sure as hell don’t want to, those guys sucked. But I can’t seem to brush the situation off. What should I do to get over this?",10Aug2020,1

105,"Last month, a family friend had spinal damage which left her quadriplegic and brain damaged. I started to feel weird because her situation matched that of a character in my latest story. I was slightly terrified but I didn’t freak out too much because I’m actually quite a logical person when I’m sane.

However, last week, a classmate’s father was killed by cardiovascular disease after a severe car accident, and that was what did it for me. His story, again, matched yet a second character in my story. I wanted to abandon the story for good this time but I can’t let go of it because it is the only work of mine that I truly care for. I keep falling into a cycle of writing the story, noticing more little coincidences, having panic attacks, and writing to soothe the pain, which only makes it worse and worse each time.

I feel like my mental border between fiction and reality is getting blurrier by day, and since I’m a student it’s threatening to put my good grades to a halt.

107,"Hi I guess I’m just trying to see if anyone has experienced this feeling. 
 But, like the title suggests, my everyday just feels like a screensaver to me. I feel like I live majority of my life in my head. I can spend hours just daydreaming and thinking. I think about scenarios, questions, intangible things, feelings, you name it. Multiple things at once even. I feel like my brain has 80 tabs open and it’s hard to focus on what’s most important: what’s right in front of me. 
I can have whole conversations where I’m on autopilot and I don’t, or hardly know what was said. Sometimes I can’t even process what people are saying because I’m so focused on completing a thought that words sound like gibberish. 
I don’t know how long I’ve been like this but I’m afraid it’s causing me to look bleak and boring at times and I hate it. And I have to try so hard, so INCREDIBLY hard to filter out all my thoughts to be outgoing when I truly need to be.

Basically, I go through periods of time where I feel fine in a way, but very distant from my life and relationships. Not really unhappy, but unable to truly ‘feel’ the things im experiencing. My emotions, especially happy ones, feel kind of flat. Somewhat numb in a way and like im observing my own life. I start to overthink many social relationships and situation because it doesnt feel like it just happens naturally anymore.

I used to think this was maybe related to my birth control, because I had a very good period of time where I felt more truly happy and in touch with my feelings when I was off it.  Now ive been back on it for about 7 months and am only now having another period like what im describing above, so im not sure if its related. There doesnt seem to really be a trigger.

I'm just coming down from a bi-polar 'high' phase.  I went crazy the last few days.   Bought loads of stuff I don't need (furniture I don't have space for, a sewing machine I will likely never use, sport equipment, plants etc.). I started to 'makeover' my flat-it's a mess, calling people, making crazy posts- got banned. I'm glad that I didn't went out and met people. I was conscious enough (for my safety) to keep to myself, except for my family. They know my 'crazy' phases, used to my calls in the middle of the night and being hyped for whatever is important to me at that moment. Didn't sleep much, hurt myself.

I'm physically and mentally exhausted, but glad that I managed to eat again for the first time in days and being able to go out and buy cat food. I'm in the dark place for now. Depression, suicidal thoughts and despair for not knowing what to do with my life. Always making the wrong (career) choices and feeling stuck. Shouldn't have left my old job(s), shouldn't have moved countries again.  Should be in London or California/Nevada and trying to make my dream job (for now) a reality. I'm fucked and don't have the energy to start all over again.

I don't even know what it will take to make me 'happy' or at least content with my life. Relationships stress me out after a while.  Had nice jobs and left. I don't know how I would deal in a stressful job and having an episode. The fields I'm interested in are stressful, fast paced and deal with many assholes. I've found a small,  successful promotion-perfect for me. Instead of finding new energy and a goal, it made me depressed cause it's boxing.  I cried over it. All the good stuff is not happening over here. I'm not interested in the scenes. Don't have the energy to move back to England or America. Don't even know how Covid will be affecting my future plans.

115,"I'm looking for self-help book recommendations for a close family member (F/30). To summarise the challenges she's facing:

-	She’s a chronic worrier. Her worries and anxieties dominate her and are damaging personal relationships with family and loved ones. Eg her conversations almost always revolve around seeing problems, worrying and complaining so it’s increasingly difficult to enjoy time with her. 
-	Her negativity is usually about analysing other people. She views people as deceitful, rude, hateful, etc. It can be colleagues who are blunt (IMO misreading professionalism for rudeness), family members who say the wrong thing (becomes an overblown analysis) or even just the the woman at the till who might have looked bored/grumpy. These interactions can send her on a spiral of negative tirades.
-	She has a lack of self awareness. Conversations with her can be very long winded (can end up hours) and one-sided once she gets going about her perceived grievances. The lack of self awareness is quite literal. She sometimes won’t realise actual things around her.
-	Her obsession with these perceived injustices stop her from enjoying life and pursuing actually important things. 

Other than these things, when she’s not being negative, she’s a very lovely person. It’s strange just how different this other side of her can be and how dominating it can get.

118,For the past year or so I've had what I would call episodes of paranoia. Sometimes randomly maybe 2 or 3 times a month I will feel like I'm being watched or followed. It started off just a night when I would be walking home from work I would feel like I'm being followed and Id get very anxious. Over the past year it has escalated to the point where I'm checking to make sure my doors and windows are locked multiple times  during these episodes and will even check all my rooms closest and even the shower because I feel as if someone is in my house. Sometimes I will even see a person look at me well walking down the street and start to panic that they are following me even though i know they aren't. Like I said this only happens maybe 2 to 3 times a month and normally lasts for and hour. Does anyone thing this is something I should seek help for? The only thing I can think of that started this was about a year and a half ago maybe a few months before this all started I had taken magic mushrooms and experience what I believe to have been psychosis.,10Aug2020,1

121,"“You always think you’re perfect”
“You never think you’re wrong”
 
“People notice not just me”

“You’re like a robot you need to be told what to do, you never think about how you can help”
(meanwhile the other people aren’t  even asked to help and doesn’t get scolded for not thinking of how how she can help)

I’m always told I’m too emotional, too dramatic, too selfish, think too highly of myself.

Yes I know I don’t help around the house as I should but other than the kitchen she seldom does too

Whenever she’s on her phone it’s important but when I’m on my phone it’s not. How is that fair. 

She finds it wrong that I don’t want her to see my Instagram but that’s not a platform I want my parents to see. She argues that I’m fine with having strangers see my profile but but my own mother and that in it of itself is a red flag to the bad kind of person I am. But what would I care care what strangers think of me they don’t have influence over me like my mother does. I follow no parents just as my friends don’t. None of their parent have an IG and would ever even ask to see their IG’s. I feel like I can no longer post about me, the real me the girl who wants to have fun, who’s anxious most of the time, who’s stressed, who blows off steam by drinking with friends, I guess what it is is I don’t want to be seen as a disappointment.

I’m constantly criticized for everything I do and you might say all mothers are like that but she’s the type of person who only sees her way of doing things correct and won’t even let you try a different method. She would complain at my discontent at doing chores.
I hate cleaning and I can’t change that fact, but I never just ignore her or not do them after she tells me to. But the fact that she expects me to look happy about doing something I don’t like has always irked me to no end. Im doing it, without any verbal complaints but how can I control my face. And it’s not as if I’m glaring in her directions she’s actively watching my facial expression. Don’t you think if I could I would magically transform into a good hearted person who enjoys doing chores and helping out in the house but the sad truth is I not the kind hearted person and I don’t like doing these things, but I doesn’t mean that I’m not gonna do it when asked. Just have a little bit of a realistic expectation here.

She thinks I have no struggles or that I don’t try enough and she always judges me it would always discourage me from doing things late at night because I’d be bombarded by criticism saying I’ve procrastinated and that o never have a good future like this when she doesn’t understand o don’t procrastinate just because I’m being lazy I dread and am anxious of starting projects when I know I have no talent or skills for.

I know I’ve passed all my classes albeit the one that I failed but I feel inadequate, untalented, mediocre. Although I’d die to admit it to someone. I’m NOT special at all I’m just a bratty obnoxious person with opinions that harshly judges others though I’m not better myself.

I’m an ugly person, a selfish person, I don’t even have any real life skills, I don’t really know how to do anything and I’m scared I won’t find a job after I finish college this month. I’m 23, broke, living at my parents, no job(COVID related, I at least used to work) and no skills. I’m a LOSER dependent on my parents for a place to live, but I act like someone bigger and better. What a disgusting person I am.

I’m not warm, not conscientious, I’m not bright, I not a hard worker, I don’t try hard enough. I’m not thoughtful. I don’t think of others. But I don’t think I’m a really bad person. What kind of a person has this mentality. I must be a monster.

I’m fake, I want to give off an image of posh perfection, I even lie to my friends when they don’t to me. I’m sacred that they’ll find out I’m too ugly inside and I’ll have no one but my family who don’t see me as more than am incapable little girl.

I’m so unhinged I clap back at attacks to my character because it hurts, it just proves how it’s true. I cry so easily because that’s how fragile my feelings are towards myself when I’m generally unfeeling towards other people. I must have been born without compassion. Sometimes I’m scared that I’m psychopathic. I always seem to relate more to villains than heros. I scared of amounting to nothing because I inspire nothing.

I can’t even go to therapy without the fear of my parents finding out. I’m sure they’ll think I’m crazy for even suggesting it. They’ve never really just heard me out, it’s always a what you’re feeling and doing is wrong, you’re wrong, you’re too emotional.

I remember my mom bringing up if I’m depressed a few years back because I was acting moody, mean, unresponsive and I said maybe I am, I was angrily mocked and asked if I needed to get therapy. My father then chimmed in a said  future employers will know your coworkers will know people will know. They’ll all know you’re not right, that you have a problem.

I had a bout of suicidal thoughts back in middle school or was it highschool, I wrote down my feelings and some suicide stats on an index card an taped it on my mirror. I never intentionally want them to see it and my parents seldom entered my room but as luck would have it, they found it. They didn’t ask me if I was unhappy or how I was feeling they got mad and reprimanded me for feeling that I had a hard life. I grew up privileged  enough to never go without food, clothes, and even had enough for the electronics like game consoles and cell phones. I don’t remember why I was depressed back then no matter how hard I try to recall I must’ve locked it away. But I was upset, not that they found it because in truth maybe I did want them to find it to ask me how I was doing, I wanted to be comforted. I wanted warmth, I wanted concern but I was met with anger. I was told  how stupid I was that I thought and felt that I had big problems and even stupider for having thoughts to end my life all in an angered tone. Telling me I had no right to feel the way I did and not even inquiring how or why I felt that way, if made me feel that I was wrong and stupid, and that there was something truly not right in my head. Perhaps that’s why I sealed away the memories of why I  was depressed in the first place. I really wanted and tried to remember because I want validation that I’m not a total trash person and that there was a reason.

I think I’ve always known I was depressed deep inside but would dismiss it because I had a lot of happy days and things I’m thankful for. I didn’t know you could be happy and depressed at the same time. I thought being depressed was a constant endless state. I always didn’t want to admit it because there’s a stigma that depressed people are broken people. I had an even worse fear that I’m not depressed and just act the way I do because I’m was born a bad person and depression was a convenient excuse.",10Aug2020,1

so i don’t really want to give all the details but basically my grandparents would foster kids when this happened and at the time they were fostering a 14 year old boy that i’m gonna call tom and basically he did some not very good things to my younger cousins who were 2 and 4 at the time. 

and for whatever reason i have been fucking terrified by the fact that he could’ve done something to me and that i just don’t remember.
i have nightmares at least 3 times a month about him. most the time he’s just the villain in the dream but the other night i had the worst dream about him i’ve ever had. i’m not gonna go into detail but he did some really awful things to me and i just don’t know what to think anymore.

i told my mum about the dream and she thinks that i’m trying to tell her that he did something to me. i know he most likely didn’t and she knows that too. she’s said there were no signs he did anything to me and that she would’ve known if he did and yet still i’m terrified that there’s a chance he could’ve. 

it’s so selfish of me to think like this. he didn’t do anything to me he did it to my cousins and still they’re more mentally stable than me about this.
i don’t know what the fuck is wrong with me i just need help.

also i forgot to mention that i am already in therapy and i’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and a large portion of it i’d say is because of this situation.
i’ve mentioned Tom to my therapist but i’ve never told her that i think he might have done something to me.

i don’t know how to talk about it. i’m so selfish
 i don’t understand what’s wrong with me.

I started off fine, not worrying too much about everything as long as it’s disinfected it’s fine. 5 months down the line I have gone the full on insane. 

Example : I use way too much alcohol on packaging , I won’t eat an egg if it has dirt on it , if I crack an egg and it touches my finger I will throw it in the bin , if I get something out of the packet and it touches the outer packet in anyway shape or form I have to throw it away ( food items ) ... It’s killing me.

But the one thing that does bother my quite a bit is seeing posts from teens or even early 20s. I’m not bothered by the content and I definitely want them to reach out. But this age difference is the one thing that gets me. I feel more compelled to want to help, but at the same time am really leery of this age group getting feedback from strangers/adults on the internet.

127," TLDR: I can't stop analyzing communication with SO and think I might suffer from (relationship) anxiety. What to do?

We're 28 and 33. Together 1 year. Like the titles says, I keep going over and over our interactions. I think to make sure I said the right thing, to analyse their affection or if it was an argument (doesn't happen often at all) to see where 'it went wrong' or where I could prevent it from 'escalating' next time.

We don't live together yet and we see each other maybe 2 or 3 days in the week. So a lot of our communication is over text. After each day, when I'm in bed, I read the convo we've had over and over. Sometimes just because it was fun but it can also be.. compulsive, and I'm (over) analyzing everything they said and I said. They don't know this &amp; I would be embarrassed to tell them.

It's not really seriously hurting me, them, or our relationship per se, but I do think its strange and I can't really seem to stop. It can also feel too much and unpleasant. I think it might have to do with a bad break-up that came out of nowhere for me a few years back, I haven't really been with anyone serious since until now. That was the worst time of my life. Maybe I have a deep fear of missing signs that they are pulling away or smt, like it happened last time?

Anyway, I wanted to see if anyone on here has done, or is doing this too, and how do you feel about it? Or what you think it could be and how I can stop/ have a more healthy attitude? Is this anxiety? I also react very strongly to any conflict or anything between us, I get emotional and upset (sometimes shaking, dry mouth, strong heart beat, sweating etc). Afraid and scared they will leave. They do know this and are really good with it and always affirm everything for me when I'm feeling this way (saying things like, I love you, everything is ok, I want to be with you etc). So I know what I'm doing and my worrying is irrational, but I can't help it. I was in therapy for a short depressive episode last year and this did come up but I wasn't really given any advice about it nor did the word anxiety come up. I also compulsively chew on the sides of my tongue some periods, not till it bleeds but it does hurt, idk if that has anything to do with it. I'm pretty ok and happy besides this and do not struggle in other aspects of life (anymore). Any advice or similar (succes) stories would really help! Sorry if this all sounds dumb.",10Aug2020,1
128,"These past several days have been really strange. I’ll be driving to work or coming home and night, then it’s like I realize what I’m doing. I guess that’s dissociation. Whatever it is, I’ve been doing it constantly. It’s something of a new problem for me. But it isn’t always an issue. Sometimes I dissociate because it’s just easier to block things out. But even more than dissociation, I’ve been slipping into depression pretty badly the past two days or so. 
       I’ve gone as far as planning out how I would run away and delete all of my information so I couldn’t be found. I’ve done some thinking about how to get out of my current lease without hurting my roommates financially. And my idea was to just drive somewhere, maybe move a few states away. I don’t want to hurt my family, but running away and traveling has always appealed to me. The idea of getting lost seems nice. Connecting with people seems harder. Isolation is more appealing. 
       I understand everyone is somewhat isolated right now, but I’ve gotten to a point where I prefer the isolation over socializing. There have been a few times in the last few months where I genuinely enjoyed the company of other people. It’s not enough to make me want to stick around, though. I have a problem with trusting people. And it’s not like I’ve been lied to a lot or anything, but for some reason I have very little trust for anyone but myself. When people give me compliments I assume they’re lying or just saying it to be nice. 
      This is a super long post, and I’ve done all this to say I don’t know what to do. If anyone has been in this place recently, not exactly wanting to die but wishing you could go missing for a while, I’d love to hear how you cope or what actions you’ve taken because of it.",10Aug2020,1
129,"I want to share with you a practice that helps me when my world is shaky. Everything seems to be fine, but suddenly I feel sad without any reason and it seems that the world, so stable yesterday, is collapsing suddenly.

Well, first of all, **I let myself suffer!** 

I'm serious. I try to feel all the emotions, I let them pass through my body. This is the easiest way to move on. We are stopped from so many decisions, actions and wonderful events by not wanting to face our own emotions. Whatever you feel, just dive into these feelings.

And the second stage. **Taking care of yourself.** 

Think about what kind of the energy is going away, how you can support yourself, what kind of leak you need to block. Treat yourself with understanding and love.

At that stage I try to focus on things that I’ll benefit from.

Emotional energy: hugging, petting cats, watching a good movie.

Intellectual energy: studying, reading, and trying to understand new things.

Physical energy: sleeping, walking, and doing yoga.

Spiritual energy: meditating, painting, and writing.

I can recommend some apps I use to feel better, but please find what suits you best.

1. Headspace for meditation and good sleep: [https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app](https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app)
2. Zenia for guided home yoga practice: [https://get.zenia.app/0BrF/f2f98069](https://get.zenia.app/0BrF/f2f98069)
3. Mood notes for emotional balance: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/moodnotes-cbt-mood-tracker/id1019230398](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/moodnotes-cbt-mood-tracker/id1019230398)
4. Card Diary for keeping good moments in memory: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/card-diary-memories-journal/id1295506659](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/card-diary-memories-journal/id1295506659)

And after such a quick but very effective therapy, you can go on a date with yourself and talk. Ask yourself the question: what the hell is going on and what are we going to do about it?

However, usually after the first two stages everything comes in order again. It turns out that in fact everything is fine.

**What can you do right now?**

Feel what you are feeling now. Understand how your body responds. Let it be. Breathe deeply. Give yourself attention.",10Aug2020,1

134,"Hello. I came here looking for some advice about what happens to her. She permanently acts very weirdly and her behaviour sometimes borders literal paranoid one. She makes our lives very hard and literally just living in this house means you are never going to be happy and have to live with extreme stress levels. I am going to write all her behaviours which we think remarkable and not normsl in a sane person:

-She listens things no other says or listens, generally insults against her that no one absolutely says. Sometimes she hears noises in the night from our rooms and can enter in our rooms in deep night hysterical, no matter we were silent or even sleeping. And, we WERE silent. I can completely prove it.

-Sees imaginsry things for very brief periods or time, for seconds, sometimes less than a second. Normally sees bugs and insects of different classes, people who thinks she knows among a crowd, and a grin in the face or people she is argoing with. And, trust me that when that happens, we, or others, can't have less reasons to smile in that specific moments. It can't be our expression which leads to misinterpretation because either everyone has the same expression or it's my problem, who have natural extremely serious expression and rarely feels smiling, even less without a reason. This visions don't seem to happen the rare times she is calm, at least less commonly, but they aren't super common at high stress, it's not normal to see her having visions but definitely happens.

-Thinking every single word we pronounce out her presence is against her, critics or insults, and that we literally exclusively dedicate our topics to insult her.

-Lives thinking we will forsake her in an old people residential center to not having to deal with her when old and every single day shouts recriminating it when hasn't even happened or seeiously just planned. Obsessed to insane points with everyone wanting to possess her riches when dead but no one really caring about her.

-Menaces with take her life regulary, sometimes in front of us, sometimes secetly to her husband.

-ALWAYS depressed, I can't remember a single time on over two decades she comfronted any situation minimally positively, in a healthy way and not sinking herself deep in bad emotions of any kind.

-Has hypersensibility, this one is diagnosed. Every minor thing has a disproportionate effect in her. Once, without exagerating, saw the news and remained on bed for a full week unable to talk or do anything because of it.

-Naturally aggresive, always and against EVERYONE, known by her or not. If someone in some place does something she dislikes she tirns even more aggresive, and she will pay her frustration with us in a variety of ways, and vice versa. Goes rampant against basically everyone when other different person upsets her.

-High stress levels, sleeps like 2-4 hours a day, sleep problems, her job is killing, and though everyone works in home duties they are a lot of them, raising the stress.

-Shows constant victimism, not as I'm wanting to critisize her but because realistically everything at the end will end with her exposing herself as the victim, redirect everything as going against her and point others for being against her. She almost never admits mistakes (counted times she did, two in over 20 years) and it's associated with two previous points, her tencency to believe everyone think and talk bad about her and her aggresivity, always attacking. Says she is shit and bad things about her to try make others feel worse.

-Nonexistent self-esteem, hates herself, her personality, her body and her life.

-Very few friends

137,"CBT - cognitive brain therapy
EMDR - Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing 

I suffer from pretty bad anxiety where my thoughts just get all muddled and say I encounter something that gives me anxiety, all my previous memories that trigger anxiety just cause bigger anxiety than necessary.

I was offered EMDR and CBT therapy as a way to try and help not get extreme anxiety but less impactful anxiety. I honestly loved how it works. In particular EMDR. The psych gets you to think of a memory where it triggers anxiety, and they genuinely wave their fingers in front of you, and magically your brain is just like well this particular memory doesn't cause anxiety anymore. Then the psych gets you to picture another memory and so on. Whilst this is happening your brain is kind of filing these memories so instead of being this huge cluster of memories and their common interest being anxiety, they get sorted into other categories. If you can kind of imagine that.

EMDR is also really good for PTSD, as it was designed initially for that as a way to remove the traumatic emotional side of things from a memory, to help it become less invasive in your day to day life.

Check out the origins behind it. It truly is amazing. 

If you do want to try it, few psychs do know how to do it, so ask your psych and Google/call some local psychs to find someone. I was fortunate that my regular psych was trained to do it, and was the one to offer it to me. 
Plus if you want more details on how the experience was feel free to chat with me. You might be cautious or anxious like I was to try it and I know I would've loved someone to go over their experience for me. I just had to trust my psych and Google. Neither of which let me down.

Also disclaimer to abide by the rules just in case. 
I'm based in Australia. However I do believe this is globally practised. 
As well, this doesn't normally cost extra than your normal psych visit. In Australia it was part of my 10 free psych visits we get each year. Just in case it may of been seen as promotional.",10Aug2020,1
138,"Hi reddit, 

This is my first post here so thanks for having me in this sub..

I've been having these weird outbursts and I'm not sure why.

What basically happens:   
I'll be doing something normal like working on my laptop or I'll be in bed trying to sleep. I'll remember an embarrassing moment or bad part of my life and I'll blurt out something (i.e. 'oh god', 'f\*cking sh\*t', 'I hate those c\*nts' or something similar) and tense up.

This normally doesn't happen in front of people up until now but I've noticed I'm doing it more and more in front of my family and I've had to pass it off as me getting frustrated with my work etc. 

I haven't been diagnosed with any mental health conditions but my dad has got severe OCD.

I convinced her to go to therapy a few months ago, telling her about how much it helped me and some success stories, but the therapist she was seeing did little to no help. She stopped going after a few months, but her depression got worse.

156,"I have autism and bipolar. The current world is starting to affect my mental health very seriously, especially because my autism makes me unable to understand much of it and my bipolar has me constantly switching sides every time I come across new information, so my therapist says to avoid politics, avoid both sides and avoid news. I think this is wrong and she’s encouraging me to abuse my privilege (I am white). It feels like, if I avoided politics because of my mental health, I would be blatantly rubbing my privileged ass in the face of all the mentally ill people who are less privileged and cannot afford to avoid politics. Life does not care if you are too disabled to understand it, people affected by it can’t stop following it just because they have a disability, when their LIFE OR DEATH is reliant on it. I DO NOT WANT to abuse my privilege.

My therapist says “your mental health comes first, is more important than what is going on outside of you” but that is FALSE and downright offensive.

I communicated with a person (had actual conversations instead of just hi and bye) besides my dad was almost a year ago at my job . The longest I’ve stayed at a job was 2 weeks . The job was easy , my anxiety just took over me and made it hell for me and I quit with no notice , everyone was nice to me  . I run and hide from my dads visitors . Lock door so I have time to run to my room and hide . Peek through curtains to see if people are outside my house . Duck under the door window so no one can see me pass by .  I’m on meds and see a psychiatrist.  I take klonopin 3 times a day as needed (which I don’t ) I take Wellbutrin for depression, and latuda for psychotic symptoms. I get anxiety just by going outside so I started exposure therapy last week . The first week I did every thing. Went into stores , bought things , went to mall, ordered food , went out to eat. I showed myself I can leave . Now I’m starting to think I’m making excuses . Because I showed myself I can leave . I interacted with the store employees . So it’s like ? Wtf am I just being lazy ? Not trying to get a job ? The klonopin stops my panic attacks . I still feel anxiety but it’s no where near as bad like if I didn’t have it at all. I got 4 jobs last year and I just quit and I felt like a complete failure everytime. 21 , no college or job like wtf is wrong with me.  I was going to contact a staffing agency and see what work they could get for me. Phone calls give me panic attacks lmao . I can’t fucking win at all. My life is nothing but fear . Always in fight or flight .  It feels like I’m “waiting “ for the right moment . THERE is never going to be the right moment to do the things I NEED to do it now. I just keep waiting and waiting . Some people don’t even have a car to try and expose their selfs to these things . My dad got me a fucking truck ! To leave and do whatever I want . Anxiety tells me not to leave , I force myself and then see that the anxiety makes shit up and the things that could happen more than likely will not happen . Sorry I’m crazy and just wanted to vent I have no one to talk to but one day if I get somewhat better I can look back at this and see. I feel like I’m in a dream nothing looks real to me . Severe confusion and brain fog . As soon as my anxiety spikes my head starts spinning and I get dizzy . It’s like I’m on a boat and it’s in water rocking back and forth for hours. I can’t think clearly . Memory loss. I don’t know why I just won’t do anything to better my life even the slightest even though my meds are helping a lot (I wasn’t leaving my house at all or my bed at that) .    It feels like all of my avoidance has made this life that I’m living my new reality and I’ve done these things for many years and I can’t see how all these behaviors can be undone without years and years of correcting it.

160,"My cat died a few years back and I’m still not over his death. He was first person/animal that I experienced death of and I’m extremely anxious and depressed since then. Before that, it was as if death didn’t exist, it was too much of an abstract concept. But now I’m scared of death every day and I guess I’m experiencing panic attacks, where I’m just locked in this extreme fear and I can’t breathe or move and in my head there are horror images being projected on my mind. 

When my cat died, no one expected it. One day he was doing fine and the other his kidneys just failed all of sudden, he couldn’t move, drink or eat and it felt as if he barely recognized us. We had him for nearly 20 years and he was my best friend and I always talked about him as of my brother. I never expected him to die, I mean I knew he would die one day, but I hoped that day would never come. That year when he died, I was going around the country a lot, making trips and traveling. And every time I left home that summer I thought to myself “my cat is doing fine although he is old, so I will travel now and then we will spend Christmas together”. But the next Christmas with him never came because he died basically a month after this thought popped up in my head. To this day I feel so extremely guilty for every time I left him at home and went away. His death was so traumatizing for me, for the whole weekend I held him by my chest, kept him warm and wiped his mouth from bloody saliva. I felt how he slowly stopped moving, blinking, swallowing water and how he was slowly getting colder and colder although he was still alive. And then suddenly he wasn’t.

I often have dreams about him where I have to dig his grave with my own bare hands, place him there and then I see his ghost walking around. And recently I started dreaming about same image but this time it involves my parents too. I see them die and then I have to carry their cold lifeless bodies to place where I dig their graves and burry them there.

Today I had to leave home for school and my father mentioned that I wasn’t home much lately and mentally it sent me into the panicking space again and I started thinking that what if this is the same scenario as with the cat? What if my parents will get sick when I go away from home and then I come home and they will be dying and I will have to burry them and then I will be all alone and miserable because I care about them so much and I don’t want them to die like my cat did and if they die it will be my fault because I left them at home. 

And then I had a panic attack again and I feel so hopeless, I don’t have someone who I could talk with about it. Usually people just tell me to forget about it anyway, but it is so hard to forget it and to just leave the thought to be if it hunts me so much every day even when I sleep and the thought of my cat, of my family and my loved ones sends me into a debilitating panic attack. I don’t know what to do anymore. 

Thank you if you read this this far. Sorry if there are any typos, I don’t want to read over it again because it makes me even more depressed when I thought that it’s not even possible to be in even darker mental place than I already am.",10Aug2020,1

However, it certainly isn't helping.

I've been working from home for 5 months now. I was told we would go back by the end of August. This has now been extended to the end of October at the earliest.
I was fairly new to the job, just 2 months away from the end of my 6 month probation, when I got sent to work from home.
At first it was fine until it wasn't.

So I've been struggling. A lot. I've forced myself to at least get out of pyjamas, but sometimes that doesn't happen until lunchtime when I get off the phones ( I work in a call centre.) 

It was really effecting my productivity, I was taking less calls and more time in between, I was going over on breaks and lunches and I got pulled in for it a lot. I also let customers affect me way too much, frequently crying after challenging customers and actually crying on one of the calls (not my best moment.)

Half the calls aren't even upsetting, just frustrating.

About 3 weeks ago I decided to come clean and explain to my manager what was going on and I've never regretted something so much in my life.

Immediately I was asked to sign a form to allow my employers to contact my doctor to see ""if there was anything they could do to help"" (which I think they just don't believe me), and I was referred to our Employee Assistance Line. I've spoken to the councellor I was assigned once and she was lovely and helpful, but the way I'm being treated by work? Not so much.

Basically, the day after I told my manager about my mental health via email, she called me first thing in the morning to ""have a chat"" this is when she gave me the forms and asked me to contact this line. I did, answered personal questions (thankfully confidentially) and cried A LOT. Straight after, I emailed my manager and she called me again.

NOT to see how I was doing, but instead to pull me up about a call I had failed. Bear in mind, I'm not long out of probation, I'm still learning, yet she starts going on (again) about how this will affect my end of year review and just generally putting mega fear and anxiety in me.

Long story short, I've improved my productivity quite a bit, and started to feel better, it's good having people off my back. The only issue was my breaks and lunches, which I received an email about today. I had gone over again recently (never for more than 5 minutes) and the tone of her email made me have another anxiety attack. Words of how its unaccceptable, I need to tell her whats going on (she does! she just doesnt believe me!) and how she'll have ""words"" with me on Wednesday. 

I've just finished my shift and I'm off tomorrow, but theres no way I can relax now. I'm currently crying into my phone (so excuse any format issues) and panicking already about Wedesday. I like my job, despite it being taxing lately with the loneliness of working from home, but I'm really really struggling with feeling like a burden.

Oh, and the cherry on top is I emailed my manager this morning to ask if I could get time off for my next counselling session on Thursday and she ignored that email, but had enough time to send me an email about my breaks and lunches? 

Idk, I'm upset and scared. I just needed to vent. Terrified for Wednesday as I don't have an excuse for being late other than forgetting (even though I set alarms) and being too nervous to go back into ""ready"" once I get to my desk.",10Aug2020,1
162,"In a single week, I’ve texted a crisis hotline three times. Each time I feel like it doesn’t help and nothing changes after the conversation ends. I’m scared that me reaching out so much means something dire but I don’t know what to do.

I’ve been hospitalized before like, 8 times and each time they’ve let me go within a week except for the last time. I was there for two weeks and they discharged me while I was on a one to one. Clearly I wasn’t ready. What does it mean if I’ve contacted a crisis line so much?? What do I do about myself if the lines don’t work?",10Aug2020,1

164,Growing up every time I had a panic attack it turned into both my parents and sometimes siblings hanged up around me screaming at me for “faking it” or “being weak” or “too sensitive” I’m really paranoid that no one believes that my anxiety is real. Every time I start to have a panic attack it turns into a crazy loop of being afraid everyone is mad at me and questioning my own feelings. It’s happening right now and everyone I can usually go to is unavailable and I just feel alone and like I’m a burden.,10Aug2020,1
165,All my parents do anymore is put me down. Nothing is ever good enough for them. I could literally discover the cure for cancer and they would have expected me to also cure the corona virus at the same time. I feel not good enough constantly and I can’t deal with it anymore. I legit live at home and have thought about trying to commit suicide just to get away from them for a few days in the hospital. I can’t do it anymore.,10Aug2020,1

168,"It begins with the number of thoughts I have surpassing the amount of time it takes to process a single thought. My estimate is that when things break down, I'm running at three to five thought seconds for every actual second of time. They overlap and are separate, though they merge into the same generalized negativity. They all carry the same psychological mass and momentum, though vary in velocity, with some seeming to move very quickly, and others lingering. I estimate the shortest is a malformed thought, which lasts a fraction of a second. The longest perhaps five seconds. While these thoughts are not connected, many form themes and patterns over time. Further, they will usually loop back around and grab onto the tail of a similar, yet new thought, causing a very loud series of feedback loops.

They range from very well-formed negative themes to static intangible noise.

The cycle goes in about 20 minute loops, reaching a crescendo, at which point I suddenly become acutely aware I've become mentally incapacitated, and have stopped breathing properly - For how long I don't know exactly. I use this break in volume to breathe and physical manifestations of the episode begin. I become very aware of my body and its placement, and it tingles all over as oxygen starts getting around again. I'm very aware of the injuries and chronic pains I live with constantly, which I usually (but not begrudgingly, I'm reasonably stoic) block out.

I go through a sensory reset. I start to see again, but it's laced with mild hallucinations, and I can hear the world around me, although again, there's a lack of normalcy - usually a weird constant high-pitched  tone I can hear. Real noises rattle me, and can be jarring. At this point, I have to avoid any unsettling or disturbing imagery, as they will form part of the next wave of the spiral. It's kind of like they stick  in my brain and get incorporated into the nonsensical negative loop, so the less disturbing that wave can be, the better. An example of this was a flash of footage of a hand, covered in mosquitoes, on the news. That came through over and over during the next cycle, at varying velocities, sometimes overlapping itself.

During an episode, I occasionally get a break for up to 20 minutes. An episode usually lasts about three days, but can be as short as half a day and as long as two weeks.

I cannot go to work, or do anything creative or constructive. It just isn't possible to function. It feels safest to turn off my brain and weather the storm. Going to sleep and waking up is my best chance at a hard reset that stops the spiral. The longer it goes on, the moire likely it is to become further protracted so it's best to try and kill it quickly. I'm currently 36 hours in at the deep end of a an episode that started about 72 hours ago.

I used to drink heavily to deal with this. I'll be four years sober next month. I feel SSRI's are a danger to both my life, and long-term mental health. I've found that a benzodiazepine offers my best chance at breaking the cycle long enough for it to lose its momentum, and dissipate. 

I'm currently waiting for 2mg of alprazolam (last resort) to kick in, and I'm going to go to bed for the first part of the day. I hope for a reset upon waking up.",10Aug2020,1
169,"So about four years ago I got diagnosed with Severe Chronic Depressive disorder, Generalized Anxiety, and a severe Panic disorder. About a year ago I stopped seeing a psychiatrist because my old one quit and my first two visits with my new one ended freaked me out because she immediately wanted to perscribe me Lithium and told me she didn't read any of my file. I since moved back in with my parents after finishing college and it's been about eight months since seeing a therapist. The main problem was that I don't have health insurance and we're worried that if I expose my parents to Covid they won't make it. It's been fine, but for the past three or four months  my depression and anxiety have been getting worse. For the past month, I think I have been having auditory hallucinations but I am not seeing anyone so I really don't know. My dad is having a hard time with his bipolar disorder so I feel like if I tell them then it'll take away from my dad.

I've been looking into mental health facilities near me to go to and maybe get my meds straightened out. But my mom has spinal problems so I am the one taking care of all the day to day chores at home. And like I said, I don't have a job or health insurance and we're short on money so we don't have the gas money if I wanted to go anywhere anyway and I'd have to be using my mom's money to pay for it. So I really don't know what to do or if I should even tell my parents. And I'm terrified if I do go and it is really severe and I get prescribed Lithium or something.",10Aug2020,1
170,"Throughout my day my mood seems to swing pretty wildly. I go from feeling amazing about myself and my life to feeling utterly deject if anything mildly bad happens to me. I tend to feel very secure and confident one moment and then suddenly I'll become extremely nervous over the slightest of interactions. I also tend to feel very ""out of myself"" and ""numb"" a lot of the time. Some of these shifts just seem to happen for no reason at all, but it gets very exhausting.

I don't think what I'm going through is normal and I want my mood to become stable, i.e. I want to react to things happening to me like people normally would. What could potentially cause this and how do I get rid of it?",10Aug2020,1

Basically last week I came in mid-panic attack I think and she was able to talk me down incredibly well. During and towards the end of the session she asked me if she wanted to make a call. She also brought up abuse, specifically emotional abuse and how it's harder to identify and prove emotional abuse. I'm not sure what she meant by that, and I wasn't ready to ask. Honestly, I can barely remember what she was saying in the moment because I was so stressed out and anxious and my brain has been working to forget it all. Did she mean someone would take me somewhere? Where would I go? Would it be temporary?",10Aug2020,1

My mental health is down the drain since yesterday because i went with my bestfriebd to a boys house ( 4 boys, me and her). He was my crush since last year but he ghosted me for one year ( we dont go to the same school so we didn’t even see eachother) anyway, he FORCED me into giving him 2 rounds on bjs YES TWO. I feel so miserable i am 15 years old and i hate my life i would have never given him a bj . So after it was done he didn’t talk to me, he said that we ( me and my bestie) could leave now. So we did and he didn’t even text me and he told me to not say anything to anyone and that i should be happy that i was able to do that to him 🙄
So now he totally doesn’t care about me he couldn’t care less, he got what he wanted. (They are muslims) he and his friends now say i am worthless.

177,"I come from a family where ""mental health"" does not exist. More specifically, mental health issues do not exist. Anxiety? Well I mean you're nervous, sure, but there's nothing wrong with you, stop being a baby. Depression? You got sad a few times, stop trying to get attention. ADHD? What' you just want adderall, is that it?? Etc.

When the doctor asks me if my family has a history of mental illness, I'll pretty much have to say probably, but no one knows for sure. So I'm on my own with this one, because I definitely see signs everywhere, but because it's never been diagnosed, tha5t doesn't really help me. I'm trying to keep trakc of symptoms I've been seeing; mainly for ADHD, bipolar depression, and anxiety. I'm like 99% sure I've got it bad, but I want to approach this realistically and make sure I'm covering all the bases.

To clarify, I'm actually trying to write off anything that could be seen as a symptom that may have other causes; i.e. I do have days where I'm very irritable, but how many of those days are because of some reasonable factor? I have been struggling with focusing on work, and after months and months of actively and presently trying to take extensive measures to help me focus, I still notice severe issues, so okay, we can put that down on the list.

I suppose I'm just asking for your experience and if there's anything in my life I should be paying particular attention to. I looked up some symptoms and ruled out the ones that don't really resonate with me, but I'd like to be as informative as possible when seeing the doctor, because this is likely the very first time someone from my bloodline will be doing this and I want to make sure I'm getting it right and not missing anything that could be a factor. All I know is I've felt fucked up for a very long time and I have now, at 25, discerned between normal levels of happiness, sadness, anxiety, inattentiveness, etc. and decided something needs to be done for sure. Also this is in the US.


TLDR: No one in my family has ever gone to the doctor for mental health issues and I want to know if there is anything I should be looking into so I can give the doctor the most complete description of what's been going wrong.",10Aug2020,1

College student and first time mom here. I have never been to counseling or therapy before but the last few months have been a lot for me and for many. I think I need talk to someone. I've tried to go through my insurance but the therapist are an hour plus away from me or the clinic has horrible reviews which isn't comforting when you are looking for help.  

Are online counseling services affordable and are they quality services? I mentioned that I am a college student and a mom to give some idea of my financial situation. 

Can you guys recommend some counseling services out there for: Anxiety, sadness, irritability, panic attacks, loss of motivation, anger....

My adoptive parents were both therapist and now I'm totally traumatised and can't see another one. I am a trans boy who feels like he can't be anything else than a girl. I lost my dad, my son, and my friends (from my coming out). I don't feel like I have any strength left to continue..

182,"There's uncertainty in the title because I don't know what I am going through and I am fucking tired of it. I had a pretty normal childhood with my parents at each other's throats all the time. My dad was pretty much absent, my mom was abusive but in a very 'I mean well' kind of way and she really did. I don't exactly started to realize it but ever since I was a teenager, I have not felt okay. I have had a hard time keeping friends. I don't trust anyone. I think people are laughing behind my back, that people  are friends with me out of pity/ because they want something from me. I have believed I am unlikable for so long that it seemed normal until recently when I stepped back and saw what I was doing to myself. 

I feel so disconnected from myself. Most of the times, I am not even present. I feel like I can't catch a hold of myself. I don't know who I am  and every time I get close to understanding my personality, it just slips between my fingers. 

And I am fine some days. I am so happy. I am content. I am not thinking about anything and being me comes naturally. But then there are the bad days, when I feel like I have forgotten how to walk, how to talk like myself. I feel like I have forgotten how to be me, what my personality is. This happens the most when I am by myself for more than a day. Then it gets me. I lose all will to do anything. I stop cleaning (otherwise, I am a cleanliness freak), eating, working, and generally just getting out of bed. 

On good days, when I look back at the bad days, I tell myself I was being dramatic but when I am actually going through it, I know it's real. I am going through it right now and it is very very real. 

I have talked to a therapist for about a year. But I could not even open up to her. I could not tell her what all was going on in my mind and ended up not seeing her anymore after she told me I was not trying hard enough to ""snap out of it"".

184,"Quarantine hit me big time as I realized that I have depression. I may appear alright on the outside but inside, I feel so much weight from clashes of negative feelings and thoughts inside of me. Symptoms of social anxiety, low self-esteem, loss of self-worth, insecurities, inauthenticity, and fear of being judged by other people make me say so. Just writing this makes me conscious and let me feel anxious due to the fear of making mistakes. Social anxiety frequently arises whenever I converse with other people online or even offline. I just feel like I always need to please people and because of this pressure as well as overthinking, I decided not to communicate for a year with all my friends back in HS or even some of my loved ones. I lost touch with them and it makes me feel guilty, ashamed, and feel like they should have never met me in the first place. It makes me sad that maybe I may have affected them as well because of not being there for them.


 
Playing games and entertaining myself made me able to brush off these thoughts and feelings during my first year of college and somehow I survived. However, all the symptoms were there so I was not able to develop deep relationships with anyone because of this thinking. I felt out of place because even though I was accepted by my dream school, I felt like I was not enough. I always remained in my solo dorm playing games and not conversing with anyone unless when I'm in class. I just converse in a close-ended manner and it made me sound arrogant but I just always felt so much anxiety. I did not even hang out with my college peers even once during my free time. This made me feel like they did not like me for it even though I do not comment on any bad things to them. This results in a peer of mine being depressed and ended up leaving the university which I feel like partly my fault cause I was not there for him during the first year. Other than that, I was not able to maintain any relationships with anyone since childhood due to this mentality which rose during my first year in college. Overall, I was this introverted uptight, and passive person who wanna escape from social situations and just be by myself. And I'm very much guilty of not being a good friend to anyone even since HS and makes me not want to attain any more relationships with anyone cause I might harm them as well.  


 
This also affected my academic performance which I was ashamed of because I was a consistent honor student back in HS. I was a passive learner even before but I always somehow manage to cram all my academic stuff. However, given I'm all alone, I was not able to discipline myself to study my lessons during college. I only study the midnight or morning before the exams which I know is a messed up habits. During laboratory meetings, I was always so unsure cause I don't know what to do and my hands are just so shaky due to tremors which make me feel so inferior to my labmates. Most of the time I feel like all of the people are around me watching all of my movements and this makes me not execute my tasks efficiently. I thankfully did not fail any subjects but I felt out of place and so low.


 
I never said any of these things to my parents nor any of my family members. My parents do not know anything nor believe in mental health. They were poor back then but got through it and now living a comfortable life.  This makes me feel like what I'm experiencing is nothing compared to what they've gone through. During my admission to college, my parents scolded me due to why I was given a psychological clearance to enter due to mental health reasons. They say that I was stupid about giving myself a low score in a mental health test but that was just what I felt and I didn't expect a psychological clearance. I cried that day for the first time in years. On my psychiatric appointment, I didn't want to disappoint my parents anymore so I did not fully tell her everything I feel and I messed up the chance to fix my mental health problem. But in the end, my parents were proud that I was able to pass so I felt happy for a short time. I didn't attend any further consultations even though I feel like shit. In terms of academics, they never really directly pressure me that much but they hate failure. And it lowered my self-esteem whenever they tell me that I'm an idiot or a failure whenever I make mistakes, too nervous to do something, or do not know what to do. They say all I know is academics and I don't know anything about life. Well, I guess they are somewhat true cause I do not know how to cook, wash clothes, drive, etc. (All I know is washing the dishes and they still say I'm not good). In school, my teachers say I'm a good student but at home, I feel like I don't know anything at all. It somehow invalidates all the good grades I've gotten since grade school and I think it is showing during my college year.
 


In terms of my sexuality, I'm still confused about what spectrum I am part of. My family is catholic and homophobic so I guess since childhood, I am always reserved cause I don't wanna be called gay or anything. But this constant hiding and suppression made me feel like that maybe I am. And this made me feel homophobic as well cause I'm scared to be gay, not only because of religion but because my family would not treat me right. And maybe because of my family's culture, I tended to look down on people who are gay which I know I should not do. As of now, there were many women who I felt could have been my girlfriend but due to bad mental health as well as confusing stage, I did not forego with it and maybe treated them badly. I just don't want to hurt them. On the other hand, I tend to be attracted to some men which are due to their masculinity or qualities I lack... I feel like I am missing on in life cause everyone seems like having a good
time finding their mate while here I am not knowing what to do with my life.


 
I am being pushed right now to become a doctor and on a pre-med track so I don't have a choice. And I kinda feel that this is the right path for me cause I wanna help people but the thing is I don't want my mental health to be the reason for a person to die. I wanna figure myself out and not able to interact with anyone is not helping. I'm just so scared to reach out to people offline or online due to this mental health. The feeling of guilt as well as social anxiety makes me so limited as a person. I don't know what to say and due to overthinking I always feel like what I say may be judged differently to what I intended to say. Should I apologize to them? Should I just casually say Hi and just go with it as nothing happened? I feel like they are angry with me or already have forgotten me and maybe don't want me in their life anymore because of how I treated our relationship. And maybe I would go back to this mindset again and ended up ghosting them like before. I just feel like it's okay that I will be the only one to be hurt than risk hurting anyone by how I treat them. I wanted to change but I'm just losing hope right now.


 
I'm just masking it off with a smile and laugh as well as playing games or watching movies but deep inside me, I'm hurting to how my relationships came to be. I don’t know why I'm writing this but I just want to let this all out. Maybe I'm just making excuses or playing victim on how I'm a horrible person. And sometimes I feel like I am. I just lost my voice to speak out or know what I really feel but at least I can write what I think I'm feeling now here.

186,"Please don't make fun of me, i know how dumb this sounds!!!! and sorry for my english!

I hate myself. I just can't stop overthinking. My mind finds a reason to overthink, like i did something in the past, or just what can happen in the future, like dumb reasons, but my mind thinks it's the most important thing in the world, and thinks about it 24/7, for example I did something 3 years ago, and even though i give my mind reasons not to worry, it still thinks otherwise, me: ''you don't have to overthink, here some reasons why that wasn't a bad thing'' my mind ''oh yes, i get it, no more worrying'' and two minutes later i am worrying again. I can't do normal activities, i can't be with my friends and family, all i want to do is sleep, because then i am not worrying. It doesn't stop until my mind finds another reason to worry, and i stop overthinking about that last thing, my mind finally takes those reasons why i shouldn't worry and my mind be like ''ooooh, okay, i'm so dumb, why i did i even worry that?'' and then that new thing becomes the most important thought and it repeats.

I wish i could stop those thoughts. Ok, i know it's dumb, 3 years ago i broke up with my ldr boyfriend, actually we weren't that serious back then, and almost dated another guy, and i almost kissed him. We weren't on a break, we broke up, and i didn't think we're going to get back together. And maybe after two or three weeks me and my bf got back together. And after 3 years my mind decided that i have to overthink it?? Like I am like why did i even like that guy why i did that? And i can tell myself: ''dude, you were single, you broke up with your boyfiend, AND WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT YOU DIDN'T LEAVE HIM BECAUSE OF THAT GUY'' but still my mind takes is as a cheating and makes me even regret it, like dude whyy?

I know it's dumb, and i wish i could stop

and i guarantee, that when i find something else to worry about i'm gonna forget what happened 3 years ago and my mind is gonna be like: ''oh yeah, why did i even worry about that? i wasn't with my boyfriend'' but  now i am overthinking it.

Or for example i thought what if my boyfriends family hate me? what if? and again i am thinking about that 24/7 how they might hate me. I don't worry about that anymore, but 2 months ago it was my most important thought of the day. And even i be like charging my phone, i want to take it, and i look at 98% and i be like noooo, i can't take it, i have to charge til 100% because if i don't do that my boyfriends parents are not going to like me, i has to reach 100 and then they will like me 100. I knoooow it's so stupid! i know that know lol, but 2 months ago i did that.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok i got everything off my chest and maybe you have some tips how do i stop my dumb overthinking? Because I am so tired, i wish i could sleep 24/7 and i wish i could just be happy, and i want that, but my mind just won't shut up! I just want to be happy and just enjoy my life!

ok, so don't judge me, i know how dumb all that sounds.",10Aug2020,1

191,"Warning- Abuse mentioned

I feel like I'm going to fall apart. 

My daughter is a year and three months. When I got pregnant with her, I was in a very abusive relationship. I had just been kicked out of my grandmothers house and he took me in. He worked offshore fir two weeks at a time, in which, I was not allowed to leave. I rationed out my food for two weeks at a time in a rotting one bedroom trailer. All I had was my phone to keep me occupied. When he was there, I was sexually abused and physically abused. I couldn't even move in the air mattress we shared because he would wake up and either choke me or try and force himself on me.

The week my daughter was conceived was by far the worst of it. I don't know the specific day because he had to have sex 6+ times a day. I was in so much physical pain that I could barely move. He wanted to have sex and we started but I just hurt too much. I told him out safe word, started crying, screaming our safe word to stop. I put my hands on his chest and pushed him back while crying. He force my hands away and told me, ""Shut the fuck up. You belong to me, therefore, I can do what I want."" I just cried and drifted off while he did what he wanted. I was physically, mentally and sexually abused growing up, so, I already had Dissociative PTSD when I met him which he made worse. I left him and went homeless only to find out I was pregnant.

Now, its the week of her conception and I can't even look at people. I keep snapping at my current, and amazing boyfriend. I feel bad about it. But I'm barely functional and I just don't want to talk about it with others. I just don't know what to do.",10Aug2020,1
192,"I've been off sick for 4 months due to depression and anxiety. Today I went back in and it was ok. Well I say 'back in' but really I mean online writing from home. Won't be physically in the office for ages yet. 

Everyone was glad I'm back, my boss was really helpful and made sure I knew everyone was fine about it and weren't gonna make me tell them why I was off. I got several nice messages. It was also just good to have a chat with someone who isn't family after so long. 

But it was also really anxiety inducing. I'm still worried about exactly what I'm going to be doing now, there's been a lot of change whilst I was away. I feel really out the loop on everything. I had over 3000 unread emails. I think most are unimportant but I need to still go through them.

195,"Hi everyone. 
I don’t know of any other relevant subreddits, so thought I’d post here. 

A few days ago I got a message from someone on here, and we were chatting for a bit, had quite a bit in common, don’t live too far from each other, etc. We moved over to a different messaging site, exchanged a couple of pictures, voice messages, whatever, usual stuff. 

Anyway, she had things to do, so obviously we halted the conversation for what I thought would be a few hours. 2 days later I’ve got no messages at all, and the couple of messages I have sent haven’t been read or anything. 

Now this in itself isn’t a problem. What is a problem however, is why I feel so empty and depressed, almost feeling as if I’ve broken up with someone who I’d only been speaking with for a couple of days. It’s ridiculous. 

For further information, I have no friends, as I do struggle quite I bit, although I am relatively happy on my own. I do suffer from a couple of mental health problems (possibly aspergers among others). 

Honestly any help at all would be so appreciated. I know it’s stupid to feel as bad as I do for such a silly thing. 
Thank you!",10Aug2020,1
196,"I’ve struggled with a myriad of disturbing symptoms with thoughts, feelings and even some physiological signs for a very long time (15 yrs). I feel like I’ve always gone in, afraid of a poor outcome, saying what I *think* I’m supposed to say. 

Truthfully, I don’t want the first 5 words out of my mouth during a 2 hour session to be the determining factor of what this psychoanalyst says, putting me back at square 1. It’s happened to many of us before, and personally it’s happened to me plenty. 

For all of this time, I’ve gotten a ton of “determinations” and I’ve been on 35 medications with little to no alleviation of symptoms. With age, behavior control isn’t the issue. I wrote them all down. With negative side effects listed. 

It’s the disruptive thoughts and feelings getting in the way of actual progress in many, many areas.

197,"-I live in NC, USA.

-My problem started towards the end of my last romantic relationship a few years ago. I had dated my exbf for 6 years only to break up when i was quickly approaching the age of being unable to get pregnant. 

-I resent him because i feel he robbed me of the chance of meeting someone who actually wants marriage and children with me. I was his first and only gf, his inability to communicate and express his feelings made him wishy washy, hot and cold all the time and it hurt my self esteem.

-I was depressed and couldnt face my friends because i felt so awful. Im also naturally introverted so i didnt exactly have many deep real friendships to begin with anyway. I have no close relationships or support.

- i left the country to work on my career and build my self esteem and enjoy life. I did that. I had fun, i felt good about myself and i belonged to a social group. I adopted healthy habbits. I had planned on staying away for 2 years to gain work experience.

-my plan was suddenly cut 6 months short when i found out my dad has stage 4 esophageal cancer in the middle of this covid19 pandemic. He lives alone, has no other kids, and his family lives far away. He lives in the same city as my exbf.

-i flew back to the USA and needed help. My exbf is the only other person i know so he checked on my dad, picked me up from the airport and just helped me and my dad alot.

-My exbf has not changed and is still the same toxic person. He plays with my feelings and he is trying to find himself and is having an identity crisis.

-i have no health insurrance so i can only go to the free commnity clinics. The therapist and psychiatrist there only let me talk for 30min and then i have to come back in a month. This does nothing for me. I have no friends or support.

-i want my dad and I to move across the country to be with his family so that i can have more support. But his chemotherapy treatments have been making him feel comfortable that he is working from home and he thinks he can beat the cancer. 

-he has no idea how much distress i am in. I cant be social and make friends because of covid19. I cant work a full time job because my dad needs me. He thinks it will be just a few more months and he will be in remission so he wants me to wait a little longer before looking for a job. Im scared of starting a full time job too and then my dad needs me and i will end up having to leave the job or the job firing me for having to leave to care for my dad or attend his funeral.

-i cant figure out how to cope. I feel like my only option is to be alone and go crazy or call my exbf to go for a walk with me or play videogames or do other fun activities to take my mind off things.

 -i have been spending time with him and i resent him. He still hurts my self esteem but he is always excited to spend time with me. He thinks he is helping me. I know he wants to help me and make things right with me.

-Sometimes I talk to his family. His parents and sister. They are awesome people. They check on me and my dad. But i try to keep my distance from them because of their connection to my exbf. They add to my distress.

-my half sister lives far away. Sometimes i talk to her but she is much younger than me and immature/dumb. We cant visit eachother now anyway because of covid19.

-i wish i had other friends. I wish i had support. I wish i could go out and meet people. Im going crazy. At times i want to die but i dont want my dad to see me depressed. He is hopeful and comfortable. I dont want to scare him or make him loose his hope.",10Aug2020,1

199,"Ok I didn’t know completely what to title this , but it’s just the beginning of what I mean or meant? 

So we all feel things, and you can compare situations to others like they haven’t had it as hard as me , but they’ve definitely organized a chart showing how behavior can traumatize and what it makes you like 

But it doesn’t matter to the other person if you feel you’ve had it harder, because they’ll still feel the most extreme anxiety they have ever felt and sadness and it’ll just be a feeling that gets passed around but you own it

200,"I guess I'm writing this because I'm kinda drunk, but boy does it get a bad side out in me. 

I'm honestly very isolated, with almost no friends, no current or former romantic partners and only a job working with colleagues I don't really feel any connection to. I used to be somewhat more involved in social circles in school and college, but I always noticed that whenever I was in a group and the conversation turned away from me if it had involved me before, I would become absolutely deject inside. I felt utterly isolated and horrible. Any instance of instead getting attention felt like a drug to me, but at the same time I was convinced that I was just being shallow and I was way too meek to try and get more. Those few instances of getting genuine attention are gone now though at this point in my life.

I don't feel like it's a narcissistic thing either, because I genuinely do care about other people's feelings and emotions and I want them to receive all the attention they crave too. I don't feel ""shallow"", as much as desperate. It's just at the same time I feel extremely lonely, but it's the sort of loneliness that can be alleviated by somebody just talking to me. I crave an attention that is constant and unending. As soon as somebody stops paying attention to me, even for a moment, I become extremely miserable. It's not healthy at all and I can't really function in normal relationships anymore because of that, but that's what it is and I hate it.

I keep telling myself I should just be able to find joy in myself and my own pursuits, but that's not actually the case. I feel miserable and I don't feel able to build a normal relationship with my environment at this point. I don't feel I can enter into new friendships because I know they won't satisfy this extreme but hidden neediness. If they so much as hint at not being 100% approving of a trait of mine, it would just destroy me too.

Basically, how do I feel more ""stable"" and appreciative of myself?",10Aug2020,1

202,"First i wanna give you some details about me then I'll get to the point. 
I thought i was tough, got into martial arts, even became national champion once so i was pretty convinced that i was a tough masculine guy. At the time i wasn't interested in reading stuff on Internet and I'm 19 now and haven't had any romantic partners, even my father once thought i was gay cuz i wouldn't bring girls home lol. After quarantine i don't feel like going out of my room unless it's necessary but yeah i would like to have a big group of friends and go out but i think i don't have skills to do That, It feels like I'm all alone here like i never feel like i need help or asking for help, but my first inclination would be feeling like I'm stuck and can't use my mind when i find myself in challenging situations. I think i should get used to thinking on my feet. 

The only people i talk to face to face when I'm home are my mom and sister, am not good at small talks and they know that as well so when I started talking about something I've read on Internet like it's the coolest thing ever they'd just pretend listening to me and i wouldn't realise that at the moment but they know that them listening to me kinda makes me satisfied. Recently i was trying to explain how MBTI(its about brain functions and personality types) stuff works works but I couldn't pull it off and my mum said i don't understand laughing, and i laughed it off but i couldn't say anything more, my mood went down and I felt there's something wrong with me so i went to my room. I clearly know that she wasn't being rude or something and even if she did i don't care but I'm concerned about what happened to me there and i don't even know what to address it as. 

First time i felt this way was when I was in a fight in 8th grade, I got stunned while fighting, that's what made me get into martial arts i thought i was scared. Recently, i was in a party with friends and all of them were drinking and a friend was kinda starting a trouble (we're not that close but we know each other for like 4 years) so i grabbed his hand to get him to a room and he suddenly started saying _Yo, you have no rights to grab me, dude_and i was kinda stunned and got upset, didn't know what to do next (I'm not trying to brag, I'm 6'1 and 180 lbs, I'm confident that i can bear the hell out of him in a fight) my mood suddenly went down. I have so many incidents like this of me feeling that way suddenly in such situations i wouldn't know know how to respond, i think I'm highly sensitive. So i idk what it was or what to call it and i feared it the most and that made me lose so many stuff in life and almost made me lose all my teenage years. So i wanna fight this and don't know where to start, If you've read this far i wanna thank you for it.",10Aug2020,1

I am not a lazy person in any other aspect of my life. I was actually pretty successful in academia. But the idea of talking about myself and my own interests is overwhelming. I seem to block off thoughts related to it and I can’t seem to get the energy or motivation to create and fix up my resume. 

The thought of listening my accomplishments and reflecting on myself is something I seem to avoid so much. It’s such a simple task that I know I need to do, but I just can’t. I don’t know why. My mind completely shuts down when I try to look at my accomplishments on paper. A feeling of guilt, inadequacy, and incompetence comes up. But none of that is true about myself based on what everyone tells me. I struggled with imposter syndrome during my academic program and have seemed to lose interest in the field. I am good at what I do academically. But according to my friends and family I’m objectively a likable, responsible, and smart person.

211,"I've suffered from depression for most of my adult life, or at least I was treated for that. 

My parents have been very supportive throughout, even when I used to abuse drugs, when I was younger. I was recently diagnosed with carbon monoxide poisoning brain damage. I'm not sure if anyone here is familiar with that, but it can lead to depression, anxiety confusion, a lack of ability to concentrate, and a change in personality, all of which I have. It's led me to think that maybe I wasn't depressed in the past. I took the SSRIs, but I don't think they ever done anything for me. I came off then cold turkey when I moved overseas, and I didn't even notice I'd stopped taking them.

Now that I have verified brain damage (CT and MRI scans), my dad seems to have had enough of me. He told me my character has changed. I know that. I hate that about myself, but it's a symptom of the brain damage. He told me last week that he wasn't going to walk on eggshells around me, then last night he told me my brother was going to collect me to bring me to his house for my step mum's birthday. I was OK with that, I don't do very much otherwise. Then he told me I wasn't to ""hang around like a black cloud"". What sort of thing is that to say to someone who not only has depression, but has also recently been diagnosed with brain damage? It's irreversible, it'll never go away. I have to deal with that from now on, but I don't need my dad telling me that he doesn't want me to act in a certain way, or that he's not going to be sensitive to how I act now.

I've been put back on mirtazipene, and now I'm on lamotrigene too. It seems like now is the time I need support the most, and he's being very insensitive to me. Maybe it's because I abused his trust when I was younger, who knows. He also said some awful things about an experience I went through as a kid, he tried to normalise it. 

I think he might have mental health problems of his own, or he's going a bit senile. God knows what the problem is, but he's the one person I've relied on my whole life, and now he doesn't seem to want to even try to understand.",10Aug2020,1

I'd like to work on a few, but I'm so unmotivated and just plain tired all of the time that I can't be bothered.

In those 2 years I was also depressed and dealing with sick family members so it really wasn't working out. I told myself that my weight was OK because I was in no place to fix it and I genuinely lacked energy. However, summer rolled around and things began to change for me. I decided this was the time for me to take action and better myself. At first it was going well, until it became obsessive in some ways. I began fasting and doing workouts I frankly didn't like, as well as continuing with them even after having panic attacks in the middle of it. To top it off, I felt overhwhelmed by beautiful (according to traditional standards) people on social media and just people around me. It all really sucked, because I had finally started to wear clothes that I wanted to wear, and I was finally somewhat OK with what I looked like. However I'm back to square one mentally all the time because some days just make you feel ugly and fat, and like all the hard work done really was for nothing. I thought I could finally enjoy a day at the beach with some friends without these endless thoughts circling, but I guess not. I still feel as insecure and shit as before I lost weight.

-My problem started towards the end of my last romantic relationship a few years ago. I had dated my exbf for 6 years only to break up when i was quickly approaching the age of being unable to get pregnant.

-I resent him because i feel he robbed me of the chance of meeting someone who actually wants marriage and children with me. I was his first and only gf, his inability to communicate and express his feelings made him wishy washy, hot and cold all the time and it hurt my self esteem.

-I was depressed and couldnt face my friends because i felt so awful. Im also naturally introverted so i didnt exactly have many deep real friendships to begin with anyway. I have no close relationships or support.

-i left the country to work on my career and build my self esteem and enjoy life. I did that. I had fun, i felt good about myself and i belonged to a social group. I adopted healthy habbits. I had planned on staying away for 2 years to gain work experience.

-my plan was suddenly cut 6 months short when i found out my dad has stage 4 esophageal cancer in the middle of this covid19 pandemic. He lives alone, has no other kids, and his family lives far away. He lives in the same city as my exbf.

-i flew back to the USA and needed help. My exbf is the only other person i know so he checked on my dad, picked me up from the airport and just helped me and my dad alot.

-My exbf has not changed and is still the same toxic person. He plays with my feelings and he is trying to find himself and is having an identity crisis. He lies to my face still. I called him out on it and he will say. ""If you think im such a bad person then stop talking to me then."" He is seeing a therapist now about his issues. He says he is trying really hard to fix himself so he can be supportive and make things right with me. But i think the fact that i talk to him enables him from being a better person.

-i want my dad and I to move across the country to be with his family so that i can have more support. But his chemotherapy treatments have been making him feel comfortable that he is working from home and he thinks he can beat the cancer.

-he has no idea how much distress i am in. I cant be social and make friends because of covid19. I cant work a full time job because my dad needs me. He thinks it will be just a few more months and he will be in remission so he wants me to wait a little longer before looking for a job. Im scared of starting a full time job too and then my dad needs me and i will end up having to leave the job or the job firing me for having to leave to care for my dad or attend his funeral.

-i cant figure out how to cope. I feel like my only option is to be alone and go crazy or call my exbf to go for a walk with me or play videogames or do other fun activities to take my mind off things.

-i have been spending time with him and i resent him. He still hurts my self esteem but he is always excited to spend time with me. He thinks he is helping me. I know he wants to help me and make things right with me.

-Sometimes I talk to his family. His parents and sister. They are awesome people. They check on me and my dad. But i try to keep my distance from them because of their connection to my exbf. They add to my distress.

-my half sister lives far away. Sometimes i talk to her but she is much younger than me and immature/dumb. We cant visit eachother now anyway because of covid19.

-i wish i had other friends. I wish i had support. I wish i could go out and meet people. Im going crazy. At times i want to die but i dont want my dad to see me depressed. He is hopeful",10Aug2020,1

233,"My week roughly looks like this: I wake up early in the morning, go to work to do a job I'm decent at, but don't care too much about (accounting), then I come, cook, play keyboard, guitar, play vidya, read a book and go to bed. A little bit of each every day, unless I'm drunk, in which case everything goes out the window. On weekends, I do all the things I've mentioned + chores. I've had these mood swings all the time starting around early adulthood, I think, regardless of my situation. I feel being a lone can make the ""self-centredness"" worse though

My source of misery I couldn't properly identify. Every day my mood goes through extreme changes. For example, I might feel miserable waking up, but then randomly I will start to feel amazing. I might feel very confident in myself and feel like an amazing person one moment, but then a minor interaction that went badly will send me into a stage of self-hatred. My whole world view too depends on both how I feel in that particular moment and what others around me tell me to feel. It's never ""Oh, I feel good about myself overall, but just a bit down about myself"", but when I feel good *everything* feels amazing and when I feel down it's the opposite. Often I just randomly feel like I don't even exist and I just feel numbness.

I lack social contacts, but desperately crave attention. When I'm sober I tend to just put up with the feelings I've described and my craving for attention, but when I'm drunk I'll seek those things out unapologetically.

I just want ""it"" to end, but for no real reason. I only have vague reasons as to why to give. 

Any way to feel less miserable? Would a therapist be worth it?",10Aug2020,1

240,"Keep in mind this was a little over two and a half years ago, but I’m still struggling.
I went to my mother who I thought I could trust a couple years back after my mental health was on the decline once again. 
For some background I had gone to therapy for about 6 months at this point so she knew I was struggling. I hadn’t realized until later that she was getting impatient with me about it because “therapy shouldn’t be something you need your whole life. Stop treating it like a crutch if you don’t need it., you are only rehatching your trauma instead of moving on” Because she was only in therapy after a divorce from an abusive relationship for a couple months and was fine. But that’s besides the point. I was in such a bad place and wanted to rely on her so much I didn’t realize how toxic this was to my mindset. 
A bit later I went to her after an especially bad evening when I had self-harmed. Sobbing, I told her everything, and foolishly showed her my scars. She flipped out trying to tell me that she understood but this was not how to do things. She loved me, and I should’ve told her sooner. That I couldn’t do this.
She sat me down in front of herself and a housemate (a friend living with us) and HUMILIATED me. The friend had gone through depression when younger and tried to reassure me, but it was awful. Then she made me decide.
Either i was forced to call and talk to a suacide prevention hotline, or she was going to take me to a fucking hospital right then. I felt like a freak! It was so fucking awful. I hate her for it. 
I was so humiliated that I cried myself to sleep and didn’t talk to her for days, which she got upset at me for, calling me unreasonable. I was so confused and angry about it that I still self harmed but made sure to hide it even better, and suacide was out of the question then because what would she think of a daughter who was heartless enough to do that and leave everyone? It truly ruined me. Shortly after I quit my meds and therapy. At the time I felt like I couldn’t depend on anyone anymore. For the first time, I felt very truly empty and alone. Honestly, I really need to go back to therapy, but don’t know how to bring it up to her. I haven’t talked to her about anything big since. 
I want to share things with her so badly, things have been getting pretty bad again, but I’m afraid she will flip out like this again. I can’t even explain how alien and alone she made me feel back then, and she doesn’t even realize it. She thinks she did the right thing to help. It was a truly devastating experience. How do I get past this? I’m a minor still though not for long, but I can’t wait any longer, I need help. I can’t just get a therapist, schedule my own therapy appointments, pay for it etc on my own especially without her knowing. I’m so stuck and scared and stressed.

241,"I need help with my brother. He is my identical twin brother, we are 32 years old, and we live in separate states.

For years, we were both addicted to pills to cope with work and life in general. We would take adderal, xanax, methodone, and any pain pills we could get. I still struggle to this day with my addiction but I have stayed away for a few years now. With antidepressants and counseling, I was able to get out of that lifestyle and I am now happy and healthy.

My twin brother unfortunately has had trouble getting to where I’m at. He knows I am clean and is now embarrassed to tell me when he relapses. I found out yesterday that he was using again and I want to help him get the help he needs.

I basically would like him to do exactly what I did, which was get the correct medication and find a counselor but I can’t seem to get him to do it. I’ve given him contacts for counselors in his city and told him the medication and dosage that has worked for me but is so reluctant to seek help. He found a psychiatrist who gave him a prescription for an antidepressant which he takes but he says it doesn’t work. He’s been taking this drug for months now and won’t go back to the doctor to request a different medication. I have no idea why.....

He will call my parents and ask for help and will let them know when he relapses sometimes so I know he wants help, he just won’t receive it.

It's something I am struggling with heavily right now and I'm curious if there are people like me who've managed to get past that way of thinking?     


You meet someone, be it in a romantic or platonic situation, and they have no interest in seeing you again.    


The right thing to think is that not all people will like each other, it isn't possible to hit it off with everyone. I'm aware of this and I'm trying to train my brain to think like this... that being said I immediately start evaluating what I did/said during that interaction. I try to find the faults in myself that caused the person so not enjoy their time with me. I begin to feel like I am not good enough and spend the next while wondering how I can be better.

To put it simply, if people reject me I see it as I have little value as a person.

244,"TRIGGER WARNING

I have a suicide attempt which I never know if I should count it or not. I don't know if I truly wanted to end my life or I just wanted others to think I did so I might get the help I needed. If it's the latter it would technically be attention seeking and does that mean it's not a suicide attempt (also does that make me a bad person?). Although I climbed on top of the bridge because I got back down does that mean it counts less.

If that suicide attempt counts then that makes 3 suicide attempts. But then what about the other times I thought about attempting or put actions towards attempting? What about the time I wanted to cut myself so I would die but didn't have the strength to cut deeper. Does that count as a suicide attempt?

How close to dying do you have to be for it to count? How much action do you have to take? Is it that as soon as it turns from a thought to beginning actions it's an attempt?

This is probably a very stupid post so I'm sorry. It's like I've thought about it so much that I don't know when it starts becoming reality.",10Aug2020,1
245,"Does anyone else just really hate themselves, I feel so hypocritical because I’ve always told others to love themselves. I feel Ill in my own skin, I can’t look at myself without pointing out flaws, I feel so alone, I have zero to no friends, I struggle talk, I’ve tried so hard to break out of my shell but I just can’t spark a relationship, the closest person I have to me is my girlfriend who lives in another county, I visited her last year and I can say that was the first time I ever felt at peace since I was a child, I’m 20 now. 

My plans to see her got cancelled and I think that’s when it started going down hill, over lockdown my hair started to go, I already live with body dysmorphia, this really effected my self confidence, I feel shits just been stacking on top of eachother.

Today’s my little brothers birthday, we went out for a family meal and he brought his girlfriend and friends, I just felt so jealous, he has his looks, friend and his girlfriend, on my 18th I didn’t even have any friends to bring over.

I feel like the feeling of not wanting to get up from my bed is slowly getting more stubborn, I’ve been having suicidal thoughts but I just feel so guilty about it because after speaking to my parents about it my mum said she’d kill herself if I did it, I have a super supportive mum and girlfriend, why the fuck do I feel like this, why do I want to die if I have people like them.

I brush my teeth and wash my face in the dark because I can’t stand the sight of myself, it’s so demoralising. Everything just seems to be going downhill, my aspirations are fading, my motivation is gone.

This is not the first time I felt like this, I was bullied a lot as a kid for having an Irish name in a very Protestant school, I live in a very sectarian country, I also had a lazy eye (it’s called Duane syndrome), at the age of 12 I felt alone, ever since I’ve been telling myself it’ll get better, I’ll go to college and uni, I’ll make friends there, but I havnt really progressed, I feel outcasted, in turn nobody wanted me.

I started using weed to numb myself, at the time it really helped, I felt at peace, I’ve started to come off because I realise that’s not the answer, I took a break initially for my tolerance, but got high last night, I didn’t like it anymore because i felt fake, I realised I was doing this because I wanted to mask my pain.

How do I cope, I feel like a pussy, I feel like I get angry and upset so easily, I used to be the happiest kid ever, there wouldn’t be a day where I wasn’t smiling, my first year in high school the teachers would always say I would be the only one smiling in class to my parents during the parent teacher conference, this was before I started to get bullied obviously.

It bothers me. A lot. The guy I lost my virginity was manipulative and not at all a good person to be with. I can’t believe I didn’t see it at the time being 24. Old enough. He got me very drunk one night. Or stupidly I drank too much I guess... and yeah. I don’t wanna even think about it it makes me feel sick. I was 24 at the time and I was very strict on my virginity. Even walking down and aisle where there’s alcohol makes me nauseous. It was my biggest goal to wait for marriage as I grew up in a very red pilled ideology of a  household. I’m trying to break free from those ideologies as they’ve obviously harmed me. But I’d be lying if I said I don’t believe in them still. 

After that first ex and I broke up I felt so low and disgusting. A year later I started sleeping with a colleague ( I’d say a handful of times if that) The sex was obviously miles better than that dreadful first time. 

Fast forward to 26 and I meet my fiancé. I love him so much and everyday it pains me that he’s not my one and only. My first, my only and my last. Like I had always thought my life would pan out. Except i’ve slept with two others who didn’t have any actual love or respect for me. 
I have a great relationship now but there’s this black cloud over me. I feel sickened and embarassed that my fiancé knows ive been with other men I don’t know why. I guess because I’m sure he doesn’t like it.. who would? I can’t help but feel really bad as my goal in life was to be with only one man. Will I be loved differently, seen as less special? Just be honest. 
He’s never made me feel bad about it of course and has a past of his own but idk. It hurts. I worship the ground he walks on but I never feel good enough. I never feel like I’m special enough. I also recently read online that men feel closer and more attached to a virgin spouse and it hurt. I know I logically have more to give but there’s nothing special there to give. Anyone can give him kindness or love, or make him food etc. 

I feel like I’m drowning in pain each day and life is feeling less and less worth it.

Thing is our wedding is coming up in October and I still cry myself to sleep pretty often about this whole thing. We don’t live together  but we will once we move in. I’m worried about him seeing me so broken over it. He knows I wishes he was my first but he doesn’t know how much it tears me up on a day to day basis. Idk how he’d react.",10Aug2020,1

I wasn't anything to an extreme I think, and I was caring and genuinely helped ppl, etc. But I still regret so much how I used to be.

260," A couple months ago I got my biggest wave of continuous panic attacks that kept me awake for days (was my second one ever), since then I slept fine but I was pretty anxious all the time since quarantine I was basically locked to the same place where I had that episode, it finally happened last Wednesday when the same thing happened again at the same rate or even a bit stronger, after four days of no sleep and panic I was basically thinking about the worst case scenario that I was gonna have psychosis from sleep deprivation especially since I was in my room almost all the time and I couldn't really move or do much due to the loss of appetite so I started to get paranoid and I understandably started feeling a bit down but I'm not depressed.

These last two days I'm almost baseline calm but still not over the insomnia which could increase my anxiety. I went to a psychiatrist for the first time today explained everything and gave me prescription of 5 mg of olanzapine every night and said don't worry even if its used to treat more severe disorders and that I should report back in a month.

Since then I've read everything I can on off label use but I find mixed results, some people that swear by them and others they warn not to use them.

The main side effects mentioned are weight gain which I don't mind since I lost 7 kg these last months due to anxiety so I'm moderately underweight and dullness which I'm not a fan of but if it's just short term treatment I don't mind it since I'm gonna be stuck home doing nothing anyways for the foreseeable future.

Anyone has experience with the off label use? Is the dosage too much?

as the title says, I’m really struggling with this one. I got my first panic attack at my workplace 2 years ago, a couple days before my birthday. I don’t wanted to make a fuss, so I kept quiet as good as I could do at that moment. After work on my way home I felt like collapsing on the bus, so I got off the bus some stations too early and walked to the central station. At that point I really had to focus to not just fall down. Finally arrived at the central station I decided to visit the hospital, so I waited there at the central bus station for the next bus driving there, walking up and down like a maniac and focusing onto not fainting. In the meantime I also called my parents and tried to describe what is happening and where I’m heading, so they could follow after me. Arrived at the hospital I explained the guy how I was feeling and he just sent me to the office of the medical on-call service, where I was waiting literally 2-3 hours before the doctor arrived. At that point I really thought I was going to die, because nobody took my state of health seriously enough and nobody was there to help me. I felt alone and helpless. Also my parents arrived while I was waiting, but that didn’t help me to calm down either. So the doctor was listening to what I was saying. I told him like I was feeling like having a heart attack or cardiac arrest, how it all started etc. All he wanted to know after that was my age (27 at that point btw.) and all he had to say then was: You can’t get a heart attack with 27. Nothing else. No check-ups, no ecg. Just nothing. After that he let me out of the office, where I thanked my parents for coming and caring and just drove home. I was just tired after all what happened, so at home I just dropped to bed and slept. After that one day everything started. Chest pains, shortness of breath, heart palpitations and trippings, more panic attacks and so on... It took 1-2 different doctor visits before one of them really wanted to make a ecg to check my heart at rest and also at exercising. But at that point every result was that calming me down for another 2-3 days and then everything started from the beginning. 

Now, 2 years later, most of my symptoms disappeared, but the anxiety, the heart tripping and my fear of dying or having a heart disease are still there. I go to a psychotherapist from time to time, but I don’t feel like it’s helping. I also get some really weird panic attacks, after feeling my heart tripping (kinda feels like a short circuit for me, like something stopped working for a brief moment) and it feels like it happens because I don’t breath correctly and that thought let me think that I’m kinda forgetting to breath at all. Some kind of really shitty cycle.

I also don’t take any treatments or medicine. 

So, does anyone have a similar story or similar symptoms and found out some way to deal with this?

Just thanks for reading and I’m looking forward to your answers.

265,hey um so basically for a long time i was struggling with self harm and when i found out my best friend was cutting herself too my problem only got worse. i thought that if i was a good enough friend then she wouldn’t be hurting herself and that if i was a better friend she wouldn’t be talking to this dude that treated her like shit blahblahblah. me and her got into an argument stopped talking for about 9 months and when we started talking again both of us had gotten better and next month i’ll be a year clean but about an hour ago she texted our gc and basically said that she that she almost relapsed and she would tell us about it when we picked her up today. so basically i’m scared because as soon as i read that my stomach dropped and i immediately wanted to cut again because i’m still in the same stupid ass mindset that i could’ve done something differently. it’s all so fucking dumb. i just really thought that she was doing better and now i’m scared. i can’t bring myself to throw out my blades even after all this time they’re still right beside my bed. i don’t really like to talk about this shit but i’m nervous and i really don’t know what to say to her.,10Aug2020,1
266,hi my mom refuses to see a physiatrist so i wanted to ask the people here for (not a diagnosis) but maybe a coping method for what she’s going through or something. my mom constantly is rushed for no reason and it stresses her out so much. we move a lot and we just moved somewhere new 3 days ago and she says she can’t stop freaking out and she feels like she is having a constant panic attack. usually changes make her feel more panicked but she always feels constantly stressed in her everyday life. she has diagnosed OCD but undiagnosed depression and suicidal thoughts if that stuff may correlate to what’s going on right now. does anyone have any possible solutions because i don’t really know what to do right now and her stress makes her shout all the time which then makes me panic.,10Aug2020,1
267,"While reading a quora post about gaslighting, I decided to google the meaning. I do this sometimes to understand better. After reading the definition, I thought to myself -‘No one has to make me question my sanity, I do it to myself all the time’
The next thing I did was open incognito and type in self gaslight. Lo and behold there were a lot of results. Apparently it’s common. I was so shocked. I was gaslighting about gaslighting myself. Sorry if I’m not grammatically correct but I hope you get what I mean.
So I thought I’d post it here and get the community’s opinion.

268,"I was listening to an off song the other day and it triggered a vivid memory from high school of talking to the guy (who date raped me) in the library about what music I was listening to.  It came out of nowhere and the assault isn’t something that I generally think about much of at all.

So since that came up I was trying to think about the night the assault happened and while I know I was pretty much blacked out when it happened I don’t remember anything about the night. The beginning of it before we had started drinking, where we were going, who I was with, anything. To be fair this happened almost 20 years ago but I found it strange that I could think of any details surrounding it.

Then the more I thought about it the more I realized that I don’t really remember anything from high school aside from teachers names and some of my classmates. Individual experiences don’t jump out at me and I feel like I can’t remember anything clearly. I didn’t do drugs or drink very often in school so I can attribute it to that, but I was wondering if maybe the assault made me compartmentalizations the whole experience so that I don’t remember anything.

Has anything similar happened to anyone else here?",10Aug2020,1

270,"The state of the world/country has really taken a toll on my mental health. I am incredibly anxious about the pandemic, so going into any sort of office to talk to any strangers in-person sounds spooky. 

I don’t see myself being able to dig myself out of this hole- so can anyone recommend any apps or websites that do virtual therapy? Whether it be video chat or phone chats doesn’t matter to me. I’m mainly worried about this being accessible, able to find a therapist I can get along with/trust, knowing it’s confidential, and also covered by insurance in some way? I have zero monies as I’ve been fighting for unemployment for 5 months now. 
Thank you all in advance!",10Aug2020,1

272,"Right now I'm struggling massively with depression. This is the worst I've felt and I constantly have a feeling of wanting to kill myself but I dont have the balls for it. I dont want to feel this way I want to be normal. 
About a few months ago I went to the doctors and they diagnosed me with depression, when they referred me to a place for therspy the whole lockdown thing happened and they moved it to online. I completely pussied out before the first session saying I could deal with it myself but I really cant.

What types of therspy would be available now. Idk if a texting one is a thing but I would much rather do that than a zoom or whatever. Any advice is appreciated",10Aug2020,1
273,"Even though I've talked about this with my therapist a few times, I still struggle to put it into words. I think the best analogy, as silly as it sounds, is that it feels like there's molasses or asphalt inside my body. Not only does it take tremendous effort to move, everything also feels heavy and...sticky? I spend most of my days sitting around at best, lying around or sleeping at worst but I'm starting to think it's not because I'm *tired*, per se, but because it just feels like someone turned up gravity and even just...sitting upright is exhausting. If I'm not lying down, I have to rest my head somewhere...  
And it makes just doing *anything* really difficult because feeling exhausted is my default state. I feel like I'm spending all my energy on keeping my body from falling apart, I have no energy left to do things that I love, and it's making me sad.

My GP has checked all my blood values recently. Twice, actually, once for a general checkup and once when I was sick. Physically, I'm perfectly healthy. I work out, I'm not super fit but not out of shape either, I know from experience than I *can* do manual labor all day long, I eat well, I get more sleep than I'd like...but my mind is stuck in this...lead armor that makes it nearly impossible to do anything I enjoy. I sometimes wish my soul could just leave my body behind and have the energy to draw, read, listen to music, write, take photos and do all the things I enjoy but can't do because I have to drag my body around...

Can anybody relate? Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this?",10Aug2020,1

277,"I've noticed for a long time that when I try to open up and share things, I immediately breakdown physically. Sometimes I'm just nervous or sometimes I'm really sad and I acknowledge that I probably cry more than the ""usual"" person.

My question comes from when I recently opened up to my siblings about my recent feelings and hardships and while we were talking and they were comforting me, I knew I was sad but I didn't feel sad at all? I sort of felt empty after a while and it was hard not to feel that I was tricking all of them even though I knew it wasn't true. Somehow it makes me wonder if I know what it feels to be sad.

278,"I don’t even know how to start. My head is so clouded and I don’t know who to vent too. So I'm here I guess. 

I have been struggling with mental illness my whole life. I don’t think today is the worst, but it could be better. I was having a heated discussion with my dad (found in post history) and I got really upset. I couldn’t find any space or room to be alone and I just became so scared.

I started crying as the space I tried to search for was declined. I couldn’t stop crying and I started shaking. I was hyperventilating and everything was just horrible. I made everyone cry and I feel pretty bad. I feel like I caused lots of drama. 

Any support would be appreciated :,)",10Aug2020,1

280,I get caught up in long periods of self loathing and suicidal ideation. I’ve talked to others about how I feel and I always get the same advice to “start loving my self more” and being kinder to myself. However what they don’t understand is that it’s not as easy as It seems. It’s hard constantly battling the negative thoughts. I don’t know if I “hate” myself but i feel embarrassed about my life and personality. I tend to always overthink about past situations and beat my self up about them when I clearly know I can’t do anything to change them. I feel stuck in a ditch where I want to get out but don’t know how to.,10Aug2020,1
