1,"Hi all,

Not sure if this is the right place to ask but I feel this has been coming for a long time. Made an account for some advice.

Posting here for options as a last resort sort of thing. 27 year old male uk.

Just come home at 12pm from a work night out which was fun and had a breakdown and cried my eyes out for 1 hour none stop. I feel extremely lonely I haven't cried really since I was 14. At least not like this. I can't connect.

I don't want to worry my parents or brother since they have their own problems and worry a lot, asked a friend to talk but she's asleep. Can any anyone recommend a mental health sevice in the UK? NHS or private I don't mind paying or should I just see my GP? Feel like I need someone to talk to, I've been very stoic until now and this is very sudden although it's been a long time coming. It's very worrying. Who can I speak to in the UK? Have to go to work tomorrow, thanks.

All help appreciated,

2,"I want to write what I am dealing with in my current life in a few sentences, but will likely not be able. I am a 37m, single, and rent a house w/ my sister. I currently work independently delivering amazon packages. I am doing this job because it enables me to not have to engage with people. I don't like to engage with people because I have severe social anxiety and generalized anxiety. These last 4-5 months my hands and feet will just sweat profusely on top of my other symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, shallow breathing, tense upper neck/shoulder area, and just overall walking around feeling in constant fear (with no real reason as to why).

&amp;#x200B;

I have dealt with anxiety starting around the age of 21 or 22. In the beginning it was awful: Panic attacks along with some actual hallucinations in the first week getting off of drugs.  I self medicated with alcohol and drugs in my teens I believe to cope with that because at that young age I couldn't really identify feelings:just that something is off.  I kept going in and out of Alcoholics Anonymous until I got a DUI in 2007. I had more serious arrests prior to that, but that was when I had enough. I had to tell my Fiance's daughter why my car was missing one day on the couch and that really shook me up. I obtained 10 years sobriety from that day on until 2017.

&amp;#x200B;

I eventually divorced in 2013. Looking back at my marriage I see so many things where I went wrong. Near the end I wasn't as active in my recovery anymore. It was from 5-7 meetings a week down to only 1 a week. I found that I wasn't growing emotionally anymore and was going back to counter-productive behaviors.  I was starting to isolate myself again and isolate from people that care about me. My isolation manifests so many unhealthy things. And obviously it makes the anxiety 10 times worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometime in 2017 I decided to drink again. Fortunately, I haven't had any serious ramifications from it. I have only drank 8-9 times since 2017 till now.  I just don't like how it makes me feel anymore for the most part: Shitty next day w/ a lil bout of depression. I have questioned if I am really an alcoholic at times because of this. However, I do have an addicting personality and know ultimately I shouldn't partake.

&amp;#x200B;

When I got sober originally my sister offered me a career in appraising. She had her own appraisal company and offered to train me and I took her up on it. I went from making $9/hour to $50 per claim over night. A few more years into it I was making $4000-$6000/month. It really boosted my self esteem. I was able to learn a skill and it finally gave me some direction in my work life. I was not rich by no means, but wasn't stressing either in finances. Somewhere around 2015 my sisters company was not doing well and she had to sell it. I was working for another appraisal company in addition at the time. Eventually I had to leave the other company also because work became just too slow. Keep in mind what  I liked about these jobs was that I had limited contact with people. Meet with the shop or owner and only took around 30 minutes to inspect and then I was gone:But was obtaining decent money too. That is when I signed up to do a ""Gig"" job delivering packages. This was in 2017. It was only suppose to be temporary until I found something else. But that something else hasn't happened. That is because I went to one job interview at a shop and my anxiety was so bad I remember the collar of my shirt was shaking. I decided right there to not go through with that again. I basically said to myself I am giving up on life in general. 

&amp;#x200B;

It has been a pretty pathetic life since. I am obese and that brings on even more anxiety. I have no self confidence in myself. I have just gone through bankruptcy and my car is now a salvaged title. I barely make ends meet.

About 5-6 days ago my sisters best friends daughter moved in with us. She just lost her 2 kids due to drugs and possible mental illness. I had recently lived with my sisters best friend and her daughter for about 3 years. During that time I got to know them and for the most part enjoyed being around them. We got to know each other during that time. So when she moved in the first day it was nice to see a familiar face even though it was not good for the circumstances. I had heard from my sister some of the horror stories recently with the daughter (25-26 years old). It seems in the last 6 months her life has gone upside down. Her ex is in prison for ""Lewd acts with a child"", lives with her mom, had 2 kids with that guy, and is completely dependent on her mom. I think the situation has took a toll on her and quickly. 

&amp;#x200B;

The night after she moved in 5-6 days ago her and I drank and fooled around. She wanted to have sex, but I told her that was not going to happen. Thus far it hasn't happened either. But there have been some intense moments. She is sleeping in my bed every night now. I told her we can't have a relationship because of a magnitude of reasons. However, after the first night I started developing feelings.  I haven't had any intimate contact with anyone since my divorce. It felt so good and was intoxicating. But with being in AA and being older I know also this is never going to be a successful relationship and is likely going to end really bad.

&amp;#x200B;

I have attempted to talk to her about getting sober and that her kids should be her number one priority. But that just goes over head like nothing. She seems to not care what so ever. It is hurtful to watch because regardless of this ""Fling"" that is going on right now I do ultimately care for her and her well being. She likes to smoke pot and when she does it is disturbing. The effects it has on her are worrisome. It is not a typical somewhat vegetative state or relaxed it is full on psychotic. Last night she was just laughing every 10-20 minutes at nothing and sounded somewhat evil. I told her yesterday that we needed to end our ""Fling"" because it isn't healthy. What is sad is it feels like a real ""break up"". I am going through emotions as if I was with someone for a year or more. All it is showing me is really how unhealthy I am right now. Also, I have no control over what she does with her life: Nobody does ever. My sister is going to kick her out she said in the next day or two and while I fear what the future will bring for her I have to realize that I truly am powerless. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since yesterday I called a doctor to start getting on meds again for anxiety and will meet this coming Tuesday. I have made contact and am awaiting a return phone call to start therapy also. My old boss at the other appraisal company called me a couple of days ago and see if I wanted to work again appraising and I took the job. I am considering going back to AA....... I really shouldn't consider it and should just go do it.  I get so caught up with my weight and anxiety and I keep pushing that idea off right now. I need to start exercising.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel for the first time in many years and I am just the very very very beginning of getting my life back and taking control again. What more should I do? 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a small sliver of hope again, but it is small. Lots of work to do now....

&amp;#x200B;

All day in my head its been : You have to fight, you have to fight, you have to fight.

God relieve me from despair and anxiety.",14Feb2020,1
3,"Does anyone else feel like self-demeaning jokes are hardwired in your library of jokes? I am pretty sure  over 80% of what comes out of my mouth is putting down whatever I do. I noticed my outlook on life has drastically changed over the past year and I am starting to think it has to do with how I view myself. The question I have is how do people not care what people think? What do you do to feel more confident? How do you get through each day without tearing yourself down? 

I am always reassuring my friends or strangers that nobody is judging them, but then I secretly judge myself 24/7. Why is it so fucking easy to be a hypocrite about something I am constantly telling others to do. What do you think I am doing wrong and why can't I get these thoughts of extremely low self-worth out of my mind?

I can't even invest my time in one thing for too long because I constantly convince myself that I'm no good at it. I have been trying to get into reading books, which has been really nice to get out of my head (when that works). It's hard to focus on reading when a steady flow of thoughts pulse through my mind, which makes finishing a book that much more of an accomplishment. Why is it so hard to read a sentence without losing track of what you just read. 

I have so many more questions, but this is getting too long for my comfort. I guess I just want some answers, but I know we are all going through our own shit. If anyone reading this has similar thoughts or questions then hopefully you find comfort in knowing you aren't alone. My hope is for someone to answer at least one of these questions. Then maybe that answer will resonate with me and whoever else feels the same way.",14Feb2020,1
4,"Hey everyone. I want to see if anyone has experienced something similar and/or if anyone can share any advice. 

Over the past few years, especially after going to college, I have been dealing with mental struggles. One thing that I have noticed is that loneliness triggers me to be in my head and really get overwhelmed by negative thoughts and FOMO. Even though I am happy to have moved on from high school days, I have yet to experience a close knit friend group like I did in those days again. I have close friends but they are all on different paths and it is difficult to meet up with them at times. When I am free and unable to meet up with any of them, I feel very isolated. I used to be active on social media with everything a few years ago, but now I keep all that to myself. I don’t usually talk about this stuff, even to my friends. Can I have some advice with how to deal with this? For reference, I am 24 and finishing up school the end of this year. I live at home and drifted apart from many people in my hometown after college. I just really struggle with not having a close knit group anymore it seems. 



Short: I have a close friend group but they are sometimes difficult to see and when no one is available and I have a lot of free time, I really struggle with loneliness.",14Feb2020,1
5,"Bit of a long one but I need to get it off my chest. Apologies for the formatting, I’m on mobile. 

Almost four years ago I found my biological dad just before my 18th birthday. He didn’t know he had a daughter but he was over the moon and things were great for a few months- we were planning to meet, spoke every week or so, he told his other kids about me and I was getting to know him and his family. Unfortunately it didn’t work out and we haven’t spoken in years. 

Through finding him I also found my grandparents and an auntie, who told me she has another sister but my grandparents don’t really speak to her. The only people from the family I stayed in touch with were my aunties, we didn’t speak much but the occasional message was enough. I’ve always wanted to meet them but life just got in the way. 

Anyway, I’m going to my aunties wedding in a few days and it’ll be the first time I’ve met any of my dads family. I don’t know if my other auntie will be there but I’m pretty sure no one else from my dads family will be. 
This is such a big deal and I honestly can’t believe I’m finally going to meet them but honestly, I’m so nervous about what to expect and my mind is going overtime. I’m overthinking every little detail and I’m dreading the unknown of whether the rest of the family will be there- I know some of them blame my mum for ‘taking me’ from my dad but there’s so much more to that story that even I’m not sure of. 
I’m also terrified of how I’ll be after this weekend. If it doesn’t go well I don’t know what I’ll do. This is my family and it’s all I’ve ever wanted.

8,"My wife and I lost a dog 3 years ago who had been sick for about 5 years before that.  We would like to get another dog (we are both very much dog people) but I had anxiety attacks when he was sick and still do when we dog sit for friends.  When ours was alive any sound he made at night would shoot me straight out of bed.  If he didn’t eat I couldn’t leave the house.  If he looked at me funny (which Boxers never do!) I tried to figure out what was wrong.  Sometimes I’d sit at work and suddenly feel like I was just about to be run over by a train.  This was driven by me watching him like you would a first born toddler at all times so I could offer help immediately if I saw anything.  (He had multiple issues, some I could help others not so much)  Some of that anxiety is still there when we dog sit but its much better now.  The feelings now are more if like realizing that I forgot something at home and they pass quickly, but are still triggered by the same things as before.  So my question is what is the best way to move forward?  Do I keep dog sitting until I feel more comfortable?  Do I need so see someone?  I'm pretty open about this with everyone I know but talking about it with them hasn’t helped much.  I’m hoping someone can offer better insight.  Thanks!",14Feb2020,1

12,"Don’t know if this is the right place to post this, starting with the fact that I should be going to a professional for this instead of asking strangers on reddit, but I digress.

Basically, I’ve kind of noticed a pattern with my mood. I’ve been struggling with really bad depression since 2011-ish. The first time I fell into depression I spent about 1.5 years in that state, then in 2013 I felt good again, but that lasted for about four months, until I fell into depression again for about the same amount of time. The beginning of 2014 was okay but then I fell again and didn’t come back out until about late 2016, and it seemed to start going uphill. The first half of 2017 was really good, second half I was depressed again. Then came 2018, the worst year of my life. Nothing bad really happened to make it the worst year, but I was just the most depressed I had ever been, ever, for the entire year. I probably started feeling okay in December. In contrast, last year has been the best year of my life so far. Just like 2018, nothing significant happened to make it the best, but I was doing incredibly well. Fast forward to now, I’m depressed again.

The thing is, I know for sure that whenever I’ve felt depressed, it’s always been a major depressive episode for sure, literally all the symptoms, no exceptions. But when I’m doing well, I don’t necessarily think it’s hypomania. Maybe it is and it just doesn’t seem like it to mee, but I don’t know. Do you think it could be Bipolar II? If not, what other possible “diagnosis”, for lack of a better term, do you think it could be?

I do plan on going to a professional to talk about this, but I kinda want some reassurance because I feel like it could give me that extra push that I need to finally bring myself to therapy.

I’ve had depression anxiety for years since I was a kid. I’m now 21 but I held it in me for so long as I didn’t want to go as a kid to the doctors and tell my parents. When I was 18 I finally saw a therapist and psychiatrist. Did therapy and didn’t help me, got prescribed anti depressant was scared to take them originally and also the one I had seen was a bit dodgy, wouldn’t answer phone calls to make future bookings so I stopped seeing him. Found a new psychiatrist who scored me the highest you could get depression and anxiety then proceeds to tell me I’ve got adhd. I was like fine I’ve now got adhd and was given medication for it. It did help with concentration but my anxiety was increased and depression was still present 2.5 years later. I keep telling him week after week I’m struggling everyday with depression and anxiety (stemmed from having eczema, ibs and eating disorder as a kid) which led me to be bullied every single day at primary and high school. I have no confidence in myself at all, and have lost my job due to it. He proceeds to tell me all my depression and anxiety came from my adhd, I call complete bs on that because if it did why hasn’t adhd med helped my anxiety depression?

Recently, I started going to the gym. Over the last year I’ve lost almost 100 lbs and I’m in amazing shape. Maybe the best shape I’ve ever been in. But my eating habits still aren’t that great.

The corona virus is a way that people are being tested. It will eventually turn all of the bad people into zombie like creatures and the good people will not turn into these creatures.

I think I recall this starting when I was about nine. At the time, I was really into some superhero show, honestly I don't even remember what it was called. For whatever reason, I started getting the feeling that the characters were watching me every second of my life. Sort of like in inside out, only they had no control over me. They just saw me, saw everything I did, probably judged me.
Since then, my brain has convinced itself that everyone is watching me. Be it characters from something I was obsessed with, family members, friends, or bullies from school, they were always watching my life through my eyes.
Obviously, there is no one in my head watching my every move. But for whatever reason, I always feel self concious about doing anything while I'm alone, because some random character from some random game or show has been forced by some unholy being to watch my life unfold.

I looked it up and I get results for children who grew up with helicopter parents watching their every move, but my parents weren't like that. I've always just assumed I had a weird irrational fear but as I get older the feeling of having no privacy takes its toll.

30,"I’ve always known I wasn’t right in the head but growing up I was taught to ignore the shit and move on. In my early teenage years I had some fucked up shit happen to me that I ignore most of the time but still can tell it bothers me to this day. But now I’m not sure what’s happening. I really think I’m slowly going insane more and more each day. I hear voices..I see things..and blocking it out is making it harder each day. 
I was in the bathroom staring at myself in the mirror one night, not sure why, or how long, but I was stuck in a trance. The person I was looking at in that mirror wasn’t me. The person I seen was ugly, my eyes looked insane, I was losing my shit and telling myself how fucking horrible I am...all while I’m just standing there staring at myself. I can’t even describe what it’s like..the voices..the things I see. The only reason I snapped out of it was because my boyfriend walked in and scared me, and I mean when I seen him I almost hit the ground in tears. I’m losing my hair, my eye lashes are literally coming out if I touch them..I want to go to the doctor and try to get on something but would it even stop?

I ultimately would like to receive insight on why I cannot truly connect with anyone, so I may then adjust my life accordingly for the better. 

To start things off, I am 18 years old, and I’m currently attending high school. Throughout my years I have associated myself with many different groups, participated in different activities, and have attended numerous events that have exposed me a variety of different people, and yet I still cannot seem to empathize with anyone. I have repetitiously honed in on my people skills, trying to make myself a person that can harbor a healthy community of people, but it seems as though it is futile. Generally speaking, I bring smiles to people’s faces - It appears that I make them happy, but It also seems that I am not able to share this happiness. I try my best to never put anyone down, alienate them, disrespect them, or disregard their feelings. In fact, I tend to keep my mind open to other people; I try to SYMPATHIZE with other people to, once again, harbor a healthy community of people. I do realize that I am quite young, which may be the culprit of my case. Maybe I’m just too naïve, and I’ll grow out if this. It’s also notable that this may be due to mental illness, but I’d rather doubt that. On the contrary, I may not be familiar with the intricacies of mental illness so who knows. In addition, I may just need to improve my people skills more; I could just be blind to social queues, and thus they may not provoke any real feelings on my end. 

I’m open to any and all advice or questions that you may have.",14Feb2020,1
40,"I'm 20m, always been really fucking off myself.  I don't even really know how to explain, and I feel everyone has this feeling to some extent, but I'm pretty sure it is very abnormal to have such stubborn assumptions in me.

I moved country when I was 13, when I was just coming to terms with things I think (I suppose you might say when a boy first starts transitioning into a man, mentality wise), had my first group of friends I felt included with after heaps of bullying, started losing weight finally and getting fitter etc.  I think this says a lot, because after that I kinda just recessed into being agoraphobic.  I was always fucking ages away from anyone I knew from school, which was even more true after I moved.

Idk what happened, but I just got tired of always trying to talk to people and shit, put up with people's shit, being expected to just toughen up and shit when I was fundamentally hurt.  I just stopped trying at some point and just assumed everything I felt was bullshit.  Feeling overwhelming boredom, loneliness was just what I was to expect, it's hard to make friends when you don't want to do anything, have anxiety, and are so desperately lonely, and I think I just had a real superficial persona.

I was at a boy's school too, so I guess around 14-17 having no friends and knowing 0 chicks just makes you feel bottom regardless, and people get hostile dealing with their own shit around that time so I guess I just assumed I was always worthless and saw no way to improve my situation without changing for the worse.

Now I keep discontinuing uni and I can't talk to people for whatever reason, I can't have fun, I can't make friends and i don't feel it realistic to make friends any time soon.

Idk, my psych just tells me that I can, and that I'll make friends at uni, but I'm not just pessimistic, I literally see no way of that working out at all.  Idk what to do.  Either I'm not enough for people and am way too passive, or I'm way too hostile.  Idk.

My body react in a violent and a sudden way for a few seconds every time I see something that reminds me of my ex. That also happens when I relive past memories (not necessarily bad/painful ones).

I also feel excruciating pain mainly in my chest area for hours whenever I talk so much and people react coldly to me. Not sure if it's related though.

42,"My mom has always had something wrong with her, and shes been getting worse to the point where shes not really my mom anymore, I'd love to hear some opinions of what she possibly could have and what I can do to at least have a relationship with her before it's too late. Her entire life shes been very socially weird. Shes super nice but when you talk to her you could tell something's off. Shed go on ramblings a lot. She dealt with some weird types of paranoia, like she would see a group of teenage girls at the mall and run, and I mean full on run, in the opposite direction. She was and still is too scared to go to any kind of doctor, after she was treated for her second case of breast cancer (~2010) she stopped going all together. Her dental health has always been poor. Shes so paranoid now that she has even lost teeth, clearly has some kind of gum disease that she is still to scared to treat, and now has lost a noticeably large amount of hair. The ramblings have gotten worse and I've noticed that she talks to herself. The last time I saw her she visited where i live and talked to herself and noted different lampposts that were new. Its bizarre. She cant hold conversations, often times it's like talking to a brick wall. She talks to her 10 year old daughter like shes a puppy (baby talking and whatnot) and does the same to me (I'm 18) in texts. She sends me barbies for my birthday and for some reason cant grasp how old I am, when I ask her what shes been up to she cant comprehend it. After not seeing her for 3 years, she had lost a terrifying amount of weight and her mental condition had worsened severely. I dont know what's wrong with her and I'm kind of desperate because it hurts to watch this happen. We have ruled out possible drug abuse because a lot of these issues were present when we still lived with her, she didn't have issues like that then. She also only ticks a few boxes for it, she doesnt get super upedy or awake or anything, shes still down to earth. If any one could give their opinion I'm all ears.

43,"So I’ve been on risperidone since April of 2017 when I went into an adderal induced psychosis and ended up in the psych ward. I saw a psychiatrist when I got out and he cut the dose from 4 mg to 2 and cut my Ativan to 1/3. I had another episode where I was up for 3 days and ended up back in the psych ward. 

While I was at the second place they put me on a whole plethora of other meds along with the risperidal, but after about a year and a half I was down to only taking risperidone. Starting in feb of last year i started going down from my 4 mg dose by 0.5mg every 1-2 months, with some longer periods while I was in between pyschs. 


Just this past Tuesday was the first night I stopped taking it completely. I feel good but I’m scared because a lot of emotions are coming back and I’m thinking a lot more than I have been the past almost 3 years. 

I’m just wondering if anyone else has successfully weaned of risperidal and if you have any helpful tips or tricks. Or things I can do if I start to feel like the thoughts are too much (like taking risperidal again and at what dose). I know I can talk to my psychiatrist but I just wanted to see if any of you all have any suggestions?

Even people whom I am somewhat close to, after a long while, I will randomly stop and go “wow I can’t believe how bad I’m treating them because I’m constantly thinking about negative things.” People, acquaintances, and even kind strangers can be such a positive impact in my life but I sub-consciously and consciously block them out of my life.

54,"so I've been interested in doing modelling for a few years now but my parents said to wait until I finished school to apply for anything. I graduated at the end of last year and I've started looking into it. I have sent photos to a few agencies in my city and there is one agency who would like to do a test shoot and another agency that would like to meet with me in person. I have also applied to a modelling competition which is being held in a few months. 

I haven't replied to them yet because I've been having second thoughts about it and whether doing modelling is the best thing for me. I am quite insecure about the way I look, mostly I focus on flaws that I perceive such as my nose being too big or something like that and I can't stop thinking about it. I have never had any issues with weight/eating and I am comfortable with my body, but it is mostly my  face and/or hair that preoccupies me. I always get really anxious when getting ready to go somewhere and even something small like a bit of hair being frizzy or a small part of my dress not looking right stresses me out. whenever I take photos at social events I always zoom in on myself and scrutinise myself for ages. 

I always assumed that doing modelling might increase my self confidence and help me get more comfortable with photos but I also know that it is a really harsh industry and I am worried that getting into it will negatively impact my mental health. also, as I said I haven't had problems with my weight or body before but since I am already insecure about somethings about myself I feel like I have the potential to have other body image issues.

57,"So, he’s had anxiety attacks in his life before. He takes benzos as needed for his anxiety here and there (maybe 1 every other month on bad days). I’ve never known him to be anything but stable. Two weeks ago, he got a blood clot in his knee and this came right after his mother in law  nearly passed away from kidney issues. He and his wife are caretakers for her. 
He’s recently had issues at work with not having promised hours. He works when he’s called to come in. Finances are an issue right now too. So stress certainly is a factor. 
He’s fairly active, a healthy eater, and fit (mid 50’s).

Here’s what’s happened since over the past two weeks:
- his sleep cycle has been horrible.
- he calls his two children who live closest to him and talks to them about his personal issues (testicle pain, sexual details, etc...). This may not sound like a big deal, but he is one of the most modest men you’ll ever meet.
- he says things like, “I am afraid to fall asleep because I feel like I’m going to be buried.” &amp; “my hands are crumbling because I don’t have enough water in me.”
- he drank 72 oz of water one morning within an hour because he felt like his body was crumbling and breaking apart.
- he weeps for hours at a time. I’ve never seen him cry. Ever! And his daughter said the only times he’s cried were when his parents passed away.
- he calls his children all the time and tries to guilt them if they need to go, “you are trying to ignore me aren’t you?” (He never calls his kids before all this.)
- he feels like people are trying to take his credit card information with devices at the grocery stores. To the point that he literally followed a guy out the door of a grocery store and wrote down his license plate number and called his son to give him the details because he was sure that he was going to get captured for turning them in. He called his son back a few minutes later and told him to destroy the evidence because he didn’t want those people tracing the information back to him and hurt them because he thought he was being followed.
- he called his son about a week ago and told him to come and get all of his guns out of his house because he was afraid of himself. His son went and got them all.

He went and saw a doctor about the issues and was prescribed a sleep aid, anti-depressant, and an anti-anxiety medication. The doctor said it was stress induced anxiety. He suggested that he and his wife “get away.”
Today, they went to a cottage on a nice little tourist island west of Seattle. There is no cell service, but there’s a community phone. No more than two hours of being there he called his son and told him to come and get them because he was afraid that he was going to hurt himself or someone else. There are no weapons there.
He tried to guilt trip him into coming and getting him. “I feel like you guys are abandoning me! I just don’t know what I’ll do now.”

1. What should we do?
2. What is happening to this man?! 

He is a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSON. Think of your most stable friend or family member. Then imagine them changing instantly so much that they now fit into your top 10 list of most crazy people you know. It was like a switch flipped and it hasn’t flipped back for two weeks, now.",14Feb2020,1

Lately a lot of burden has been placed on me. I am in a weird place where my ex and I live together but I am the one who is forced to take care of all the financials. On top of that this girl I was talking to for less than 2 months wants to get married so I can take care of her and buy her things. My mom and stepfather may be forced to leave their home.

Then a couple minutes later I was okay and asked my boyfriend if he could make me a bowl of ice cream and in the few minutes it took him to make me a bowl, I was back on the floor laying down crying again and I just felt like I never wanted to get up or move or do anything. And I've been feeling like this on and off a lot. I'll be sad in the morning, then after an hour or so, I'll be happy again. Then by lunch I'll be really sad again. Then by the time 6th period begins, I'm happy again. Then when it's time to go home, I'll be sad again. Can anyone help me? I'm so sorry this is so long you guys.",14Feb2020,1

ET: 12:46 AM

I sprained my ankle, I am thinking wednesday. I have not showered in maybe a week. I feel extremely unclean. My body is tired and so is my eyes but I don't think I can sleep. I am far too uncomfortable. I feel like I'm faint. I feel like I'm going to throw up. I have been forgetting to brush my teeth for over a year..my teeth hurt..they might all fall out. I want to knock my teeth out so I don't have to deal with this bother anymore.....I cannot stand due to my ankle, well I can but cannot walk, much less go upstairs where a shower is...

I didn't go to therapy today and my dad suggested taking my brother in my place. I was upset. How dare he? Take my brother, the one who abuses me to my therapist? Oh shut the fuck uP! You raise your voice at me for being ""selfish""? for protesting taking the one I fear the most (excluding the christian god) is him. I do not want my therapist ever meeting him, or sympathizing with him about his problems, or whatever. I do not want her to put a name to a face.

I am already repulsed by sharing blood with that guy, and a last name, a house, breathing air. Do not take him to see that nice women. He is nice sometimes, but it does not cure his faults. If his problems are so bad, why won't he just kill himself to stop dealing with them? Oh I'd be so glad.

I have very little love for this family. I only feel anything for them when they seem to benefit me, though that is normal. Humans are a greedy species and I belong to this species. I want to throw up.. but I don't obviously. My ankle, ow ow ow. The darkness surrounding this screen is very strange, it is acting strange. Am I seeing things now?

I feel itchy. I am dirty. I don't intend to eat for a few days. I am very tired. This is unpleasant. Naturally I get this injury when I am looking forward to something. Nobody could understand these words of mine as they like to add a stupid health-scientific reason. Science is a good way to explain what cannot be explained with fancy words to sound legitimate. I was looking forward to the symphony in which I cannot go.. due to my injury. I was helping people when I got hurt! How silly is that?  


I decide to be nice for a change and it totally fucks me over! Guess who is going back to being mean, more then before. DId you get your wish? My god! What are you planning? I confirm your existence and even when I try to imagine your existence as a lie, I cannot. Oh how I was raised...curses and curses... it really really got ingraved in there huh.'

I want you to back off and leave me alone. I always say shitty things about you, and then I come back praying to you for help. I am a weak creature and I try to depend on the stronger. I feel blamed for the things in which you made me. It is like forcing someone at gun point to dance and when they dance hitting them for dancing. Rude! 

I am so incredibly unhappy in this moment. I have memories from my weird dream, not a pleasurable one. That is what I get for having a nice jerk off before bed eh? Punishment! Oh when will it end? Why can't you just decide one sin is too great and then off me? Or what do I have to do?

I feel like i'm going to throow up throw up throw up 

this is stupidd

I am blasting music through headphones, broken ones so only one ear. This is the worst.

Let me die in my sleep. Send me somewhere not to hell, not to heaven. Do not re-incarnate me unles in the lovely case of magic existing...in another world!!!!!!!!!!

Should I leave this world with a fun record? I've been thinking of it for a while..too long..now...

how many? 1? 2? 3? 4? 5? 100? a whole city? a country?

Man.  I have tried so much.

But none of it seems to work. I hate that stupid medical guy,, the word too hard to type.. psychatrist? psycha...triste... 
who gave me prozac? are you stupid? is he really that stupid?
and all those awful, god - awful, ones who sided with him. A guy they never met?
well granted they didn't meet me...either

I think I have superiority to him. As I do not have depression or anxitey giving that to me is stupid! I'm just going to use it to kill myself. I don't even know wha i have anymore...but it sure isnt' that!! 
mY ANKLE
ow ow ow ow

please.....god. free me from this. if you'll grant my wish. don't make it painful, or ideally make me not allowed to realize what is happening

I am afraid of dying, though it must be done! I feel the color lavender, here.
I see no lavender. This is strange

I FEEL SICK AGAIn
this suck this sucks this suckkkkkkkkks

I have nothing goin for me at this point, just end it al!!!!!!!!

a whole week is too long to wait to let my therapis know i'm killinnn myself


get out of here. I'm done.

64,"I'm not always a good judge of how I doing. people tell me not to push myself or put too much on my plate and that my expectations of myself are too high, even when I feel like the task shouldn't be considered as my limit and that I'm barely doing anything. if I can leave the house, I should be fine to go to a meeting, right? I think most days I'm a 2/10 on the fatigue scale, and going to an appointment is a level 6 skill, so I have to mentally prepare for days beforehand. 

there have been times when I really really didn't want to go to appointments, they went shittily, and made me feel even worse afterwards. most of the time my anxiety hijacks my depression and makes me go using nervous energy because I feel guilty. how do you judge your capabilities? how do you know when to tap out?",14Feb2020,1
65,"I’ve been thinking about killing myself for most of my life. I feel like at this point if I don’t do something about it, nothing will ever change and I’m just going to devolve into this numb, unfeeling creature pseudo-satisfied with its own mediocrity. I have a plan to combine drugs this Saturday and end my life. I will be leaving behind friends, parents, a partner, and a stepson. I know I’m supremely selfish. That’s part of why I think they will be better off without me. 

I failed my goal of becoming a musician. I ended up some mediocre music teacher of no consequence. I teach upper middle class kids, but my own art quite honestly sucks. I’ve been a jack of all trades master of none for my whole life. I’m not impressive physically nor mentally and I ultimately see no purpose in continuing on this way. I’m just an altar to being kind of okay on the surface but actually shitty underneath. Most of my life has been abuse, disappointment and neglect and I’ve tried so many times to get better but I don’t think it’s actually possible. 

Anyway, I just wanted to announce it somewhere before I go for it. I’m not scared anymore. I don’t believe in God or heaven or Hell or anything. I mostly just want experience to stop because it’s so regularly and consistently painful. I wish I could be normal and enjoy life like other people do, but I can’t let go of so much. I’m basically fucked from drug use and addiction anyway, so it’s not like the world will miss me or be worse. If anything, my partner can move on to someone worth her time and my stepson can have someone actually capable to look up to.

67,"I used to be a fun outgoing social person up until 3 years ago when my grandad died, I loved him more than anyone in the world and I completely crashed I locked myself away and I lost all my friends I used to play rugby but my grandad came to every match home or away I couldn't bring myself to play without him being there. I just feel so empty and I have absolutely no purpose, I've turned into my worst fear, the only bit of happiness I get in my life is through video games, I always feel like a burden to people and even when I got a little bit better, last year my grandma died and I've gone back to this dark pit that I keep digging deeper, I have absolutely no social life because I just don't want to leave the house unless it's for work. The only way I talk to people is through social media like I've downloaded dating apps just to be able to talk to people, I don't consider myself terrible looking so I get a few matches but because I'm so boring and I don't know how to talk to people any more they quickly lose interest in me.

69,"Been struggling in and off with depression but it was always manageable or rather I knew when I entered the realm and prepared everything for it. 

Right now everything that formerly helped fails and I can feel myself drifting away.

I don't want to talk to my parents, friends or anybody actually because I can't stand their platitudes (I had it even worse!) if we are to talk about anything serious, I know I'm in a bad mood and don't want to spoil theirs.
It's getting harder to keep my apartment tidy, to go to the gym, to keep up with studies, I can't sleep even though my body feels beyond exhausted (because I force myself to the gym and outside to tire myself) still, my mind is absolutely awake. Slept around 6 hours in the last 3 days. 

I have to drag myself to work, a job that I hate, and recently got forced to work extra shifts that make seeing my s.o. (we can only meet at the weekend) harder, we've got only a day left to do something which I need right now to .. lay around and recover because I feel everything is just too much for me.

The usual stuff (sport, meditation, being in nature, reading a book, writing stuff down) isn't working, I don't feel much joy in anything and I'm on the edge of crying all the time.

I've already contacted some therapists but they are booked until the end of march.. I can't even take a day off work.

I just want to cry and sleep. Help please, any advice would be appreciated.",14Feb2020,1
70,"I am so tired, and I have no real motivation, I'm pretty content to sit on the sofa perfecting an ass groove Homer Simpson would be well jelly over..
Just messin around with DnD, tweakin maps and stuff..
I didn't sleep last night, and my eyes are (always tired), and heavy, I can feel moments where I could drift off... Even after being off the phone, bright lights etc. I'm just not switching off..
But here's where I'm a Mary Contrary atm...


But yet I have a small pissed off fire inside of me (oddly positive at myself) don't take it anymore, don't let it take over you like this! 
I have a kick it's ass, that depression ain't gonna own me anymore, that anxiety isn't gonna have me frozen in fear for the idea of leaving the flat..

I wouldn't let a phsycial ailment defeat me, why should I let my own mind be tortured by something that wasn't my fault.

We all want to shun the idea that our mind, precious thoughts are grown, ideas, decisions could be manipulated, could be torn to shreds, that we think if we are open people just think we are lazy, or just not tryin hard enough...

But it is our mind, and did we give consent to that mental illness taking over?

Fuuuu no!

Did we say, hey come on in and bully me 24/7?

Hell no WE DIDN'T!

A physical problem, we'd seek help, regardless of it being a shape of a pill, or physiotherapy etc.

But a mental problem, we don't want to take a pill to change the chemicals in our brain, we don't want to talk to a psychologist or psychiatrist about our inner thoughts.. that's personal, and we aren't sick, it's a mistake, a mistake that takes over us and the shower and us go on a separation, actually looking at ourselves in the bathroom mirror is an enemy..  realising you've been in the same damn clothes for more than 1 day, more than 2..

Would we be like this if we weren't ill? 
Would we want to tear our body apart?
Would we want to cry without something triggering us yet our tears become floods like someone we loved died?

That not wanting to meet up with friends cos ""what's the point? I'll just ruin their night with my mood"" is what we'd normally do?

Fuuuu no.

Its an illness, and some of us do need for short or long periods of time some form of medication to help stabilise the chemicals, that's not weak, that's literally logic.

Just as eating food with lower bad crap will assist in lowering cholesterol...

But it is NOT the cure.

We must accept, we must admit that it's a pie of the puzzle to recovery, and everyone's puzzle once completed shows a different picture, that putting it together in the first place has many techniques to reach the goal..

It's not the be all and end all.

It is not!

And that's okay.

We have to take the gloves off ""no more shit! No more making me feel like I DESERVE to die, hurt myself, be alone...!""

Why should I just let it waltz into my head with free lodging goin about breaking everything I cared about? That sucker needs to be kicked out!

I wouldn't let diabetes destroy my body, I wouldn't let a broken leg stop me from doing what I love, I wouldn't let my eyesight get in the way of me reading and watching my favourite things, to see my loved ones faces clearly..

But we do with mental health, (we do with standard health, eat better but don't exercise...), we get so well and than we halt.

Because the hardest thing is to forgive.
To forgive ourselves for all the terrible stuff be allowed to be played in our heads..
To acknowledge that negative cycles have to be broken... 

Find that pissed off teenage rebel inside ya, get that middle finger in the air and work your ass off getting to where you wanted to be before that intruder decided to squat.

Admit that you'd be a lot damn nicer to yourself if it wasn't there.

Admit that if all the shit you said to yourself was instead said to a loved one, would you let them say that stuff?

If a person comes over to you and just suddenly starts womping your ass over and over again, would you just lie there? Just letting them mess ya about?
Stop others (doctors, friends etc.) running over to help you, protect you?

What if it was happening to someone you cared about?

And why do you react differently between it being YOUR and it being another person? 

Why, why is it okay for you to this this but not someone else?

Why is it okay that if someone calls us ""strong"" we discredit them, but if someone (eso ourselves) says we are a waste of space, we buy into it?

We are strong, there are always some that see it, and are proud of us.
We try, even to just get through the open crack of a door, we try!
So yeah we are bloody strong.

We've been through utter torment, from moments around us and our own thoughts, so hell yes WE ARE STRONG! 

and we have each others backs.

Get that middle finger in the air and prove that nothing rules your life. That it WILL be what would make you happy. That you gotta stay to finish the project...

72,"To get down to the point. I feel like I’m constantly hurting although I’m in a perfect relationship, we’ve just bought a house, doing well in my job but everything inside me is suffocating me. 

For example (my thought right now) -

I’ve been my brothers guarantor for a year now but I’m having to stop doing this as I now have a mortgage. My brother is going mental at me and hasn’t spoke to me in weeks, this has restricted me seeing my baby niece. So he’s not talking to me like a grown up resulting in me sorting it for myself via the landlord. What if he ends up homeless because of me? What if my niece is homeless and they stop me seeing her? What if he ends up topping himself because of me, what if everyone turns against me for what I’ve done. Then this has left me feeling suicidal and I know that if something like this happens I will end up killing myself. I always have thoughts of doing it, the only thing stopping me is are my family and friends. But I’m scared that one day something will happen to my family or I will face sudden despair and guilt that I’ll give up.

I can’t bring myself to go to the doctors but I’m feeling really fucking down. And it sucks because I’m at the best place in my life. Please just help me and give me clarification why the devil is playing on my kind. I create scenarios which make me sick and want to die.",14Feb2020,1

76,"So I'm incredibly bitter towards women. I've been single my entire life when objectively Im not that bad looking but I think the personality detracts hard. Here's what happened today and at previous jobs;

- Today, a girl at work in my department who is quiet, pretty and always polite left a knitted heart on my desk. I rarely speak to her but I thought it was really nice and made me feel good. Looked around 5 minutes later and everyone in our booth has one. I'm seething, and now I get a huge feeling a hate every time I look at her. Which I guess is the opposite effect that was intended.

- at my previous job, I thought I was getting along fine with a girl from work. We were abit flirty for a few weeks. Following that, she kissed another colleuge on a night out. From that, I made a point of not talking to her or looking at her for the 6 months following until I quit. Even when it was well passed and those colleagues weren't seeing each other anymore I just felt hate, lots of hate.

I'll add more later - my 10 min break is about to end - help.",14Feb2020,1
77,"Hey everyone. Don't really know how to start a post like this, so I'll just jump into the backstory.

I'm not the healthiest person, at all. I'm extremely lazy and also don't care that much about my own body (and myself in general). Thankfully, this has gotten better lately and I feel like, maybe in a years' time I could care about myself so much to overcome the laziness and care for my body normally.

I've never regularly exercised and while I actually enjoy being outside whenever I finally am, my laziness but mostly my shyness has stopped me from going outside more than I have to. I don't get along well with my neighbours, my whole family never has, basically they're drunk and racist shits. I don't like being seen by them, but also not by any of the nicer neighbours. I'm also ashamed because, well, my lack of self-care does show on the outside. So yeah, for me to go outside more often, I'd have to take care of the self-care problem first.

Despite all that, I want to be healthy. I want to better myself in general, but right now my focus lies on being more healthy. I love food, both quite healthy food and a lot of unhealthy snacks. But, something that really bugs me is that my tummy shows. I've never been fat in my life, and I'm still not fat now, but I have a tummy. And I hate it. I want it gone. I want to be the absolute skinny girl again. It's not much I'd want to get rid of, but it's *something*. So I've made a plan, easing myself into being a little more healthy step by step. There are two rules for now: a push-up a day, and limiting unhealthy snacks to one little bit a day.

The problem is, I've gotten so fixated on the idea that because I'm at home getting no exercise all day, I have to limit my food intake by a lot, I feel like the line between being absolutely hungry, and not hungry at all, is blurred. I'll sometimes sit here feeling no hunger at all, and a minute later I realise I'm starving. I wanted to listen to my hunger more, not eating more than my stomach tells me it needs, but somehow I fucked that up. I can't tell hunger anymore until I'm extremely hungry. And it's scary, it's really scary.

I think what I want with this post is just some support, maybe some advice at how I could have done things better, but mostly just support.

If you need to know, I'm 16 in a week.",14Feb2020,1
78,"Hi.   
 

I'm here to vent. I don't think I need any advice unless you see something I'm not seeing.   
 

I'm 30 year old single male. I'm not a wizard thankfully, but my love  life have never been rich. I forced myself into a relationship with  married woman, it lasted over a year until I saw an opening and left it  behind.   
 

I know I have problems with finding love. I was only once deeply in  love. I fell in love at the first sight, it was mutual but she got over  it within few days but I didin't. It was six years ago and at this point  I don't know if I still love her, or just an image of her. Or maybe I  don't love her at I'm just using it as an excuse to not go and look for  love anymore.   
 

Dating requires effort, sacrifices, balls. it's stressfull, even  though I'm pretty tough and the level of stress I feel when dating is  probably way lower than averege person's.   
 

Ever since I got a cat in 2015 to be able to show affection to  something and have something to hug my need for love have been greatly  reduced. I want it, but I don't think I need it. I want to be in a  relationship, to date together, have activities and someone to motivate  me to keep going. Someone to cook for, someone to have sex with. That  would be nice, but it's not that important to me anymore. Once or twice a  year I feel like I have to hook up with a girl to not go crazy, then I  get on tinder and usually have no matches or like 1. Sometimes a  conversation with the girl is enough. It's almost like... what I really  need is attention and not sex. A validation that I'm atractive for at  least one girl. Somehow my urge for hookup evaporates after a  conversation like that. Besides, to be honest, masturbation has been  more pleasureable for me than actual sex act. I worry too much, can't  chill out and enjoy it, I feel like I'm constantly judged and I'm  worried if she's having fun. This doesn't happen when I'm going down on a  girl cause that's what I know is my secret weapon. It's the only thing  in the world that I know for sure I'm good at. But as I said, I'm rarely  doing that and I haven't since I broke up with the wife, and that was  over a year ago... ok actually right after the breakup I hooked up with a  girl from tinder, like three weeks later.

So that's where I'm at if we talk about love life. But I didin't even  wanted to tell you that, it just sort of happened once I started  writing. I wanted to talk about a place I'm at right now. So I have a  pretty good job, twice the money I ever had, working 8-4. small trading  company. I have almost no supervision over what I'm doing. That is not  good for me. I like freedom and I hate when people tell me how to do my  job, but 0 supervision is very bad. My division is probably going to be  closed within few months If my score won't improve, I should work on  that looking for new clients, making calls and meeting people. But I  spend my days on reddit and 9gag and work for maybe 30 minutes a day  with the clients I have, who are not enough. I have no will. I'm lazy, I  don't want to do it, I hate to do this part of work. I'm fine with  selling and buying stuff bur with clients we have some kind of  relations, but if it comes to strangers and just calling them asking to  work together, no. i hate it. so i avoid it. I know it's bad but I can't  help it.

I live alone. with my cat. I have no friends, because I don't like  anyone enough to want to spend time with them irl. There's this one  succesfull guy, we worked together in previous company. He is calling me  and trying to get me to go drink a beer with him every week for months.  I always find an excuse. He will probably get tired of me, too. The  only relation I have is with my sister, we meet once a week or once  every two weeks, but she has a 6 year old kid who is very envious of her  mom and we can't talk or do basicly anything until she falls asleep.  then we usually watch a movie.

It got worse recently. I'm trying to lose weight, I' a bit obesse,  not too much but still. Recently... I don't want to speak to anyone. I  come back from work, cook dinner, feed the cat. I put on some random  netflix show and sail the seas in sea of thieves untill 11 pm. that's  all I do. I offen just take my trousers and socks off and go to bed like  this, in the morning put trousers back on and go to work like this. I  don't like to smell bad so before I leave for work I make sure I don't. I  take a full shower or a bath like once a week. It weirds me out when I  write it. you must feel disgusted. As I said, I make sure I don't smell.  I also make sure my hair doesn't look too dirty so no one would know.

Is this hygiene system in place because I don't like to feel cold  when I exit the shower? I don't have a proper warm robe to fight it, I  just but some t shirt on after I'm done, and most of the times If i  shower at evening, I will go to work the next day in that same shirt and  underwear I'd wear to bed.   
 

I don't feel like doing anything. I have cinema subscription so i can  go to any movie for free and I don't do that anymore. I didin't go for  almost two months. I just sit in my apartment. I need to go to the gym  to strenghten my back, cause I have some spine problems and whenever I'm  not sitting or laying down I'm in pain. Guess what, it's been 7 years  and I'm still too lazy to do that.   
 

Sometimes I feel like I'm missing out on life. I probably am. I used  to think I'm creative, I had high hopes and dreams of becoming a movie  director or an actor. I thought I' special and unique. I wrote original  short storries and I thought I'm amazing. Now I see every day people  more interesting than me, just random people making videos on their  cellphones, getting thousands of karma. and I think that I should be  this guy. But I'm not, I didin't come up with this simple and brilliant  idea for a video. I'm not that special, but I still want to be.   
 

I was once in local tv show. It's pretty bad, but it's on tv and  everything. I went through the audition, spoke with director, she was  very surprised I'm not expirienced actor. I made good impression on her.  After the show I got plenty of propositions to keep on apearing in this  show, but I didin't. It was too far from my apartment, I had no car and  the show was very cringey. I should have do that and try to climb the  ladder of fame. I thought I'm cool for refusing this offer and hoped  they will call me for a bigger production. they didin't. 

That's about it. I think I'm at the lowest point right now because  I'm trying to lose weight and it took the only pleasure I looked forward to everyday - eating. I love to cook and eat and now I can't eat as much as I  want and whatever I want.",14Feb2020,1
79,"I'm always worried about the future cause I can't even imagine having a calm life, I always see my parents struggling almost daily. People suggested to only think about tomorrow but that also doesn't work, it makes me think everything I do is useless and has no meaning. Whether it's for relaxing, learning or helping at home with chores. I don't think I even have a passion anymore, I used to love math and science and gaming but nothing really feels good anymore, maybe because I don't have too, IDK, also I feel really lonely, I keep having thoughts about a GF in life and it feels so good but then I remembered that I have nothing like that and doubt I will find someone like that too.

Definitely feel like it's affecting my mental health.

80,"Hello everybody, 

This is my first post on Reddit actually (longtime lurker though). I've come across the mental health subreddit, along with various others, and it has further emphasised to me that I am not alone and others are going through similar stuff that I am. HOWEVER, that doesn't change my circumstances. 

For quite some time, probably around 3-4 years, I've dipped out of suicidal thoughts and general low moods, some of which can last weeks and weeks. Just to clarify I'm 18 now. Whenever my mood would peak again, I'd say/convince myself that I was just feeling a bit sad, and blame it on something going on in my life, like receiving a bad grade at school or argument with my parents etc. 

I really need some advice. Nowadays, I go through spells of feeling great, and spells of feeling worthless. A lot of the time I feel light-headed, and it is honestly the most frustrating thing in the world. I don't know why this happens. On top of this, I feel numb to my emotions a lot of the time. I feel as if I don't love my friends, family or S.O, even though in my head I know I do. 

I get annoyed while hanging around with best friends, it's like I don't want to be there. It feels like my battery is constantly drained. My energy levels are low. Always. I used to be suicidal, but now I don't want to die, but I don't want to live either. 

My friends and family haven't been much help, and that's because I haven't really opened up/they wouldn't understand. I also can't control my emotions. I would always convince myself I could, but I was just choosing to act that way. However I know I really can't control them. I get emotional/cry over little things, such as my parents arguing with me. This never used to happen at all.  I used to sort of love getting shouted at lol.

My S.O often asks if I have anger issues, because when feeling low I can't be bothered with anything or anyone and lash out easily. Then shortly after I feel the utmost guilt and apologise, feeling bad about it for days. 

There is nobody in my immediate family with a history of mental health illnesses/disorders (from my knowledge). Can someone please help?

I slowly feel myself dropping into a low mood. I reckon within a week or two, I'll be depressed and numb again. I can't stop it. 

I need answers. Help.",14Feb2020,1

I keep trying to reach out to people, to tell them I need help and I feel like I'm drowning. I've gone to the hospital, and when that failed, I've called crisis lines. Nobody is LISTENING.

But none of it matters. I'm experiencing it all from behind a closed door in my mind. Life is nothing more than muffled sounds and muted colours. I just want to be normal. I just want to be SANE.

I don’t know how to be intimate with her without dragging her down with me, which is something girls have done to me in the past. It sucks.

Occasionally I'll have a day or so where I'll be super productive and can think straight. Most of them everything is a fog, can't concentrate and I struggle to get anything done.

I work as a software developer in a company that prefers people to be there at 9am. I usually get there at 10am. Sometimes 11am. I struggle to wake up in the morning and get out of bed. It's like my brain physically hurts and my body is just numb. I've been there for 3/4 months and already had people coming talk to me about that. I panicked, I cried, I feel like I'm failing.

I want to be better. I want to wake up feeling rested and calm. I want to tackle the day like every other normal person. I want to feel normal.

Right now, my main struggle is waking up early. But I need to change that. I need to get motivated enough. I need to be calm.

I take xanax and one other anti depressant/stuff for anxiety. This isn't working for me though. I still need to be better. I'm constantly stressed because I'm scared I'll get fired. Where should I start fixing this? I feel like I'm trying so hard just to come to work everyday and do something that I don't have the energy to do more.

Even though I'm going to a subsidized place, it's still pretty pricey if I sum up the total cost.

The only plus point for me to go is because I told my SO that I want to change my behavior and be a less shitty person overall in terms of behavior.

Okay, okay... I (21F) know most people on Reddit aren’t mental healthcare professionals, so I’ll take everything with a grain of salt, but I’ve been to a few psychiatrists and everyone says something different. 

Here’s the deal. When I was 13, I was raped by three guys. For a year or two I was completely okay, like nothing happened, and then I was depressed for a few years, then I went to college and things were mostly fine. 

Here’s where the “mostly” comes in. I’m generally very high functioning, do well in school, have a job, etc., but whenever anything happens to upset the apple cart I lose my mind. And the symptoms are always similar every time. Immediately after the thing happens (in this case, I broke up with a guy I’d been dating a few months because I was tired of him), I feel 100% okay. Then my appetite disappears, and I realize this would be a good time to begin losing weight, so I become fixated on my body. Absolutely fixated. 

On top of that, I don’t require very much sleep and I’m extremely energetic. In the last week and a half, I’ve exercised for at least 1 hour a day, and consumed less than 1000 calories total in the entire 9 days. I haven’t consumed a single calorie in 3 days, and yet I still have energy to run and do gymnastics. 

I’ve lost 50 pounds in the last year though this radical weight loss, and I was at a healthy weight to begin with. I can’t help but think there’s gotta be a word for this, but I don’t think anorexia fits because I’m not underweight and it’s not sustained for more than a few weeks.

I made jokes and acted stupid to make my friends happy because it was the only thing that gave my some sort of joy. I was so emotionally exhausted when I came home from school I lashed out or sat on the couch and watched tv until it was time to sleep.

I'm a computer science student. I've been for the most part learning all courses on my own as I rarely leave the house. Lately I lost all motivation to study and can't even force myself anymore. I've lost my scholarship due to failing many courses.

I've tried to get a part-time job but haven't had any luck with that either.

I blamed my laziness on my depression but recently I realised that I'm just trying to come up with excuses so I can feel a bit better about myself. I'm a lazy piece of shit and I hate myself for it. In fact I hate myself for many reasons and can't even see any good aspects in myself. I just hate my life.

I got a gym membership recently and haven't skipped any sessions (I follow a program), started eating exclusively healthy meals that are devoid of any type of junk etc etc. And yet I still feel like shit and can't bring myself to do anything, let alone study. I've lost all motivation.

I'm so lost; I don't know what to do anymore. I love programming, and my dream is to make games but that is so far fetched right now. I'm taking multiple medications and they don't seem to help me with my motivation issue.

A few common things I share with people are humor and creativity. I love stand up comedies be it any type.
I'm a very diplomatic person in a lot of things except politics. To any other person I may come off as very normal and I have learned to have cognitive behavior around people I don't know involving emotions so it's very difficult for them to know the real me unless I say it to them up front which I have to a few friends of mine.


I'm quite selfish, a pathological liar you could say because I have lied a lot to get what I want. I have manipulated people a lot. I have never till now felt guilty of anything nor remorse. I have often broken laws but nothing major. I feel if there were no rules or laws, I would have openly done something major that would be criminal like murdering people, maybe just for the fuck of it. I'm quite analytical of situations and I'm able to keep my cool in very tense situations.

107,"I've been meaning to rant and just spill out my feelings in Reddit for months now. I haven't managed to post anything though because whenever I'm starting to write something, or I'm in the middle of it, I just think 'what's the point?', 'who cares?', 'you're not special, everybody goes through this' and 'just shut up and suck it up'.

But this week has been especially hard so here it goes. Straight into the text box:

I graduated from a top Russell Group university last June 2019. I actually chose the university because it had an excellent Geography department (second in the world).

I'm from a low-income immigrant family so this was amazing for me and my family. It really was. And despite suggesting subjects with more clear-cut routes such as medicine or law, my family nevertheless wholeheartedly supported my decision to study Geography.

During my studies, I was so sure of everything. So sure of loving Geography and sustainable development. So sure of pursuing urban development—maybe get into research or a consulting role. 

I tried getting 'relevant' work experience but I failed to secure one.

But I was eager to get a role—any role—in sustainable development so I applied to 'irrelevant' roles (though I guess they have transferrable skills). The opportunities I had weren't all bad. In fact, it enabled me to go to other countries (for 1-2 months each) with considerable financial support (as in, at the least, flight tickets and accommodation weren't a worry). They were all related to educational inequality though which is I cause I am also passionate about but, at the time, didn't really want to pursue. I told myself that I wanted to go into urban development. To work with local communities and get their voices heard in the planning of their spaces.

Whatever.

After interning abroad for 3 months and going back to my country of birth to spend the 'ber months', I'm back in the UK. I did apply for the graduate programme while abroad. I got two assessment centres in the end. One offer for a teaching job.

Initially, I wanted to take the teaching job. I just wanted to end my job search. But 4 things stopped me:

1.) Can I really (legitimately) empower kids (like I claimed in my assessment centre) when I can't even achieve the, albeit cloudy, vision I built in my head?

2.) The responses that friends and families give. Not one has just said 'Yay! congrats'. Everybody seemed to squeeze in 'oh, but you don't have to take the first job offer you get' or 'you can do better' and 'how are you progressing with your other applications'?. I feel like I hyped everyone up—that I'm gonna be this person influencing policymakers and fighting for marginalised people the urban Global South (wherever that is anymore). And I'm disappointing them.

3.) It's 4 hours away from home. I'm very close with my family and accepting the job would mean being away for 2 years. I can visit of course, but with the allegedly crazy work-life imbalance of teachers, I don't think it's going to be that straightforward. 

4.) Linking to point 3, the pay. I have a close friend who comes from a similar background but has been sooooo successful in assessment centres (after uni she got 3 offers) with salaries that are waaay above NQT pay range. Am I really not competitive enough for roles like those? Am I not worth roles like those? 

I know I can perform well in a professional context. I've got an offer from one of my internships abroad (because I thought it's time to kickstart my career back in the UK. It's a decision I am now regretting) and academic wise I have a very good work ethic (got a first-class).

I know the world of work is a whole different game.

And maybe it's just not my time.

And probably I just need more experience acing applications and interviews.

But right now I just feel like a fraud. I don't know what I want. 

I'm still applying for jobs in the charity sector (hopefully with an iNGO). But so far, everything has been unsuccessful at the CV/cover letter stage. 

I'm considering applying for a masters in urban development. I'm drafting my personal statement right now. But honestly, I don't have the money. Honestly, right now the path that I wanted to take before just feels like a very middle-class journey right now. And I'm dying so much to start helping my very working-class family right now. 

I feel like one big excuse and I'm trying not to be by just going for different jobs that may possibly lead me to where I want to go (which to be honest I don't know anymore) and I feel like I'm spreading myself thin because of it.

I just really don't know. I feel paralysed. I know it's just my first permanent job. There are loads more later on. I'm just scared that doors might close and I'll regret it. That if I don't apply for a masters programme now and just accept the teaching job, for example, it'll be harder to chase after tutors and professors to write a reference for me.

Life is feeling really overwhelming right now. 

Before I didn't care what people think. I loved learning Geography and that's all that mattered.

But now I'm questioning whether I should pursue it. If it's all worth it. If I'm worth it to these development agencies.

And now, I've been magnifying people's opinions so much.

110,"The way this group of “friends” (honestly I am like acquaintances with most of them) makes me feel so anxious. I’m in my last year of uni and I can’t be myself. I feel that I’m forgotten, irrelevant and not exciting because they all speak to each other but not me. Sometimes we’ll have catch-ups for all 7 of us and not everyone can attend them because of priorities and I avoid them sometimes because I’m not sure if I’m anxious or overthinking. I feel that if I confess to someone that I feel neglected they will say “Yea but you never speak to us, you don’t attend many events, why are you complaining if you don’t reach out?”. UM, I’ve spent money on birthday presents, I’ve sent messages but stopped because no one responds, I congratulate people when they get a job or graduate and sometimes I’ve gone out with them. I feel like they’ll say I feel this way because I keep doing what I’m doing which is not talking and not turning up.

I haven’t left my house to attend any event with people my age since Christmas last year and feel miserableeee. My “friends” want to go bowling to catch up because a friend is flying back to a city for uni in a few days. So everyone is rushing to see her before she leaves. I remember last year when I left to go on exchange and invited everyone, they attended but weren’t ecstatic. I know comparison is the thief of joy but I can’t think properly.

114,"I worry often and about nonsensical things (my partner only dating me for a place to live, my family members deliberately pushing me to a breakdown, that people are embarrassed to be seen with me, etc). I was diagnosed with GAD last year and am seeing psychiatric help again but after some research I’m convinced I don’t have it and don’t want to go when I get the change. My worry isn’t about anything specific like a social phobia or eating disorder, and it causes me to not do things I’d like to and miss school etc BUT if I’m (for example) spending time with my boyfriend in our home I’m not anxious constantly. I go to the mall every day so I’m not alone and that really limits how anxious I get. I can get suddenly hit by anxiety when I’m enjoying myself or distracted which ofc takes away that joy but I’m not unable to be happy, relaxed, calm. Does this sound like something (GAD) I need help with or am I just a worrier?

I have SEVERE anxiety. It affects my daily life and I want to get better. I also have depression, and I’m fairly certain I could also have OCD. I’m literally going insane and I need the help.

120,"this was x posted to another sub, the reason i posted this again is to know if what kind of trauma or disorder i have.

i remember that i was still 10-14 years old that time. this is what happened when my mom reprimanded me. i just tried to voice out my opinion in a calm manner when she was scolding me but she took it as a sign of disrespect and she thought that I was talking back at her when I was just really trying to defend myself without raising my voice. She then got really mad at me and slapped me, very hard that my cheeks started to get red. Then she continued to say that I won’t reach the gates of heaven when it’s armageddon and I will burn and rot in hell for talking back at her which I clearly did not. I was so shocked that she could say that to her own child. After that, she would often say that I would burn in hell every time she is scolding me. She tried to reason out that she was just saying that to help me get to heaven and not rot in hell. But it still didn’t quite sit well with me. There was also a time where she got really upset with something I did that I just stretched out my arm for her to hit it since she said i need it for me to get disciplined. I was expecting her to hit my arm very hard but instead, she SLAPPED me really hard. I was shocked at what she did to me that I cried. I was 13 or something at that time. 

i remembered her face that time. it was full of anger and hatred. i was scared. although sometimes when she say those kind of things and slaps me, she would feel guilty and try to cook me something or give me some food. but she never apologized for it. i remember one time where she offered me some snacks when she slapped me in the face in my early teens. i rejected it and she was mad. in the end, i just accepted it to not anger her anymore.

it’s been a long time since then and im already 24. my mom doesn’t say that to me anymore and she even accepted me when i said that im gay and i’m really thankful for it. our relationship got better since then when i turned into an adult. however, I never forgot about those. so many years have passed and I thought I forgot about all of those until now. I didn’t know that I would still remember those vividly, like it was just yesterday. is this like what they call an “episode” for me? do i have an anxiety disorder or trauma or something like that?

But I don’t see a point in working to pay taxes and die, starting a family that will die from nuclear war or climate change. 

Besides my gf I have nobody. My family hates me and sees me nothing but a criminal bc of my tattoos and the fact that I like to smoke weed and used to sell drugs. My childhood was basically all my family members ganging up on me and insulting me. My little brother bullied me constantly as a kid, my twin constantly belittled me and told me nobody loved me, my dad has tried to fight me so many times and was an alcoholic and abusive when I was younger and told me he wished I wasn’t born, my mom is the worst tho. She is obsessive and delusional. She emotionally abuses me by constantly belittling me and isolating me. She has made up lies about me and told me to kill myself. She even made my dad block me and told me he didn’t want to talk to me when he was happy that I contacted him for the first time in years.

124,"Hey y'all!

I had a question for all of y'all, since I've been lurking a few subreddits because I've had the suspicion that what I'm going through might be borderline. I've been previously diagnosed with bipolar, but on bipolar reddits, they say that since I don't have a lot of the same symptoms or experiences that people usually have, I should get a second opinion. I'm about to ask my psychologist what she thinks.

I wanted to ask, have any of you found that just taking medication 'fixed' everything? Is this an indicator that it's not actually borderline?

Especially in hs, but during my first year of college too, I dealt with feeling empty daily, really bad overeating (at times binging), feeling like the world was against me and all my friends abandoned or forgot me...I'd dissociate a lot (feeling like I'm not a part of the world/my life, like I'm living in a movie). I felt fine being alone. I'd get into these states of intense moods (usually they lasted a period of time: like, for a few months I'd be depressed, then a few months I'd be agitated depressed, then a few weeks I'd be elated, then a few days or weeks I'd be elated-agitated).

I was hospitalized in May 2018 and put on meds, and since then I've been fine. After getting on Latuda, I felt fine. Then, some mixups with other meds (Depakote, etc.) led to me not feeling so fine and going into a month of constant anxiety, flight of thoughts, and paranoia. Then, after that, an 8 months long depression. (But, none of that same emptiness, 'me against the world', or over eating came back). Then, once on an antipsychotic (Abilify), I felt fine. Then, got depressed for a couple of months, and have 3 weeks of intense mood swings and impulses and a lil paranoia, then got on Lamictal and immediately felt fine. No mood swings, no impulses, no paranoia, nothing. I feel...normal.

I should explain that, since getting on some form of medication that's a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic, I've had none of that emptiness, overeating, or feeling like my friends and family hate/forgot me, or rampant dissociation. I rarely feel guilt.

I've been in regular individualized therapy since I was 16, but nothing DBT or CBT like. I literally just got on meds, and everything silenced. Has anyone else gone through this?

(I should add, I've never self-harmed, rarely exhibit reckless behavior, and don't fear or predict abandonment from my friends anymore, since the meds. I don't isolate, do allow myself to express anger and other emotions to friends and family (and obvi my psych), and have become kinder to myself and don't blame myself for everything anymore. I've become less of a perfectionist, and more someone who just wants to be content in life, healthy and whole. I can still be pretty self-critical.

I believe I have a stable sense of self, in that there's a bunch of interests and activities I've liked/loved and wanted to get more involved with since hs (am 22 now) and my characteristics haven't changed, which I've also confirmed with my friends and family. I've known which career field I want to go into for years, and am better fine tuning exactly what that looks like.

In spite of how I felt in my hs and earlier college days, I've always had stable relationships with friends and family especially in the last few years, though how I felt about those relationships used to change (re: feeling like I give them all this love, and they abandon/forget me.) I haven't felt that way at all about my relationships since getting on meds. I haven't had a romantic relationship, so Idk about that part.)",14Feb2020,1
125,"So I guess I should start off with what is going on..  I tend to have a really bad habit of lieing, it was a habit I picked up growing up to protect myself since growing up wasn't a very pleasant experienced with bullying and I grown to pick up some very negative habits I need to break, such as being super closed off and always having the fear of being hurt. Well a few months ago I finally was able to talk with a person who also happened to be someone I had interest in. Things were going well.. We were able to connect, talk, and found that we get along really well. Some time went by and one of my habits kicked in, where I try to avoid talking about my problems and resulting in my going down a train of self pity. Yea I know now its a really bad habit.. and what ended up happening is I made a fake persona of my mother, and used it to talk to this person, both to help him with his problems and it avoid talking about my problems.. and this kept going for a few months.. what was bothering me the most was... I saw what I have done.. I kept lieing to someone who wanted the best for me... only showed me love and kindness and this person treated me like I was apart of his family... and because I kept doing these bad habits of mine of lieing, and using emotions to just avoid talking about my problems.. to avoid facing the music.. I.. I forced myself to just come clean to him... It was one of the hardest things I had to do... because I knew the cost... and it hurts me too because I did love this person.. I loved this person dearly.. and as a result.. this person blocked me from all form of communications we had together... playstation.. xbox.. discord.. facebook.. we had alot going together.. a really good thing going on.. but because I was using lies to tell truths.. and using lies to protect myself.. and using lies to avoid things... I lost that... We go to the same campus and we see each other everyday... and what I am trying to do is take the steps on the right path... because what this person always wanted was for me to be happy.. and for me to face my fears.. to face my problems... and I am trying to do that now... I am trying to understand what I have done... and understand how it made this person feel... I am trying to make amends for what I have done... and I hope.. that I can try to talk it out with this person.. but I don't know... I feel like I should give this person time... alot of time... allow myself to take this time to get better.. to try to break my habits.. to be the friend that this person told me they wanted... and what is going through my mind right now... is alot of self hate.. alot of self doubt.. alot of anger for what I have done... and I been having alot of panic attacks... lately.. when I see this person my body sort of just shuts itself down... and I am basically alone.. I gotten on a waitlist for a therapist.. but  I just feel lost.. I feel like I am walking around in a frozen path naked, with guns pointed at me at all directions.. My question is I guess... is how can I cope.. how can I take the steps to become better.. and how can I not let all of these negative emotions get the best of me...  I really want to make things right with this person because they were such a major influence of positive to me and made me see my problems... made me see what I was doing was wrong... I am calling for help or any form of advice because this is tearing me apart emotionally and I keep having progressively worse and worse panic attacks.. and I am scared that one of these days I'll have a panic attack that I won't wake up from...  Because if something does happen to me.. something that can be fatal and this person found out about it... I don't want to put that worry on that person.. I don't want to scare that person.. because I know that person cares about me...",14Feb2020,1

Unable to deal with any criticism or anything not going right without getting upset.
Constant feeling of impending badness.
Inability to deal with difficult situations .
Being overly affected by small things, causing anger, irritability or crying.
Periods of extreme happiness and productivity where stuff doesn’t seem to bother me.
Loss of rationality

127,"Over the last 5 years i have been fighting with depression, ocd and personality issues. I have seen different psychiatrists and 2 different therapists. My depression really faded away after treatment and i was having some really fun and fulfilling time. Right now i am not depressed at all but i have serious obsessions about social life in general. People around me sometimes make joke about how i like being under the spotlight all the time when i am in a group or how i love to show my body off and flex sometimes but the truth is these people literally ASK me to give biceps poses etc. like they are setting a trap for me and these people are so called my close friends. They saw Tinder on my phone one time and they told me do i ever swipe anyone right. These are the same people who shamed me when i was in love with a girl when i was abroad saying she looks like a guy and i deserve sooo much better etc.( also there have been some people just openly saying i am just narcissistic). This was an example from one of my friend groups but as i will mention further, others group of people tell me different things about me like i have issues but this time it is no narcissism. The general consensus is i am a very odd person like wtf i look normal i go to school i pass exams i go out i go to gym i have hobbies etc. I had 2 very happy long term relationships. I seriously do not understand what is wrong with me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 My first therapy ended my therapist saying that i am completely oki just have high expectetions from society. Now i am currently seeing another therapist and she tells me i have acquired this personality from my parents and we have to work on my obsessions especially on my low social flexibility.

&amp;#x200B;

Now i do not now what to do after recieving these kind of different messages all over my environment according to everyone i am some kind of shit person obsessive narcissistic the list goes on and on,  i do not want to be like that and i can not really understand what i am. I can not comprehend what is going on around me and what is my normal standart. I forgot what kind of a person i am i do not know what to do in social situations. I don't know how to be ""myself"" anymore because of these inputs from therapists others and my own thoughts on my ""self"". I have zero clue and stopped going out for some time, i literally go to school gym and language course and sleep, every week ends like this. I want to create a healthy social life but seems to be impossible with these problems i guess.

I went to therapy and I'm mostly ok now, it is not the same themes at least. But recently, I have noticed a new set of 'themes' emerge. They aren't as bad as the old ones were but I have a suspicion that they are connected to the same personality trait. I almost can't read the news or certain books too much because I know that I'll get a lot of thoughts and doubts and I'll waste hours and it feels pretty bad too. It can ruin a day sometimes, but it is not as major as the 'old' one was. They aren't as related to a particular stimulus, they just hit me at a certain point and poof... there goes my capacity to get stuff done or to enjoy the world around me. I don't know if it is the same thing but either way, it is annoying and I really want it to stop. I have tried engaging with them, telling myself 'No, that's not true and if it is it does not matter.' but that just makes me question 'Am I sure? I don't really know. Maybe I should be doubting this.' and there it goes... a cycle has started. A lot of the stuff is relational, but not really, it can get super random. What should I do to stop it?",14Feb2020,1

Such as Sensory, Mood, and Blood Dysregulation symptoms (Change in taste or smell and ringing ears now and then, feeling overwhelmed, depression, low energy/motivation, and some other stuff.)

His behavior is getting more and more worrying. 
Background: he had a troubled primary school life and had to go to a special school who were trained in violence prevention and able to restrain, he often hit teachers. 
He went to the doctors at that time and tested for all sorts of mental issues. The only thing they came up with was pathological demand avoidance. Which is a fight or flight response to overwhelming situations.
Once in secondary school he improved massively, no longer turned to violence and was behaving fine at school. 
However things have taken a turn for the worst in the last few months. 
He started skipping school, it was just a day or so here and there.. no explanation as to why.. 
Now he is skipping 2-4 days a week. He won’t tell us why. The school haven’t found any bullying issues.. he hasn’t mentioned anything to us.. we started taking his tech (PC, XBOX, phone) off him when he skipped school for a couple of day’s at a time to try and incentivize him to attend.. didn’t work. He got angry at us for doing so. We hid the wires in bedrooms but he would go in and find it then barricade himself in his room. 
A couple of weeks ago it happened, so we took his tech.. he found it,.. we took it back and put locks on our doors. He got angry at us for putting locks on our doors. He skipped 4 days that week. He still would not talk to us.. not tell us why.. 
this week.. he skipped school Wednesday.. I go in home and he is on headset happily chatting away on Xbox like nothing is amiss. I ask him calmly to give me his tech.. He hands it over seeming to understand why it needed to be done. No fuss made, nothing. 
I thanked him for changing the bins and feeding the cats to try and make it less negative.. he didn’t say anything. 
He skipped school again Thursday and again today (Friday)
I come home Thursday and the cleaners have left my bedroom door unlocked, my drawers all lay half open.. he’s been in them. 
I change the lock code.
I come home today and the lock is broken on my door. It was a strong lock. He’s been in but he’s put the tech back after. 
My mum went in his room. He’s curled up in bed with his teddywolf. Not doing anything.. just lying there. She asked what he took. He says he never got in. 

He has spent this entire evening almost laid in his bed doing nothing. He has spent many evenings doing the same. We are worried. We have tried so many times to talk to him. Asked if it’s us, is there something going on at a school? What is he feeling? What is he thinking?
Nothing
He won’t speak to us. He won’t go to the doctors for help. He won’t talk to anyone. We wouldn’t know if he was having dark thoughts because he would not tell us.

We don’t know what to do. He needs help but we can’t get it to him. What can we do?

People say not to punish him but if we leave his tech.. he has more reason to not go to school. 
He broke into my room.. 
he goes through my things when I’m not there
I don’t feel anything is safe anymore 

My mum is terrified that he will go as far as to take his own life and so am I. 
He didn’t have a troubled childhood.. he was raised with love and never wanted for much. My mum raised him as a single mother. There was no conflict that he witnessed, no abuse. He was a baby when my parents divorced.

138,"About 2 years ago I lived in a group home and I was woken up at 6:30 AM by the police telling me I was moving. I was not allowed to know where, I didn't get to bring shoes or a jacket or anything at all, I was barely allowed to pee, I was not allowed to have my phone or make a call, I spent 2h in jail, the entire 6h drive in handcuffs crying and crying and crying.  
And the reason was for being kicked out of my group home and being moved to another one. Neither were ""locked homes"" in any way both optional to live in but when do I ever get to make a choice.

Same thing when I was 13 but then it was living with another family.

Same thing at 15 but without police. People coming to take all my stuff so that I had no choice but to move.

And now I'm about to turn 21 which means I'm too old to live here and every day I expect them to come for me and take me somewhere I don't want to be. Cuff me and throw me in jail for not having a place to stay.

I wouldn't say this got me PTSD but the many years I've been labelled mentally ill has built a lot of trauma that no one seems to get.  
Police arresting me, holding me down, saying they'll break my arm off, tied in a bed at the psych ward, liquid anti-psychotics, the state making plans for me and my life, police men running towards me with giant plastic shields, coming at me with tasers. What everyone else says is the truth if I have a diagnosis. Violence is needed if I am upset, if I disagree, if I show emotion.

I can't trust anyone anymore, every doctor, therapist, police man or woman, person at the state, no one can be trusted. Seeing police cars drive by makes me tense and my friends who have been through the shit I have feels the same and we warn each other when we see them so we're both aware.

And I can probably never feel safe again. Never not have to worry about someone getting involved in my life and taking control and deciding what's best for me and I know I sound severely mentally ill from everything that has been done to me and everyone of these people treat me as if I am but I don't think anyone fights as hard as me I see people just give up on standing against them because it's so tiring.

I see myself 5 years from now with a full time job and my own apartment still worrying about the police knocking down my door and taking me away from my life, from my job, from my family, from my friends. Just when everything is going great.

I remember being in that car with cuffs on, everyone just ignoring me, and I was asking about my cat and where he was and the man next to me saying ""who's that ? your boyfriend ?"" as if he thought it was funny. no dumbass its my cat who i may never see again because some idiot decided that this 18 year old should not be allowed to be informed about anything and should be put under a law which makes me not have a say in anything at all until im at my new home.

I'm so collected and I'm so calm compared to how angry I'm supposed to be. I'm sitting there in meetings saying it like it is instead of throwing my chair at them as I feel I should be doing.

I guess the most hurtful is that I've always been all alone. I've never even had a therapist to discuss any of what has happened with or anything that might happen and anything that is currently happening. I've always been by myself dealing with everything, constantly worrying and constantly afraid.",14Feb2020,1

First, I have diagnosed add from when I was younger and have a hard time focusing and prioritizing things. This hasn't been much of a problem, but I now have a job with almost zero direct supervision or guidance. I have basically been told to make sure the thing I work with safe, and passes inspections and doesn't get complained about. Not a problem right, wrong. I know there are more things I could and need to be doing but can't focus on them unless something is to the non-functional point of broken or unsafe. And I still get distracted during that to make it take 2-3 times longer to fix something than it should.

Secondly I work a very inconsistent schedule, which has led to sleep problems and some depression symptoms. I will work days all week, but get woken up at midnight on a random night to work for a few hours, and have to go in very early one day a week. 

Third, I have anger issues in that I am easily frustrated with my family or things not being as easy as I think they should be.

I kinda want to see a mental health professional that can help me with these issues, but don't know what type to see, counselor, therapist, psychologist, psychiatrist. I don't want to go overboard and see someone who is over qualified for my problems or someone who is not trained to deal with them.

141,"So, I won’t go into detail, but let’s just say that people yelling at me or being confrontational with me, is very triggering of past abuse I’ve suffered.

And, I always struggle with how to stand up for myself because I don’t want to get all worked up and stressed, but I also don’t want to feel like I just took it like a doormat. 

Today I had a particularly bad encounter with a woman on the subway. I live in NY, and the hallways leading down to the subway are rather narrow, just wide enough for the width of like 2 and half people, maybe three people. 

This woman was standing right in the middle of the pathway, talking to someone, so they were blocking like 2/3s of the space. And, she was facing my direction, so she could easily see and hear me coming. 

As I got close to her, I expected her to move over a bit so I could get by, but she didn’t, probably wrapped up in her conversation. So like any New Yorker, I just scooted by her the best I could as I was walking, and brushed by her a bit. 

I didn’t body slam her, or stick my elbow out to smack her like some people do to be dicks when people are in their way. 

I only made light contact with her, which was inevitable because she was being inconsiderate about where she was standing. And then as I’m already several feet from her heading down the staircase, I hear her yelling really aggressively at me something along the lines of “of don’t fucking bump me, say fucking excuse me fucking bitch”. 

Which besides the superfluous use of the f word, really pissed me off, because I felt like it was unfair verbal abuse that I didn’t deserve. 

I just kept walking because I had somewhere to be, and I didn’t feel like dealing with getting into it. But these kinds of interactions always make me feel really angry and triggered. 

This city is crazy which I’ve accepted, but I feel like I’m always getting screamed at by strangers for stupid things, and I never know how to deal with it. Do I need to start acting as crazy and angry as they are back for them to back down? Because I don’t know if I want to be that person, or if I even could be.",14Feb2020,1

Hi ladies, this will be a bit of a long post explaining my circumstances. I am 25 years old, healthy, and just found myself pregnant at 6.5 weeks (or further possibly, I would have to wait to get another ultra sound to confirm). I got pregnant on the copper IUD which had a failure rate of .8%. I really want to be able to keep my child however I’m facing a few obstacles that I don’t know how to deal with. I’m turning 26 before the expected due date so I would be coming off of my mom’s insurance. Even with my mom‘s insurance maternity is not included so I would have to pay for every office visit unless I can use medical or something like that? I know there is affordable/free prenatal care in my area that works with medi cal. I work part time and I don’t have health insurance through my work. My partner and I currently live in the Santa Barbara family student housing because he is a student at UCSB. He’s graduating in May of this month so we have to move in May. We’re in a really difficult financial situation right now where we live paycheck to paycheck and basically survive off of his veteran marine disability benefits and financial aid. We are not sure where we are going to be moving, we both have some debt, we don’t have a specific place that we planning to move to yet. I’m in the process of getting an online remote job with full medical benefits and I have a few interviews lined up and I apply for jobs daily. I’m facing extreme negative backlash from my partner and both of our families because they’re nervous however they’re all supportive of my choice. For moral reasons I don’t feel comfortable ending things without knowing all my options and I feel really negative surrounded by everyone’s opinion that we will ruin our financial lives. Is there any hope? I would really love to hear if anyone has been in a situation like this, how are you made it work, what you wish you had known, and anything else that may help.

Edit: I am only looking for advice, resources, and how you made it work if you were in this situation and you kept your child.

I have worked MANY jobs mostly all labor, I worked at UPS which had no actual opprotunity for me further than just breaking my back unloading trucks (the list for ""truck drivers"" was ridiculousy full), I worked at a landscaping company that didn't keep people for more than a year and that was a fact I don't know the reasoning but the longest ""worker"" that had been there had only been there 7 months and said the rest of the people that he got hired with got fired, the rest were people that had worked 20 years + and were supervisors for that company. I am currently just fucking lost with what I need to do, I have worked and worked but it feels like no job is actually going to give me a career opprotunity or something to rely on for a long-term. I WANT TO MOVE OUT I WANT A NEW CAR I WANT ALL THIS SHIT but what the fuck do you do?? just work and get fired over and over again until you die??

147,"50 year old male. Physically active. Gym. Avid golfer. Eat super healthy. No pre-existing conditions.  


Metal Health History:

Sexually abused by a social worker as a child. Didn't think it affected me, but now I'm less convinced of that.  
Chronic Social Binge drinker.  
Nasty divorce 3 years ago. Probably have PTSD based on what docs told me.  
Depressed for two years. Getting better now.  
Lack confidence and self esteem despite being successful and a 140 IQ.

The Physical Problem:

I have this ongoing sensation of low blood sugar, and ""electrified brain"", feeling like ""toxic"" all the time. I feel like I'm going to pass out at all times. Sometimes its worse than others, like around 8pm at night, it gets bad. I have been super bloated with air for 3 years, and I took a hydrogen/methane breath test, and the hydrogen was through the roof, so they told me SIBO. I was explained that the HPA Axis is whats making me sick.

The Testing:

I've had the whole battery of tests done. Blood, urine, stool, neurotransmitters, everything. I was told I have general anxiety disorder, and my response to that is ""of course I do, I'm sick and no one knows why"". I'm in constant fight or flight, and there seems to be some relation to carbohydrates/sugar. When I eat them, it makes me feel better for several hours. My blood sugar has been tested and studied like 4 different times over the last year, and its always perfect. My blood pressure and heart rate are that of a triathlete, perfect. Resting at 62bpm, and 100/65. I even got a home testing kit, and every time I test it, its dead on perfect for where it should be. I've had more panels that a lab rat. The only thing that I had on my tests was slightly elevated BUN/Creatine Ratio at 25.6:1, Bilirubin-Total at 1.7mg/dl, ALT 50U/L, BUN at 23mg/dl. I was told this was likely dehydration, and to drink more water. Cholesterol and lipids are beautiful, no issues there.

Some BackStory:

I got divorced 3 years ago, and it was incredibly traumatic. I was depressed for well over 2 years, and I had a script for .25 Klonopin, that I would take here and there, when I would feel a panic attack. I never took it for more than 10 days, and I stopped that permanently 3 weeks ago, because OMG the withdrawal from even that tiny amount was awful. I'll never take it again. I was also a fairly successful binge drinker during the divorce aftermath, but I've since also sworn off alcohol. Its been 2 weeks for that too.

I was tracking with MyFitnessPal for electrolytes, and for Arizona, I had low sodium and potassium intake, so I'm working on getting more electrolytes too.

I guess my question is in relation to the mind making the body sick. I believe I have PTSD from the betrayal of my wife. I was literally bedridden for months at a time. Maybe I need to see a CBT therapist or something. I was told I have HPA Axis issues with my gut and brain, and my hormones are not balanced, thus the crazy bloating and feedback loop to the brain.

I don't know what input you can provide, but I'm getting desperate. I'm nearly unable to go out and do normal things because my doctor told me to cut carbohydrates and I'm on some diet called SCD Diet. Pretty much it's Keto, but you can have fruit.

I was loved there and even promoted.  Probably could have been a good career for me in a few more years.  Thing is I kept feeling stressed out and even resentful of the job.  I was mentally and physically drained.  I took another job that was closer to home with less responsibility and close enough pay that I would be fine.  My thought was my overwhelming negative thoughts and lack of energy were due to my old job and a change is what was needed. I'm thinking I was wrong.

I don't make rash decisions and have always been very careful with choices I make in my life.  My marriage is happy and we are financially ok.  But I took this new job and my wife felt being closer to home would be better.  My negative thoughts have magnified.  It is less work overall then my old job but I feel even more drained.  I do not talk about this with anyone, this is the first time I'm even putting it out here because I think I need to do something before it gets worse.  I feel like I'm sinking I always was a push through the bad to get to the good kind of person. But this last year or so I just don't want to do anything.  I want to stay home and just lay down.  No matter how much sleep I get I feel like it is never enough.  Some darker thoughts have started to show up like maybe I should just check out or whats the point this will all go to hell soon.  That said I will feel this way but put up an act to seem ok.  It's just hard because I feel like I'm wearing a costume and what people are seeing is not even me. I've looked into somethings myself and I found out about high functioning depression which does seem to line up mostly.

What scares me is mental illness is rampant in my family.  My mother is bipolar schizophrenic as is my aunt.  Both have made attempts at suicide.  A few years ago my uncle did kill himself and no one knew he was going through anything.  I heard that my grandmother was diagnosed with severe depression and  I only found out after my uncle that my great grandfather had killed himself as well.  I am starting to get older (early 30's) and I think I've just been able to push the thoughts and negativity down but it's getting harder.  I am not saying I am suicidal but I'm worried if I don't be proactive about this it could get worse or even start affecting my marriage.  

I guess I'm asking is what do I do? I don't really know much about doctors and such.  Do I talk to my general doctor or should I call a psychiatrist?",14Feb2020,1

People have told me that I am not going after what I want, that I’m afraid, that I’m not living my life. I think that a reason for this is because I’m becoming a... well. A “normie” for lack of a better world.

I know there are things about me I ought to change, and that I have hurt people in the past. But I don’t quite know how to make amends, or how to even feel properly sorry for what I’ve done. It feels like every day I decide not to change, I’m losing opportunities and that one day I just won’t even care that I have these qualities that hurt myself and other people.

I’m afraid that one day I won’t have a proper conscience, I guess. That I won’t even recognize that I’ve done something wrong. I’m generally pretty happy in day to day life, but this is a conversation that is always going in the back of my mind. So every decision I make feels very high stakes, and that if I make the wrong decision I will draw closer to becoming just an awful, uncompassionate and unintelligent person.

The change can happen the other way around too, and this kind of change happened yesterday. In this situation I was dreading to go to a party that I knew one of my ex friends was attending. I got there, saw her and immediately my mood was ruined as I remembered the many times she had wronged me. I mostly ignored her, but I still felt the hate I have towards her. After the party was over, I was talking with another friend who I haven't seen in about a year, and my ex friend came up to us. And she greeted me. At that moment, all of the hate I had towards her disappeared and instead turned to the urge to reconcile with her.

This has been happening for a long time already. There's rarely any kind of in-between in my opinions, it's nearly always either love or hate. And the opinion changes immediately when I feel either wronged or respected by the person. So, what's wrong with me? I've tried to explain this to my therapist, but I can't really put this feeling into words. I feel like I couldn't explain it here either. But I hope someone replies and knows what's going on with me (and maybe someone else as well, who knows :) )",14Feb2020,1
159,"I feel so lonely. For the first time I’ve really tried to open up to people about how much I’m struggling with my mental health. Over the past few months, I’ve been very triggered by some things, and I have really struggled to pick myself up.

Some of my friends are amazing and supportive and try to check on me. But most have dropped off the face of the planet after I told them that I’m really struggling. 

I just don’t get out of bed most days. My work is lenient but I haven’t been in a week. I work from home when I can, but I know I’m not being productive. 

My therapist is in the hospital with her own health issues right now. I have two friends here who are supportive but they’re busy with their own lives, and anyways I know they can’t fix me.

I don’t understand why I’m struggling this badly NOW. I’ve been through so much worse, but for some reason I’ve just lost my will to live. I’d never ever take my own life, because my parents don’t deserve that. But wishing that I could is no way to get by. 

Just needed to vent for a second. I’m just tired of feeling pointless.",14Feb2020,1
160,"So I don’t wanna get to into the weeds with this but I’ve struggled with stress and anxiety my whole life. Tried medicine for it, couldn’t make myself continue it so I have just learned over the last few years how to deal with it on my own.

My wife has had a bout of depression and anxiety, bad enough that we ended up in the ER with her having suicidal thoughts, she’s been on medicine for it but still has very down days. Today was one of those days.

On top of all this, I’ve been dealing with financial stress, doubting my capabilities as a dad, and hating being away from everything while I’m working 60 hours a week.

**WHERE IS THE ISSUE?!***
Well, Today has been an overall very BAD day. I got to work and have been extremely testy, and felt myself reaching my anxiety ramping up point and i started breathing exercises. After a few minutes of doing this I felt very very peaceful, almost serene for a minute, very calm. But for whatever reason my vision was very dark, almost like my eyes were kinda peeled shut. I felt this EXTREMELY DARK/ALMOST “EVIL” feeling take over my whole being for a couple seconds. It legitimately scared the shit out of me and I panicked, threw my headphones down and walked away for a minute.

I don’t know what the hell that was, I’ve had bad anxiety to the point of tears before but I legitimately felt terrified for a few seconds. 

Anyone have any idea about what I’m describing?",14Feb2020,1

162,"hi, just discovered this subreddit cause i was looking for some place to share this specific and recurrent feeling that i have, and see if anyone experiences this too.

once in a while i feel that i dont want to leave my home, and feel the urge to cancel everything i programmed for the day. this sounds really common, but what i'm struggling with is that everytime this happens i feel like the right thing to do is the opposite of what i'm feeling (recluding myself), so i don't let it take me over, but simultaneously, as a response to the rational thinking, the feeling grows and paralyses me.
this way, most of the times i just let myself stay at home, but end up really anxious about it.

i hope i explained it well enough. it's hard to describe such a confusing feeling, specially in a foreign language. do any of you experience something similar? i'd love to read some perspective on it.

thanks!",14Feb2020,1
163,"when im at school i can function like a normal human being without any problems, but when i am alone everything goes downhill. i have episodes where i suddenly get violent and start hurting myself, for example cutting and punching myself and sometimes after that i break down and start sobbing for a good ten minutes or so. the scariest part though is that when i cry there is no feeling, only tears. if i try to, i can stop it and go straight from an ugly cry to a straight face. i dont know what the cause could be because i have a very comfortable and rather stress free life. i have been dealing with this for about six months now, it was very sudden.",14Feb2020,1
164,"Good evening, my name's Thom.
My main issues with mental health, recently, is that I just don't feel that anything is enough. I used to work 50 plus hours a week as a chef and eventually after a mental breakdown I reduced my hours. I feel much better in terms of reduced chances of burnout, but I still feel like there's a lot missing. Most people in my position would be proud of themselves, and in a way, I am.
I'm 28, I currently own a house, (second one that I've bought but I sold the first and moved on) a boyfriend that loves me, I was rising in my career, but I took a step down because I just couldn't cope with the stress.
I have GAD and OCD as well as a social anxiety disorder so I feel like I can't really connect too much with people, I have difficulty with physical interaction except with my boyfriend and people laugh about my ""quirks"" as they call them or become annoyed be aude they don't understand my disorders. I always feel alone, and I'm okay with that. The hardest thing for me is that I've had to fight for everything I've got in my life and I never really experienced love until I found my boyfriend who I've been with for almost 2 years now. I just don't want to live my life for the sake of living my life. I want it to mean something and do something worthwhile, but part of me thinks ""what's the point in trying? Nobody takes any notice"". People will say I'm being stupid... But am I really?",14Feb2020,1

Im diagnosed with depression and anxiety for now. Not to sound pessimistic but thaths the truth. I just fall apart with every step. I hate my guts with everything i have. First of all im not poor, i go to college, i have friends and i have an only mother that cares for me. Isnt that sad i feel this way? I feel stupid even being on this page asking for anything. I somehow think this is the curse of our geneeation.. Theres so much to talk about with kids my age. Trust me i know. Ive been here a long time.

The last few months i am got the feeling that im losing control over my own mind. Just something in my mind is acting crazy, and i just stopped to care about a lot of stuff. Things dont seem normal anymore and i start to hate more and more things. Because of that  im less happy all the time, and it scares me more and more. 
If been trying to figure out what is happening, but i dont see anything why it would happen. I mean, im doing good on school(studying physics) and my family is good. Idont have a lot friends, only some close ones.

But i dobt know what it is, and it is starting to scare me and freak me out. Does anybody have some tips for me on what i should do, or shouldnt, because it is getting more and more crazy here",14Feb2020,1
168,"Hello  
I have a friend that suffers but I don't know what to do to help. He just moved out of his parents house at 29 years old and has never had a steady job. for the last 10 years he has gotten quite active in drinking. He does not drink much in the weekdays, but usually start early and drink through the Saturdays. The last time I saw him drink was at a party, and he was then completely smashed at 19.00.  
I know something is wrong, and I know something needs to be done but I don't know how to approach it. My explaining might not be too good but I know he does need some kind of help. I'm sure he will not seek professional help on his own and he will probably not listen if I say it straight out.",14Feb2020,1

I guess would be the word for it (real life people, not celebrities- just people I talk to online sometimes or irl), and I want them to like me SOO bad.

I want people to like me. I want them to think highly of me, I want to be seen a certain way (as cool for ex), and if I'm disliked or if I'm viewed as a way I don't want to be viewed, my self esteem gets hit. I want to not give a shit, but idk how.

172,"My mom has always had some mental health issues. A little background on our relationship, I'm 25, 2 years ago I was going through some mental health issues in the city I lived in and decided I needed a fresh start, she wanted me to move to where she lived and I did. I moved into her place with intentions to get apartment once I settled in, but two natural disasters later her house got fucked, I lost my job. We started to recover, I got a new job (a better one) re enrolled in school, and felt like my mental health was getting a bit better. But we're still living in a house that is pretty fucked up, and this isn't uncommon for where we live. The process of getting rebuilt is slow. We talk almost everyday. Sometimes small talk, sometimes sit down and talk in the dining room. Lately though, shes just unloading all of her problems on me. Everyday I have to hear about how powerless, how hopeless, how tired she feels. Today I had a long day, it rained and thundered all day and that triggers anxiety attacks and makes me irritable. (she knows this) We were talking today, she was unloading her problems and I dont know why but I said ""Thats stupid, stop worrying about it"" 

I feel really bad for being so callous about her problems, but its almost like her negativity and unloading of problems on me is starting to make my depression worse. Every time we talk I just leave feeling emotionally drained. All i've been doing lately is sleeping, working, and smoking tons of weed. I just cant handle someone elses problems when I can hardly get excited or feel good about anything myself.",14Feb2020,1

I'm 18 and I'm starting college but I'm living home with my parents and I was born in a Asian household who are the main cause of my mental health problems. I was always viewed as a trophy or a child they could brag about to there friends. They never once hugged me I remember or shown actual affection for me and scream at me for petty things all the time.

I want to move out but I make only 800 a month and it will be two years until I finish my degree and find a stable job.

""Don't you know someone who could help you or lend you a few bucks""

I fucking don't, I don't have help, I don't have a support system or network. I don't have a supportive family or helpful friends...

It's so fucking frustrating and it gets me depressed AF knowing even these basics I can't turn to anyone I know for anything..
