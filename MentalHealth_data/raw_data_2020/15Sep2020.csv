0,"I was diagnosed today. With bipolar disorder, and PTSD
I always knew something was wrong with me. I was too emotional, too from 0-100 too..crazy. 
I ruined my mom's life with how awful I was as a kid,
 i ruined relationships.
 I have no clue why my husband stays with me. 

My parents saying I never had a thick skin, I don't take criticism well, I'm too emotional, I'm whiny just like my dad, I'm so annoying just like my dad ect.
It basically affected my childhood.

 Started cutting at 12, self destruction behavior at 8. I haven't stopped cutting. My cutting hurt my mom so much
When she found out I did it, she kept saying how I could so that to her. I hurt her so fucking much. 
Now I do it to punish myself for everything I ever did to her.
My family doesn't talk to me either. I don't want to be around me either, but I don't have a choice. 

I also found out, that it's a lifetime deal. I will be stuck with this my entire life.

I don't deserve my kids or my husband. I will just ruin their life too.",15Sep2020,1

2,"I'm still waiting for that phone call: ""This is the Chief of Psychiatry calling from ""XYZ"" Hospital, with regard to M.A.S. I would like to speak to you to learn more about her mental health history. Please call me at......""  


Initials don't violate HIPPA, and Ms. S. should have been admitted to a Psychiatric hospital years ago! There are at least a half dozen people who know just how mentally ill this woman is, who have known her for forty years or more. I have the hardest time understanding why just ONE of them hasn't taken steps to have her committed.  


One visit by the Police to her home, would be all it would take for transport to a local Psychiatric Hospital. Once a team of Psychiatrists evaluated her, a determination for long-term admission would be made. If it took 40 years for her to get as bad as she is, it will take at least two years in a Psychiatric Hospital, to try to undo the damage to her brain.  


People are told that if they ""see something,"" they should ""say something."" Her Landlords see plenty, and say nothing. So do close friends from childhood, and co-workers she's had for a dozen years or more, and her cousins. People who see what the inside of her home and car look like, people who know about her reputation as being ""crazy."" SO many people know how much this woman needs extensive Psychiatric help, yet not ONE is willing to help.  


I'd like to think that she was scooped up months ago and shuttled over to a Mental Hospital, or by some miracle, she ducked in quietly during the COVID lockdown. Maybe the same people who keep in contact with me since I've left the area, were told not to tell me, because she doesn't want me to know that she's in a mental hospital. Even though nobody knows more about her than I do, I'd much rather it be like that, than have another month go by with nothing done. This woman is getting worse and worse, heading towards a very tragic end, if no one intervenes.  


I've seen a lot of comments in this sub, about how people around them know they are struggling with mental illness, yet they don't seem to care and obviously, don't do anything to help. In my opinion, there should be a law against that. Failing to act should be criminalized, because leaving people to languish on their own with a mental illness, now that's criminal!",15Sep2020,1

8,"For most of my life I've always had a problem with overthinking things but for the past year or so it's gotten very bad. I hang out with my friends pretty regularly but for the past year or so every time I go out with them or we do anything at all, the next day I am filled with overwhelming anxiety. Most nights I go out and I feel no stress of any kind when I'm with people, I actually usually have a great time and love every second of it. But every morning after I can stop thinking about how I shouldn't have done certain things or how my friends probably hate me. Then I spend the whole day feeling like shit and hating myself. This has gotten so bad to the point where I just get so angry with myself and I don't want to hang out with people every again. But once I do eventually hang out with them again I feel completely fine. What can I do to stop feeling this way, I hate it because I can't even cherish all the fun I had on these nights out because I can't stop thinking about what I did even tho I didn't even do anything wrong.",15Sep2020,1
9,"I had my feelings summarized perfectly then accidentally deleted the paragraph, so I'm going to be spitballing I guess.

I feel depressed and I don't know why. I was a toddler when I first noticed it was a struggle keeping my emotions in check. whenever I was angry I'd slam my head against walls, whenever I was sad I'd tear at my skin with my nails, and while that's generally gotten better over the years I still do these things impulsively. my mood shifts frequently without reason.

 I'll be having a good day time when all of the sudden my vision dampers and fades, leaving the empty sensation of a void in my chest area. my thoughts are then clouded with, what feels like in the moment, the most horrid existential dread I'd ever come across. I don't fear death much. I suffer from occasional bouts of suicidal thoughts, and in those moments I am afraid, and sometimes I find myself wishing I was blissfully religious so that maybe I wouldn't dread existence as much.

I love being alive; I love the people, I love the interactions that come with the people, and I love just the sheer feeling of existing, but at the same time I have a deep sadness that really never goes away. I don't understand why I'm depressed and why I feel so empty every second of my life. the weird part is that, even when I'm morbidly depressed, I can smile and be genuinely happy at the same time. It's extremely hard to explain. sometimes when I think about killing myself I can't help but crack a smile, and it feels... edgy as hell.

 the internet makes me feel insignificant. on every social media site I go to there are people joking about wanting to kill themselves, wanting to die, being depressed, cutting themselves, and to be honest it makes me want to bottle up all my emotions just to keep from acting like one of those tweens that uses depression as a way to garner popularity online. I'm 17 y/o and all of my friends are suicidal apparently. I don't really have any way to vent outside of reddit. bothering people that have suicidal tendencies with your own suicidal tendencies doesn't seem like a good thing to do, I guess, so I've been putting on a fake smile.

don't get me wrong, my friends make me \*\*genuinely happy\*\*, but again even while I'm feeling enjoyment/happiness/pleasure, there's that constant contempt in the back of my head that keeps me from 100% enjoying anything, and as soon as a pleasant conversation with friends stops, or as soon as I stop occupying my mind, I feel fucking unbearable sadness/grief in which I've only really been able to numb with vodka, cutting myself and sleeping. I am 17 y/o and I've never been genuinely happy in my life. I feel like I'm being controlled by my conditions/mental health.

there was a time when I was vulnerable to my mom for the first time in years, and I ended up venting to her about these problems. she made it worse. she took it as a way to project her religion onto me, albeit I guess she didn't know I stopped believing in a god a few years prior. ""Do you want to go see my therapist? She's great, I think she'll really help you out."" she said to me, in which I agreed; I thought it would help.

I went to this therapist. it turns out she was heavily religious, wasn't a professional, was heavily biased, heavily emotional, and all the things that I least expected out of a therapist. she lived on a farm and brought me out to see her horses, and then told me a story about how they had been abused and rescued, and how talking to the horses helped calm them down. this therapist thought I had anxiety, and I don't. I wanted a safe space to talk about my issues with a professional that wasn't obligated to talk to anyone about my personal shit, and instead I was sent to a god-fearing 60 y/o farmer that made me do all of her chores while preaching to me about god.

I have no issues with religion, none at all, but this seriously made me feel worse, so I bailed after a few sessions. my mom called and said she was picking me up to go to therapy, so I said I didn't want to go. ""You have to go, you've only been for a few sessions of course it hasn't worked yet, honey..."", ""I think she'll really help you, she's helped me a lot."" are some of the things she kept telling me over the phone, basically begging me to go. I said no and held my ground because she'd already guilt tripped me into 2 sessions previously... and then she starts crying, says ""Fine!"", and hangs up.

she wanted me to apologize to the therapist and gave me the woman's number, and I never did it. I don't enjoy when people say they care about me and then force me into things that make me feel worse about myself, especially the guilt tripping. overall I don't have many people to go to, I basically sit in my room most of the day now and cut myself. nobody on reddit is my friend, nobody online can be a genuine person through anonymity, and the internet is always going to be a toxic cesspool, so I don't really have many options when it comes to self-help. I guess It's hard to give a shit about people when you can't see their face and don't even live in their state.

TL;DR:      I am a 17 y/o with asperger's. no car, no license, all my friends feel like shallow imitations of people, my family doesn't understand my condition or what I need to get better, and neither do I. I'm posting on reddit to try and feel at least a bit better, but I know nobody I care about and nobody that cares about me will see this, so what's the point. I'm getting closer and closer to killing myself, and for once I think that might be alright because I've tried all I can at this point and I don't see myself getting any better; if there's a hell I hope I go there. I deserve it for wasting my life.",15Sep2020,1

Which leads to me feeling guilty and more anxious since I’m wasting food, but I can’t bring myself to eat. Besides, just eating in front of anyone outside family makes me nervous in general anyway. Anywho, after not eating, I then stress more about the fact that my breath might stink because of the lack of food since I don’t eat breakfast either. I tend to drink more water because of that, and because it feels like I have a dry mouth a lot.

26,"Hello, I am at a point in my life where I feel as if I’m a failure and am destined to stay as one.  As some background, I had a very rough and troubling childhood and adolescence.  When I was around 9 or 10 my mother became very ill suddenly.  We later found out it was a rare form of Lyme disease with not much in the way of treatments or a cure.  As time went by it got to the point where she couldn’t walk, eat, or do most things by herself.  Because of this, my mother went off to live with her sister and my father took care of me and my brother.  When I was 12 my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and I was his main caretaker for the months from his diagnosis to his death.  For the next few years my mother lived with me and my brother with my aunt coming daily to help her while we were at school until my mother died last July.  So now I’m 19, failing miserably at college, and I don’t know what to do.  I’ve always had bad anxiety problems starting with a long traumatic episode when I was around 7.  And every day the anxiety gets so bad that even the thought of some minor bad thing happening is enough to make my mind race and leaves me forcing myself to hold back vomit.  I also have pretty bad OCD that’s gradually been getting worse since I was diagnosed a few years ago.  At its worst it might take me a half hour before I’m comfortable going through a door way, or hours and hours of repeating a task before I can finally fall asleep at 10am.  And compounding all of this is the feeling of enormous guilt I have for failing my family.  I’ve always been told how much they expect of me academically and career wise and I’ve been a complete let down in that regard.  I went of to university right after high school and ended up dropping out half way through the semester.  I’m currently taking online classes at my community college but I’m still failing.  I just don’t think I’m ready for it yet.  But my family always reminds me how disappointed they will be if I don’t succeed in college and they tell me how disappointed my parents would be if they were still alive, and that really really hurts.  So now I just don’t know what to think.  Is it fair to say that because of my mental state I’m not ready for college right now?  Or am I just being a selfish brat.",15Sep2020,1

My mom is a sweet lady and I know she really tries to be a good person, but the way she was brought up doesn't always allow for that. As an adult (twenties), I'v realized that she has a difficult time seeing other people's perspectives? I don't really know how to phrase it but she can be a bit narcissistic I guess. I don't know.

For example, I just had an occasion that made me really irritated at her and I feel guilty about what I said and how I acted. Her friend's kid, Liam, is having his 13th birthday. My mom loves books and she got him a book about whales for his last birthday. She never heard if he read it or not but she got him another book for this upcoming birthday. She showed me the book and told me about how her friend said he isn't a big reader, so she got a book that has graphic novel and reading parts. This kind of annoyed me because I don't understand why she's trying to get this kid books if they aren't one of his favorite things. The friend said he likes Pokemon cards so my mom also said she's going to get him pokemon cards. 

This is where I feel like I messed up. I said she shouldn't get him more books in the future if he doesn't read this one. Then she sorta got offended and I just said if he isn't a big reader don't get him books. And then she asked if I still had my Pokemon cards (I used to have 800) and I looked for them and I don't because she threw them away. Then I mentioned how I asked her not to throw them away and she did and she pretty much just left to go run errands then.

I feel like I didn't need to judge her about her gift for her friend's kid and I did anyway and I feel guilty about it. I know she just loves books and that's how she relates to people and connects with them and she tried to get something the kid would like and I made her feel poorly for it. I just felt triggered about my Pokemon cards and the fact I don't like that she's getting him something she likes rather than she likes (or at least that's how I perceived it). 

I know my mom isn't good at seeing other people's perspectives and talking about that kind of thing with her is difficult. I know I should just hold my tongue but it's hard. I don't want to create tension between us like this for no reason, it sucks and I hate it but I always end up doing it over the stupidest little things. How do I stop? It's hard for me to regulate being triggered and I really want to. I feel so bad about possibly making her feel bad about her gift when it has absolutely nothing to do with me.",15Sep2020,1

I didn’t kill myself at any point during my childhood/teen years just to have this shit life and I don’t want it.

I wanted to do better and work harder but I’m just worthless. I can’t sleep and I want to die.
I want to clean up and throw away everything that isn’t my clothes and furniture, starve myself, and then when I’ve gotten rid of all of anything anyone could go through or judge me for, then going to erase my laptop and phone and hang or drown myself.

It might take weeks, the only reason I don’t go through with it is because I need to do all this stuff first and people I know will blame themselves.
I had kind of a bad childhood by no fault of my mother and all I wanted was to make music or art for a living.
I only really have one friend kinda and their dad died a few weeks ago and I feel like I can’t do this to them and just add to it.

I have no talent with music and art and absolutely no skills outside of this.
Even my influences say it’s best not to think you’ll make money doing that anyways.
I have no chance. I’ll be a nearly disabled cashier for life.
I have a drinking problem and body dysmorphia, I might have ptsd and I’m either ADD or bipolar.
I can’t take the meds, I gained so much weight from that and drinking.
I’m such a fucking loser, I hate everything about my body, I think I need plastic surgery to look presentable. I’m mentally fucked. I’m a musician idolizing loser. I’m ugly, don’t know how to do make up and I’m too short. I don’t have a license and live in a horribly maintained apartment building.
Someone gave me a cat and I love her, but it wasn’t my choice to take her so now I kind of own a cat I really don’t want to get rid of but I hate cat hair on everything and maybe it will put off a lot of people that I own a pet and it’s not like my appearance or personality or anything really does me any favours.
I’m going to die alone.

I never want to have children, I know I couldn’t handle it and even being in a relationship in the first place sounds pretty out of reach. I know I’m going to eventually just go through with killing myself and nothing in my life will ever change.

I wanted to kill myself when I was 12 and nothing I stayed alive since then for has ever happened to me and never will so what is even the point.

35,"I’m a little lost on what to think about this. I’m not sure I need advice, but maybe someone to relate to. I used to be a pretty sexual person. I craved it and honestly made careless decisions (for my physical and emotional well being) for the sake of attention and validation. I can admit I didn’t know how else to connect with someone or show/seek love. 

Now, I’ve been with my boyfriend for about 3 years and I’ve never been more comfortable with someone. I don’t get insecure about the relationship, or worry about body image like I have with every one before him. However, I become more and more uninterested in sex to the point that I’m practically averse to it now. Sometimes he’ll start to touch me and I feel like I’m being accosted and my body just won’t give in to it. I have to actively tell myself that it’s okay and that helps me to relax and be more in the moment. I very rarely climax, but I don’t think I ever did with another human before I met him. Even on my own, it’s difficult. 

I truly don’t think the relationship is the issue, but it’s causing a lot of disconnection on my end. It feels like this is what it’s like to relive old trauma, but I honestly don’t have a past traumatic “event” I can connect this to. It just breaks my heart that this seems to only get worse.",15Sep2020,1

38,"In a lot of emotional pain and it hurts more than ever that it's my birthday. I feel more alone than ever and I still wish I wasn't born.

I don't trust anyone. I wish I could honestly talk to someone and I can't. I have had to always been by myself. My parents attack me, and since I was a little child I would go to my room, lock my door, and cry. I would have to stay strong and never give up hope. But that child in me has really died. I don't know how that little girl had so much hope even when she was suicidal all her life. Never was I able to talk to anyone about anything, my brothers and sisters all left me at a young age (they know visit but didn't when I was younger), and I feel like people on reddit people don't have good intentions and are using people for porn or something worse. To manipulate them or do something else. I don't know but I just don't trust anyone in this world. I don't even trust a therapist I'd be paying for and no way in hell would I pay for a therapist. Point is that I was born into the family I'm in and it hurts so much to see other people my age who celebrate their birthday with friends and family. It just hurts. My family doesn't care to celebrate birthdays and nothing is ever happy because my entire family is depressed. It's so hard to see other people and compare myself to their life. Why couldn't I have gotten that life? Life has been so painful and my birthday is not something I can celebrate. I wish I wasn't alive.

39,"28/F and recently got diagnosed with anxiety and severe depression. I've been getting chest pains but they've been getting worse ever since last year. My dad passed last year. Since my dad passed, I've been trying to be proactive about my grieving and mental health. I've seen my therapist 1/week for a couple months, and now I see her 2/month. Last week, is when I got diagnosed and got on medication to start. Anyway, these chest pains..have been panic attacks. I'm surprised that's the feeling because I never thought that's what panic attacks were. I would be lying down and relaxing and this pain happened. I'm Asian, and we've never talked about mental health. Heck, my mom gave me a hard time about seeing a therapist. However, I'm trying to be better--mentally, confident, happier, and grieve. I'm told journalling can help with anxiety, and just noting down all your thoughts out.. I have so much to say sometimes, sometimes nothing at all. But my question is -- is there a journal you'd recommend to use? I've tried writing on a regular journal but I get tired. I want to fill something in. Not sure if I make any sense.

I could be fine for a good half hour but the urge to burst into tears always creeps up on me. I tried to keep myself busy by doing my passions like playing guitar and getting new hobbies such as working out but I just have no motivation. It’s evident that I’m up against depression. I considered telling my parents but they are very religious and they’ll probably make me join them at church which is something I don’t want part of. Going to friends isn’t much of an option either due to the fact that I recently moved to another state and know absolutely no one. Work and school is just adding more weight on my already weak shoulders. How do I go about this?

50,"I’ve always suspected my wife may have some type of mental illness—bipolar disorder, depression, or something. She’s always displayed a handful of telltale signs; bouts of depression, wanting to be alone, unexplained crying or feelings of sadness, irritability, mood swings, paranoid delusions, difficulty sleeping, fatigue, etc. She always chalks it up to her period coming soon, which seems to be 3 weeks out of the month at this point. I’ve always just figured it’s who she is, her personality, etc. 

In the past several weeks, she’s had increasing paranoid delusions about her work place spying on her. She’s adamant that her personal cell phone, personal laptop, and work laptop are all hacked—and her boss, other employees at work, even third party vendors she works with have access to her personal and work electronic devices and can hack into her cameras or even listen in on conversation that we have within our own household. 

When I’ve asked why anyone would do this, she says it’s because they’re using this as a way of controlling the workplace, instilling fear in the workers, and cyber bullying. When I ask her for proof she gives me very generalized examples of people at work bringing out generic talking points and somehow ties it into something we had talked about at home previously. But they’ve all been really broad or generic. The biggest kicker, she also thought her phone was hacked at her LAST job and even went as far as buying a new phone. 

It’s come to a point that I refuse to play along and I’ve tried telling her that these things are not happening and that she needs to seek professional help. She’ll cry and tell me I’m not supportive and naive. I have no idea what to do anymore and how to help. I don’t want to encourage this behavior, but she refuses to see this as anything other than truth. A part of me is almost starting to even doubt myself—is something like this even possible? And how likely is it that it’s happened at back to back jobs?

I've always been weirded out by it. Even when I was a young child, I never had a problem cutting people out of my life, friends or family. Just today I had a pretty good friend of 2 years decide to block me and stop talking to me because I wouldn't answer to a long ass paragraph accusing me of not caring for them and still holding resentment towards me because I was forced to drop out of the college we both went to because of financial issues, and that meant that they would no longer have a roommate. In my mind, I'm a busy woman and I don't have time to answer silly things like that, especially since I work long hours and have to come home to deal with my mental health now. I found out that she blocked me today through a mutual who was also having issues with her and called me about it just to tell me and I felt nothing. The first thought that came to my mind was how I should change plans then, and that was it. No sadness, no memories of better times, nothing. Even as I type this I feel nothing, and this was someone people considered my best friend.  It made me think back to when my childhood friend had a similar situation with her best friend who blocked her and told her she was a bad person. She called me in a fit of tears and had to come over to my house so I could console her. I've had people tell me it's a good thing that I can do this, but I feel like there might be something wrong with that. I've cut many people out of my life, including even both of my grandmothers.

My intention is to help me to discern which activities are fruitful and not fruitful, while also to look back my stats as a retrospect my life condition in general.

Thus, I want to re-evaluate my methods on mood input with you guys. How often do you input the mood? I usually put the input every 3 hours starting 06:00, so my input probably goes around 09:00, 12:00, 15:00, 18:00 and 21:00.

I said to my friends and family members that I have depression and they were like nah you're just lazy do your work everybody gets sad. So I'm asking this on reddit. I keep imagining things that I don't actually wanna imagine. For example a few days ago my friend sent me this f\*cked up vocaloid song called im sorry im sorry and it had some pretty messed up lyrics which I don't actually condone however when I think stuff like man this is messed up I won't imagine something like this my brain always goes like nah f u I'm gonna imagine it anyways . This is just an example of the many times this kind of stuff happens and I have so much messed up stuff that I've imagined even though I don't like them .

57,"I’ve known I’ve had a problem with masculine figures in my life since I was little because of the abuse I suffered from my father. It’s the common case of “daddy issues” for me. But I realized that the hyper sexualization isn’t really as simple as people think it is. At least for me, it’s because I’ve never had a stable male figure in my life, and now when I do have any kind of male figure in my life, I feel like the only way I can feel loved, or wanted by them is when I give sexual favors.  This isn’t the best mindset to have, and I want to know how to get rid of it, but it’s just so much easier to have that kind of relationship than to actually deal with my feelings. 

It’s gotten to the point where I’ve talked with multiple guys at once, none of them with the intentions of forming an actual relationship, and maintain a form of “friends with benefits” in a way. I’m not comfortable being in an actual relationship because it’s easier to deal with a friend with benefits leaving than someone with a deeper connection.

62,"**Background:** I earned my AS in business administration in June from my local community college in downstate NY. I transferred to UCF, expecting trips to Orlando theme parks with new people, tons of parties, and in-person club meetings where I'd meet people with common interests nearly every day. 

**The Problem:** None of this has happened, because UCF is taking COVID very seriously, even though cases in FL have been declining for months. Campus is a ghost town, there were few in-person rush events until this week, most events are over Zoom, and the ones that aren't have absolutely nothing to do with my interests or have an RSVP list that is full in like five minutes. 

**Roommates:** My roommates work a lot and don't leave their rooms that much when at the apartment. One of my roommates is in his 30s, the other one delivers pizza much of the day, and the other one sits in his room a lot, and they're not interested in partying or going out. 

**Silver Linings:** I have managed to meet several people by driving on campus almost every day and hanging out on the large lawn called ""Memory Mall"" and eating there. I even went to New Smyrna Beach and met up with the people I see at Memory Mall on Fridays. I've also registered for in-person events including a fair at Rosen College, a fraternity rush, a gardening activity, and Friday night dinner at Chabad, a Jewish organization.

65,"I've been closer now than in my whole life to ending it all.

I have the method, tools, and the location set in mind. Somehow I just cant find the time.

It seems that every time I want to eat a bullet so bad I either have to take care of something before my exit or I have something great to look forward to.

The day before yesterday, I woke up early in the morning. I decided, today is the day. I got my clothes on, and drove up to the mountains to my chosen location.

There is a massive drain pipe running under a road, the end of it pokes out from a cliff and overlooks a gorgeous valley full of trees. The end of the pipe is my chosen spot.

I have magic mushrooms that I planned to take to enjoy myself one last time before ending my life.

My plans fell through when the way up the mountain was blocked off by police; the fires are devastating the forest.

I decided to stop and figure out if there is a plan b location for doing it. To lubricate my gears I stopped at a friends house for a beer. One beer became 2, became 4, became 8, became more. Next morning we receive the news.

Two of my friends lost their homes to the fire. The fighters had to let it go because it was out of control, they were willing to let the whole forest go.

My heart broke when I heard this.

My friend has always been there for me, and the forests have always been my second home. The fact we are losing most of our Woodlands makes me want to remove myself even more because I cant stand to live in a shithole like this and not even have a forest to camp in for respite.

But I had a mission to accomplish. I was in the Foothills, right at the base of where the forest fires are raging. We have to secure this home against possible spotfires. Rage and sorrow burned through me as I cut down trees, mowed the grass, pulled weeds, and watered down the house and yard. My heart aches for the dying forest and my now homeless friends.

Today, I feel some relief. I almost want to pursue firefighting to be honest.

Even still, I am being internally devoured by this festering wound in my soul. I cannot help but contemplate, when and where, now that my woodland refuge is gone?

My father called, he wants me to come visit him to help him work on his yard and his boat this weekend.
Somehow, life finds another day.

Maybe I will just make it to new years, when the life of my love will join my family and I for our annual celebration. It will be the first time my father, mother, and my grandparents meet her. I hope they love her.

I'm trying to make new friends and it's difficult when I'm so sad most the time. I just feel so lost and hopeless which scares me bc the last time I was like this I was absolutely destroyed.

72,"I am someone who others always perceived as outgoing and funny despite my anxiety and awkwardness which i’ve just recently reached a breaking point and healed from, around this time last year I had friends I would hang out with just about everyday one day we were smoking weed &amp; I felt a moment of anxiety and my friend noticed he quickly insisted that I looked suspicious in a joking manner I chuckled and looked away but I guess this arose suspicion of me because the rest of that night my friend was probing me even though we had known each other for so many years all it took was one anxious look to rise his suspicions after this I hadn’t seen my friend for about a week and I finally decided I would clear the air he asked me to meet with him so I did but in our encounter I could tell his demeanor was different than usual after all i’ve known him for over 6+ years his hostile intent was very clear so I decided I would tackle the issue head on and tell him how that was just an anxious look and nothing more, but when I attempted to explain myself it didnt come out like that instead in an act of desperation I completely spilled my guts and told him basically all my issues at this point he was a bit thrown off since that day we went from talking daily to not speaking very much at this point it was clear to me I needed to deal with my issues I stayed home and meditated on it but of course Im the type of person that doesn’t correctly handle his issues and it bleeds to other areas of my life, this instance im speaking about comes next when I decided to talk to my older sibling about it he is a bit older than me and has more wisdom I was certain if I had no one in life I had him. So I explain the issue to him hysterically because honestly at that point in life I was nervous I was being portrayed as an untrustworthy liar even though i’ve told nothing but the truth. He insisted I was overthinking the situation and being paranoid but I was so sure. For those who don’t understand the situation I was in people who are  in such a position of question where im from is punishable by death. This was the first time my word had ever been in question so I didn’t know what to expect exactly even though I was being honest. Fast forward two days later at first glace I could tell my older sibling had grown extremely tired and irritable of my theories and wondered why I was so concerned and insisted that if I truly had nothing to hide then why was I so worried ultimately it made him skeptical of me and has since put a seemingly permanent dent in our relationship. Time went by and my “friend” and I still dont speak but I believe that he realizes now that it was really all a misunderstanding but my family life has truly taken a toll from this and it seems im constantly under close watch as if I cannot be trusted and has truly effected how I look at myself no matter how much self reflection I do I cannot seem to get past this, i’ve also tried speaking to my sibling but its as if our mutual point of understanding has hit bedrock honestly I’ve accepted the fact our relationship may never be the same I would like to just get my life back on track.",15Sep2020,1
73,"This is kinda depressing, but I’ve only ever had one reoccurring dream. It was years ago, but still haunts me. Recently however, it’s resurfaced. This is kinda long, so bare with me! 

I’m standing in my room in the middle of the night. My room is small and rectangular with the exit on the left wall in front of where I’m standing. It’s empty except a desk to my right (not mine, plain white) with a black clock with rainbow numbers on it (this has significance I will explain later), a twin bed behind me (from early childhood), and a full length mirror leaning against my closet door (which is in front of me). Three small windows are behind me with white curtains.

It’s dark. It’s night and no lights are on. In the dream I stand there and stare at the mirror for a long time. After awhile, outside shines a light like passing car headlights through my windows behind me. It blinds me for a second, and when I look back into the mirror I look sickly. My face begins to turn pale, and my eyes melt out of their sockets until black orbs are shown. I grab for my face, but nothing is actually wrong. 

Another headlight passes and I hear a door being unlocked in the distance from outside my door. The lights fade on underneath my door, I then vaguely hear my siblings voices from when they were young saying, “good morning!” and “Hi daddy! You’re back!” etc. which leaves me confused because it’s night. 

I ignore it and turn back to the mirror. In the mirror I see something behind me and quickly turn. Nothing.                     
When I look into the mirror again, I see the figure still and wave at it. It waves back after a moment. I turn on the lights and everything is normal for a second, then the light in my room goes out and it turns back to this weird room with the mirror figure. I wait longer.

Outside my door I hear my siblings (again, like when they were very small) getting ready for school/getting breakfast. I look at my black clock with the rainbow numbers and see it’s 3:17 am. I think that is absurd, but ignore it. 

Turning back to the mirror there is a whole bunch of figures behind me, but I’m not scared this time. I’m used to them, and almost welcome them. But one steps forward from between them, and I’m full of dread suddenly. Then I realize why I welcomed the figures at first. They’re my family. My mother, four younger siblings, and older sibling. The one who stepped forward was my father.  I began to tremble terribly, and stifle my tears. He suddenly yells, “Get your ass out of bed! What are you doing here still!?” I shake my head vigorously while being unable to speak, but he advances still, “You know better then this!? Why can’t you be more responsible! I raised you better then this!” He hits me upside the head and it knocks me against the mirror, shattering it. I can’t look at him, I feel sick, everything is still dark and my world starts spinning. “How worthless” he spits, “Look at the time, I bought you this for a reason!” He tore the alarm from the desk and threw it at my feet. It read “8:27 am” on it. I was late for school. 

As this happened the rest of my family plugged their ears and turned around. The room remained dark. My father stares me down and I hear whispers from voices unfamiliar and warped, “Trash” “worthless” “you can’t even get out of bed” “this is the fourth time this year” “what are you even doing?” “Your grades will drop” “you know how to do better, so do it” “there’s nothing wrong with you, so why are you so stupid?” Etc. 

It faded eventually, and when I looked up they were gone. I was alone in that room crying in a pool of my own blood (was cut from the glass). I picked up a shard of the mirror and looked in it again. I was actually alone, and looked lifeless. A creeping blackness begins to engulf everything. I sat for what felt like forever in the dark, and it faded darker and darker. 

It was now pitch black and I hear my alarm going off. Giant rainbow numbers flashing “8:27 am” was all I could see. Sometimes it’d continue for what felt like forever, and I was trapped. Other times, I’d wake up in a cold sweat and tears at exactly 8:27 am. That’s the dream.


Not long before these dreams occurred was the morning my father gave my a concussion and yelled at me for hours for not waking up on time. Thing was, I was just laying in bed reading and waiting to leave. I wasn’t actually late, it was just my clock which was fast. He didn’t care when he found out. Now he denies it even happened, cause he’s a “great father” and a super religious “god-fearing man” ha, more like a narcissistic abusive asshat. That morning I went into class, in eighth grade, sobbing. Not long after my parents had a nasty divorce. Everything fell apart after that. For a long time, I blamed myself for it. If only I had been a better kid. If only I was well behave 24/7 and got better grades. My dad’s favorite phrase to drill into us was, “obey all the way, right away.” The “or else” was an unspoken threat lingering over our heads my whole childhood. I fell into a deep depression and had panic attacks almost every day. That wasn’t a one-time-incident... it was my every day. 

I still can’t get rid of the damn clock. I don’t know why. I don’t use it, but it’s sitting in a box under my bed collecting dust. When I hear that type of alarm I have a panic attack. I’ve moved forward and things are better now, but I think about this morning every day. When I open my eyes and look at the ceiling, it’s my first thought. I can’t read books in my bed anymore, or in the morning, I become too paranoid and startle at small noises. Hearing doors unlock gives me bad anxiety. It’s my life now, even though I’d previously gone through worse, this seems to be a major event for me.

I just wanted to vent I guess. The nightmare came back the other night, and I’ve felt off since then. It’ll eventually go away again, and I’ll have my ease returned to me, but for now I’m anxious. It’s difficult to wake up when I have these dreams, and I hate sunrises and sunsets since that morning.

82,"Roughly 10 months ago after an intense year long battle with depression and loneliness I lost and tried to take my own life. Since then my life has been on the up and up again. The weeks I spent basically just sitting in my bed or the shower I was able to realize the things I enjoyed about life and the things that really gave me joy (my religion, music, friends that never neglected me even when I neglected them, etc.). But there have been a couple things nagging at me recently as I approach the 1 year mark that I could use some advice on or things that I’m curious about. 

1.) When I think back on my life prior to my suicide attempt, the memories don’t feel like mine. Like I know they’re mine due to head knowledge but in a weird sense they don’t feel like my memories but rather like a really really bad and poorly made TV show or a bad book I read. Even the friendships I had from that era of my life no longer feel “real” in a sense. I still love these people and in some cases I’ve maintained the same amount of contact I’ve with them every before my attempt, but I just feel really detached from them. Is this a normal thing? 

2.) About two days after my suicide attempt I forced myself to tell two of my trusted friend about my attempt so they could occasionally check up on me as I knew I wasn’t out of the woods yet in terms of my mental health, and as the months ran on I eventually told a couple more people as it was apologizing to them for my behavior and for any hurt I caused them while I was in that state of mind. One group I haven’t told is my family. I’ve never really been able to tell them and it hurts me a little bit, but I’ve always felt like I couldn’t because I have a very sensitive mother who would either get mad at me or blame herself. So how do I do that? How do I tell my family about the gigantic event in my life? 

3.) People are people and they hold grudges (sometimes justly so). In the events leading up to my suicide attempt, I lashed out at a few people and I hurt the feels of many, and because of that there are many people who are angry with me. I want to apologize to them for the hurt I’ve caused but I feel like with a couple of them who don’t really have a grip on the basic understanding of “depression and suicidal thoughts can make you act a bit dickish” would just get more upset. So how would y’all recommend going about apologizing so someone who wouldn’t quite understand that depression can sometimes cause episodes of anger?",15Sep2020,1

86,"I feel like a selfish, heartless, vindictive jerk. Everyone’s all about understanding others and meeting people halfway and taking the higher road. I wish I could think like that. I wish I could be nice like that. I have to try so hard to be kind and do kind things and project an aura of “friendly nice person” all the time, which probably doesn’t even work that well. People tell me that I’m fun to be around and I’m so considerate of others when 70% of the time I’m judging someone unfairly or feeling irritated at something stupid or straight up angry and on the verge of smashing something (but I still look happy, teehee). Maybe I brought this upon myself for not being more honest. Anyway, instead of that imaginary nice friendly person, I’m the type of person who fantasizes about hurting people who hurt me. I want to ruin the people who ruined me. Even when I try to empathize and think about situations from other points of view, try to forgive and forget, try to realize that people are complicated, that sometimes people don’t even mean to cause me pain and they have good intentions- I don’t care because all I can feel is MY pain and MY grievances and how I’VE been wronged.",15Sep2020,1

90,"Sorry if this doesn’t sound good or make very much sense. I’m kinda sad and it makes it hard to think. 

Every month or so I miss an appointment with my therapist. I either forgot or I’m not in the mood to talk. Once I miss that appointment though I get scared about calling back to reschedule. And it’s like that with everything in my life. I forget to text someone back and my mind goes “I can’t ever talk to them again” I get depressed and don’t show up to work so I think “well I can’t ever go back I have to quit”. I don’t know what causes this but it’s the hardest when it’s my therapy. Everyone in my “support group” gets really mad at me. They’re frustrated and sometimes yell asking “why do I do this? It’s not that hard” but for me it is. I think their reactions is what makes it so difficult. If they think this then won’t everyone else? If they’re mad then won’t my therapist be too? 

My therapist has been trying to call me every week for a month and yesterday I got a letter saying if I don’t schedule and appointment in 10 days I lose services. After getting this I’m more embarrassed then ever to call but at the same time I really need this therapy. It’s been helping me more then I ever thought it could.

98,"While im University, my friends and i met this really cool girl who later became one of our good friends. Throughout our time in University, we ran into a few issues with her but a few of us made up and remained friends. I was really close with her and i considered her as one of the closest friends i ever had until recently. 

We both struggle with depression and confide in each other. Some time ago, she started avoiding everyone and giving them the cold shoulder. She would say at times that it was because of her mental health. We would often ask how she's doing and check up on her  but she told us that she hates it when we do. We respected her decision and tried our best to understand her struggles. We remained there if she needed us. Things seemed to get better.

Over time, she became out of touch with reality and display disturbing behavior. We tried to get her help from the school but to no avail. Later, i found out that she would say a lot of awful things behind my back to a lot of people. The things she said were extremely insulting which confused a lot of people given our close relationship. She later apologized to me and said it was because of jealousy and i forgave her. Things were looking better for a few months until she started behaving this way again and giving everyone the cold shoulder. She keeps stating that there was only one person who was there for her and never left her side. It hurts whenever she says and gives us the cold shoulder. 

It looks like a dead end at this point. How can i get over it? She was someone i really cared for. Thank you so much.",15Sep2020,1

101,"I started mental health treatment with a psychologist who was amazing. During treatment he recommended me to a Psychiatrist who I also believe is an amazing doctor and absolutely love. A few years back my Psychologist retired which sucked immensely. My Psychiatrist agreed to also take on the psychotherapy role in absence of my Psychologist after he retired.

So here is the problem. I am prescribed adderal, which I sell most of what I am prescribed every month because I lack self discipline and really need the money. I know what I am doing is wrong in every way. I hate that I do it and wish I didn't, but every month those bills keep coming around the corner and every month I sell some. I feel so guilty that I sell my prescription that its hindering my ability to truly open up to my Psychiatrist about anything, even things that have absolutely nothing to do with selling adderal. Even after years of seeing him the guilt keeps me from sharing anything too deep. I am receiving medication for depression which definitely helps but I know from experience that medicine alone is not the cure all for problems. From personal experience coping skills learned through Psychotherapy are move valuable than anything a pill can offer.

&amp;#x200B;

I know its not right but I do not want to lose my adderal scripts because 1. I do take them when needed (but do not always need them) 2. The income defiantly helps. Yes I know I am trying to have my cake and eat it too.

So barring what is right and what is wrong my question is this: Can I see a Psychologist and tell them this information without them contacting my Psychiatrist and telling them what I am doing? If I could just spill the beans on myself maybe I could finally get some mental relief and work to the root causes of all these problems.",15Sep2020,1

thing is it comes in waves too. i feel fine with it, used to it, whatever. and then like once a month i just break down and realize how tired i've been / am and how much it's built up. 

it doesn't help that i'm constantly physically tired too due to health problems and insomnia. but i can't block out the physical tiredness like i can the emotional. the emotional / mental exhaustion just hides in the background until it builds up and i just snap and breakdown 

it's so confusing and thing is i'm too tired to be motivated to work to permanently change this and avoid it. i just want some fucking miracle drug or whatever to do it all for me. i feel pathetic honestly but it's reasonable i think",15Sep2020,1

119,"For the past few days I've been self introspecting and have come to realise some of the deeply embedded issues within me.
 
I am extremely insecure. I think everyone is better than me, both in terms of physical attributes and intelligence. This has always been the case with me, I never had the confidence to even raise my hand and answer a question in class even when I knew it. It's because I felt that I'll say something dumb. 
The problem has gotten worse, now I just feel self conscious all the time. Check myself out in the mirror 50 times a day, and absolutely hate what I see. Refrain from talking too much or expressing my opinions about anything to avoid getting laughed at. 

I think the reason why I developed such insecurity can be traced back to middle school. I hit puberty before most of my peers and so everyone would point that out and also my weight gain. I had this boyfriend who always laughed at my opinions about most things. Often not logically correcting me, and just waving it off like I wouldn't understand the logic. 

Anyhow, I just wanted to share incase anyone else has been through something similar, so that we can discuss and maybe share some tips to get out of it. It's really weighing me down and killing my motivation and it sucks!
I've started working out, reading more and just being more woke and aware in general but none of this makes me feel any better.",15Sep2020,1
120,"For a tiny bit of context: She was my first girlfriend and I broke up with her about a year 1/2 ago. She caused me a lot of pain and there was a lot of betrayal, and I starting liking someone else who was better and less toxic so I broke up with her and went for the other girl. I'm still with this girl and have been for the last year and few months and she is amazing and we tell each other everything and actually have trust, unlike my last relationship. Anyway, some of my other toxic friends betrayed me throughout the years and I cut them off as well, while keeping other good friends.

I guess my main problem is: I get these weird scenarios in my head every time I think of someone who hurt me. I have daydreams and imagine situations of me having conversations with them. Whether it's my ex or other people who hurt me, when something randomly triggers their name in to my head I sometimes imagine talking to them and having specific conversation, as well as just wondering how they are doing. I don't like this, and I want them gone from my memory but this happens nearly every day. No idea what's wrong with me, but a lot of the time I even talk to myself OUT LOUD and imagine I'm having a convo with them and imagine their responses and stuff then I snap out of it after a few mins. Someone help me free my mind. Do I need to meet up with these people and get closure somehow (even though I cut THEM off)? Do I need to go to a hypno or therapist?

121,"I got out of an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship last year after having been in 3 physically, emotionally and 1 sexually abusive relationships prior to that. I met someone I think is amazing, treats me well, doesn’t do drugs and is not a narcissist which was my MO forever because I haven’t wanted to accept “daddy issues”. 

This person is truly the best partner I have had besides some offhanded comments in the heat of an argument that were deeply insulting and made me really insecure about myself. This happened more than once. It’s my first time not feeling physically attractive or uncomfortable naked around someone I love. Fast forward 10 months, we go to a strip club because that’s what we do, I love them, and he gets a lap dance alone. Last time we went together and that was totally fine. This sent me over the edge and it just so happens my most recent ex just moved to my state. We got home and I was already pretty wasted, we fucked and I laid there just stewing in my thoughts that have spiraled out of control greatly over these months. I left and fucked my ex. An abuser and a drug addict who would probably walk right over my dead body if I’m real with myself and not falling for the fake, abusive, manipulative shit. 

When my partner called to check on me at 6am because he was worried sick, I replied “I just cheated on you I hope you enjoyed that lap dance.” On my way there everything was telling me to just go home and I was just hoping I would get pulled over and get a DUI or something because alcohol is a major problem in my life for years and I would like to be done and don’t know how. I knew I was sabotaging worse than I ever have. The anger, worthlessness and alcohol fueled me to keep going. 

I’m a social worker so I’m definitely not unfamiliar with mental health, I just haven’t come to terms with my own or sought proper treatment. I’m realizing this reckless behavior, especially when it comes to alcohol and sex, are indicators of several illnesses, now compounded with trauma across my childhood and adult life, I’m thinking I’m bipolar and possibly even borderline and definitely experiencing ptsd and remaining in abuse cycles. I was in the hospital last week and they just checked me out with Ativan but I think I’ll go back tomorrow and ask to actually stay so I can sort this out or I really fear I’ll end up dead, if not by my own hands then at the hands of alcohol. 

What I’m wondering is: is it wrong to ask him to have some accountability too and approach it thru a trauma informed lens? Because this would have never happened minus all of these factors. I’m fucked up man, I’ve tried breaking up with him many times so I could sabotage alone and I think I just totally fucked it up in the absolute worst way possible. He’s been supportive thru my ongoing mental anguish and drunk episodes and I’m confident it’s not to the level of codependency. He is my first decent partner that cares about someone other than themselves. Then my paranoid ass just doesn’t think he cares and he’s like the rest and I am actually neurotic about it to the point it disrupts my day. I don’t think he’s coming back and I’m sad but I’m honestly pissed he made me feel unattractive/undesirable and like a bottom bitch because not even my worst partners have done that. I’m the dysfunctional, reckless, emotionally disturbed one in a relationship for the first time and I’m not sure what to do anymore but I’m certain I want to work thru this with him because I think it’s more natural and forgivable to say terrible things you don’t mean to someone than literally risk your life to go fuck an abuser and sabotage not just your life but someone else’s. So I’m just hoping he comes back. I just want a normal life that doesn’t include constant suicidal ideation and self-sabotage behavior.",15Sep2020,1

I always end up asking her to let me know how I can help. that's it. and she never explicitly goes on to explain how. Like, whenever I say ""let me know how I can help"", shes says ""yeah"" and that's the end of the topic. 

I sometimes suggest her things that I find enjoying ( exercise, movies etc) but she doesn't find them comforting. I also understand that depression and anxiety work differently for everyone. so some things that might work for someone would not work for her. I also understand I can't go on simply suggesting her stuff because that could come out as rude. i just. want to know how to react. whenever she opens up to me. how to react so that I don't hurt her further but also i am being helpful to her. currently, whenever she shares things with me, i feel my replies look like I'm just trying to do some formality and that i don't care. but the truth is i simply dont know what to do or say.

another thing is, that i myself struggle with mental health issues, although i have not ever been to therapy or got myself diagnosed. so i just really need to know how to help her but also remember to put my mental health first, at times.

136,"Hi guys, 

I'm posting this up here not knowing if it will ever be seen but I feel like shouting it into the void could take some weight off my chest. 

I've thought about writing this loads but as I type I've forgotten it all, so here it goes. 

Basically I'm getting birthday blues. I get them every year but can normally skip under the radar. I purposely don't remind people and have managed low key acknowledgements and the usual- HP Bday an auld text off closest friends, If they remember. 😁
Last year, the only person I wanted to spend my birthday with was my daughter (6 then) She was so excited and asked every day that week, except for the day my sister took her for a few hours for a visit, I got a phone call around 7 and it was her asking for a sleepover at her aunts. I couldn't see why not, left down the phone to a blissful girlo while I proceeded to burst into tears, She has forgot and I made no effort to remind her it was exactly what I wanted and I was gutted.

This year seems it might not be so easy to schlip under the radar however, I got in touch last year with my estranged grandmother and my aunts and uncles. I hadn't seen them last since I was 16. 
My Dad passed away suddenly 6 weeks ago and I never got to meet him as an adult. (I will turn 30 soon) I know he wanted to know me. Being honest, I had no intention of meeting him until it was too late and my conditioning was smashed into pieces. 

I was raised by my mother who unfortunately has narsiccistic tendencies, and a dislike particularly towards me growing up, (she really hated me for being a heavier girl among a million other things, I reminded her of my dad, which I have learned since his death I also remind others) and had done extreme things to cause pain to myself and my adult siblings I've had to make the choice to distance her in order to protect my daughter. (The irony, dont think I dont feel like an iron hearted villain, the situation is beyond help) 

The result of Dads' passing is that we have met and gained alot of family, and they act like a real family who note, care about and love each other and are excited to have us back in their lives, and we as siblings also became closer. Granny already mentioned 'the date' - queue poker face. 'Oh yeah, that Sunday. Of course we'll come out to you"". So I know somethings gonna go on. And it scares the shit out of me. I dont want it, but I know they do. My boyfriend finally had to tell me he has spent the last 2 days talking my headstrong sister out of a surprise party. My Social anxiety is so bad I don't go to shops. (Ive been attempting to buy knickers for 3 weeks now and bf gets the food or there would be none)  

So on top of that I have massive confidence issues, my best friend is beyond attractive (housemate up to lockdown)  and my boyfriend likes to admire women- not in any purposeful or hurtful way  but I can see it in him. While my bestfriend and I were living together I lost so much weight I scared my bf. (I was always heavy, you could see my ribs 6 months ago so I scared myself a little also but I was hoping to die)
I spent so much time involuntary worrying over them realising they wanted to be together and I'd be the one with the issue so buh-bye me. This would keep me awake for nights. 
Eventually I had to tell them both and its still an ongoing conversation because I'm not well over it in general and not atall again now. 

So last week my best friend asks for his number, and I know she has my back but just the thoughts of some spark happening is dominating my mind while she is most probably trying to set something up for my birthday. Its been unbearable in my head since I realised why my brain got so scrambled. 

Its 11:26 am and I have yet to sleep, Im not feeling tired just sad. I have trich so I pulled out all of my eyelashes on my right eye. It took me the night to figure out I've been behind the scenes attempting to sabotage peoples plans without even knowing what they are. And if I dont succeed, I now have no eyelashes or eyebrows so I can look as awful as I feel. I didnt realise till most of them (lashes) were gone I was garenteeing I won't get the hope for a chance to feel pretty now.
I pulled them all out back in Feb and confidence plummeted. They were back by August properly and I was feeling OK about my face for the first time in my life ever. I guess my brain knew that long before I did. 
I'm not sure how to cope to be honest, I dont want people to remember or care about my birthday and the thought really upsets me. Both ways. My brain is fried! 

I'm just sharing, Im In councilling and am currently working on my insecurity. but to anyone who's read this waytoo long post, thoughts welcome. 
I do hope it makes some lovely soul feel that little less alone.",15Sep2020,1
137,"I've been dangerously depressed since about 5th grade (13-14 years ago) and I'm in treatment since 9 years now. Me and my therapist went trough our goals from 2 years ago and well, what I reached could've been done without them (stopping eating my fingers) while we made zero progress on the important things. I've spent a lot of my remaining energy following their advice in the recent years, but doesn't matter how much I try: The following exhaustion from keeping up with something on the last drip of my energy just drags me down further. Simple example is doing some sport: I can break trough my depression and do it for a while, I'm so exhausted from keeping doing it that I end up more depressed rather than reaching the promised effect. The recent appointments with my therapist have been desperately looking for something to talk about. There's nothing to talk, I'm depressed without any reason and since we tried everything there's nothing left we could try. Now we'll run out of appointments soon and while I could extend it, I don't see a reason to do so and she doesn't suggest doing so either. It seems obvious that my therapist is done with my shit and wants to get rid of me after years of unsuccessfully working together.",15Sep2020,1

When I was a kid I've always wanted to be a soldier/police officer/intelligence officer/spy/special agent-ish/jedi master.

In the course of time, with getting more specific knowledge and stuff ""my brain"" started do demanding from himself to be as precise as possible - so now, when i imagine being let's say soldier I can ""dream"" about being some high ranking guy but I need so be someone with rank matching my age, serving in the unit that really exists... and other details. Also I can't focus on being one imagined person all the time, this changes all the time, even few times a day, with every change I start to create new details and stories.

All this bothers me more lately, I feel overwhelmed with stuff going inside my head I feel like I hold too many not-really-important details and stories that don't even concern my real life! My head feels tired.

Anyone had that? Any ideas how to deal with it?",15Sep2020,1

152,"So my life had quite been rough sometimes. I'm 28 years old.

In my childhood I've not been confident kid neither I was good in concentration in any subjective matter but through times my confidence level got its place in my life but I feel that my concentration point is still weak and as I m growing through the age it seems my mind is getting weak.

Why I feel my concentration is weak?
- I never had peace of mind in my childhood days. My nature does demand peacefull environment around or else I can't get through...! at home my mom and dad use to fight all the time(andcthey still does) so all I know that their fight use to make me numb and scare in my childhood days and so I started to distract my mind in every possible way to avoid such noisy, stressing situation. Since then making my mind wander became a habit and maybe due to this I never had good concentration level. 


How this had affected in my journey?
- I had been overthinking about lot of thinks and I cannot shut my mind until I feel exhausted so indirectly my mind is almost controlling me no doubt.
- Again, stress and depression had consumed me. I bring on this issue on every negative phase comes in my lufe. Like, loosing friendship, rejections, no satisfaction in  proffessional life, family issues etc.. Etc.. Each of these phase affects me to the core its not just my feeling but my mind gets affect too. Its been 28yrs and I haven't yet figured out what I accompolished as person. I still struggle with the issues under these phase - loosing friendship, rejections, no satisfaction in  proffessional life, family issues etc.. Etc..
- I had developed an 'Alter Ego' and she. is way more confident than me, actually a Tomboy! She is rowdy and rough tough one, fearless too. Well my alter ego takes place depending on situation so yes I had always got feedback that people don understand what sort of nature I have.
- Strange Memory issue. Sometimess I dont remember easily what I did 5 minutes before but I do remember some important events like 10-20 yrs ago only if they had made space in mind. Honestly I dont know why is it like this.
- I had been hallucinating since 4-5 yrs back and I think my hallucination rate is quite 20% whuch means I dont hallucinate frequently, but it is increasing as I m aging.
- I do have lots of mood swings. For a person like me discipline or a process doesn't work. This because everyday life situation has different impact on my mind and that decifes my behaviour for the moment. So in a day I do go from happy to depress to happy to self hatred etc. Yes I dont have control on my mood either. Recent case - on saturday I wentvto shopping with my dad. We came back home 3 hours later. It was raining outside and since my dad do get sick in rainy days easily I wanted to treat him very soon. So I went hime while he was parking car, turn on the water heater for him to have hot shower and was waiting at door for him to arruve and help him out if all the mess he was in. But it went 15minutes he didnt came up and in thise 15min I literally loose my temper alot. I was angry on him. As he came I literally blasted on him at the top of my voice which literally shocked him and made him angry as well. I knew he was off at the moment he couldn't. Understand my behaviour.

So this all my case which makes me wonder that if I m suffering from any mental disorder.
As far as I thought was maybe it will be minor case of Dissociative identity disorder or Bipolar disorder.

I had given very less example which might not conclude above things but tgere are many such things that I m missingvout right now again due to my lack of memory.

So do let me know if these are  signs of any minor mental disorder or Its just simple case of weak mind.",15Sep2020,1
153,"...Our schools are virtual learning for the First Quarter (at least, and probably until Jan. 2020) so I have to do everything online with our Autistic, can't-sit-still-for-a-second 10 year old 5th Grader.

The work he has to do isn't hard...

Just getting him to SIT STILL--aaaaaaaaaaaargh!!!

&amp;#x200B;

0\_0 This is how I feel today. My brains are already leaking out my ears and I need a Valium to make it through the rest of my day. What is worse is that I have to go to my Drug and Alcohol class in about a half-hour (9:30 am) and that means hubby has to take over until I get back at 12:30 pm...he has NO idea how the classrooms work. Eli (that is the 10 year old) has a Google Meet Meeting at 11:30 am so I have to show hubby how to get into that room when it is time. -\_-   


I am not really complaining...much. I just thought it would be interesting for you guys to read a bit about my life in the trenches (aka homeschooling, not by choice). Maybe make someone laugh a little. Today's assignment for our 5th Grader was a typing game to get him used to the keyboard. I do all of his typing...I have to sit with him or he would be bouncing all over creation like an even more-hyper Tigger. Ha ha. He can't sit still for a second unless he is watching Minecraft videos or playing Roblox.   


OK. I am done rambling. I am feeling ok this morning. I got a good night's sleep (EXACTLY 8 hours lol) after talking to our 21 year old daughter who is at school in Rochester NY right now. That is \~4 hours from home. It was sure nice to see her (we video chatted) again. I miss her lots. Can't wait until Nov. when she comes in for the HOLIDAY!! YAY!

155,"So here goes. 

Sometimes (usually when I am stressed out about stuff - mostly deadlines/study for uni) I just get these thoughts/voice inside my head but it is not my own conciseness or what ever you call it but the thoughts/voice is what I feel like someone from my past would be saying to me (I no longer hang out with the person now though) 

Sometimes the 'thoughts' are on my side or other times against me. examples like: you have taken on too much work and you can't handle it you shouldn't be doing so much, or its not that hard seriously so many people do it and they don't complain 

then it can just stem into hearing more thoughts about my life in general  eg. shouldn't be doing this or that

There is lots of comedy in each and every situation if you look deep enough, and there is a perfect timing to make that observation to be comedic enough. It is better to keep most of those jokes to yourself, and only tell them to people who you really care about, and who you know to care about you. There is some amount of happiness and satisfaction in mystery and not knowing as well. Not knowing whether a joke would make someone laugh when you refrain from telling it. Not knowing whether someone really likes you as much as you like them. The best part of it all would be not knowing everything. The sweet part of mortality is being aware that you won’t be able to know literally everything, so you know that there is an unachievable high score in life, which everyone will try to reach. The best you can do here is try to reach it too. Live your best life, and don’t struggle without a reason.

171,"When you have BPD, you are hard to love. Even when someone does love you, you're skeptical. I had the opportunity of experiencing unconditionally love, and I'm only able to appreciate it now that it's gone. I loved her so much that I destroyed everything. Throughout our entire friendship I stayed on the verge of a panic attack, just waiting for it to all fall apart, for her to leave. Most days were great, really great, other days were a nightmare for the both of us. When the fear of abandonment became too much, I would do the toxic thing that people with BPD are known for. I would do awful things to her, just to see how determined she was to stay. She never left. It's an awful feeling to know you are capable of such things. She stayed through the lowest points in my life, and never gave up on me. She stayed through my eating disorder, when I was severely underweight and would deny I even had a problem, she thought she was watching me die. She stayed through the first time I used a hard drug, despite the fact her chgildhood had been destroyed by that drug. She stayed through my manic episodes, she was always got the brunt of it as I loved her the most. She stayed when I went into active addiction, she didn't lose faith in me. When I got clean after going to rehab, then relapsed, she even stayed then, she told me relapses happen, just to pull myself out of it. Our entire friendship was a rollercoaster of emotions, Ive never seen someone so worried about someone than when seen me high for the first time. She didn't deserve any of that. Our friendship ended after I lied to her about relapsing, when she found out, I had just been assaulted by my older sister. She said the tiniest rude remark, when I said I don't know why it happened, she said I should know why. I immediately took that as as sign that she was on the verge of abandoning me, so I blocked her. Three years of the most love I have ever felt, was gone in an instant. I miss her more than anything, but even if she wanted back into my life id have to decline because I couldn't in good conscience have a relationship with her knowing I'm not mentally well enough to where it would just end up hurting her more than it's worth. Im scared to ever be that close to anyone again, because I know the toxicity I'm capable of.

173,"My sister (14, I'm 20) makes art that's usually pretty creepy and sometimes leans onto horror, and she often asks me to crop and send back pictures for her to post. Last night, I was with a friend watching a movie, so I pretty preoccupied- and she sent me new art. I saw that it was violent and gory, there was blood, but I didn't take a good look at it until she actually posted it with an added trigger warning. Realizing that, I feel awful for enabling that, because even with a TW prefacing it, that content could have reached little kids and her peers, and I'm sure posting and dwelling on that kind of stuff isn't good for her either. I just wish I noticed that she made art depicting self-harm right off the bat, and I wasn't distracted. I usually take more time to look at her art because she's great at what she does, but for some reason she caught me when I was seemingly too occupied. I know she struggled with this, so I should have been caught off guard as soon I saw blood, but I wasn't. My mom saw the art since my sister used her phone to take the pictures, and now she's deleting my sister's instagram. She is in therapy, and because of this my mom is going to make sure she gets help for this too. I never had to really struggle with anything like she is, so I'm trying to be more of an ally and protector for my sister than anything, which obviously I have failed at in this instance.

174,"For context, we’ve been together for 13 years and our wedding keeps getting delayed thanks to covid.

We have a great relationship, we’re best friends, we run a business together and we’re in love. Everything is open and full of trust which is why this situation is so confusing for me. 

I have sometimes debilitating generalised and social anxiety and it gets in the way of me showing affection and of course my desire to have sex.

He suffers from anxiety related to health anxiety but he is on medication so he is handling it.

His idea of a healthy sexual relationship is having sex every day. My idea is sex 2-3x a week.

Every time we get in a “rut” - read: over 3 days - he brings up his discontent and worry that I “don’t want him” or find him attractive.

He has always suffered with low self esteem physically (appearance), where as I have low self esteem mentally (am I interesting/smart etc). We both comfort each other knowing we love each other and are a great boost to each other’s confidence.

He brought up tonight that he thinks I don’t want him and it’s been like this for “over 5 months”

It’s midnight right now and I’ve had one of those days where I cry at the drop of a hat, so when he brought it up tonight for the first time in months, right as we were turning lights off for bed, i instantly exploded in tears and called him unfair... and I probably didn’t help the situation by yelling and saying that he shouldn’t go to bed and bring something like this up so out of the blue.

I can’t shake the fact that this came out of nowhere especially because I’ve been working on my anxiety and how it affects my desire to want sex. In my mind I’ve been making progress in the last few weeks, but slower than I’d like due to being in lockdown for a really long time. It’s been a transparent effort and I had no idea he thought this the entire time. It honestly does not link with the conversations we’ve been having of late.


He’s gone to sleep somehow but I just can’t sleep and have been on the couch crying for an hour.

We usually iron out these issues in the morning, we’ll have makeup sex and all is forgotten but this time he sounded even more convinced that I don’t care about him.

It breaks my heart because it’s just not the case. I really don’t know how to prove something I thought I was already doing :(

193,"I started mental health treatment with a psychologist who was amazing. During treatment he recommended me to a Psychiatrist who I also believe is an amazing doctor and absolutely love. A few years back my Psychologist retired which sucked immensely. My Psychiatrist agreed to also take on the psychotherapy role in absence of my Psychologist after he retired.

So here is the problem. I am prescribed adderal, which I sell most of what I am prescribed every month because I lack self discipline and really need the money. I know what I am doing is wrong in every way. I hate that I do it and wish I didn't, but every month those bills keep coming around the corner and every month I sell some. I feel so guilty that I sell my prescription that its hindering my ability to truly open up to my Psychiatrist about anything, even things that have absolutely nothing to do with selling adderal. Even after years of seeing him the guilt keeps me from sharing anything too deep. I am receiving medication for depression which definitely helps but I know from experience that medicine alone is not the cure all for problems. From personal experience coping skills learned through Psychotherapy are move valuable than anything a pill can offer.

​

I know its not right but I do not want to lose my adderal scripts because 1. I do take them when needed (but do not always need them) 2. The income defiantly helps. Yes I know I am trying to have my cake and eat it too.

So barring what is right and what is wrong my question is this: Can I see a Psychologist and tell them this information without them contacting my Psychiatrist and telling them what I am doing?

202,"In *Awakenings*, one of the top selling non-fiction books of all time, we take a trip to Mt. Carmel, NY and meet post-encephalatic patients reviewing their life from a vessel which they’ve been trapped in. Dr. Sacks was one of the leading researchers in the fight against Parkinson’s being the first to have assembled a history of the disease. In order to combat this amalgamation of malfunctions, Shock said the medical community needs to combine resources and focus attention on finding causes rather than treating side effects. Like a leukemia patient mustering every bit of strength and technology within their means to rid themselves of cancer, the pharmaceutical industry would need to unite to put to rest this end of life mental degeneration. This book accounts the introduction of L-DOPA a dopamine antagonizer that revitalized catatonic patients to a level of youth they didn't know was within them. Before an age where 1/8 of people are on antidepressants, Dr. Sacks found the key to a healthy sustainable life is holding onto that enlightenment and continuously refining the sense of self.

203,"I don't know how to describe my mental state. I have anxiety, that's pretty obvious, I struggle to talk to people because I get stuck trying to talk like a regular person, but it's just not something I know how to do so I end up getting stuck on certain words or saying something that doesn't make sense. I also think I have something like psuedo-depression, if that's the right thing to call it? Things feel pretty hopeless and I often think about what I could've done to avoid my current life, but I don't have a want to hurt or kill myself and I wouldn't say I genuinely hate myself, I just find myself annoying.

Anyway, onto the reason I titled this post what I did. I have a very small group of friends spread over two locations, one of which is 100 miles away and is hard to visit given covid and such. Overall I'd say I have roughly 10 people I'd call friends and of those 10 maybe 2 or 3 that are close friends, in addition I've never had a girlfriend which is something that I want to do in the not too distant future by bettering myself mentally. 

I've set myself a goal to try and socialise, by choice (i.e not at work), at least once a week. The issue with this is, I find it really difficult to meet new people as I don't like places with large crowds and I struggle talking to new people even when it is a quieter setting. Like I say my friend group is limited so I don't want to be a burden to them and make them like they're all I've got, plus I want to meet new people anyway. 

Do you think this is a good way to help give my life direction, help me out of my position and, if so, how would you go about it? where are some good places to meet new people easily, especially with the covid situation. 

Thanks all.",15Sep2020,1
204,"I might actually get an appointment with the GP and get an assessment to see if I'm applicable to get treatment in a mental health hospital but I'm really losing my grip on reality. Is it worth the struggle?

I found myself thinking of suicide a lot more these past few months and it's starting to make me feel that sickness again, like the sick feeling you get in your brain when you do something messed up. I'm really nervous to speak to someone, I get so nervous talking over the phone too, but I really want to get better, I don't want to feel sick anymore.",15Sep2020,1
205,"Pre-cap: I am 22, and I've developed OCD since I was like 16 and something. Being in love at 15/16 has fcked up my hormones (if I saw that girl back then it felt literally like a punch in your stomach and my knees were weak like jelly). Before that I was a normal boy without ANY OCD

**Worldview intrusive thoughts**

I do not want to say what my worldviews are specifically to not start a debate here. 

But just for the sake of the example, let's say, someone has communistic views. He then hears some, for him, good or at least interesting arguments ""Why communism doesn't work"" and so on. He then cannot find peace until he finds a good counter argument to be ""in equilibrium"" again. It seems sometimes so hopeless to find a counter argument that he literally gets nihilistic that ""what's the point being here if communism doesn't work?"", but the more is his joy if he finds a counter argument for himself

I am not a communist, this is just an example. But this is what I feel like if my worldview is challenged. It's like I can't keep cool or something. It doesn't have to be political, it can be philosophical, teological, whatever.

I once tried to simply tell myself ""Maybe the counterpart is right, who knows, maybe yes maybe no"". It worked, until I started to think things like ""Maybe I'm dumb, maybe not, who knows"" and it ended with a nervous breakdown when I came down to ""Maybe the world i see is what it is, maybe not, maybe it's just a simulation, nobody knows, maybe your red is redder than mine, nobody knows"". So this coping mechanism will not work for me.

**Super Checking Everything**

As I am a height challenged guy, I literally get obssessed with sentences containing the words ""short, shot, shoot, tall, tail, tale, tell, little, big, large, small, etc"". I firstly make sure that I've read it correctly, and then think about the context of the sentence. 

I also check other normal words ocassionally, or if ""there's not a . or something else left if you go to the very right or very left of a sentence where's the background usually"". 

The same checking goes for listening to videos - I usually go like 15 times back with the left arrow key on YouTube just ""to get it right""

I am just afraid that I'll not read or hear anything and that the context I'll be missing would be insulting me, like my height or nationality or something else. Also I just don't like to not know things, because it feels like a little voice inside of me tells me that ""ha ha you forgot what Homer Simpson said at 10:24 min in the ""Homer loves Ned"" episode)

I also check doors and lights a lot, or if there runs no water in the sink by pressing the faucet multiple times

211,"I'm 27M (gay if that helps), and my sister is 30F. We're both single. She's been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and has had depressive episodes intermittently for over a decade. 

The thing is, my sister is extremely unsociable. She's been fired often from jobs, and is often in conflict with her bosses or coworkers. She also has episodes every few weeks (sometimes more often) where she becomes extremely verbally abusive and sometimes physically violent as well. We've got no other family, and not much money either. So I've kind of become my sister's keeper, if that makes sense. I love her, but the truth is, I've wanted to move out since I was 18, and it's never happened because I know she's got no one else and she can't be alone. I've come to a point where I've accepted that I'm gonna probably live with her for the rest of my life. I wouldn't mind that, if only not for the times when she gets aggressive. She's generally negative and hates everything and everyone. I feel it's affected my mental health and I haven't been able to have any long lasting romantic relationships because I'm pretty messed up as well. (I feel I can't blame her entirely for my issues as that's pushing blame.)

For the last year or so, I have been feeling more resentful towards her with every passing day. I know that's terrible of me because she's a good person and it's the disorder that makes her this way. But I can't help think how I'm missing out on a normal life and a shot at happiness. I've been feeling low, have distanced myself from all friends, and have had suicidal thoughts (but I would never actually do it). I also know it will break my sister completely if I left her. I don't know what to do.

212,"I wanted to share this technique because it has helped me so much. 

It's called 5-4-3-2-1 and how it works is, whenever you begin to feel anxiety or panic coming on, in your head or out loud you:

1. Name 5 things you see
2. Name 4 things you hear
3. Name 3 things that you feel, physically (example: I feel my feet on the floor)
4. Name 2 things that you smell
5. Name 1 thing you taste

It's so simple, but so effective. I find that it works better than other mindfulness techniques, when I'm feeling really intense anxiety. It gives my mind just enough to do and it really brings me back into my body and the present moment.

And I don't just take antidepressants (which aren't working, by the way), I also take a med for chronic GI issues and, more importantly, meds for my epilepsy, which I need in order to *prevent seizures* (obviously). The point is, my other meds are important, but they won't kill me. (I don't have suicidal tendencies, so my depression won't.) A seizure isn't going to cause my death or something, but falling and hitting my head hard enough or falling when I'm near a busy road could.

216,"Hi,

So lately I've been having a really hard time. I had a bad sexual experience about 2 weeks ago where I was pressured into doing things I didn't really want to do (I consented out of fear) and he was doing drugs, however I managed to get out and thought that was it. However I then started noticing rashes and red bumps on my genitals and I've been absolutely freaking out. I got onto my doctor and he gave me some cream which hasn't done much, so I now have to sort out an appointment with a sexual health clinic, with the probability that I have herpes. This has caused me immense stress and has really made me mad at myself, extremely anxious and panicky (especially when the symptoms flare up) and has destroyed my confidence. I can't sleep, and have had suicidal thoughts several times. I'm just really worried for my future, like how am I ever meant to get into a relationship and find someone to love if I have this? Especially since it is incurable. So thats one things that been extremely stressful.

Additionally, I started my new placement (i'm a student) last week, and so far it has been pretty stressful. It's a small studio (8 people) and we are producing a product to sell at the end of the year, but there have been quite a few issues so far with people not getting along at all, ideas and people being ignored etc. I thankfully am not really too involved in this drama, but obviously it still affects me. Anyway, this week (last tuesday to today) we were producing a small product just to see how things go, and it crashed and burned. In the end we had nothing to present and there were several very heated arguments. Thankfully people seemed to really like my work and everybody praised me at the end (not trying to sound cocky or anything just literally recalling what happened) so I have that going for me, but that along side the sexual health situation has just completely stressed me out and I feel like screaming.

Thirdly, my friends have been really upset due to one of the friends (lets call him A) basically calling one of the other friends (B) horrible things, and really causing alot of arguments. Person B is understandably upset, but what really makes it worse is how two of my friends in the friendship group are living with person A. Therefore, they are having to find a new person to live with because person A is going to move out, but this happened literally 2 weeks after most students signed their contracts so its a real struggle. This again is causing Person B to really suffer (I live with person B) and understandably the whole friendship group is having a really hard time. I have really bad anxiety issues, and when theres conflict or drama my first response is to just shut down - my brain stops thinking and I become zombie like so that has again, really not helped everything else.

Finally, I really hate dating. Each time I find someone that I like, and want to get to know better, I just fuck it up and I don't know why. Like, everytime I just dont seem to be attractive to them, or they get to know me and leave or something and I just hate it! I try my best to be spontaneous and fun, to be caring and to listen to them and just try to be myself but each time it has gone wrong and I don't get it. It's like i'm turning them off and I don't understand why, like perhaps i'm just putting signals out there that i'm unavailable or something? The last couple of guys that i've liked and got to know better just stopped wanting anything to do with me after a month or two, and now that theres this whole herpes thing I just feel doomed to be alone. Additionally, i'm developing feelings for one of my coworkers and he is giving me so many mixed signals I just cannot tell what is what with him. Like I really wish I just wasn't developing feelings for him at all, its just making things worse.

233,"Day 15 of **Suicide Prevention Month**. We are halfway through! 

What is happiness? When was the last time you felt happy, if ever? 

**Happiness** = the state of being happy. 

Do you see that definition? The STATE of being happy. Does it say that you have to be happy continuity? No. Do you know why? It’s impossible to be. You’re not going to be happy 24/7, 7 days a week. It doesn’t work out like that. If that was the case, the World would be in a perfect condition and not in the state it’s currently in. But, that’s for another day... 

You’re more than likely lurking and posting on this sub due to lack of **happiness**. You’re simply not a happy person. In fact, you’re suffering, hurting and at times, on the verge of tears. I get that. I understand you. Believe you me, if you’re looking for happiness by lurking/posting on this particular sub, it’s going to take a while for happiness to come to you. Or, as usual, for some people, the feelings of happiness comes and goes. Today, you may be happy for approximately 2 hours and then unhappy for the other 22 hours. The next day, it could be the opposite. We cannot tell when we are going to be happy or not. Usually, we can feel it when waking up in the morning. You’ll either wake up to the sunshine shining through your window, the smell of freshly cut grass, the comfiness of your cushions and the feeling of relaxation. **Or** you wake up in the morning to worrying thoughts, signs of regret, a hatred for yourself, not wanting to leave the bed and locking yourself in the bedroom. 

We all wish to be happy every single day, every single second. But, that’s not the case. We get good days, but we all get our fair share of bad days. For some people, in a year, they’ll get roughly 75% bad days and 25% good days, it’s rare for them. In today’s post, I will share some tips and advice on ways to be happier, even it if lifts your mood up a little. I sincerely hope some of these will help you out and if so, carry on doing them. :) 

**Never Forget To Enjoy Yourself**

Life was made for enjoyment. Life was made for laughter and having fun. But, at the end of the day, we don’t experience it all times. As previously said, many people don’t experience it at all. One way of finding the true happiness inside of you is trying to find enjoyment in anything you do. If you’re suffering from depression or mental health, I understand that this will be extremely difficult for you. You will start to lose interest on the things/activities you’ve loved for years, you will simply lose interest. When you feel ready to do so, find an activity you’ve always wanted to try or give a go. By doing so, not only will you find enjoyment in it but you will learn at the same time. :) Doing the things you enjoy is brilliant for your emotional wellbeing. This can be the simplest of activities such as walking, watching TV, listening to music, reading and many more. Anything! 

**Become A Healthier Person**

Nobody wants to wake up in the morning, looking into the mirror and not be impressed at what’s looking back at them. This will heavily damage your confidence. Instead, start a healthy lifestyle ASAP. Don’t worry, I’m not asking you to run 500miles today, so breathe! When it comes to having a more healthy lifestyle, you have to start off slow then build up your progress, whenever you feel ready for it to grow. For example, today, throw out all the junk foods you have in your cupboard, replace them with healthy fruit and vegetables. Whenever you’re hungry in the day, instead of eating a chocolate bar, replace it with a banana or an apple! Secondly, after a few weeks of healthy eating and you feel better within yourself, it’ll then be time to start exercising. If I was in your position, I would start with a very easy exercise to build yourself up. For example,  a slow relaxing walk. Personally, I enjoy walks where nobody is about, that sense of freedom and the fresh air hitting you in the face. Lovely! If you’re not comfortable going for a walk or a run when people are about, you can either go for an evening run (if it’s dark, remember to wear high vis jacket!) or a morning run (which can be very nice), it will wake you up and get you ready for the day ahead. Once you get used to eating healthy and starting a slow exercise programme, it’ll then be time to up it a little. Instead of walking, go for a slow job and so on. Exercising takes time, if you can’t see any Improves, don’t worry about it, it’s all about patience and you’ll eventually get to where you plan on being. :) 

**Keep Your Busy**

As they say, busier, the better! Although researchers say that becoming busy shows the feeling of “rushed” which could possibly make you more stressed and unhappy, keeping your busy will also keep your thoughts and worries out of your head for the time being. Studies have suggested that balancing your free time is key, at times it can lead to boredom. Your target should being having a productive life at a comfortable pace. Constantly being busy is no good, constantly having free time, is no good, it’s time to balance it. Add 1 and 1 together, you’ll get the perfect answer. As previously said, when you’ve made yourself busy, for example: cleaning the house, it’ll give your mind some rest as it will be focusing more on cleaning the house, rather than having dark thoughts and think of past mistakes and regrets. Make yourself busy! 

**Self-Talk**

One of my personal favourites. Sure, it sounds a little crazy but having mini conversations with yourself throughout the day can help you greatly. Let me say, I don’t have a FULL ON conversation with myself.. “Hey”, “Hey”, “How are you?”, “Good thanks you”, not like that! Sell-Talk is a good way to motivate yourself whenever you’re feeling down or anxious. Say a few words to yourself here and there, you don’t have to say it out loud, say it under your breath, if you may. For example, if you look at yourself in the mirror in the morning, tell yourself “I’ll get through it today”, “I will overcome this” or “I’m stronger than this”. A little words to yourself can help you throughout the days. When all said and done, YOU are there for yourself at all times, YOU have your own back and YOU know exactly how YOU feel. 

**Family Time Is Best Time**

I don’t know about you, but spending time with my family is the greatest thing in the world. I adore them and I always will. That being said, if you have strong love for your family, then what should you do? You’ve got it, spend more time around them. Family members are there to make you feel safe and secured. They will always be there for you no matter what. Unfortunately, some people no longer have their family members and my heart goes out to you, but this can also work for friends. Nobody’s said that friends can’t be your family too. A true friend will look out for you and be there for you whenever you need them. Instead of locking yourself in your room, eating Cheetos and watching Netflix in the dark, phone up a friend, talk to a friend over social media and when the pandemic is finally over, go and meet a few of them (don’t forget your mask!). Family and friends can make you feel great, especially when it’s full of smiling and laughter. It’s the best medicine! 

If you’ve made it this far, thank you very much for reading, I hope you learned a thing or 2! In life, the #1 priority for everyone should be happiness. When you’ve experienced happiness, you never want to lose it. But if you do, which you will, do everything in your power to get it back. If you’re in any need of further help, guidance or some support, feel free to message me at anytime. My PM’s are open for you needs, I look forward to hearing from you. Cheerio! 😊",15Sep2020,1

235,"Hey everyone, 
just wanted to say a couple of words about something on my mind lately. 
My flatmate has been struggeling with PTSD and is now away at a therapy center. 
Before she left i was mainly doing the household chores as she had terrible days where even getting up was a struggle. She was constantly apologizing even though i told her it was fine. 
So here's my word out to you. 
It's okay if the biggest thing you managed to do today was make your bed or brush your teeth or whatever little thing. 
You are not a burden, you're doing the best you can, no matter your home circumstance. 
The most important thing is that you keep trying and accept a helping hand without feeling crap about it. 
And if the people around you don't say it enough: you matter and are loved",15Sep2020,1

238,"Since I (17F) started being more aware and concerned about my mental health, I've also become really insecure about even thinking about it because sometimes I feel like I'm just overreacting. I keep thinking that ""it's not a big deal, a lot of people feel stressed"" and that ""it could be because this is my last year in highschool and I'm just stressed out"". I really want to see a therapist to finally get an answer but I'm terrified of them telling me something like ""you don't seem to have any problems regarding your mental health"" because then, how do I justify feeling so unmotivated and lazy the past month? (not that I know anything about how therapists and diagnoses work) I have been a good student all my life and this happening so suddenly at such an important time is terryifying. In previous years I have felt like ""oh I'm getting tired of studying"" but never to this extent?? Could it be that my body and mind are tired from years of consistently working hard? That it's an accumulation of negative feelings? But that sounds ridiculous, I've just never heard of something like this happen to anyone. During august this was less of a problem because we didn't have school every day, but now I'm even more scared of not being able to complete my schoolwork simply because I cannot sit down and do it. 
And the most scary thing is, what if I'm simply lazy? How do I even change that? Because I really don't think I can do it on my own at this point... My teachers are always demanding things from us and telling us to just, you know, do the work that we have to do??? But it's so so hard for me to do that. My parents have always been supporting of me and they still support me, but at this point it feels like we're disconnected when it comes to this because I'm taking a diploma that is very different to the one they completed. So asking them for help feels like a bother when it comes to certain things like essays. 
I'm just rambling at this point but I'm so scared of disappointing my teachers who have faith in me because last year I was a very good student. And I also absolutely do not want to stay behind in any of the work that we have to complete because it'll be a nightmare to catch up later on and I don't know if I'll have the energy to do that in the following months... I really want to get good grades like last year or even get better grades than that, in order to get to the university that I want, but it feels like it's becoming more and more impossible now that I'm like this all of a sudden",15Sep2020,1
239,"my boyfriend and i both have bpd. we’ve always been a bit volatile. i guess we have both treated each other poorly. he has cheated on me, but i forgave him. he has abandoned me. and ghosted and gaslit me, and i forgave him. he is now saying i am gaslighting him. i can openly admit i’ve been so dismissive of his feelings.... i disgust myself. i try talking to him and explaining myself but i usually turn it into an argument. for example, i expect a lot of him. like to retrieve things if i ever am sitting, which is so often as i am lazy. expecting prompt replies to messages, doing dirty work for me that i prefer not to, expecting essentially to be pampered. he had been saying he didnt mind, but the truth is i’m a lazy fuck and he hates it. i need to support myself. 

recently i’ve really been bad. almost anything that comes out of his mouth i disagree with. my moods swing between bitterness and anger, to sudden, almost manic happiness and hyper. back to pissed or sad. he tries so hard not to hurt my feelings, but i still get offended. the biggest issue is i still view myself as correct in a lot of situations, but have conceeded that my brain must be lying. 

i have been having memory lapses. my grip on reality is loosening. i have false memories and things that apparently happened that i have little or no recollection of. i can barely be civil to people, but they are all so fucking annoying!!!

my boyfriend and i are soul mates. i choose him. we have decided to go through this life thick or thin. the transfressions he’s made have been fully forgiven. his actions were a result of his mental illness, just like me. when my mental health is stable, the steady love i feel for him is insane and beautiful and real. i know i just need to fix myself to get through this. but i don’t know how. i have a therapist but i dont think she understands how severe my situation is. i’m afraid to tell her i have been plagued with thoughts of self harm to relieve my internal pain. i don’t want an ambulance sent to me. i don’t want to admit i have self harmed, even if i dont consider it major. 

my boyfriend told me we need space. a few days away from each other. it’s been a while since we have been. he thinks i should go to the hospital. do you agree?? should i go inpatient? my mom is encouraging me to reach out to my therapist. i’m scared to go and not have access to my phone, vape, or weed. i don’t really know that it will help me as a lot of the root of my problems lays in the structure or our society. i am in the US for context. i could really use some advice. thank you.",15Sep2020,1

What am I even supposed to say at an interview when they ask for skills or something? Lie? I have no skills and I’m a terrible liar. I have bad posture and terrible at presenting my self. I stumble and stutter my words a lot and even if I somehow fake my confidence that would still ruin everything. Am I basically screwed for the rest of my life?

I went to bed at 12... 

This is still more sleep than ive been getting recently anyway so i thought id be fine. Anyway im coasting through the day with a sleep deprivation headache that i dealt with fine. And we get to the final lesson, geography. Geography is known to do two things to me, 1) put me to sleep, and 2) make me not care about anyone or anything. But when i got into the lesson i felt so fucking stressed out that i couldnt help but maniacally laugh for a solid 20 mins at different things. When i finally got myself under control i felt so embarrased and just confused at what just happened that i started crying. Mid class. Im a silent crier because my body cant take the idea of showing other people my weaknesses, so there i was silently crying and i suddenly realise the absurdity of it all. Its just one fucking day i thought. 

So there i was, laughing again like its no bodys business and i feel genuinely insane. And when i say maniacally laughing i mean uncontrollable, joker-esque laugh.

I just started therapy for my depression and already my therapist is wanting to send me to a hospital. She says she feels I’m a danger to myself and others and she’d prefer I start medicine management quickly by going to a psychiatric hospital.

I don't seem to care about my friends for which there are few in number and far in proximity. I don't know what it is I understand more so than others do nor do I think I have the energy to find out. 

All I do know is that I simply exist. I have no traits; no defining characteristics that I can recognise and truly call my own. I feel like an imitation. A shadow cast in the shape of someone else yet never something so easily confined or understood. The truth of the matter is that I have no identity. I exist as a blank slate: A cup, waiting to be filled with whatwver convenient truth needs to be swallowed. For my mother I'm a young adult focusing on his education. For my friends I'm a kind, yet somewhat aloof individual with an intense interest for the unknown and a passion for things yet to be understood yet I never actually believe any of these pre-packaged versions of myself.

Today I got up at around 10, they had gone to my grandmother's at around 8. I made breakfast, watched a movie, opened some packages, and made meatballs with mozzarella in them for dinner because mom made a joke about me making supper and I wanted to help. I put all my package stuff away and left the stuff I'd need for dinner out so I could make dinner later on. 

Dad immediately got home and started getting annoyed that there was stuff out on the counter (Some cheese I was going to eat, but had forgotten about, 6 small bites, and the breadcrumbs, and the toaster.) 

I went in a bit later because he called me to the kitchen, and immediately put away the toaster, my mom asked why the breadcrumbs were out so I said they're for what was in the fridge. He got mad, and when I say mad, I mean the whole ""Well mom hasn't looked in the fridge, I haven't looked in the fridge stop giving us attitude and disrespecting us"" Lecture, while yelling, as I was trying to get rid of my mess. 

When I say I'm not good with yelling, I mean, if anyone starts yelling angrily, at me or not, I'm bawling. I can't control it, I just start deteriorating into a ball of crying. I put the cheese in the compost, and he yelled at me for that because it doesn't belong in the compost (pests and all). 

He brought up that I don't have a job, and I should get one so I can get out of the house if I want to stay up late (I stay up until about 1-2am and wake up around 10am, and get out of my room at about 12pm, because I'll make stories or continue dreams in my head or scroll through my phone.

Basically, I am scared that I already messed up on my second day of university. Yesterday we had to sign in into different lists for groups, which were for the appointments for the introduction to the library and the website. I thought I signed up for group 1 (there were 7 groups in total).  
Well, yesterday in the afternoon, that plan changed and somehow an 8th group was added and some times shifted around. All groups will have the same introduction, just at different times because of the current situation.

So I went to the group 1 appointment today, just to see that no one of my major was there. I thought it's alright, maybe they signed into the lists earlier. Turns out, we were 10 people in the group instead of 9, which were suppose to be there. So I went to the lady, who held the instruction for the website, and saw that my name wasn't on the list. I was horribly confused by that. She said, she'll keep my name in mind, maybe the lists were off. She also said I could take part at the library introduction (there was a break inbetween) and that it should be fine.

That's what I did. Now I know everything about the website and the library. Only at home it occured to me, I might have misread 7 for 1 and maybe I am signed in for group 7. And that's basically what I am overthinking. As I wrote, I did talk to the instructors and they said it's fine. I was there after all. I know everything that I need to know about the library and the website, so there would be no use for me to go to one of the other appointments. I even asked a friend (who has a later appoinment), if she could ask, if that lady from the website instruction remembers me, so I don't get in any trouble.

253,"Hi r/mentalhealth,

First, I hope this is the right sub to be posting in for help with resources. If not, can somebody point me to the proper sub for that? Anyway I’d appreciated some advice/resources to sort out my brothers living situation... 

Diagnosis/Substance Abuse:

A few years ago, my brother (21) was diagnosed with bipolar disorder with a psychotic component. I personally think his symptoms more closely align with schizoaffective disorder (https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schizoaffective-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20354504), but our dad has bipolar disorder which might have influenced the doctor’s diagnosis. I’m not a doctor though, so this is the only official diagnosis he’s got. 

He also struggles with substance abuse issues. Mostly Xanax as far as I know, but he was a heavy pot smoker in high school and got into cocaine in high school as well.

He’s seen multiple psychiatrists over the years, but basically refuses to continue seeing them if they don’t prescribe him benzos.

He also went to a PHP program for several days but refused to continue. 

Living Situation:

My brother currently lives with my mom. My sister and I have been out of the house for a few years now. My dad lives with his girlfriend about 30 min away from my mom’s house.

In March of this year, he and my mom got in a fight and he pushed her out of the house and pulled a knife on her. My mom called my dad who called the police. They came and arrested my brother, who had been in jail for the past few months, but was released in the middle of August. 

This last incident (along with previous anger issues) made it clear that he and my mom should not be living together anymore.

Question:

My sister has been looking into finding places for him to stay. She’s looked at local NAMI support groups, buying a trailer and renting a lot in a trailer park, Section 8 housing, Mental Health America’s housing webpage, SAMHSA’s housing webpage, Healthy Place’s housing webpage, and the Public Housing Agency’s website.

Does anybody know of any other resources that we might be missing? He gets just over $900/month in disability benefits. The rest of us can afford to pitch in around $100/month for whatever we can find. We live in Pasco/Hillsborough County, Florida.

Every night, she would bounce her legs until she falls asleep. I asked her why she does these things, She said that she's been that way since she was small, and she likes cutting into things because she wants to know what's inside. 

I remember that her parents told me abt how when she was small, they would hide away all the scissors or sharp objects because she would cut open every single thing that she could reach for.

Its ""one size fits all.""

Take it or leave it

Im scared of opening up to people as I worry what they'd think of me. I haven't even told my parents or my best friends this (whom I've known for about 8-9 years) due to this fear. 



It's the first time I've told anyone this. I'm sharing this in a public forum for hopes to find something which can help me or help someone who's in a similar situation.

Thank you.",15Sep2020,1

But it feels like a burden these days. Just few minutes after sitting on my chair, i start feeling restless and annoyed, and i give up. I feel sad and tired throughout the day for really no specific reason. Every night i sleep dissatisfied due to pretty much wasting my entire day.

268,"I'm a teenager in the UK. I'm also probably on the spectrum (haven't been diagnosed yet). School has been back on for nearly two weeks and I'm struggling to keep up. There's so much work and I have no motivation at all. Everything's disorganized and the systems I've made to keep on track are falling apart. Not even my bullet journal is helping.

I've been anxious about everything constantly and my parents are no help. My Dad literally hugged me and said, ""Don't be anxious honey. There's nothing to worry about.""

I know that I shouldn't be worried about this stuff but I am anyway. I've had two minor panic attacks and three meltdowns this week.

Math seems to be the class I have the most trouble with. I'm actually good at math but the teacher is really loud and let's people talk about the work so it all gets overwhelming.

I've been doing a lot of bad stims too. Biting my fingers, scratching my arms all that. I've been trying to stim less because I don't want my teachers to get mad at me for fidgeting. It is not working.

I'm also being bullied for being gay. It's not like physical violence or anything (except for the time someone threw a rock at me but I sure he was aiming at something else).

Its mostly just people yelling slurs at me in the halls or making obscene comments about me having sex with other girls while I'm nearby. I know they know I can hear them too.

My mom is contemplating getting me a therapist to help manage my ASD. I really want one but she is eering on the not get one side.

I get that I'm super privileged considering I have well off parents and my mom is willing to get me help if I convince her I need it. My dad less so but what can you do? The thing is I don't know if I can talk to a therapist for ASD about all these things. Will they tell my mom about our sessions? What if they hate me for being gay?

I really need some support and maybe some advice here. Has anyone been through a similar process?",15Sep2020,1
269,"I am living on campus, and my campus is basically forcing everyone off it. If you live here you can come, but if you don't they literally escort you off. TBH my mental health can give less of a shit if its COVID and whatnot, and it really hit me hard. I know how to deal with this shit, its just a question of why am I dealing with this shit. 

I wanted to see my friend for so long, and have tried to get her on campus for a long time we were so close today, she literally got on and then everything just failed all at once. I feel completely isolated and there is no hope of seeing her again. Her family and living situation is an ass, and I absolutely hate her mom, so the only way we can actually meet up is if she comes her but now it feels like that's not even an option. 

Why do people assume that everyone would be okay living in 24/7 isolation, I think people on this campus are more likely to die from suicide than from COVID like legit, this campus is LOCKDOWN. No everyone wears masks and social distances and everyone has to take mandatory tests and mandatory vaccines. We have probably 0 COVID but are acting like an elderly society, where anyone coming on this campus is a health risk when in reality its not that bad.

I just feel like a statistic at this point, it doesn't matter how dire my need for personal interaction is, all that matters is I don't get COVID. O look he killed himself at least he didn't get COVID!

The main problem with restricting it this much is, that it, yes, restricts people who just want to have hookups and shit, but it also restricts people with mental health problems. My friend has literally attempted suicide a few times since I have been talking to her, and the feeling you get when you can't help them because you are away is massive. I feel like if they died I wouldn't know until a few months because I am so isolated on this campus. I have very little ways of leaving, and it just feels like I am stuck here forever.

I am going to follow my own personal philosophy and try to calm myself through this, but I fear for my friend and people more vulnerable than me.",15Sep2020,1
270,"Throw away account for obvious reasons. Lil background on me, 28 mom was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, I'm single, stopped going to therapy because I lost insurance, I smoke weed and drink a lot, it ""evens"" me out. Or atleast I tell myself that.. I've always been depressed, feel like in my later 20s I really figured out how to get a grip on it. I was going to therapy for around 6 months when I lost insurance, for the last three months I've not seen any medical professional. 

A month ago a family member was going through some medical shit and it was really hard on me emotionally. Family member IS better, and I feel good about that situation now. However, recently I've noticed weird feelings and urges, some of which are scary. The other week when I was laying on the couch watching something my roommate sat down, I had my feet up on the back of the couch and for some reason started feeling like kicking him in the head... I started feeling scared and telling myself ""stop thinking this"" but the urge wouldn't go away.. It wasn't a voice or anything it was just a feeling, a thought that crept in and would not go away.  After 10 mins of feeling like kicking my roommate in the head I started playing on my phone and I was able to get out of that mindset.. never have I ever felt that away, I've never felt like hurting someone in such an unprovoked way, I've never hurt animals, violence has always grossed me out. If this was a one off thing I wouldn't think much of it, but since that first time it's happened almost everyday. I've never actually kicked, but it's this urge, almost a craving to want and kick my roommates head when we are on the couch. I can't see myself ever acting in it, but it scares me. 

Before that happened another situation happened that was similar. I was at a party pretty fucked up. A female friend of mine was sitting across from me when I started feeling like I wanted to makeout. I've NEVER felt feelings sexually for this person, just a friend. It wasn't just like ""oh I'm going to try and hookup with her,"" it was like a day dream of me just getting up going over to her and making out right there. I got up  didn't say anything, went to the bathroom and started sticking my fingers in my mouth and stretching my cheeks, I have no idea why. maybe i just wanted to stop feeling that urge. Again, I have literally never done any of that before, the feeling, the fingers in the mouth.. I have punched myself in the face while drunk in efforts to sober up, but the motivation behind this felt different.  At that point I just left the party without saying goodbye to anyone and I felt like I was a monster.",15Sep2020,1
271,"I’ve been doing things now that are “risky” behavior that could hurt me or put my life in danger. I get the fucked up thrill out of it that satiates me.

I’ve been accelerating, peddle to the floor, going up to 70 miles and hour and swerving. I’ve been running stop signs. I took some u-turns so harsh today I made tire tracks. At one point I was in far right line next to the curb and a driver in a large truck was next to me. Usually I’d stay behind the truck so they can see me. People have honked at me for trying to stay in the line of sight of the driver before lol.  This time I sped up in the driver’s blind spot and this guy was so close to my lane he almost ran me onto the curb. I’ve been experimenting with not wearing a seatbelt and today I opened the door on the way home and ran a red light.

A few weeks ago I lay in the middle of the road in the middle of the night to see what it would feel like. I also drank and mixed all my medications. I’ve been overdosing on medications when upset. Also, self-harming of course lol. And today I saw a sign at school that pissed me off so I ripped up the sign and threw it out the window and also ripped a flow out of the ground. 

The worst thing I’ve been doing is playing chicken with other cars. I pull on the opposite side of the road into oncoming traffic and then pull back into my lane. I also today went into the men’s bathroom and hurled the doorstop at the wall, lol. I’m a girl.",15Sep2020,1

273,"Tldr; I feel like I don't have a purpose to my life. How do I find one? What do you think your purpose is?

After years of putting it off, I finally got myself into therapy. It's been going great so far, but my therapist hit me with something hard in my last appointment that has me stuck. And I know this is gonna be long, so apologies for that.

I was expressing to him how I always feel very anxious in the mornings right from the time I wake up. I believe it's mostly tied to work as I feel it on days that I work and on Sundays before I have to go back. It's been very stressful for me lately. I'm in a job that I haven't ever had experience in before and I'm still learning, so needless to say I haven't been perfect at it. I constantly worry about messing something up. I constantly am worried about being a disappointment, and not just at work. He told me that I'm basing my worth as a human being off of my successes and failures, and that's not how I should look at myself because every time I fail it hits me really hard. It's not reliable. A more reliable metric would be to find a purpose in something that allows more with my values.

Thing is, I don't know what my values are anymore. I've been going through a lot with my family and left the religion that I grew up with all my life. I used to think my values were loyalty, hard working, and selfless. Well, since the issues with my family has lead me to want to get rid of that kind of baggage in my life and not deal with my family, and that doesn't sound very loyal. I thought I was hard working, but it seems like no matter how much I work it doesn't seem to make me happy. I still can't afford the things I want, and it never seems to be enough. I was taught by my church that in order to be happy I have to forget myself and serve others, leading me to completely ignore how I feel and what I need. I'm at a place in my life where I want to focus on myself; actually get to know who I really am without feeling bad about it, and to think about my needs before discarding them for someone else. But that also means that I feel like I'm a selfish person.

If I don't base my purpose and value in my life on my successes, then what do I base it on? Just that I'm overall a good person? That kind of seems like too easy if an answer to me. I dunno, maybe I'm overthinking things.  I guess I would like to have a reason to feel like I should be alive, because I currently don't. Sorry to dump all my thoughts here, but I like having deep conversations with people.",15Sep2020,1

I have always had amazing grades without ever having to study or anything, the only thing I’ve ever made a B in is math but even then the final end of semester grades are always As.

275,"My sister (48) and I (51) live in different states (me NYher CT). She’s always been “tricky” to get along with. I suspect some type of mental illness but she’s never been properly diagnosed. She lives in disabled housing in ct after losing her home to foreclosure. She lives in a tiny 1 br with two large dogs (Great Dane Australian shepherd). The Great Dane has gotten out and terrorized some smaller dogs and cats in the housing development. Now the police have taken both dogs away. 

These dogs are my sisters whole life. She lost her job to Covid, her unemployment ran out and she won’t be allowed to see either dog again. Her neighbors are all at odds with her, and it took her so long to find this place. She talks about “seeking revenge” against these neighbors then, in the next minute she talks about being tired of living and wants to end it all. 

She was very active in her church but I think they had recommended she give up the dogs and she refused to listen so I don’t think she wants to go back there. 

I would invite her to live with me but our relationship is best when we don’t live near each other. She can be difficult to get along with.

279,"At the beginning of 2020, before most people thought that life would soon revolve around avoiding a coronavirus, I estimated that I had about 50/50 odds of dying from suicide in the next couple years, and would almost certainly be dead by the end of the decade. No immediate plans to do anything about it, but it does feel inevitable. I've been a student for basically my whole life, in a field that I'm not truly passionate about and can't see myself ever employed in, and if I could find the motivation, I'd be nearing the end of my PhD, which I basically equate with the end point of my life (I have no other aspirations or marketable skills).

So it's been stressful, in a way, to see the rest of society put so much emphasis on the sacredness of *life* and *health* over the past 6 months. If I get really unlucky and die of Covid-19, that's totally fine by me. Saves me the trouble of having to do it myself. The risk of death from this virus has always been lower than my daily desire for death, so the whole thing almost feels like a tease. It's strange to remember that social media used to be full of edgy memes about young people being tempted by death because their lives are so pointless, and these are all just... suddenly gone? Did people not really feel that way?

It's also stressful that I now have a highly taboo political opinion, that the preventive policies much more harmful than the pandemic itself. I don't care if I die, but I don't want my last few years of life to be more miserable than they have to be. Right now one of my main motivations for staying alive is to see the ""new normal"" eventually rejected by society. If it prevails permanently, I won't be sticking around.

287,"First, some demographics. 22M, medically diagnosed with ADHD, Anxiety, and Clinical Depression. I'm not on any medication for my mental conditions.

I have a lot to be thankful for in my life. I grew up with a family that fed and supported me, I was never homeless, I have a job that isn't going anywhere despite the pandemic, have a decent income considering my age and lack of degree, enrolled in college, and I'm decently healthy. And alive, that's pretty important too. 

That being said I often sit here and just think about how drastically different my life is to most people. I have only two friends, no joke. Both are online and hundreds-thousands of miles from me. I'm extremely introverted and shy. I don't trust people. I have big problems with envy too. If I'm envious of someone, I feel strong hatred toward them, no matter how petty the thing I'm envious over is. Sometimes this can spill over and I'll wall off an entire community. I'm also shy to reach out into the hobby-related communities where that isn't a problem. But social issues aren't the only problem I'm dealing with at the moment. 

I lack motivation. As a kid I used to royally piss people off on the internet with my Mountain Dew fueled levels of enthusiasm. These days I just don't give a single fuck about anything. My career and hobbies barely interest me anymore. There's still some interest here and there, but I'll usually pick it up, dick about with it a little bit, experience either some form of resistance, failure, boredom, or worst case ""someone else ruins it for me"", and then say eh fuck it I don't feel like it anymore and just let it go for a while. 

I don't see a career change as something suitable. I'm too deep down the rabbit hole I chose and anything I'd remotely be interested in as an alternative is either is too much above my head or it's not enough to make a living off of. This isn't me wanting to sit around and play video games, I'm talking stuff like being an auto mechanic or communications engineer. 

I am enrolled in college but my lack of interest in.... well.... anything really... has resulted in me stalling around and not wanting to do my work. Which isn't doing my any favors. I'd like to get it done and over with so I can move out and live on my own. 

I also have mounds of debt due to impulsive spending. I don't even have most of the things I've bought over the years anymore. And even of the things I still do have (which don't total up in value a lot), only a fraction of it is stuff I actually consider worth the money. I tried numerous times to get out of debt, but I just fall back into the same trap all over again. Or I put myself in the hole with medical debt. It seems somewhat hopeless. But at least I don't have any negative marks on my report, so that's one good thing going for me.

I've sought therapy, the particular therapist was more interested in talking about COVID which doesn't really bother me so much on the emotional level given that I barely go out and do stuff. I broke off with him. I haven't sought help of another therapist, life has been too busy with work and by time the day is over I feel exhausted and don't feel like doing anything.

I'm terrified of medicating. I've had bad run-ins with side effects. My previous PCP wanted me to try Xanax, and that was an immediate nope from me. Heard too many bad stories about that drug and don't want to risk the side effects. 

My self-esteem is in the pits, I'm just going to leave it at that.

I'm at wits end. I'm ***terrified*** of death so thankfully I'm in no way going ""in that direction"". But I am quite sick of the place I'm at now. I want to pull myself out of this. One of those two friends told me that I'm going to look back someday and be sorry that I didn't go out and live, and he's probably right. I just want to stop being lazy. I want to start getting stuff done. Start getting in routines. Start accomplishing things and doing my schoolwork. Start socializing and not being afraid to go to meets and conventions. Hang out with people who are like-minded, or maybe even slightly unlike-minded. Stop being embarrassed of myself and my interests/hobbies. I want to enjoy my hobbies again and not sit around wasting time on the internet constantly. But most importantly, I want to live. I want to be happy.

298,"I'm a 17 male and for the last 5 to 6 months I've had alot of problems with my parents that I've gone to therapy for against my wishes. I've also got myself on probation with some stupid decisions at the beginning of July. Between my family problems and the stress of probation and some of the colledge classes I'm taking all I have been able to think about the last 2 weeks is ending my life. I dont think I would actually do it unless things get worse but it's all I can think about. I try to get my shit together but everytime I try too, it feels like life puts more bullshit on my plate and I feel like I'm getting closer and closer to my breaking point and I'm not sure what I'd do if I reach it. Everything and everyone makes me so unbelievably mad that I feel pissed at the world every second of they day. The only person I feel like I have is my girlfriend who I've been with for just over half a year now. I havent told anything about how I feel because shes had trouble with depression and cutting and I'm afraid she might go back to it if she knew how much i was struggling. Everyday I have to tell myself ""take it one hour at a time"" and everything I do to fix my situation makes me feel like I'll never do enough or be good enough and I'm getting tired of it. I hardly leave my house anymore except to see my girlfriend. Every day when I'm not working or going to school I sleep and I think I know that I'm not tired I just do it to get away from my life. I've been trying just tough it out but idk if I can anymore and I'm starting to wonder if there is something wrong in my head.",15Sep2020,1
299,"I've had depression and anxiety for almost a decade now. They were finally diagnosed in 2016. I've had suicidal thoughts for most of my life. I'm not sure I know what it means to be happy, honestly. When I was first diagnosed with depression, I didn't know what manic episodes were and therefore couldn't quite give an informed answer on if I had any or not. Now I'm looking back and seeing some times where I was overly hyper and couldn't control what I did. They weren't frequent, maybe once a year. I don't know if they were me having truly happy days or manic episodes. Would anybody mind sharing what some of their manic episodes look like? I'm trying to decide if it's worth bringing up to my doctor or not and would like some insight first.",15Sep2020,1
301,"Hate to much about my life...

My father who has no job, me being alone and fantasizing about a life that I will never have, the guy that i liked so much and he forgot about me, the endless times i spent all my day learning and night crying, the unhappiness that seems to follow, the songs that can't me happy ever again, the books that i love so much and their characters they seem to real( wish i can meet those characters, because we are so alike, like two raindrops) 

I was always that A graded student- who spent their entire life learning and crying, that beautiful girl (tall and slim and b*sty) that guys wished to f*ck- but always stayed alone... nobody ever talked to her.

That girl that spends every day thinking how it would be easier to kill herself- who wishes to be hit mortally by a car/ train, killed by a mysterious illness.

It's so miserable being so unhappy.

And that guy...that guy that that i know since I was 11, that guy that I thought he can really love me, that guy that I tried to make him understand how I feel, that guy that never cared.",15Sep2020,1

303,When my life start turning up and I feel happy and good about my life I always get stuck on but what about everyone else that still feels down and isn’t in a good place in their lives and are just really struggling?? Why should be happy when so many are struggling? How selfish of me. And then I go backwards into depression again. Why do I fee so guilty about everyone else’s pain?? Why can’t I be happy that I’m happy and just not let them being down affect me? Ugh,15Sep2020,1
304,"My doctor has me on 137.5mg of Effexor, 150mg quetiapine, and 2mg of prazosin but I stopped taking them a couple months ago because I had gotten sick and I legitimately didn’t have the energy to take pills. I want to start taking my medication again but I’m scared to consult a professional because I was able to take my Clonazepam and I’m worried they’re going to get suspicious on why I was only taking one medication. Does anybody have any tips on how I can start myself back up on my medication as I have them still and I’d like to start taking them tonight. Note I’m 90ibs and a lot of medication doesn’t go well with my body at first so I could like to start off slow. My inbox is open to any advise and please no negative comments.

305,"I really don’t know what to do anymore.

It appears that my Mom has been in a state of mania now since the end of July/beginning of August and there doesn’t seem to be an end in sight. She won’t get help, or accept any people that reach out, and accuses us of not being there but she’s been receiving support throughout over and over. Including financially but says we aren’t there for her.

She is now becoming physically aggressive and abusive when people go to check on her because she’s making posts threatening to hurt herself. She pushed me, hit me, threw rocks at me, kicked a table at me and hit me with it when I went to check on her last week after she made a threat to hurt herself.

I saw her house and it’s completely destroyed. She’s been burning stuff in her yard and the neighbours have called the police on her. 
I tried calling 912 worried she was a missing person with the ability to potentially hurt herself or someone else and they were completely condescending and unhelpful. 

She voluntary placed herself in a psychiatric facility at the hospital on the 22 of August; and checked herself out on the 24th. Left me a message telling me if anything happens to her it’s my fault. 

We got an order last Saturday through our court system here to get her involuntarily placed in the hospital for a psychiatric assessment, and she also got released.
I know she’s not well. She’s either Borderline/Bipolar or both. Back when she was diagnosed when I was a child they said it was “multiple personality” but I know that’s not the terminology anymore. I feel like it’s bipolar based on her behaviour and posts. She posts on FB constantly, going from aggressive and threatening to nice and encouraging. 

She got her vehicle impounded last week or so but the details are very uncertain because she’s not talking to anyone, she’s blocking everyone. She might have been charged with a DUI or B&amp;E.
She’s been using weed daily, to excess for months now. I’m not sure about drinking. 

I got rid of FB/other media months ago because I was being emotionally/verbally abused by my sister who is an alcoholic who was in the past several months being very awful to me and my mom. My mom and I were sort of on the same page with setting boundaries with my sister because she was being so verbally abusive and putting her child in danger. My mom got fed up and threatened to get child protection involved, but didn’t. I intervened. 

Everything has been so awful but anyway, I don’t have FB and people are sending me or calling me to tell me what my mom is saying online and it’s so scary, but she won’t accept help. 

I’m sorry I just don’t know what to do. Our mental health and emergency services here aren’t helpful at all. 

This isn’t the first time she’s been like this, she was like this when I was a kid with me and my siblings, but she would voluntary get checked into a place and we would stay elsewhere with grandparents. But this is the worst I’ve ever seen her.

She threatens to hurt herself more if people call 911. 

TL;DR: What does one do when their loved one is in a state of mania that won’t end from Bipolar? 

Thanks for any input or reassurances, I’m just really scared and it’s really affecting my ability to function normally on a daily basis - I just want her to get the help she needs.",15Sep2020,1
306,"I’m 21 and a female, I have been on and off with someone for about 4 years now. After I discovered a few things he had done to me (manipulation and betrayal) and also after he punched through a door during an argument, I decided it was finally over.

There is much more, like him calling me worthless and stuff because I got tinder (after we broke up) but I digress. 

It should be noted that this man is very manipulative and has now become very angry, he says he misses the relationship, my therapist believes he is a narcissist or has narcissistic tendencies.

I decided I will not even entertain his calls, so when he called one night I ignored it. We’re over, I don’t need to answer.

The next morning, I wake to banging on my door. I freeze, because this already gives me anxiety. The banging grew louder, then I heard his voice screaming for me to answer the door. 

He had not texted me to ask me for something or anything or the sort, just called once and showed up at my house, so I was scared. 

I ignore it, because I’m terrified and I don’t want to see him. This man, opens one of my windows and climbs into my house without consent.

I have a panic attack and try to call the police but he lunges and hangs up the phone. I stupidly don’t call them again. He doesn’t leave after I’m screaming for him to go. I’m shaking and crying at this point. 

After an hour and a half I finally get him out of my house. He wanted to pick up something he said I could keep a few months beforehand. However, once he had that thing HE WOULD NOT LEAVE.

So, this morning I was sleeping and get a knock on my door. I freeze and begin to panic and my brain switches right back to that moment, now I can’t get it out of my head when I thought I was okay. It was the post man but I couldn’t move, couldn’t go an answer I was frozen.

I do already have anxiety issues as I have BPD and unipolar depression. I have had many anxiety attacks in the past, and many BPD episodes due to this person.

Does anyone have any advice? 

TLDR: my ex broke into my house and now I panic anytime someone knocks on my door... am I traumatised",15Sep2020,1
