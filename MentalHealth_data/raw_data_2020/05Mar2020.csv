0,"SORRY THAT IT'S SO LONG BUT I JUST WANT HELP  


Alright. So, to start this, I have a mixture of mental health problems that create my controlling issues. I was never diagnosed with anything because I never went to a psychologist, but my symptoms are crazy similar to OCD and such. And even if I don't have OCD, there's definitely something weird happening in my mind. So basically, the main problem with me is that I want to control the whole world. I want to control everything and everybody. And I also wanna say that I don't want to control the whole world, but my mind wants to do it. It's telling me to feel like that, so I feel like I want to control the whole world. I want to get rid of that feeling. The worst part is that all these controlling thoughts are linked with perfection, great attention to details, orderliness, checking things out and such (OCD). Plus with all these things there are thoughts telling me to do something or I'll die, I also think that's the OCD. Basically, when I do something, a lot of times there are thoughts like ""do that two more times or you'll die"". I have these type of thoughts since 2016, 2017 and just recently they got a little worse. That's the reason why I'm writing this post. BTW, I'm only 14 and it's very hard for me to process all this stuff. It's haunting me everyday and I just feel like there is no escaping. It's a mental prison. I just want these bad thoughts to stop. I also think all this might be linked to the fact that my life has not been the most easiest, because my dad left me and my mom when I was just 3 years old, and he left us with no money, which made us (me and my mom) a working class family, and we were broke since then. And I think all that lead to me having trust issues. You know, I never trusted nobody. I'm emotionally more connected to animals than I am to people, and if you wanna have my trust, you need to gain it. Also, the financial situation is getting a little better, and this year might be a year where things might change for me, at least a little bit. There might be things I didn't mention, but whatever, it's enough. So, anybody, please, can you give me any tips for overcoming my problems? Thanks to everybody.",05Mar2020,1
1,So my day has been interesting.. yesterday I was basically called ugly and a lot of other things by someone I considered a friend. She blamed me for saying things I didn’t . She also brought up my boyfriend (who died in November due to suicide) well she basically insulted him and said she didn’t care at all. That hurt a lot to be honest seeing that she and a couple others knew I have been battling with depression and suicidal thoughts the past few months. I’ve been happy then I feel literally dead. I don’t want to end it because I don’t want to hurt anyone and cause pain I to anyone. But I don’t know what to do at this point. My life isn’t all that bad and wanting to kill myself makes me feel selfish and just bad about myself in general. I feel like Im wrong for feeling this way and don’t know how to stop it even after therapy and counseling the thoughts never seem to stop..,05Mar2020,1
2,"*Pardon me if I made any sort of typos, grammar errors or missed any words. As I was typing this, I couldn't hold back the tears. Each time I tell the tale, I get really emotional, which is good because I never really felt emotional before like this and it helps release some stress. Crying does help. Never hold your emotions in, no matter how strong you are.*

  All my life, I always isolated myself away from my family, despite their numerous attempts to try to connect with me and my world. Some things they don't understand and some things they do. But, I always loved them no matter what. They supported me my entire life and I always supported them right back. My parents are my heroes. They sacrificed everything to move here to America to start a new life, a family and to achieve their dreams. Needless to say, they did just that and I cannot thank them enough for pushing themselves to reach this point in their lives.

  One day my sister told me that my dad had cancer, I was frozen in place. I walked up to my dad afterwards, I hugged him and told him how much he meant the world to me and my family and how much I loved him. He kept a brave smile on his face and told me everything was gonna be fine. I knew that after the announcement that Christmas wasn't gonna be the same. Immediately after opening the presents, I just went to my room and just slept, hoping to wake up and realize that it was all just a bad dream. When New Year's Eve came, nobody was in the living room. Normally, we would all be huddled around the TV with a glass of champagne (ECH) and a cup of grapes to celebrate it, but everyone was too emotional to celebrate it. It was a bad time too because around this time, I was supposed to go back to college and my car was having problems to the point where I was going to be car-less. I had to drop out because I just couldn't stop thinking about everything that's been happening.

 Come January 13th, my dad's surgery had begun. I was very sick that day. Had a very bad flu, so I had to stay home. My mom wanted me to go, but she knew that I wasn't feeling my best, so she let me rest. A few hours later, they came home with a smile on their faces to say that he's now in recovery mode and is now cancer free. Everything went back to normal, but I noticed a change in my behavior.

 My head felt heavy every day and each time I tried to eat some food, it wouldn't go down sometimes. The sensation was so bad that at work, I honestly thought I was having a heart-attack. Why was I feeling like this? My dad is okay now and is back working like he wanted to. What the hell is wrong with me? Then, it hit me. One day at work, I wasn't feeling good to the point where I had to sit down in the middle of the shift to relax. I wasn't feeling ill, weak or anything physical. My head just felt... heavy. When my supervisor asked me what I was going through, then that's when I began to break down into tears in front of him and another few co-workers. I didn't feel embarrassed, ashamed or anything. I felt more... relieved. I knew that I was holding up these emotions for so long and I didn't find the courage to talk to anyone about it because the saying goes: men don't cry. Stupid stigma.

 I spoke with a doctor about a week after the surgery and she basically said that I was going through an tough episode of anxiety. She asked if I ever experienced something like this before and I told her no. The doctor said that it's normal going through something like this and that these feelings will take a while to get accustomed to. But, she did recommend that I do some physical exercise and to change my diet up a bit, maybe even do some yoga.

 One day, I just walked up to my parents and I hugged them both and told them how much I loved them, how they were my heroes and how I was so grateful to each and every one of them for what they have done for our family. I have never done this. I did the same thing to my sisters, my friends, my girlfriend.... just to everyone who has been a part of my life and have shown their undying support towards me.

As the days go by, I am slowly but surely managing to get back to my normal self. Not my old self, but a normal self, where I can feel comfortable being around the people I love. I have my days where I just lock myself in my room to cry to let it all out. It's been tough and my job hasn't really helped much (retail, amirite?) If you are someone who has went through something like this before or is going through something like this, just remember that **you're not alone**. Reach out to someone, talk to them about your problems. Never not seek help.

 If your mother and father are still around, tell them how much you love them. If it's not a mom or dad, maybe an aunt, uncle, grandma, grandpa. Anyone who has helped shape you to the person that you are today for the better, tell them how grateful you are of them. Hold them close and just spend time with them, even if it's just having a simple conversation.

3,"I know that my mental heath hasn’t always been in a great place, I’ve experienced pretty severe suicidal thoughts before but I always just pushed through it until I was in a less miserable state. I’ve never considered my struggles to be anything worthy of being diagnosed with a mental illness, but I did try to speak to a therapist for a bit which lead to nowhere. 

Recently I went to a lecture for a class and from the minute I sat down I was experiencing this really uncomfortable feeling where I was just nervous for no reason and had cold sweats. There was no test or other possible stressor that could have caused me to act this way. At the end of the class I had to speak to the professor for all of 20 seconds to schedule a meeting for her office hours and it made me so uncomfortable it nearly put me in tears. What is happening to me? It’s not at all common for this to happen to me although I do avoid things like speaking in class because I’m afraid of people looking at me or thinking I’m dumb. 

I feel like a freak and anytime I consider something might be wrong I feel like I’m just self-diagnosing myself to make excuses. I don’t know what to do, does anyone have advice?",05Mar2020,1

5,"Question: how many of you suffer from them and what do you do to help? 

I’m 30 male, new father and have fought with my issues my whole life. Also feeling numb or very saddened by nothing or little things.

I also have panic attacks from people screaming and hitting things because of a ex girlfriend. Yes she was extremely abusive both mental and physical. 

Lately my depression has been extremely high (higher then ever) but nothing’s happened to cause it. Never been medicated and I no longer drink or smoke pot. 

I wanna know what helps you.

6,"I think I have  paranoid personality disorder, majority of the signs fit me, I’m overly paranoid about my trust in others etc 
My good friend is staying with me for a week and I am scared that he will hurt my dogs or do something bad (completely unwarranted) I keep “reading” hostile facial movements, I keep finding borderline insulting (I don’t think they are) words in his language, like I’m just a mess here and I’m scared I’m going to become hostile towards my friend and potential ruin a friendship, I don’t know what to do, i need to work and I’m scared to leave him and everything, I don’t know what to do, what should I do?

7,"I have an almost friend who sometimes scares me.
I think it's almost a form of psychic vampirism but not quite the same thing.
Imagine a person who insults and harms others for pleasure but not the pleasure of knowing the victim was hurt. A person who is just plain wicked and evil for no reason other than that it comes natural to them. Everything about him is evil. I should probably say he simply does not feel. At least that makes sense. You have to experience it I guess to understand.

About my friend

I guess I could describe it as ""indiscriminate chaotic evil justicar""?

His sense of morale is brick hard old testament biblical. No sex, no lies, no fun, no nothing. Work, home. That's his life. On occasion he entertains guests but udually only for business.

He is touched by the devil. I've never known a human so cold and void of emotion. Everything is a systematic sequence to him. He treats all people and things the same, like nothing means anything to him. He says he must rely on logic to ""navigate this world because he does not belong here"". I've tried to figure out what that means but I cant. Hes a locked box to me. 

I know his past a bit, having grown up friends with his sister. They were both traded as sex for drugs in their early life and a lot of other terrible things. 
I imagine some kind of trauma related issues maybe but he never talks about the past.  In fact you cant get him to talk about yesterday. He'll tell you time is an illusion and that yesterday is just a delusion of things once wanted. ""The only time that exists is now"" is what hed say and if you listen you'll get a thorough explanation of how man began to count time and why man will die. (If you're a bible reader youd love that speech)

I've spent the night at his home while in town visiting his sister. His life is unlivable. I cant understand what's wrong with him. I want to help him if I can but he says there is nothing I have to offer that will ""assist his plight"".  I've volunteered to shoulder whatever burden he carries and he basically recited the bible and told me God deems him worthless in this time space. This is where you'll see that he us a seed of evil. The tyrannical rant that comes when anyone tries to get close is nothing short of shit your pants fear. He'll hurt you physically. Theres complete rejection of physical touch, won't accept a compliment, wont let anyone do anything for him. Its heartbreaking because I genuinely care for him but he is evil in flesh. 
He routinely does things like take homeless people to fancy restaurants, randomly pays for peoples dinner in restaurants, donates to charities,  how could such a generous person be evil? 
Because he doesnt feel any of it. It's all impulse according to him. He equally picks fights with random strangers. 
Oh god dont ever see him around kids! This fucker pours out so much money to kids it makes me sick to see. Icecream, candy, shoes, clothes, he just ups and buys tons of stuff and gives it away to kids but he wont even talk to them or say you're welcome!
He never smiles, never directly talks to people and is always a snide mean hateful piece of shit to everybody. If he learns you're a Christian he'll totally piss in your face. Ok I take it back. I saw him smile once.
He smiled when his mom died. I can at least say that. 1 smile in all the time I've known him. I guess I'm worried why hes seemingly kind to me like he is to children. In general he seems to ignore me completely but dies nice things for me indirectly. Hes paid bills , bought me food when I was fucked, sheltered me when I was out in the street, I can ask for anything and hell throw it on the floor at my feet, but will rarely talk to me. Hes said before that he has no desire to harm me or anyone and that it's best if I keep distance but hes really an amazing person despite being totally inclined toward evil. I have seen him nurture life in such a tender way but still systematically and with precise knowledge. It's like he feels nothing and cares about nothing. I know behind those eyes hes thinking terrible things about me and its frightening but he really is an amazing person even if he cant feel it. I wish I  could be more than a friend to him if he even sees me as that.

 ""One day you and the world will cease to exist and will have no importance. It is only logic to assume you and the world have no importance now"" Thats what he said when I asked him out. 

And then I've seen him systematically destroy life and hurt people without so much as a facial twitch but the eyes and body movement are different. Almost like a liquid viper. Theres excitement in his eyes when he is destroying. 

What could possibly be wrong with him?",05Mar2020,1
8,"I don't even know where to begin as I have a very difficult time expressing myself properly, but I am going to try my best. I will be turning 30 years old in the next few months. I have been engaged to my fiance for a few years and we've been together for 12. We live in a small apartment. I work as a manager at a retail company. Seems pretty normal right? Wrong.

Waking up and getting ready for work is an incredibly difficult task for me. Most days, when I wake up, suicide is the first thought that comes to mind. I have to really force myself to get out of bed, which results in me being late to work almost everyday. Sometimes it gets so rough that I will call in sick and not go to work at all. Most days I do not take a shower or take care of my personal hygiene whatsoever. 

I am a very shy person. I have been this way since I could remember. I've always hated having interactions with other human beings. When I am away from people, I feel much more at peace. I don't have the ability to form a human connection with others, and quite frankly, I don't even WANT to form human connections with others. I avoid all social events, and I even isolate myself from my friends and family. I miss my family every day but I don't even have the strength to text/call them back when they contact me. I don't know what they truly think of me but they must think I am this stuck-up person who hates them. Truth is, I think about them everyday, and knowing the fact that I'll never be able consistently connect with my family makes me very sad. Isolating myself from people makes me feel much more at ease. 

At work, I pretend to be a completely different person. At work, I act like I have my shit together, I act like this amazing leader, and I basically fake my way through this job. I believe. I have done a pretty good job in fooling people, even my boss, into thinking I am this really great manager.

But lately I feel as if I cannot keep the facade up any longer. A lot of times I will disappear (into random rooms where I will unlikely be found, usually the bathroom) where I will end up uncontrollably crying because my thoughts are spiralling downwards again. I sometimes look around for possible methods of suicide. Many times I am undeservingly cold to employees and customers. 

What I feel is that I simply just exist. I feel I am stationed in one spot, just waiting there, just empty. 

I should have been married by now. I should be planning to have children in the very near future. But yet I let the minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years pass by. 

About a year ago, my mom learned of my suicidal thoughts and brought me to the hospital to get checked. I waited for hours to talk to a few doctors who asked me a bunch of questions. They booked a specialist appointment for a future date to which I never showed up to. I do this all the time; I will either cancel plans or not show up to something I've previously agreed to.

2 weeks ago, I swallowed a couple handfuls of tylonel, hoping to kill myself. It obviously was not enough. I want to try again on my 30th birthday, but this time I will swallow a lot more than a couple of handfuls.

I know I should see a doctor but I have zero motivation to do that.

So I will continue to silently suffer, until my next attempt.",05Mar2020,1
9,"Below are three small instances when I lied but all three could have been avoided easily. For some reason i lie when i am ..underpressure? Flustered? I am not sure what about these situations that make me panic so much as to lie when honestly I don't need to. Either way, how do I stop lying so often and so unnecessarily?
Let me give examples: 
The other day I took up someone's device without asking and took pictures. That someone, is a person I don't usually borrow things from because they hate when people use their things even if they don't use it. I have had bad experiences with that person because of taking something up that belonged to them. I forgot to delete the photos from their device and only remembered when they returned. I took up the device and hid and deleted the photos so they didn't know I used it. When they asked where their device was I lied and said I didn't know. The crazy thing is that I felt bad afterwards for lying. So I went out and told them that I had it. They were mad understandable. However, they were mad because I lied and not because I used it. I felt dumb because I had built up fear due to past hurtful experiences with that person. 

Today some guy asked me if I ever spoke to him before and I said no. We did but I was trying to cut the conversation short since I didn't like how he was speaking to me. He started by saying ""Yo"" in this really rude way. I can't explain it. 

A few weeks ago I sat in another class in the back. I finished what I needed to do and the class was boring so I decided to leave. It started a little chain reaction since two other followed behind. When we were leaving the teacher asked me if I had another class and I said yes (lie). I guess I was hoping that would be the end of it. She asked what class and my mind went blank. I didn't want to lie again. The class laughed and I used that as a gate way to leave while they were distracted. I really didn't need to lie.",05Mar2020,1
10,"I went to an intake session today because things have reached a tipping point for me. I started breaking down crying just at the basic questions today. I left feeling like maybe it's possible to get better. Now I feel completely empty because help was dangled in my face and ripped away. 

I dont have insurance. Well didnt about 8 hours ago. I lost my job last year and had no way to pay for insurance during the open enrollment. They are saying I dont qualify for special enrollment. Also the clinic I went to wont do sliding scale or anything.

I called today to set up insurance for myself but they only provide benefits for inpatient help. The agent made it sound like I would be able to make therapy/psychiatric appointments.

How do you guys afford to get help with poor/no mental health coverage. This really makes me feel like it will be impossible. After taxes and child support I have $1,400 for housing/health insurance/food/transportation/therapy/medication.

Do I need to get credit cards and max them out and file bankruptcy later? Get fired and work at mcdonalds so I make less money? I know this is a immature way to think about it but I dont know how I could possibly pay without becoming homeless. I have a psychiatric appointment next Wednesday and therapy session scheduled for Friday. I really dont want to cancel them and keep sinking. I'm 27. I cant take advantage of inpatient because I'd lose my job.

I really need to hear that it's possible. I dont have any friends. I've been looking for a roommate but I cant force anyone to share a home/cost with me.

11,"First off, I think work is a huge part of mental health. I’m not saying all jobs cause mental illnesses (although some do), I am saying that your 40+ a week environment has a large affect on your mental and physical health. Let me explain my week so far. 

I started a job back in October. I have experience so I caught on quick, although different industry so there is a learning curve. Was doing very well until I was given a new project, a whole new workload on top of my others. I have been so overwhelmingly busy and stressed that I’ve been physically in pain when I leave work, I cry on my way home. Not out of sadness but just pure exhaustion. I ask for help, and my supervisor doesn’t send any. So I get to a point I feel like I’m going to have a breakdown just out of pure mental and physical exhaustion. I’m having to work OT to even make progress. 

Today my supervisor wants to bring up unapproved overtime and that she is so disappointed etc, etc. I just start ugly crying. There is no way I can perform my responsibilities in 8 hours. I’m so fucking exhausted, the stress is unbelievable. She’s mad that people are on their phones when mine is running on the same charge from three days ago. She says I don’t need to be crying, that I have no reason to be upset. 

I’m just saying that you would think employers would understand human limits.. because they are human. And when you give an employee a workload that literally brings them to tears, maybe you should offer a hand. 

I know I’m not alone here, I’ve seen many posts about work place anxiety and depression. Please feel free to comment your workplace scenario and we can talk about it together. 

Also, I did not apologize one bit for falling apart in the conference room. I said what I had to say and left. I have every right to my feelings.",05Mar2020,1

14,"I have what is, in my opinion, moderate anxiety. I dont have actual panic attacks. But I had issues talking freely to classmates, I work as a teacher and dont engage the same as everyone else with others. I dont think I have issues understanding social cues like in autism at all. But I block myself easily when we are in a big group of people. Im a lot more relaxed talking one on one to something, personally I think others may think Im a different person there. Important information, I stutter somewhat regularly, I have controlled it quite well since kid/teenage years, but is still something I have to bear with daily. Sometimes is a struggle to start a sentence but then I talk quite well IMO.

What made me do this post honestly is that I have a weird ""reflect"" of, when talking trough something or getting nervous in a conversation, if there's a table with objects I nearly unconsciously take one and put it in another place.

I'm hoping to get a diagnosis. I have a counsellor, a family Doctor, and a naturopath and they help, but I’m still not well and I would like to change medications. Currently, I am taking Pristiq and I feel like it's not very effective (almost 3 years of it) and I don't want to go to my doctor for a new medication without some sort of official diagnosis. I've been looking at psychologists but they dont seem to return my calls. What do I say on the voicemail? Mental health issues run in my family. My emotions shift very quickly, and I often experience extreme sadness, anger, and anxiety.  I’m constantly afraid that the people I care about will abandon me/leave me/don’t care about me. Sometimes the way I feel about the people in my life can dramatically change from one moment to the next—and I don’t always understand why, or the reason why doesn’t line up with my reactions. My previous romantic relationships have been intense, but unstable.  My current relationship of 3 years is super stable and not intense, but I when I’m feeling insecure in my relationship, I tend to lash out or make impulsive gestures to keep him close. He’s patient and seems to weather it well… In the past, I would often do things that I know are dangerous or unhealthy, such as having unsafe sex, binge drinking, or using drugs. Now I tend to go on spending sprees or binge eat. I’ve engaged in self-harm behaviours such as cutting (not recent, the last incident was over a year ago) but I think about suicide a lot (and my life really isn’t that bad).

But literally whenever I do any little bit of work I normally go into full stress mode and then I'm there remembering all the good times e.g. with family and friends where I didn't feel like this. It just seems so dramatic, it's like my brain switches from 'you're fine' to 'omg this is so stressful' even if it's not, and then sometimes I feel guilty when I'm not doing work and having fun because I didn't even need that much of a break because I haven't done much anyway.

I can work harder than what I've said in this post, however I need a break and I feel like it's more than others and I still feel burnt out from A levels I did nearly 4 years ago lol. But some people have to work overtime everyday, I feel I wouldn't ever be able to cope with working the really long hours some people do.

How I could potentially never see my ex again. I’ve been freaking out, inconsolable, and crying for hours everyday. I’m grieving two losses right now.

I reached out to my ex and we talked about this whole thing. She apologized for being an asshole and dragging me down by dumping me. I told her that these things happen and I just want to move forward with friendship because I am so fucking scared of losing her permanently. She was really sweet to me about it and we hung out for a bit and looked at memes and stuff and it made me feel somewhat better at the time.

But I’m still stuck in this hole of despair around the grief. I can’t eat, I can’t sleep, I can’t work, I cant do my homework. I’m so torn up about everything I don’t know what to do.

I know that grief is a process. I know it can trigger you to mourn other things. I don’t know if I made the right choice by crying to my ex. I’ve been having a really rough couple of weeks. I guess I’m just writing this to get these words out of my head.",05Mar2020,1
23,"I've struggled with depression for most of my life, but for about the past 3 years specifically I've really struggled. During this time several things happened -- I had to put my childhood pet to sleep due to illness; my mom almost died several times from health complications; I got married without my mom present because she was in the hospital; while hopped up on opiates in the hospital, my mom told me I was a total failure, among other terrible things; my family pushed me away; etc. For a while I tried to keep going and keep doing work (I'm a freelance contractor). But I reached a point at which I couldn't bring myself to do work, to email anyone, or even to get dressed or do the dishes. I ended up ghosting several clients, and I feel very ashamed about it and concerned about the impact this probably had on my career. 

Thankfully for the last 4-5 months I have been doing a lot better. I'm taking care of myself, working, socializing, exercising, eating properly, working on cognitive behavioral therapy, etc. Is there an appropriate way to apologize to the clients I ghosted and repair some of the damage I did to my career as a result? Eg, would it be appropriate for me to send each person an email that says something along the lines of ""I apologize that I did not get back to you, I was struggling with some personal issues and I did not handle the situation professionally. I want to genuinely apologize for the inconvenience I caused, etc."" or is there a better way to approach that? Or should I cut my losses? Also, it's been almost 2 years since my wedding and I haven't sent out thank you cards yet. Is it too late? Should I apologize to people for not sending them?",05Mar2020,1
24,"I work at a call center(again) as I have a plethora of physical problems but my mental health takes a beating with it. I've been talking with HR and they said as long as I have a doctors note, I can take extra days off for mental health days, i.e if my agoraphobia or anxiety is too much, I don't have to worry about losing my job as well. 

We're trying out new meds and different doses to see if anything helps but I'm curious as to what do I actually disclose to HR?  I don't want to be known as the person who needed special treatment and this is one of the better places I've worked at. So far, all I've told them is that I'm working with my doctors to find a better alternative and might need to work 32 hours than the 40( but only sometimes. Most weeks, I can go in and make it up).

Anyone dealt with this before?",05Mar2020,1
25,"So to preface, I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety, agoraphobia and depression since I was roughly 12 (Currently 17).  I have always been an antisocial individual, but I’ve never really considered that something I wanted to fix necessarily?  The only issue I really have is anger.  I am for the most part a really easygoing person, but there are always times when EVERYTHING and I mean everything pisses me off.  I get super overwhelmed and just lash out at everyone and just start crying, screaming, the whole deal.   It usually stems from not understanding someone or not doing something in a specific way.  I was tested for ADHD and Aspergers six months ago, but the doctor said if I had it, it would likely be high-functioning and I would have to go to another doctor.  
Anyways, my parents believed I shouldn’t get that secondary test because it’s likely just teenage hormones.  I’ve voiced that I don’t believe it’s simply that, as I’ve always dealt with worse than average anger issues and overwhelming “episodes” (basically just a complete shutdown).  I have coped with my anxiety for quite some time, and feel comfortable where I am on that healing journey, but I hate feeling out of control when it comes to fixing this.   I am so frustrated with myself, and I just want to have some type of help with this.  I want to seek a doctor, I want someone to listen.  I just don’t know how to convince my parents.  


TLDR; I think I have ADHD or Aspergers because of my anger outbursts and episodes where I get overwhelmed and shut down, but my parents believe it’s just me being a moody teen.  How to get them to take me seriously?",05Mar2020,1
26,"Let me introduce my self, I'm OP's unconscious. OP is rather sleepy right now and I'm just waiting for him to reach Morpheus' hugs and confuse his conscious mind with some Freudian experience he will forget with a brush of his teeth. During his wake time though, I like to take a step back. I never sleep, don't dare you think it. I still work on my machinations, but  in absolute silence. OP doesn't even notice I exist, so sweet!

Well sometimes he does notice me. Sometimes, you know, Doctor S. stops talking to OP's overationalized invectives, he changes his interlocutor, and through the hole of the pupils I can hear Doctor's accusations directed towards me. So gross. This time he touched a sensitive point. I blow my chest and try my voice. So many days since last time I spoke. The shout in response comes out angry, and flebile. Cuts the air almost unnoticed. But Doctor S. is ready.

""Finally you told it""
""Told what?""
""That you pass 90% of your time judging people""
""Yeah that's what I do indeed. Is this bad?""

Of course is not, my dear loved OP.

""Yeah know I see the picture. I can't relate with others because I feel like they are only good at hurting and facestepping."" 

Exactly! You are different from them. You are better than them. You have a moral framework my dear. You'd like to live in a world where love and respect rule upon any action people do. Some sort of a Christian paradise without a God but only good smiling spirits. For sure I can tell you, you'd be the King of that word! 

Sad truth is, this world doesn't exists. Those people around you, yeah your friends. Not only them, your parents and relatives. Ow and that guy who asked you infos on the street. And that other girl who tried with you. And that bearded man -do you remember him? Probably not, he's just one of the many- who was dancing beside you in the club. All those people, all the people, they are bad. Yeah bad like a villain in a movie. 

""It is possible. Some of them maybe. "" 

Some of them are so good at being bad that they actually seem good. Just to trick people. I almost admire their skill. Stay away from them please. And never trust them. They want to be trusted by the people that they lie to, so when you turn your back, they can put the stab in. Even when they are smiling, they are showing their theeths. 

""Agree."" 

Some others are just violent. I'm referring to men mostly, they could beat you in a blink of the eye. That's funny cause it's literal. Watch them in the eyes if you want your orbit broken. Love the drunk ones expecially. Not that I discriminate the junkies. They are so innocuous, and can be so good at putting themselves on a car, and a cradle on a tree. 

""That's sad!"" 

 And than the other type, the aggressive authoritaristic ones. Those are the type of people who would explain you something you already know just to boss you. I guess that it makes them dick hard, or pussy wet whatever. Girls call it mansplaining, they should create a genderless term for it tho. 

""Don't get distracted, focus on the test."" 

Give yourself just a moment, you already answered all the questions after all. Did you see them? Yeah those three girls who are taking the exam as a group work over there on the last desks? God they are so loud. They aren't even good at cheating. I guess their parents will be proud of their 30/30. I can see their mums reporting it to their coworkers. Subtly, in the middle of a chat about auburgines, they'll say how good their daughters were in the Contemporary Philosophy class. In case that bitch of a know nothing thinks his dislexic son is better than Sonia. 

""I need to sleep, please!"" 

Wait! Wait! Just a second. Want to forget that sweet girl? You know who I'm referring to. Yeah she went out with you only to make your best friend jealous. It's OK to be used when the person you love is doing it after all. It happens sometimes, in love. I mean, maybe always. Yeah actually is always like this. It's not a problem by the way, your friend knows that you like her. You talked about it with him."" She's yours"" he said ""I don't like her"". When they broke one year later and he called her bitch, you cried for her for the second time. 

""I must stop surfing reddit now."" 

No you won't. Here is full of redditors who want to give a real help to you. They maybe can't help themselves, and they are just proiecting their problems on you, and they are using you as a catharsis. But they want... ok never mind they don't want to help you they are just desperate individuals. 

""OK!"" 

Last type before I make you dream a tree producing potatoes. The ""be egoistic"" ""YOLO"" type. They are cute aren't they? Each one of them thinks and acts like he is the only mortal soul walking on the earthly ground. Like he he is the only one with feelings. Like he is the only one with some sort of privileges that come from the revelation that he is going to die in 50 years. The sort of privilege that allows you to molest a girl and get her drunk to fuck her without protections, make a tape of the act and post it on any Whatsapp group. And tell you ""relax man, it was fun."" 

""They aren't all like this. I like people, I'm in love with nice people. "" 

There aren't nice people beside you. Some of them are innocuous. They are losers so big they couldn't even hurt a fly. They are just egoistic people like all the others, and they are so overcharged with frustrations about their shortcomings that when they become skilled in something, their tongue curls in pleasure at the idea of hurting you with their renewed self confidence. 

""So you telling me everybody is a egoistic piece of shit?"" 

Yes and that's why you don't want to have anything to do with them. You are scared, and you are right to be so. They will hurt you, with their multiple ways. Watch them from the distance like a birdwatcher and laugh on how much miserable their lives are. You are not of that blood, you are good in any sense. When you offer a hand, you are really offering it. When you swear something, you do it. When you love someone, you really love him. You don't care about yourself, you are selfless. And most of all you won't ever do anything that could possibly hurt anyone. Therefore, just don't move, stay there on the side. Don't talk with her. You don't want to ruin her night at the party. Just stay there and wait, wait till this violence of a party ends.",05Mar2020,1
27,"This occurred years ago during my first deployment to Afghanistan. It was during my first convoy delivering supplies and other knick knacks to our FOBs scattered throughout the Kunar province, I was riding shotgun in the PLS when I suddenly heard what sounded like a freaking fire cracker going off right in front of me. The MRAP behind our truck radioed us saying what may be have been an RPG or recoiless round impacted right behind our truck. The entire convoy came to a halt at that point and our MRAPs lit up a hill on the opposite side of the river with 50 cal and Mk19 fire. 

It wasn't until we got to our destination that we got to our destination that we got a chance to inspect the truck, the rear area of our truck took some shrapnel damage including a fairly large piece that pierced one of our rear wheels (we had to replace the tire, thank god we made it to the FOB with that thing inside the tire). That's when a thought came to me, if that \*\*\*hole on the hill had been a little bit more accurate or faster with his RPG or whatever, there was a very good chance he would have hit the cab of our PLS and I would not be here typing this up today. This random thought has bothered me for years, it's not like I constantly think about this event. It just pops up randomly, I could be at work or on the john and this thought for some inexplicable reason just pops back into my mind out of nowhere and I'm suddenly reliving that convoy all over again.

31,"Over the last 4 years I have slowly deteriorated my mental health. My physical, mental, and emotional health are all in the gutter, and have only become worse due to events I have dealt with. At this moment in life I have no motivation for anything. I’m supposed to be going to college next fall, but honestly I don’t care where I end up, or where I go. I don’t study for anything for my classes, I don’t have motivation to go to the gym, and I don’t care to work on my social life. I have dug up a hole and just keep digging myself deeper into it, making it harder and harder to get out. What do I do?",05Mar2020,1
32,"There is a lot going on in my head and in my life that has brought me here to vent. Broadly, I have been diagnosed with non-combat service connected depression and anxiety in addition to PTSD from childhood abuse. I have been evaluated several times by the VA and I’ve been essentially told the same thing again and again ... “you should seek therapy” but I still can’t afford that kind of treatment so here I am fucked up, but trying! I have a list of other service connected disabilities which further complicate life, including limited mobility in one of my legs, chronic back pain, and syncope (and related memory loss)... all of which prevent me from having a normal sleep cycle. The days sort of blend together and I have a hard time keeping track of the dates so I end up just sort of winging it one day at a time. 



Well after I left the navy, I went to college. I worked 3 jobs to ensure I wouldn’t go into debt paying bills, even though I was using the GI bill and part of VocRehab benefits to finish the last part of my bachelors degree. My grades were never great, I focused on the experiences that would bring me the opportunities I needed in my career of choice after I graduated. Now the only thing that is stopping me from graduating, is one class of Organic chemistry. I’ve taken it 3 times, the final is coming up and I’m sure to fail it again. I can rationally work through the problems with all of my notes, but the tests you have to reproduce full reactions and I just ... can’t. The second I begin to try I start crying and it blooms into full panic until I can’t breathe. I’m actually crying now as I type this out. I have tried to force myself through it day after day, trying to absorb and cram the information in there but I can never reproduce the information properly. No matter how I practice. I’ve tried reaching out to the professor for help but he just asked me to “stick to it”. So here I am failing the class with the final in a few weeks, utterly unable to prepare myself. I’ve been prescribed some different medication, so far they have little or no impact on my ability to control my response to the situation. 



The kicker? I already have a full time permanent job that I love in a community that I love. It’s not perfect, but it works for me, it’s interesting and I get by. I’m even trying to buy my first home! But everyone I know is under the impression I already have my degree... organic chemistry is in no way related to field that I currently work in! Not even close! But I still feel like shit because I can’t get through this notoriously difficult course. I am good at my job, really and it’s probably because I enjoy it so much and yet when I’m recognized for it even in the slightest way I cringe inside. Must my degree depend on my ability to memorize complicated and lengthy reactions? 



I feel helpless because there’s no other option but to take the final and fail again, like really there’s no amount of studying no amount of time or repetition that can fix my brain. I’m sorry but I don’t have the capacity. And part of me is like fuck it, it’s organic chemistry? Who is really going to fire you because you didn’t pass one class? Who is really going to notice or care? And the other part is like yea... you reaaaaalllllllllyyyyyyyyyyyyyy fucked up here, why can’t you just push through and pass like everyone else? Just read more! Study harder!.... .... I feel so dumb for being stuck with these issues in my head, I just want to be done with it but it has driven me so far into the ground it’s hard to pull myself out alone.

34,"Closure does not exist. Life is not fair. The further you can put the concepts of closure and fairness away from your life, the happier you will be. I like these sorts of statements, even though they aren't the happiest to admit. They are true, though. Sometimes we expect reality to follow a narrative, like a movie or a song might. But, life is a constantly growing bubble of information that never forgets that time in elementary school when that thing happened, or your first big rejection, or that career failure. The only thing you can control is what you put into that bubble, and how much you put into it. You can fill your life with more things, and effectively ""move on"", but you will never have closure. And things will never become fair. Just for my own sanity, I need to admit this. Because it's a good goal to have more things in your life. It's a good goal to say I want to do ""this"" by ""this date"" and to do your best to meet that goal. But it's no help to anyone to seek closure, happiness, or fairness. Or even health in general.

It would be nice if my family understood what im going through but first i think i need to understand what im going through.

I really dont enjoy being alive but the people around me who care about me are the reason i still am. Surround yourself with people that genuinly care about you, life can be utterly horrific at times but the thought of them can be that boost that keeps me going.

I had a sudden mood swing about a week ago and it felt so odd and that's what my mind is currently focusing on. It's relentless and it's fucking torture. I really wish I knew how to make it go away faster, but it usually takes a week or two or sometimes more for the thoughts to stop bothering me.

57,"Hello, so first a little back story, i'm a 16 year old boy from Brisbane Australia. I've been suffering from mental health issues for the better part of 6 years now. So basically from the point i became a teenager. over the years my problems and issues have evolved into different things. Some things have gone, some things have come, some things have gotten better and some things have gotten worse. 

But basically, I never ever feel happy or content with my life and the world around me. I struggle greatly day to day with just getting through the day. My mind is constantly going at a million miles an hour and will never slow down. I can't sleep properly, I've always had issues with sleep, but i wake up through the night all the time and when i finally do wake up in the morning i'm always tired and just want to spend the rest of the day in bed. 

I do see someone for it, i see a psychiatrist. I take about 6 different medications for my various different problems, two anti depressants, one anti psychotic, two sleeping medications, and one to stop the anxiety feeling inside my stomach.  They do sorta seem to work, but they definitely aren't working to their fullest potential. I've been told i'm very resilient to drugs and medication. I have tried so many different things and they haven't really worked. 

The best way to explain it is, i have never really felt comfortable or content inside my world. When i say my world i mean the world, like the one we all live in. I don't know why though, i have a wonderful family with support all around me from them, i have some truly great friends, i have recently just gotten into a relationship with a beautiful girl. I have always gotten everything I've needed and wanted. I'm not rich but i'm certainly not poor. I live in a middle class suburb in a first world rich country. I've never experienced anything overly bad in my life, nothing has gone terribly wrong. 

I just can't seem to help myself, everything just makes me anxious or scared, if it doesn't make me feel like that then i just feel like everything is wrong, or i have it terribly or something along those lines. It's really hard to explain, if you want to ask me to explain something more in the comments i will. 

I more or less just wanted a vent and hopefully might find someone who is similar to me. Thanks.",05Mar2020,1
58,"Rather not say any personal details except I’m in high school. 
I have a weird problem where whenever I’m alone or nobody is talking to me and I’m not doing something I enjoy my thoughts tend to travel into thoughts of murder/suicide. Most of the murders involve my ex-girlfriend from 3 years ago who I deeply resent, they vary with the most common of just bringing a gun to school and raping then murdering her, or alternatively the ol’ bat. The suicide ones vary with bridges to guns to dying in a classroom with my good friend. This has been going on for some time and I don’t want to tell my mom or ask to go see a therapist or whatever, I have already disappointed them with failing grades and don’t want to add more their plate. I don’t know if I struggle with depression when I’m around friends I’m genuinely happy or playing a game but after that ends after the dopamine rush I get down, I’ve tried committing suicide before but couldn’t bring myself to it for some reason.

I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression in the past but recently I decided to see a therapist again to help myself do better in my wonderful relationship. Well, I have been diagnosed with PTSD and as you can imagine my PTSD episodes caused a strain on my relationship. I have been doing better but I simply can't get over the guilt and sadness over the fact that I hurt my loving partner; a person I would never consciously hurt. My episodes as we call them completely overtake me to the point that I am not myself and I can't remember what occurred during them. I feel awful that I say terrible things to the man I love and he just accepts me and does his best to understand what I am going through. I love him deeply and well I am making a positive effort to break this and get better. Today, I cleaned my apartment and ate a decent dinner. I also took a nice shower; I always take care of my hygiene but this shower was more for enjoyment and relaxation rather than one just to get clean. I also made a big step in reaching out to one of my closest friend about what is going on in my personal life. My boyfriend has been supportive and I honestly can't thank him enough; I'm thankful that our relationship is super healthy and good despite these mental roadblocks. I never thought that I would make it this far but honestly taking baby steps and creating and reaching out to your support group does wonders.

I have said this to my mother, who dismisses it. Today after what looked like a day with out eating, I decided to try something new. I logged into her Snapchat. Among all of her private stories, was one named “rants”. She has not allowed anyone to view it. But since I’m on her account... I open up the story and it says quote
 “you’re fat! You eat too much. Sometimes I just wish you’d give up. Don’t eat anymore. You’ll be happier. Hungrier. But happier” 

I know she was talking about herself from previous context clues. Then she goes on to say in the next slide

 “I’m disgusted in you. Why couldn’t you just not eat. Why’d you have to make all these bad decisions all the time. You wanna be skinny but you’re doing the opposite. You’re just fat. A fat person who can’t control herself, I’m sick to my stomach.” 

That’s all she says. But I am shaking right now. I know where this all stems from. And I know that if I uncover this, our relationship will be ruined.

89,"Hey guys, sorry if I make any mistakes I don’t usually post on reddit but at this point this is the only place I can think to turn to. So I am a sophomore in high school and lately the workload has gotten to a point that I cannot handle. I have probably slept a max of four hours these past two days because of my desire to finish my homework. I usually have no problem doing so, but ever since this semester started I find it extremely difficult to concentrate; I seem to get sidetracked for long periods of time and end up doing only a bit of work at a time. It is very embarrassing for me because I find that I am having panic attacks where I cannot breathe every night because I am afraid that I am behind my peers or that I am not working hard enough, but I cannot bring myself to return to the way I was. I look at my text book and feel almost nauseous. Opening my book bag causes an immediate difficulty to breathe. I’m not sure what I can do anymore but tonight I’m doing something risky; I’m not doing my AP World History homework. When I woke up this morning I absolutely intended to stay up all night if need be until my homework was completely finished, but upon sitting down and trying to get my work done, I found that I was feeling very light headed, and I could not remember the words I had just read. I could not make any sense of what I was reading. This scared me and I laid on the ground for a bit. I considered missing school tomorrow, but I cannot do that as I have something that I absolutely must do at school tomorrow. I would very much like to confide with my teachers the problems I am having, but I am afraid that they will call my experiences excuses and punish me.

90,"So, I apologise if this goes rambling a bit, I’m just in a situation with my workplace that I’ve never been in before, and don’t know what would be best to do. 

A little background first - I’m 40, and was originally diagnosed with reactive depression when I was 27, but the GP seemed to be very much a case of ‘here’s some pills, stop bothering me’, over the years, from seeing other GP’s and mental health professionals, it’s been fully diagnosed as Borderline Personality Disorder following several traumas from my younger years. 

A couple of years ago, the company I worked for were intensely strict with taking time off sick, particularly for mental health, to the point that as soon as you mentioned even feeling a little off, there’s by eye-rolling, and almost interrogation like questioning about what I’m doing to get better, will I be back tomorrow, why can’t I come back now, etc - it’d get really stressful, and just make everything worse. 

Fast forward to the start of last year I moved jobs to a different company, and after 4 months had an episode which included getting very close to attempting suicide, as soon as work knew suicide was involved, their safeguarding team sent me home till I could have an occupational health appointment. In that appointment the nurse essentially said that I needed therapy to get better, the BPD is always going to be there, I could have a relapse at any time, but to minimise the impact and get the best out of me she’s recommend I don’t go back till I’ve had my 2nd therapy session. 

Work took this on board and followed everything, with me having to get therapy through the NHS I ended up off sick for 8 months, going back to work at the start of January. There’s been a couple of minor blips, nothing too major until the week before last, when I had suicidal thoughts again, and everything seemed to kick in again. I’ve been off work for 2 weeks. 

Because she’s officially classed as my carer other than the initial calling in sick, my fiancé has been liaising with my manager about everything. I was meant to be going back on Tuesday but in the morning didn’t feel right so my fiancé emailed my manager and told him she was getting me a sick note to the end of the week, but I’d probably be back before it runs out. 

Here’s where the advice side comes in. My manager has come back to her to tell her it’s all fine, but he’d expect me to stay off work till the sick note runs out, she hasn’t actually requested it yet, and has suggested that she just asks it to run out today, I go back tomorrow and essentially lie and say I asked the GP to do a new one with a different end date. 

I now feel like even though I feel up to going back tomorrow (it’d be 3 days in then 7 off), if I lie like that I’m going to feel guilty and that’s just going to make things worse, but in the same breath if I don’t go back, I’m going to feel like I’m letting people down particularly as my sick note conveniently ends right at the start of a weeks annual leave, I don’t know what’s best to do, and feel like I’m between a rock and a hard place, just any ideas from anyone on what’s the best route to take?",05Mar2020,1

92,"My father works very hard for us as a family and it seems at the end of the week he has nothing for himself. Over the years we can see he is slowly withdrawing into himself, getting more irritable, complaining and only seeing the negative. 

I came back from three months abroad and he seemed happy enough to see me but that night at the dinner table he hardly said anything while the conversation flowed between the rest of us. Then he went to bed without saying good night to anybody.

His relationship with his parents is pretty sour, long story. They’re on talking terms but everything between them is awkward. My mother and he have had their disagreements over the years including coming close to separation, now when they have an argument it’s usually over something small and he resigns and just grumbles. 

He has no friends. He lacks self control with eating people’s snacks (he’s not overweight I just mean he doesn’t have respect for what belongs to others). He uses my tools sometimes and leaves them out or breaks them accidentally. If I do that he goes fucking mental. In my opinion I think he doesn’t respect himself enough to respect others) But he works so hard. 

His relationship with my sister isn’t that great, she is heartbroken over the lack of affection shown over the years. When I came back from my trip I was press-ganged into talking to him by the whole family. Thing is though, I’ve tried in the past and he seems happy to vent but it’s the same the next day. I need to convince him to see a professional but I’m afraid his pride and financial worry (time is money) will prevent him from actually trying.

I have had mild depressive periods in my life, he doesn’t seem suicidal, just numb. In the past he has admitted to being depressed or losing interest in the things that make him happy, but I cannot help. I don’t know what I’m doing and I don’t want to fuck it up. I need some advice on how to get him to see somebody.",05Mar2020,1

I began dissociating and life did not feel real anymore. Flash forward to now and I feel great and like I’m ready to come off my meds, but I’m just terrified of these symptoms returning.

97,"So growing up I met my best friend in middle school. We were friends for about 10 years and he and I were really close. During high school, we would play video games every night and we would message each other all day about random things. I was his only friend and I had other friends, but he was always my best friend and the one I looked forward to talking to.

Early last year, he found some online friends he liked to play games with. He slowly stopped enjoying all the things we did together so we just stopped doing everything we used to and I sorta felt useless. It became harder to message him and I got toxic toward him because I felt like he replaced me. We’ve since made up, but it’s not quite the same. We still message each other, but I still feel alone.

Before we made up, I met a girl online and we became extremely close. We would message each other for hours everyday and we liked the same TV shows and video games so we would talk about those things endlessly. I told her about my friend and how most of my friends sort of replace me after a while and she assured me she wouldn’t do that. Eventually she stopped talking to me and now we barely talk. We occasionally send each other pictures on Snapchat, but we aren’t as close and I miss her a lot.

After that, I met someone else online. Something drastic happened in my life so I currently go to bed 4 AM EST and my new friend is in PST so we’re usually awake at the same time. I really enjoy talking to her, but she’s the only friend I have. I don’t really have any friends at my college and she’s the one person I look forward to talking to everyday. It’s just that I feel annoying and she has a lot of friends so I feel intimidated and I don’t really think she wants/needs me as a friend.

I was thinking about trying to find more friends (well I never really stopped, but I don’t really get along with a lot of people because I’m introverted), but I’ve been told I need to be more independent. Currently I feel lonely if my friend isn’t responding and I don’t think that’s healthy or normal. 

Is it wrong to be wanting to talk to a friend a lot so I feel less lonely? Do you think I should try to work on being happier alone and if so, how would I go about doing that?

Any advice would be appreciated. I’ve been really depressed over this for a while.",05Mar2020,1
98,"I have a long history with anxiety around a vast number of things... but a big one is disappointing or angering people that I love. My biggest triggers are yelling and aggressive body movements (like stomping or slamming doors), these things can literally make my flight response alert me that I’m about to die somehow (I feel so stupid for this but I haven’t healed it all the way yet.) 

I moved in with my boyfriend and his mom earlier this year and, for the first time in years, I started experiencing intense anxiety on an almost daily basis.
I find that I’m acutely sensitive to my boyfriends tones and body language — I always feel that I can tell when he’s frustrated with me, which feels like fairly often. 

Here’s what I’ve learned since moving in together: his mom is a NIGHTMARE. Quite certainly one of the most unstable people I’ve ever met and she RAGES toward her children completely irrationally, then turns around and acts like it never happens.
That being said, I can cut him a little slack and understand where his pent up aggression is rooted. And for the hand he was dealt, he is truly one of the most sensitive and patient men I’ve ever known. 

For some back context, I’ve only had one other truly serious relationship, and that man left me because my anxiety was too much for him; he cited our future children and that they deserved a mother who could hold herself together. Yea.... that fuckin hurt 

So anyway, tonight my boyfriend was acting a little aggressive and it was definitely stirring something up for me. He had already told me that he was feeling angry toward his mom, and I know the difference between what’s just a trigger for me, and what looks like it might become violent. 
But he kept saying critical things to me and expressing very obvious frustration. My anxiety came out full force... I cried, I questioned whether he’s really happy with me (because he IS frustrated toward me often and I CAN tell even if he denies it.) And then he said it... “it’s emotionally exhausting dealing with it. EVERYTHING makes you anxious. You impose your anxiety onto me.” 

In our 1 year together, I’ve checked in as level headedly as I could as often as I could that I’m not putting too much pressure on him; that he feels comfortable being honest with me.
Tonight he used the phrase “I wanted to finally be honest.” 

We didn’t break up, but I can’t stop thinking that’s because he’d feel too bad for me. I don’t want to break up, but I feel like I can’t really get past this... and I have never meant to impose my anxiety on him. I truly feel so sorry I’ve repeated this mistake and it makes me wonder if I simply cannot have a healthy relationship until my own healing process is further along... but how can I ever know when that will be",05Mar2020,1
99,"Since the age of about 21 I convinced myself I am depressed I tried about 6 different anti depressants with no real success, I was then given about 30 CBT sessions but came to the conclusion with the therapist I am not clinically depressed but have OCD (intrusive thoughts/‘pure O’) with some low mood and anxiety. I am 30 now.

6 months on from CBT I feel like I am struggling again I wake up in the morning and I dread what my mind is going to throw at me.. it doesn’t take long before I have a thought and run with it for the entire day, my current theme is that I am mentally unwell and I need to try out medications and go back to see the doctor but I’m worried that this is just OCD tricking me into starting the off the whole procedure again

Other thoughts I have are:
-I haven’t been truly happy since I was a teenager 
- I’m going crazy

I am also really stuck in my head all the time I find it very hard to be in the moment

I know these are really common OCD themes but I’m stuck, I don’t want to ask for more help because I’m afraid of starting the cycle again.

I’m not taking any medications at all at the moment and haven’t been for around 18 months, I’ve been reading up about combining antidepressants with low dosage antipsychotics but again I’m not sure if this is just OCD giving me more solutions to a problem I can’t solve

TLDR:
OCD intrusive thoughts for 10+ years do I got back to doctors or is it just OCD tricking me into worrying

100,"Not entirely sure where to start, so I'll just say that for most of my life I have been an extremely confident, outgoing, extroverted and humorous person. I never had any issues with myself, felt very comfortable in my own skin and never cared much about what others thought about me.

At 18 I moved out of home and in with two other friends. It's important to note that I was quickly assumed to be at the bottom of the social hierarchy within this house, I was the smallest, most short tempered and least confrontational. I didn't realise it at the time, but looking back on the situation (currently still in it), I realise that my confidence and personality has really been stripped from me. I'm unable to directly pinpoint why this is, but It scares the absolute hell out of me. I have had people tell me lately that I've changed a lot, and the tone of their voice assures me that they don't mean it in a good way.

I find some silver lining in that I think I have become a more empathic, understanding, genuinely happy and aware person but I can't seem to socialise anymore. I get too anxious and nervous. Anxious about something I may have said, anxious about what they think of me, and it kills me when people bring up the fact that I'm different.

I guess I'm just seeking some closure, if anyone has gone through this I'd love to know how to keep my chin up and continue going on, because it ruins me and sends me into depressive episodes with awful anxiety.

104,"Hi there. I'll do my best to keep this short and avoid ranting, but it's rough.

My BF (37M) and I (31F) have been together for 2yrs now, he moved in one year ago. Don't get me wrong, I fiercely love that man, but honestly, he's a mess. He's never had a purpose, he just picked a random career and now he hates his job with every fiber of his body, but there's nothing else he can do for a living because he doesn't have even the smallest skill in anything else that he can turn into a job. He feels worthless and miserable.

I'm pretty sure he is depressed, even though it's not diagnosed all the signs are right there. In the last 1,5 year he changed 3 jobs, and recently I start to see a pattern. His boss is always an asshole who humiliates him all the time, calling him an incompetent flake in front of others, and his co-workers are bullying him making him feel dumb and excluded. He has had panic attacks because of this and he's visibly depressed. 

Problem is, despite changing 3 jobs in 2 years he's never been fired, he just got convinced that they were about to kick him out and applied for a new job (which he got). He says his co-workers are awful but he's been out grabbing beers with his former co-workers several times, after he resigned. Also, I know the world is full of assholes but what are the odds that the same exact scenario keeps happening all the time? 

Same thing with sex. Our bedroom is completely dead, even though we cuddle a lot, we can't have sex because every time he panics about his perfectly fine boner: he is worried that it won't last and guess what? He gets nervous and it stops working, doesn't matter how I try to make him feel comfortable. Being with him I can rule out any medical conditions, I know it's all in his head. 

Also, his family lives across the country and I don't have the chance to talk to his parents really often but I've been under the impression that sometimes he talks about them like over controlling, super intrusive parents but lately I've been reconsidering his description as well. 

So, either he is developing a delusional disorder, or he is just desperatly trying to find an excuse for his failure. Or maybe, he is so biased that everything is going to suck that when he gets a new job his attitude toward bosses, co-workers and the work itself is all messed up and he makes this happen. I tried every approach I could think of. To be only supportive doesn't work, looks like I'm allowing him to give up. Now I try to be his lucid POV and play the devil's advocate, but I don't push it too much because I don't want him to think I'm discrediting his words and downplaying his struggles. Ultimatums won't work with him, he'll just think that he is so worthless that he's been able to ruin our relationship on top of his career, so I can't threaten him about leaving if he doesn't fix this. 

He's been in therapy years ago and every time I try to bring it up he says that it's a waste of money, his problem is that he is a useless flake and no therapist will help him with this. 

I am running out of resources here, I need other points of view to be able to help him getting out of this, or at least, make him willing to do that.",05Mar2020,1
105,"Seriously. I feel great when I'm with people I'm close with (not strangers though, social anxiety is a bitch) but when I'm alone my mood slumps. I motivate myself by saying I'll disappoint my family and teachers if I fail. When I think of the future one of the first things I consider is friendships, but then I remember I don't have friends anymore and likely won’t let myself make new ones when I move out soon because I'm way too anxious to talk to anyone anymore. That's when I lose hope. 

I have potential with science, art, becoming a better person, but I lose all motivation just because I don't see myself having any meaningful relationships ever again. I just don't see a point in living if everything I accomplish is in solitude. I don't understand why I feel the need to have people around me at all times to feel meaningful.",05Mar2020,1

He's going to see a doctor next week about it and he knows he's going to put him on antidepressants, which is something he's been fighting to get off.

He was tearing up and said he isn't sure if it's because of his recent brekaup (he doubts it since he was unhappy in that relationship), or he maybe didn't give himself enough time to heal after my mum's death, he's really unsure what it could be. He's not worried about his health or money but he's worried about my brother doing his exams or me getting a full-time job, but that stuff's normal and wouldn't affect him that badly.

He's seeking help because he knows it's not fair on my brother and I to be around him not knowing if he's going to be happy or angry and it's something he needs to get sorted out.

113,"I've had this issue that really worsened around about the 9th grade, where I would lose focus, not be able to study or concentrate and get frustrated at the prospect of studying for exams or doing assignments. Well now im in my first year of university, second semester and its the worst it's ever been.

  


There are multiple assignments i completely didn't do, which I've never done before, and I'd walk up mere hours before a class to skim read the notes for a test. I have an art class where we have to submit 2 courseworks every week and every week we delay it we lose a letter grade, and it's been 5 weeks and I've only done one coursework from the first week and didn't do the others. I also have this language course where we have to write a paragraph long diary entry every week and i haven't done any of them. Among other assignments i just can't bring myself to do. Everytime i sit down and tell myself to work i just feel frustrated and angry and cry almost everytime. I've also always worked so slowly that something that i predict should take me an hour at most takes me the whole day and i might not even finish it.

  


This doesn't only happen with studying, but also with starting things i actually want to do, like drawing or reading, i just can't get myself to start them because it always feels like the time in a day passes by super quickly and im lagging behind.

  


I tried to go to a counseller at uni before but it either didn't help, i had bad experiences with either the booking or they cancel, or the counsellers were just kinda rude or standoffish.

  


I made another post on why i can't tell my mom about this either, but the gist of it is that she doesn't believe me and waves it off, as things like this make her worry and she doesn't like getting stressed.

  


At this moment in time im on a two week break, and i still want to start on my overdue assignments, as well as an english assignment that was supposed to be due 3 days ago and i didnt realise with today being the last day, but again everytime i try to type or even think abouy doing research i get frustrated and angry and anxious and cry. I don't know what to do, i don't wanna fail because my family will get mad at me but i just can't do it at all.

  


I try opening articles, I've opened so many of ""How to start studying"" or ""How to do things you don't want to do"" or otherwise, I've asked on here before and I've looked at other people's advice on websites but none of it works. I don't know what to do.",05Mar2020,1

115,"EDIT: I'm so sorry for so much text, I just wrote what came to mind!! I'm kind of panicking so I just kept typing, it's all related to my title but I bet you could cut this down by 75%. Anyways, whether you read it or not and just comment from the title alone, I'm very thankful.

I don't know if I'm just mistaking depression for ADD or something but I'm so anxious and overthinking this. It feels like I'll just look like a lazy young adult male looking to get hopped up on free speed, I can't fucking calm down and I'm really nervous about seeing a psychologist tomorrow, I'm so scared I'll be ridiculed or she will think I'm overreacting, I don't know what to expect. It feels like I'll be all cloudy like I get in most conversations and forget what to say.

But my (ADD? I don't want to be disrespectful and self diagnose) has gone to the point now where I've started having extreme bursts of aggression a few times a month when I'm home alone, but it's like a switch being flipped by the tiniest gust of wind. This was *very* common for the vast majority of my childhood, and it's scary it's returning now that my issues have started making me depressed too. Like I'll drop a fucking fork on the floor as I'm eating lunch and that sends me spiralling into aggression, I'll throw the chair on the floor, start screaming about hating life and about how I can't even just sit down and focus on a simple one-page E-level assignment. I had no idea procrastination could be this brutal. Same shit in elementary school too, teachers gave me a book I could draw in because I spent lessons just nonstop drawing on tables and daydreaming out the window, couldn't focus at all. The only school work I have done what so ever all of 2020 was a simple TWO page assignment, and that only worked because I managed to get hold of illegal amphetamine which helped me quite a bit but also made me very anxious because I don't want to resort to drugs, but I just can't do anything it feels like. And it's not about motivation, my motivation is totally there, has always been. If anything my motivation can be really intense and make me super disciplined about something, I just can't direct it and it's so temporary and I end up reading a book I like or playing a game for hours on end and loosing track of time.

I don't even talk about my interests and hobbies or worries with my parents *in the slightest* nowadays because I'm scared shitless of the slightest ridicule. I pretty frequently have bouts of anxiety where my head becomes completely clouded with racing thoughts like ""why am I so weird"", ""why can't I just be normal"", ""why does it feel like everyone looks at me like a fucking alien"", ""why can't I accomplish the simplest fucking chore"", etc.

Conversations have always been hard too all my life and the depression that's been creeping in recently just makes all the symptoms worse. My mind feels pretty damn clouded most of the time in the sense that I cave in and fixate on what the person just said and what I'm going to say next so I end up not being able to think about it at all and give up so I just switch topic or say something super open which leaves conversations stale.

It's been like this all my life EXCEPT a period of about 8~ months I had two years ago in which I actually managed to do good and get good grades and get into working out. I couldn't keep that shit consistent at all, fell off all the time, but I ways managed to get back into it quickly. I've also never had trouble sleeping. Other than that this self destructive behaviour has been with me all the time. 

I read about various symptoms online and on other Reddit posts and it is scarily accurate. I am the only male in LITERALLY my ENTIRE close family who isn't diagnosed with either ADD, ADHD, or depression, which makes me even more worried.

I'm nervous and scared I either: won't get help cause it doesn't seem that bad, or I'll get too much help (like trying medication) and it'll be unwarranted because I'm blowing things out of proportion. Am I?? I just don't know, please help. My behavior sounds like ADD to me and it's ruining my life, especially school. Thanks for reading, it means a lot to me.",05Mar2020,1

You're worried that it may affect your future but you're also feeling like it's better to do now than in the future. So you take on the drugs again and regretting it immediately. 

You're thinking it's a mistake and you shouldn't have taken the drugs again. You're thinking and regretting the same thing again and again and couldn't stay focused on your passion and career. You're feeling like you can't pursue your passion anymore because of these thoughts. Whatever you try to do the thoughts and regret are blocking your mind and making you feel guilty.

How will you overcome this situation?

How will you get back on track again?

How to stay positive in this kind of situation? 

How to let go of the thoughts and regret?

I can tell you guys what I'm going through if you want to know. I just didn't want to add it here and the make it a long post.",05Mar2020,1
117,"After watching a video from Chris Ulmer (SBSK) about Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and I saw myself identifying with the interviewer a lot. Therefore I used my old friend Google and I found that I can identify with the “9 major symptoms” or whatever of BPD. I know it’s not good to self diagnose so I was wondering, people of Reddit, should I see a psychiatrist on this matter?",05Mar2020,1
118,"I'll start this by saying I know I need therapy. It's on my priority list, but I don't have health insurance currently and I'm trying to get a better grasp on my financial situation.

I (26M) spent 8 years in an abusive relationship with a woman who had BPD. There is a ton to unpack there, but the summary is that nothing was ever her responsibility. Nothing was ever her fault. All of my problems were my problems and all of her problems were also my problems. 

Her poor spending habits meant we were constantly on the back foot. We never had any savings, and money was a constant stressor. I wracked up nearly 10k in debt and destroyed my credit during this relationship just trying to keep us afloat. Her personality disorder cost her job after job, which she always blamed on other people, and I worked in a stressful food-industry job making a piss-poor wage for nearly 55+ hours a week to make things work.

On top of this, her moods dictated every day. I wasn't allowed to have a bad day because my bad day would bring her down and that wasn't ""fair to her"". I wasn't allowed to break, and yet I had to endure countless nights of endless yelling and sleep deprivation. All of this, of course, was ""my fault.""

I learned to disassociate. When her yelling started I would go somewhere else in my head. It was kind of like being in the bottom of a dark well and if I looked up at the mouth of the well I could see reality, but at the bottom I was secure in this darkness away from it all. I stopped feeling a lot of emotions in general, because I was too stressed to feel anything.

Fast forward a bit. I broke up with her, got an apartment with my brother who is also my best friend, and started my life over. I'm slowly getting my finances back on track. I have a new career that is going super well with a lot of opportunities and I love it. Most importantly, I met the woman I'm going to marry.

This is the most incredible woman I've ever met. She's absolutely beautiful, she's successful, she's hilarious, she's a badass who climbs mountains and she takes great care of her body. She's sweet, and she's caring, and no one has ever made me feel the way that she does. Which brings me to the point of this post.

I have suddenly found myself becoming very emotional lately. I don't remember the last time I cried, but on Valentine's Day she wrote me this note and it was the the most beautiful thing I've ever read and I broke. Tears were streaming down my face uncontrollably. After spending so long being emotionally deprived it almost felt embarrassing to have no control over it, but at the same time it felt great. 

It has happened a few more times to smaller degrees. I was in Seattle for the first time a little bit ago and we went to this park together and sat on a hill while the sun set and I could feel it coming again. I didn't cry, but I felt that emotion swelling and my eyes began to water a bit.

Then I had a big one again this morning. I was driving to work and listening to ""Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You"" by Frankie Valli because me and my (current)girlfriend had said we are going to play that at our wedding. I was listening to it and picturing her in her dress on that day and I broke again. Tears pouring out of my face, almost sobbing. There is nothing on this planet that makes me happier.


So I guess my question is this: Is this a normal response? Is it unusual to go from a void of emotion to being overcome by it regularly? Am I just adjusting to feeling things again, or will I continue to be overwhelmed by it? 

Thank you for reading. Any comments or advice are appreciated.",05Mar2020,1

I'll always have these kinds of episodes every week spanning a couple days where I feel nothing and everything and I fucking hate it.

I feel as if I'm too emotional at times and I hate it. I'm so fucking sensitive, I don't want to be this sensitive because it feels so shit and you feel everything and it gets too much. It just means I can snap easier and it makes me feel weak-minded. I just want an answer on why I feel like this. I'm meant to be happy, I have a loving family and a caring girlfriend who I love very much but yet I still feel like absolute shit half the week.

I've been battling this desire to want to be famous, have a career like no other, and everytime I realise its not possible it sends me into a horrible mood that can last for a very long time. Sometimes I can't watch movies because I leave the cinema wishing I was a part of the movie, while listening to music I realise how much I want to be a musician, but then I remind myself that I have no talent and I'm too old to try.

The point is, I really want people to know who I am. The feeling of someone recognising you for something good just sounds great. I want that. 

I'm at a great university, doing a course I should theoretically love but I'm just not happy.

so i was talking to my friend thats in some kind of nurse school and her class is all women pretty much all i ever hear about is them being extremely toxic yelling at and degrading each other 

skip this next bit if you want to but im gonna copy paste some of the conversation here for context 

 
""and bc this dumb bitch in my program was like she isn't even your real sister, just like brandon (her adopted son) will never be your kid. &amp; i screamed at her bc she doesn't know me and she doesn't understand a dysfunctional family bc her parents are still married and everyone in her family is wealthy her parents pay her bills and all she does is wait till the last minute to study and go to the gym. &amp; fuck any man in uniform""

my girlfriend works somewhere that is also all women and comes home crying all the time for very similar stuff people being mean to her and such or will come home trying to tell me what she thinks is a funny or cool story and its basically just her being a huge bitch to some other female 

i work in construction and have had a few different jobs all have been with only men and iv never had anything close to any of these issues we cut up we laugh we buy each other food and are just generally nice to each other 

women are seen as much nicer and gentler generally but it seems to me like its definitely the opposite im most cases especially when its just groups of the same sex

I never used to be like this but going through the education system has really just made me miserable. 
really small things like someone walking slowly or chewing loudly will put me in a bad mood and wish that person were dead.

Anyway, my boyfriend seems to actually have it. When I say, ""text me when you get home"" or ""drive safe"" or ""let's go to my bedroom"" he gets upset. Or really anything I say that is not a request and sounds to him like a demand. 

My question is, does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? I have tried to remember to make requests and not demands, but it's difficult to make that a habit, because 1. It wouldn't bother me if he said those things to me. 2. I'm a manager, so I tell people what to do all day long.

Well of course I woke up today and I feel dread in my gut about having to leave the house, so I cancelled it again. This is becoming a weekly thing where I tell her I’m going and then cancel a few hours before. I feel like utter shit and feel like I have to punish myself in some way because she is obviously upset and irritated about it but I’m just so stupidly tired. She says she doesn’t care if I don’t take while I’m there, but I don’t see how it would be fun to sit with me like this the entire night. 

I just needed a bit of a vent because I’m thinking of self harming or starving myself again because I feel like a bitch for purposefully messing her around.

131,"Hello everybody, 

 I've come across the mental health subreddit, along with various others, and it has further emphasised to me that I am not alone and others are going through similar stuff that I am. HOWEVER, that doesn't change my circumstances. 

For quite some time, probably around 3-4 years, I've dipped out of suicidal thoughts and general low moods, some of which can last weeks and weeks. Just to clarify I'm 18 now. Whenever my mood would peak again, I'd say/convince myself that I was just feeling a bit sad, and blame it on something going on in my life, like receiving a bad grade at school or argument with my parents etc. 

I really need some advice. Nowadays, I go through spells of feeling great, and spells of feeling worthless. A lot of the time I feel light-headed, and it is honestly the most frustrating thing in the world. I don't know why this happens. On top of this, I feel numb to my emotions a lot of the time. I feel as if I don't love my friends, family or S.O, even though in my head I know I do. 

I get annoyed while hanging around with best friends, it's like I don't want to be there. It feels like my battery is constantly drained. My energy levels are low. Always. I used to be suicidal, but now I don't want to die, but I don't want to live either. 

My friends and family haven't been much help, and that's because I haven't really opened up/they wouldn't understand. I also can't control my emotions. I would always convince myself I could, but I was just choosing to act that way. However I know I really can't control them. I get emotional/cry over little things, such as my parents arguing with me. This never used to happen at all.  I used to sort of love getting shouted at lol.

My S.O often asks if I have anger issues, because when feeling low I can't be bothered with anything or anyone and lash out easily. Then shortly after I feel the utmost guilt and apologise, feeling bad about it for days. 

There is nobody in my immediate family with a history of mental health illnesses/disorders (from my knowledge). Can someone please help?

I slowly feel myself dropping into a low mood. I reckon within a week or two, I'll be depressed and numb again. I can't stop it. 

I need answers. Help.",05Mar2020,1

A few weeks ago I swallowed a bunch of pills, not because I wanted to die but because I wanted a break from everything.

136,"(sorry if this isn't the right place to post this, just the first thing I could think of)

For the past month or so my brain has more or less started to collapse in on itself and its fucking exhausting. I can tell all the symptoms but it doesn't seem to come together to anything at all in the slightest and that just makes it even worse? So I just wanna see if any of y'all have any clue about what the FUCK is happening bc I can't stand this shit. The main symptoms would probably be:

•First and foremost, I've been struggling with dissociation for about three years now, and its gotten a lot worse as of late.

•My internal monologue, which used to be active as all hell (really the best conversation I normally got haha) has been completely ghosting me.

•I don't seem to be able to enjoy anything anymore. I talk to people I love, and it feels like they're not even there. I listen to my favourite albums, and it doesn't feel like anything, just the sheer fact that music is on, with no emotional connection. I try to read, and they're just meaningless words. 

•Life in general just feels like a dream, like everything is unfamiliar, off-kilter, and not playing by the same rules it always has. Like the sky has turned purple, gravity has stopped working, and no one noticed but me

•Anything I DO enjoy doesn't connect with me. If I heard album which was a hundred times better than my all time favourite, I'd have completely forgotten it by the end of the day

•I keep waking up at 2 or 3 AM with a feeling that something is wrong. A mixture of fear and guilt and complete sensory overstimulation. And its awful.

•I have no DRIVE to talk to people, even people I love with everything in me.

•I feel completely exhausted, even if I sleep for 10 hours or more hours. Like I didn't sleep a second last night, I was running off a can of monster, and now I'm starting to crash.

• I'm just constantly pissed off for absolutely no reason.

• I've lost all creativity, leading to the worst ever writer's block, so I just feel completely unachieved.

• And above all else, I can never be satisfied with what I do in a day. Yesterday, for example, I watched a film, went out with my friends, wrote a really good piece (sometimes shit slips through the block), heard three albums, and read one third of the book I'm reading. And I'm still telling myself I didn't do a single thing and wasted everyone's time

I have constant anxiety and stress on a daily basis based off the choices I have made with people I used to be friends with.

I am a very passionate person. I’m passionate for friendships, relationships, my veganism, my art, my fashion, etc; Due to my passionate personality, I am also an extremely honest person. Struggling with social anxiety since the age of 11, being 19 now I have grown to control this anxiety and to start speaking my mind. I am not someone to tell you what you want to hear. I am not someone who’s going to keep something from you out of fear that it will hurt you. I am not a quiet person when it comes to my passion for any relationships that I hold both for friends and lovers. 

I was told that I am drama from M, my best friend. It hurt me because in the moment I felt she was correct. Looking back at it now, I am not the drama. Am I considered drama because I got upset with you for doing cocaine at 18 and being fucked up in a trap house full of 30 year old scummy addicts? Am I drama because I told you that your low-life, drug addicted, piece of shit, 22 year old boyfriend cheated on you for the FOURTH time? Am I drama because I tell you what you NEED to hear and not what you WANT to hear? I'm sorry I don't enable you anymore. I'm sorry that I can't support your fucked up relationship anymore. I'm so fucking sorry that I am the ""drama"" in your life, despite everything going wrong the moment you started dating that sociopathic fuck. But still, you have made me feel like I'm the toxic one. You make me feel like I am fucking up everything in your life. I understand when I was 16-17 I made some mistakes, but for you to make me feel like I'm that person again fucks up everything that I have worked for to change. 

To H and J, the girls that fucked with my head. Why am I deemed the bad guy when I couldn't handle being friends with people who were extremely mentally unstable. Why am I a bad guy because I couldn't be around people who were enabling me to drink my issues away. I didn't have a fucking job, I couldn't apply for school, because you made me feel unmotivated, you provided me no support unless it was through substances. I couldn't handle my own mental health wasting away because I was around constant negativity. When I ended our friendships, I was told to kill myself. I was told that I'm a sociopath. I had rumours spread about me, lies that I couldn't even comprehend. I was thrown into a pit of anxiety and stress because I couldn't escape the insanity you girls hold. Still to this day, H stalks me on my social media, fucking with my head. I ran into J a couple weeks ago, and I got told that I have ""no right to make eye contact"" with her. Am I the bad guy because i wanted to be happy and I couldn't be happy around these girls, in their own fucked up way it was like they were restricting me from happiness. They were withholding me from joy, almost like they fed off my miserableness. I got insults thrown at me, stories told about me, every ounce of confidence I built up got knocked back down again, and for what? Because I wanted a better life? Am I the problem for wanting to do something with my life, for not wanting to feel like garbage anymore?

I can't seem to understand what is even going on anymore. People ghost me, people hear a manipulated story about me that emerged from anger, and suddenly I am a bad guy. Am I the bad guy though? Am I the toxic person here?

I will admit that my approach to situations is anything but subtle, I don't sugarcoat. But am I that horrible of a person? It's a constant fight in my head, a cross between wanting to be happy, but also being filled with anxiety and constantly overthinking my decisions. Please help me understand what I am doing wrong because it seems like I all I do is lose friends, but I can't pinpoint if I'm actually the toxic one or I just put myself in situations with toxic people that make me feel bad.

Days go by, then weeks, then months. All i am doing is existing. Broken from the top to bottom. I am the poster boy for dissapointment. To put it plainly. I have zero friends (had many, pushed them away), I have fucked my finances, debt that i cant clear off. i earn far less than what i should, because i wasted alot of time doing God knows what. I have a decent job, but everyday i feel someone would realise that i am a fraud and would ask me to leave. I have real anger issues, i have hurt myself and things around me, i have tried sucicide ones last year (was in the ICU for a week or so) I live with my family (Indian System &amp; Culture) I have no bond with anyone other than what you develop because you know them for decades. except for my parents i dont even make eye contact with anyone. I run away from family gatherings, I had an abusive relationship with my brother (broke my confidence every chance he got), i have had 3 failed relationships, and my current one breaks every other day (love is not enough when you are wired wrong), i try everything, there are days when i write shit down and organize, download shit apps, read articles and then i tell myself this is it, i am gonna change things around, and then the very next hour, i am where i started, i am lazy, i dont feel like doing anything, i am overweight, i want to workout, but i cant afford shit right now. I know i am in debt, but i have no control over buying shit and then regretting, i know i am fat, but i keep eating junk. right this moment too, i am frustrated, tearing up, no confidence. always comparing myself to others.

Nothing can help, what people i have around me, i dont seem to connect with any, the ones i do, i push them away.

I explained to my school's counselor what was going on and they'd told my family about it and told them that I needed to go see someone. My family blew up on me, berating me and essentially saying I had no reason to feel the way I do. Over the past few days I've waited for them to either talk to me about the issue, find a professional I could talk to, etc. This morning however I've been informed that they've pulled me out of my school, are refusing to let me see a professional, and will not be enrolling me into any other schools...

No matter what I do everyone always leaves me, not because they're bad people but because I'm insufferable. I've never caused anything but harm to others.

147,"I’m a 26 year old female but this has been an issue for quite some time now. I’ve been able to recognize it since at least age 18. One week I’ll feel intense amounts of motivation and confidence. It’ll be borderline overwhelming. I don’t want to sleep because all I want to do is grind and be my best self. I’ll come up with all these amazing ideas for my future and how to work towards them. I’ll suddenly be going to yoga and to the gym often. There’s been a few times where I’ve splurged money into something that I actually cannot afford, but I do it because I’m not thinking clearly. Then suddenly, I’ll wake up and I’ll be wildly depressed. Often suicidal. Looking into my journal, there is numerous entry’s where I even go as far as writing suicide notes and how I could kill myself. I feel guilty and sad and worthless. And it seems like absolutely nothing can get me out of that funk. It’s such a horrible feeling. Then suddenly, after a few days to a week or two, I’ll get a wave of motivation and I’m on top of the world again. I feel so good that I don’t even care about how wildly depressed I just was. I think “I’m okay now. I don’t need help. Because that feeling was temporary and I’m good now.” And the same cycle will continue. Sometimes I do feel fairly neutral in between these bouts of extreme emotions, it’s not always such extremes but very often it is. I’m so sick of it. I just want to stay motivated and happy but it always disappears.

152,"I grapple with depression and anxiety, and have been on antidepressants since October but upped my dosage last week after a consultation. This incident had happened one other time shortly after beginning the meds, so I believe it’s just a side effect. 

A stomachache woke me up last night. I’m a recovering emetophobe (phobia of vomit) so I tried to breathe deeply. But a rush of nausea overtook me, so I went outside on my back porch to get some fresh air, and to throw up if needed. 

The next few minutes I was trying to fight against my own rioting body, feeling trapped as it stiffened and trembled and I had trouble breathing. I took a few hits of a CBD vape pen I bought for both anxiety and chronic pain, and it worked. But I woke up feeling unrested and dissociated from reality, and just feel exhausted.

154,"I feel a strange urge to post this. It just came on really strongly and I need to get it off my chest. I'm going through a bit of a rough time, mentally, right now, though improving. So it's not surprising I'm thinking of past mental crisis.

When I was in the psychiatric ward last May for a suicide attempt, I hadn't had my anxiety meds for a whole day. I was stressed. I ended up being there for a week and it helped immensely. 

One of the nurses was understandably stressed, and accused me of running to the head nurse to complain about not receiving my medicine fast enough. I hadn't done this. I was told to wait, so I went to my room, having a panic attack. 

The head person came in to the room and asked what was wrong. I told her I was waiting, and she took me up to the front. This actually happened twice, but was cleared up both times.

I snapped at the nurse. Not hugely, but I slammed my fist on the desk, yelled I hadn't done it, and used the f-word.

I have never yelled at medical person in the 11 years I've had anxiety. This was wildly out character for me.

I immediately backed up, hugged myself and apologized. She might have been short and incorrect, but she didnt deserve to be screamed and cursed at.

She was much more patient afterwards and was very kind. I apologized again the next day, but she seemed okay with it.

I don't know why I feel a need to post this. During my stay, there were a lot of great nurses, including the one in my post. They were under a lot of stress. I'm not mad anymore about being accused. I wish I hadn't been, but I understand why she said that, and why I reacted the way I did. They had a lot of patients going up multiple times. Including my roomate. I get it.

I guess I'm posting this to say give yourself a break if you have a momentary freak out. And maybe don't accuse patients of doing something they didnt, maybe ask them first. I dunno. It's a tough job, and mistakes happen.",05Mar2020,1

It doesn't matter what i do, as SOON as the world changes slightly for the worse around my my brain goes absolutely haywire and I get so depressed. honestly it doesn't even have to change for the worse it just has to change. 

Anyways. I recently moved and so of course I'm depressed now. Going to see a psych later this month. but (and i know some of this is the depression talking) I am feeling more and more hopeless as the years go by and the depression keeps coming back. I feel like I'll never not be depressed. I'll just have a few brief moments of normalcy while my meds work and then as soon as something slightly stressful shows up, my meds wont work anymore and I'll be depressed again. 

has anyone found something that works? for the record I know I'll hear exercise and sleep so-- I have a great sleep schedule, mostly because I have a sleep disorder. I am medicated for said sleep disorder, and to my knowledge my sleep is now pretty good because I have very few symptoms. But, I get 8 hours every single night except once in a blue moon. As for exercise, I have struggled to find any motivation to do so but right now I'm running like 4 times a week. It does not make me feel better and never has, even when consistently working out.

157,"There are countless ways to fuck things up, and only a handful to make it right. I didn't set the rules and didn't want to play the game, yet here I am.  

That's how most of us going through difficult times deal with the world. You try for years, fail for a moment, and that is what turns your life around. Over and over again, the pattern happens. It just feels like a downwards spiral.  

This is in fact the convergence of two things:  
- we forget to acknowledge all the other little moments that led us there, all the little victories and things done right that the world takes for granted and we learn to take for granted too  
- when a hardship eventually hits our weakest point, we are so tired that we give in: mental disconnect, self-destruction, violence, and so on  

Keep that in mind. Improve at both things, and fail again just a little bit less painfully next time. Fail better, because if this is bound to be a gigantic failure anyway you might as well have a joyride and get good at it and give a big Fuck You to whatever decided you had to exist.  

To these two things I reply:  
- Acknowledge the little things of life, the beauty of a moment, an action. Call it a distraction from pain if you want, but enjoy it nonetheless. You're going to feel fully the pain, why not try to feel fully the good times. Neither is a given, neither is deserved or undeserved. It just happens, and you definitely eat up the bad part already.. so you pretty much owe it to yourself to get the good too  
- When shit hits the fan, learn to take a metaphorical step back. A breath is often enough to be a good start. Closing your eyes. Anything that stops the onslaught of the moment from turning the rain into a storm and the storm into devastation for yourself and others. 


Today another hardship hit. Big one, in a stream of big ones. Of course I'm exhausted, of course I'm not owed anything. Initial thought? End this life right now. Or self-destruct in a shitty way. Maybe hit the wall with your head until there's no wall? Or a high jump? That seems all very appealing.  

I closed my eyes for a brief second, and that second was a separation from the 'me' who is ever so good at responding to pain with pain. It's all it takes, a second or a breath, to let that timeline wither away.  

The one that's left is feeling the pain all the same. **It's not easier to get better**, most people won't understand that. But the one that's left is taking that step back to make a better step forward today or tomorrow.  
I came here and wrote this. Maybe I'll help out someone if I know anything useful to them. I feel pain all the same, but the biggest Fuck You I can give to that pain is hoping I can turn someone else's into something a tiny bit less worse at least.  

That's my rant of the day. Whoever you are, reading this, I feel you. You didn't set the rules either, might not want to play the game either. But you can let the other you wither away, gradually with each breath. I wish you well.",05Mar2020,1

I mean my dad has a pretty severe case of bipolar disorder and nobody ever acknowledged it until few years ago when he had to be hospitalized. Everyone thought my dad just had a very loud personality accompanied by anger issues; but recently its gotten to the point where its just pitiful- like waking everyone up at 3am in tears saying ""I need to tell you all something"" and he gives a few hours worth of pretense to what he's about to say but never quite gets to the point and blames it on us for not being receptive enough. And it's such a hard place for him and I love him and feel sorry for him but also like, im 21 and my sibilings 24 and this is supposed to be the prime of our lives but every time i come home im on egg shells. I feel bad that my sibiling still lives with him but hes afraid to move out bc of what my mom would end up like living alone w my dad.

Im so pissed off! I wish I could leave my two parents together and rest assured that no violoence will take place but thats never been the case. On any given day, ill hear a terrified yelp in my moms voice screaming my name and have to run down to see their room in pieces with my dad standing over my mom. We moved houses 13 times growing up. Not like my parents travel for work but more like they split up 6 times and got back together 7 times.

Growing up, he would go on for 4-5 hour 'lectures' *as we called it* when we got in trouble. Now looking back I realize that isn't a normal way to raise your kids, that's a textbook symptom of BPD. He would remind me as a kid that i am not my own person but a propogation of himself. 

Most of all, I hate who this turned me into. I've always been a *weird* kid with terrible social skills. I remember my dad asking me in 4th grade, ""what happened to your spark you used to be such an expressive kid?"" IDK dad I lost that shit! IDK who i am or why my life is the way it is. Even as a kid i would fantasize about sitting infront of a therapist and telling them everything thats been going on at home and for that imaginary therapist to just say

""its not your fault, none of what youre gooing through defines you""

What do i do now? as an adult i still have anxiety. On one hand i feel very smart and aware about some life issues most people never have to confront in their whole lives. But on the other hand, i wish i couldve had a better childhood and i hate the way I handle myself in relationships and see a reflection of my dad in that.

180,"I’m 21 (almost 22) and haven’t finished my degree at all. I’ve been on and off community college since 18 and have such a low gpa. I’ve been working the same fast food job as a regular team member for the same amount of time. Idk what’s happened lately to me but despite feeling suicidal and hopeless, I chose to leave my job in pursuit of something better. I even started going to the gym again and it’s hard to maintain a habit of it. I stopped eating out and started saving my money too. I don’t see the fruits of my changed behavior yet because I still feel pretty fucking worthless but I know the fruits are there and blooming. 

Now, I’ve concluded that my depression stems from home. My parents have argued so much throughout my life. I’ve always seen my mother in a negative aspect. I’m not affectionate to her and we argue constantly although not so much now the older I get. She would (and still does) hit herself with her hands or wall, throw things when angry, yell at my face or anyone’s face, says that it’s better to not have friends and not trust them, never truly praise me and thought negatively when making mistakes at school, work, etc, and always assume something bad would happen if I left home or make life decisions. She is a really nice person with others but very tough with my upbringing and my sister’s too. A lot of her behaviors have reflected onto me more than my little sister (which I’m so blessed for bc I wouldn’t like my little sis to feel the way I feel). I’ve done many of the things above, being more violent than my mom.

We just argued. My little sis (15) and I don’t have the best relationship and the argument stemmed from my sis’s friends being over last night. I got home late and the dishes were left dirty and the table was a mess. I chose not to clean it up. This morning, my mom was cleaning up and asked for me to finish it. I refused simply because I wasn’t responsible for my sister’s irresponsibility. My own mother started yelling how she feels alone and how she does everything. She said I was almost 22 and haven’t done anything in my life which is true. But it hurts because it’s the same topic again: me. She never understands how fucking hurt I am inside. She doesn’t understand my current depression that makes me not want to do anything. She doesn’t understand that I’m also tired of cleaning up after everyone.

181,I’ve been very stressed over the past few weeks. My trimester in school is ending so teachers have assigned a tone of work due this week and can’t be turned in even a day later. My boyfriend has also had a super hard time finding motivation for anything and can almost never sleep( I made another post about it). Today was the last day of the trimester so there was no homework due today and we have tomorrow off and a school trip all of next week so no homework at all. My boyfriend has been taking new medication for his sleep problems and it’s working. He’s also been talking to teachers after school and getting help. With all the stress being relieved at this very moment i feel so good. I looked up at the fan in my room and saw that is was colorful. It’s always been rainbow but the colors just seem brighter than they have lately. Then i looked around the room and all the colors are more vibrant. It sounds like i’m making stuff up or i’m using a metaphor or something but everything actually seems brighter. I don’t know if it’s related to the stress being relieved but I like it.,05Mar2020,1

However, it is not getting easy and I read in a self-compassion book that it is supposed to be hard specially if it is working. My head is spinning because of what my brain keeps telling me.

Today I have been having a horrible episode and it was stressing me during work, but I pulled through it. I am very dependable on emotions and love and I have been working to making that all independent and to love myself but that task is taking a lot of my energy and at the end of the day I am just exhausted mentally and physically somehow.

187,"I'm 18M from Russia.

Last year, I basically failed my biology exam(technically I just barely passed but no way any university that requires biology would accept me with that result even with good results on other exams) because I haven't studied at all and biology is not a subject you can take lightly in my country, unlike Russian, English and social studies where I haven't really studied specifically for the exam for the most part(there was also a compulsory maths exam but its difficulty was a total joke unless you are doing the non-compulsory part of it).

Anyway, I finished school with most of my exam results ranging from good to very good except for biology, which my parents weren't really all too happy about, and neither was I, but I coped pretty well and didn't stress out too much about it even when I inevitably didn't get accepted into a universtity that I was hoping to enter. I figured I'll just try to take a biology exam next year, **actually study in advance** and everything will be fine.

Oh how naive I was in thinking that I would actually study for the exam. I'm currently slightly less than a month away from my second try at the exam and I barely studied yet again. I hate myself for not being able to just sit down and study for god's sake. My parents stress out over me not studying, and I hate myself yet again for making them worry about me so much, but everytime I try to actually sit down and study I either procrastinate or study for a bit and then go watch YouTube videos or something. This cycle repeats until it's too late and I have to go to bed.

You're probably thinking that I lack the motivation to even get a degree in the first place and that might be true, but at this point I want to do a decent job on the exam not even to get into a university, but to prove to myself that I can actually be productive. You see, I'm not passionate at all about university and maybe pursuing something that I'm actually sort of passionate about that doesn't   
quite require a degree(writing, becoming a youtuber) would've been wiser if I can't even study for an exam, but I'm afraid that I can't become a writer or a youtuber while being such a lazy person. FFS, I wanted to become a writer for almost a year now and I still haven't written the first page of my fantasy book. I'm afraid that I can't do anything productive, and if I can't even study for an exam, then how am I going to write a book or start a YouTube channel?

And so, after a mental breakdown, I decided that if I were to keep being unproductive and subsequently fail the exam because of that, I would kill myself. It was an impulsive decision, and I tend to ignore such stuff later most of the time, but I don't think I'm going to be able to ignore this decision so easily. It seems silly to kill yourself over education, but I think this is a problem of self-actualization rather than just education, since I basically stand to inherit my father's passive income(he's a landlord among some other stuff, basically he made sure he wouldn't be dependent on the meager pension that the government pays him) and I won't have to worry about income that much unless I royally screw up, which means that I can basically continue to be a jobless, uneducated parasite on society who only plays video games and doesn't contribute to anything. Would've been a dream way of life for some, but what's the problem about this other than maybe an ethical one?

The problem is that I *do* want to become a writer and *do* want to become a Youtuber, but can't even get myself to study for an exam and haven't written anything yet, let alone recorded a video. My original plan was to force myself to study and somehow magically fix my laziness by doing that and start on writing after the exam, but you can see how that plan worked out. If I can't even study, then how can I write a successful novel or make a decent video? To me, the point of living is not living, but actually accomplishing something and how can I do that when I can't bring myself to do anything other than playing video games, browsing memes on Reddit and watching educational videos on YouTube, reflecting on how very smart I must be getting by watching them.

So what do I do about it? I haven't been to any therapists nor taken any medication. If this continues, I might actually commit suicide to save myself from the shame and stress of failing an exam a second time because I've had enough of stress-induced mental breakdowns and stress is only going to get stronger if I fail again.",05Mar2020,1

189,"The smallest things make me so angry and I feel so justified in my annoyance that it’s impossible for me to let things go. for example today I was in the car with my mom listening to kid cudi’s Day n Nite and my mom says to me “I hope you don’t relate to this” and that one comment has ruined my day. It made me so mad cause first of all obviously I fucking relate to it or else I wouldnt be listening to it, and beyond that when I first started listening to kid cudi what I loved about him was that I related to it so much. So for her to say such a stupid and unnecessary comment like that it implies that my feelings are wrong or bad and I shouldnt relate to something I do relate to, it makes me very angry. Little comments like this happen in every single conversation I have cause someone says something small and meaningless but to me I find it so insulting. I cant help but either say something rude as fuck or just glare in silence at them. then afterwards I hate myself so much for it and get so depressed cause obviously the people I talk to aren’t intending to offend me, to them it’s just a regular conversation and suddenly I’m pissed at them. so it’s completely unfair for me to treat other people this way with no explanation but im too mad to let things go or explain why it bothers me. plus so many things set me off that it would be impossible for someone to talk to me successfully.

190,"I don't think there's anything in this world for me.

I've been feeling suicidal on and off since I was five years old. I'm 20 right now. 

The emotions I feel the most are anger, fear, and apathy. My head feels like it's about to explode and I am so sick of being alive. 

I went to a crisis center a few days ago and left after 18 hours. I hate places like that. The only times I don't feel anxious are when I'm very drunk or when I'm alone. I hardly ever leave my room after my roommate gets home from work. Places like the hospital make me feel like I'm losing my mind even more. 

I feel like I'm a narcissist and abusive to the people around me. They all tell me this isn't true. I hate talking about anything related to myself because immediately after I feel like I've said too much and have confirmed my narcissism. 

I think it's very likely I have DID/dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder) or if that's not what I have then I'm probably just psychotic.

I can't sleep, I've been losing weight and I can't bring myself to care enough to try to eat more. It doesn't matter anyways because I dont have enough money to feed myself enough. I don't have enough money for therapy either. I get SSI and food stamps and that's my only source of income. 

My bf smokes and drinks all the time and my roommate is a borderline alcoholic. I don't think this living situation is helping me, but I have no where else to go. And I care about them, I don't want to leave them. 

Everyone tells me I should keep trying and get help. The kind of help I need costs money that I don't have. I already have a lot of debt. 

At this point I feel that it won't be much longer before I end up dead. I'm tired of pretending like everything is and will be fine. It's not ever going to be good for me. My brain is fried and I don't want to continue with this sad pathetic life.",05Mar2020,1

I barely ever listen to music because they always end up on repeat in my mind and it interferes with my thought process. I have a really hard time getting out of these cycles. Had an exam today and it was hard to study and recall the material during the exam. Not ideal. 

I really enjoyed this babysitter's care and so theres a of associated emotion and memories that I havent remembered in years. 

I'm overwhelmed by it all and have a tendency towards earworms. Sometimes I think my headphones also pick up the radio frequencies and will just play music without being plugged into anything. This happened a lot when I was a kid and was SO overwhelming. It doesnt really make senese that headphones would play music when not plugged in!!

I am very self-controlled and I have confidence that I wouldn't commit suicide but does this constitute a suicidal thought. 

As a matter of fact I have decent education, good family and earn sufficient to keep my family happy. However, there are a few bad decisions in my life that haunt me and I find it hard to undo them. Like moving to a different country leaving my aging parents alone, who were okay when I left but they have health issues. I believe staying with them would give them a sense of confidence that they aren't alone but moving back to another country would disrupt my family here. Similarly a few other things at work make me feel helplessness and would result in thoughts of being better off dying.

To summarize, I’m addict to attention and want constantly. Of course I’m aware of it and do my very best to hide it from everyone. So when I get super jealous or angry from not getting enough attention I never show it.

I’ve have a period where I was cutting myself to get attention, plus I kinda think of that every day so I think I liked it at the same time. But never mind, when adult start to make a fuzz after noticing my cuts, I stop doing it because it was just bringing me too much problem. 
When my best friend saw it tho she just asked me why I was doing it and she didn’t do anything else. Like, she would just stare at It but didn’t do anything or tried to convince me to stop. It made me very angry and frustrated by I didn’t say anything. 
Today she came up to me to ask advice about a friend of hers who cuts herself and she wanted to help her. I talked to her for a bit about her situation and tell her to convince her to go to therapy for a starter, since she seemed she needed to just let her feelings out.
But when I saw my best friend concerned about her, it made me very jealous. And I also just have this feeling of not mattering. I didn’t let any of this being shown of course. For the rest of the day I was feeling like going insane tho. I wanted to scream and cut myself again. But like until bleeding to death. I have this thing of imagining me dying, but i only was doing it before sleeping because for some reason it make me feel great. For the first time I really thought of doing it for real once I could get something sharp.

I don’t wanna go to school tomorrow. I just feel worse and worse. I tried to call people that seemed cheerful to up my mood but it didn’t worked. I’m also afraid to talk about it to a friend I love very much. I just want to be alone for an entire day doing nothing. I feel like I’m going to be insane if I go to school tomorrow. Especially if I see my best friend, I don’t know if I’ll be able to crack jocks like I’m use to.",05Mar2020,1

201," Like many others I've had some uncomfortable experiences liked being groped on public transit by strangers. However, these aren't the situations that are keeping me up at night and I'm realizing that it's because there was no grey area - it was crystal clear they were in the wrong and knew better.

I have two other instances that I have struggled with because I was on dates with those men and consented to parts of what happened, but I know my anxiety can prevent me from speaking up when I need to. The first being a guy where I had no intention of staying at his place that night, as it was just a second date, but the friend I was meant to stay with that night got sick. I didn't mind that much as he treated me well in the time we had spent together and while kissing that night he mentioned he didn't have protection so we both agreed to stop it there. At that point I felt good about things because he'd done the right thing in bringing it up and being honest and he was respectful of the fact that I wasn't ever going to do anything without protection. Cut to what feels like an hour into me being asleep and he's feeling me up kissing my neck - it didn't really wake me up until I felt him pull down my underwear at which point I ask what he's doing. He said he thought we were gonna have sex and I reiterated I'm not doing anything without a condom and that I was sleeping - he said sorry for waking me up, to just go back to sleep but in a way that made me feel like I was at fault. My dumb thought process was similar in the next situation I explain, he'd been the one to bring up on the first date how he wanted something serious and it was important to him I wanted the same so I suppose in a way I justified it as a mix up because he was otherwise nice and said he didn't just want something casual. Of course I found out that was a blatant lie and I ended things a couple days later and never saw him again after that 2nd date. I've thought about that night since and I know it was messed up but only recently am I realizing that I'd justified this guy basically trying to rape me thinking I'd be too tired to object to sex without a condom. In the moment I let him make me feel like I'd done something wrong. I guess I'm just disappointed in myself for thinking that way and letting it slide just because he wasn't successful.

The second situation is the one that seems to be eating at me the most and was just last summer - I never fully processed it, I cried the day after it happened then had a trip to keep my mind off it, then moved on. I prided myself on being able to get over it so quickly and yes, I got over him quickly but I haven't got over how he treated me. It was another situation where he'd seemed serious about things as we'd talked for a while before even going on our first date so I felt like I could justify what happened if we'd end up together long term. We'd gone to lunch and had plans to watch a specific show at his place - I knew the likelihood of hooking up was high and I was okay with that although I wasn't expecting him to jump right into it the second I sat down to watch tv. I had recently started taking anxiety medication that really dehydrates the body initially so I made it clear to him that if we were going to do anything it had be slow and careful or it would either not be possible or just be pain on my end. He told me he would go slow and then followed the roughest anyone's ever been with me physically. By the time I'd registered what was happening it was too late, I had been turned face down and I was being held down by my neck unable to properly breathe so I couldn't tell him I wanted it to stop and that I was in pain. I was basically just stuck there upset and waiting for it to be over. Once again I feel disappointed in myself for freezing when he started hurting me, I had a small window to speak up and say that I didn't consent to this - we'd agreed on the exact opposite of what was happening - but I just couldn't unfreeze and spit it out. It became clear while being choked and suffocated that I meant absolutely nothing to this guy, he didn't care about how I felt physically or emotionally, I was just an object for him to get off. He'd told me he could definitely see a future with me and then turned into a completely different person who was emotionless and cold the second we parted ways after that date. I could no longer have a justification to make myself feel okay about what had happened, not like us being in a long term relationship would've made it okay either, but that was the icing on the cake that made me feel disgusted and degraded. To make things worse, I had a pap smear days after and had to explain why there was so much tearing and bruising - then got a yeast infection as a result.

It just keeps playing in my mind over and over and it makes me feel like I want to scrub the skin off my body. It kills me that I didn't speak up in time before being put in a position where I couldn't at all. I also hate that it's taken so long for me to care about myself enough to only feel this angry now and not back then right when it happened.",05Mar2020,1

He said that he has homicidal impulses and a tendency to hurt animals. He also said that he's a compulsive liar. This really surprised me, but he also said that he was ""testing"" me after he revealed a lie that he had during the conversation. I really don't know how to react to this news. He's still my best friend and he's still the same person I knew before this happened. I think I just need some help with this.",05Mar2020,1
210,"I feel fine most the time then sometimes something can easily knock my confidence. It usually doesn’t get to me for long though. Other times out of nowhere I can just feel like being all negative about myself. It sort of feels good when I have these rants. I am usually quite jokey, chatty and sociable though. Some people I don’t reveal that side to me and tbh it rarely ever happens especially this last year or 2. I am feeling a bit low tonight and it’s like I know I should keep up appearances but my take is it’s only online and who gives a fuck",05Mar2020,1

So I started reading more about dissociative identity problems so I had a question that someone here might help answer this -

I've heard of people who hurt/abuse others, you hear them say something like ""how'd you'd get that (enter mark here"" like they genuinely dont remember that they physically hurt you go cause said mark, even though it literally happened within 24 hours of said remark.

Some stories I've read they say things like ""it was an impulse one moment I was fine and then the next I've seen I've hurt someone""

So my question is this:
Is this a type of dissociative amnesia? What exactly is the psychology behind this (severe anger management problems, PTSD/cptsd, a type of dissociation, all of the above or something else all together?)",05Mar2020,1
