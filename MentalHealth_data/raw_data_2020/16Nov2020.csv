0,so recently I've been digging my nails into my skin a lot. like a lot. to the point where it leaves a mark and hurts for days after. I wanted to know if this is self-harm or just a nervous habit?,16Nov2020,3
1,"TW: mentions of self harm

I dont know what's wrong with me. Like for weeks on end I feel soooo shit, like I cant do anything. No motivation, nothing. I feel suicidal, I self harm and I impulsively delete pictures, social media accounts and write suicide notes and plan my suicide and get ready to end it. But then for like 3 days I for some reason start doing stuff. I dunno, it's not much but doing normal everyday things that I didnt do before. It's not like I felt happy, more like I had energy but didnt get the happiness with it but I looked happy, if u get what i mean? But that lasts for a couple of days and then like now, I'm back to wanting to die, hating myself, wanting to cut myself and not do anything. My brain makes me think there's nothing I can do to get control of my life again I feel like I'm in a spiral and keep going back and forwards. I dont know how to ask for help because I dont know what to say or start with.",16Nov2020,2

6,"Hey all, 
This is my first post ever on reddit, so hopefully I'm doing it right lol. It'll be long, so bear with me!

Anyway,
I need your help!
I (22/ F) have really been struggling with my mental health lately. I'm sure part of it is covid, part of it is that I just graduated college, &amp; I wasn't really sure what my next steps were for a while. I'm usually a really put together, on top of it, type A personality. I like to get my shit done. Lately, I've just been unmotivated. And that's only part of it. 

Over the summer, I was put on anxiety meds. I asked my GP to put me on them, and she gave me some. I had some really bad side effects (suicidal thoughts were way worse than ever...they weren't really an issue before meds..., and I had physical effects like teeth grinding). So, I weaned myself off over the span of about a week. I've been off them for over a month now. 

Lately, I've just had a hard time being emotionally present for anyone. Any time friends come to me for advice or want to hang out or anything, I basically shut down. My mom thinks I have depression. I basically just can't handle anything, especially not in large quantities. It's hard for me to want to hang out or even text/ call with friends sometimes. I just feel lazy. 

Plus, I got into a relationship back in May. He's a great guy, &amp; I love him a lot. He's not always the most emotional guy out there, so I always feel like I'm being annoying or just complaining when I come to him with all my problems. Plus, I can't expect him or anyone else to fix them. Only I can make that change. He does try and offer solutions, but it frustrates him that I'm not as happy or doing well mentally as either of us wants me to be. It frustrates him that he can't fix it.

Overall, my mental health is crap. My self esteem is pretty low, my anxiety high, I've been feeling depressed, and I'm just kinda unmotivated. Some days are good, but I haven't found a way to make a lasting change. 
I scheduled an appointment to go back to the counselor &amp; maybe get back on meds, but I can't get in until December. 
I'm just so frustrated not knowing what to do. I don't want to overwhelm myself trying to fix everything at once, but I need something to start from. Small changes that I can work on daily. December feels so far away &amp; I really want to make a change! I'm tired of feeling annoying/ like a burden, and I want to help make myself feel better. Every time I try and Google solutions, all I get is the suicide hotline, and I'm trying to look for tips to incorporate into my life so that I can get back to a healthy mental state &amp; be present for myself and others.
If you have any tips, please share em!

Thanks for listening!

7,"That’s basically the problem, I haven’t received a single text in the whole week. The only ones I receive are messages asking for homeworks and  stuff from school.

I need more friends because I’m alone and sad as fuck. I just want to be like all of this guys who hang out and go to parties, I don’t want my fucking life.",16Nov2020,15
8,"Ahh why do I feel so alone. I hate feeling like this. I want to cry but I can't. God I hate this.

I can't tell my friends or anything because I feel like I'm being a burden on them.",16Nov2020,1
9,"I used to be fond of food, don't get me wrong, I would never turn down on fast food. But I feel like I can't enjoy food the same way as before. I could look forward towards breakfast, but lately I can't barely put anything in my belly. I eat eggs very infrequently, and if I am lazy, I eat a sandwich, or simply down a tea until my mother makes food when she's back from work. I'm 24M, by the way. It's also that I don't feel like the taste is pleasant anymore, whenever I used to eat something I enjoy, I would be in a better mood. It feels more like a substance that I just fill my body with. I am not looking forward to most of the food we have in the refrigerator, or the freezer. It's simply ”that substance which is needed to fill my belly.” This doesn’t work, and food simply isn’t delicious anymore to me.  
I don’t feel like wanting to eat anymore if I can’t enjoy it. I’m just filling up my body just to survive.

These 2 past days has been great, my depression oscillates between good mood and bad mood throughout the day, but some days can be completely great, and some can be completely bad the whole day. I can definitely feel an impact from stress and burden, though. It's enough that I feel insignificant already, without a job, education, etc., just today my mother asked me if I have money, told me she would transfer money, and so I was feeling like a burden again to her. I have a father too, so thankfully my load of burden is not only on her. I can't work, simply because I don't do well socially, all my past coworkers have been pricks towards me because I didn't socialize with them, I have felt alienated in my past jobs too much, I can't go back there and risk making my depression even worse, being told that I am not good enough again. It's similar with my studies, constant F's on community college.

Anyway, you can see that my problems are multifold, I don't take any antidepressants, I don't think I can manage to be on them and being caused more sadness and pain when they don't work. I am tired of failing.",16Nov2020,2
10,"1. I don’t seem to care about anyone other than myself. When people are upset or talk to me about their life I simply have no interest 
eg my friend told me they were suicidal and I (internally) shrugged it off and told them “not to do it yet because they won’t be remembered for anything just wait till you do something crazy then go for it”
2. Social anxiety? I am extremely uncomfortable in social situations 
Eg struggle to make eye contact, feel like everyone is watching/laughing/talking about me, I falter at small talk, hate social events like parties and I overthink every small thing I do Infront of people 
3. I need to be told exactly what is going to happen when I’m doing something new 
eg the other day I went to an art gallery and I needed to be told exactly where the entrance was, how to approach reception, what to ask for and when to present my ticket etc etc otherwise I get scared
4. I hate conversation in general, I love to just sit and listen/ zone out in my own head space 
5. I have to pretend I love my friends and family and I feel disgusted expressing it because i view it as “fake and gross”
Eg I’ve never hugged my mum (Don’t get me wrong I appreciate that she has given me a house and has fed me, but affection is not my area) 
6. I get very very uncomfortable when someone expresses love towards me 
eg my friend asked me if “I was ok and they were worried about me” and I physically felt sick
7. I hate physical touching 
8. My dad committed suicide when I was 11. I was closer to him than I was to my mum yet I didn’t feel sad or cry when I heard the news. I accepted it and moved on almost instantly. 
9. I do feel emotion, I feel happiness, sadness, irritation, anger, stress etc etc 
10. I have self harmed in the past, not because I was numb or overwhelmed but because I was curious and it eventually just turned into habit 
11. I think I’m asexual, I have practically no desire to have sex and the thought of touching someone’s genitals makes me feel a bit nauseous

I will not take any replies as a diagnosis obviously since the internet isn’t the most reliable place, but it would really help if I could get some ideas and if I should see a doctor (in the future when I can)",16Nov2020,1
11,"I don’t know if I can do this much longer

I am a 15 year old male. Quite frankly I don’t know how long this will go on. My parents are always heavily fighting. Since the day they have been married, they’ve had a shitty relationship. It’s worth mentioning they had an arranged marriage. Over the last 15 years, their relationship has only gotten worse. I should mention I have a 13 year old brother, who is on the autism spectrum. My dad was risen in an abusive household as well. My mother grew up with depression, as her mother passed from cancer and her father lost his business. 8 years ago, my dad got involved in a legal battle with his sister over property. It has had a huge impact on his life, draining him to this day. It has gotten to the point where he talks about his death constantly, even joking saying he won’t live much longer. They’ve fought for as long as I can remember, with a couple times standing out. 6 years back, my parents fought and there was verbal abuse, and it even got physical. In the end, my dad threatened to commit suicide by pills, and I had to call a friend of his to mediate. To see my younger brother crying while I stood there has traumatized me to this day. Since then they have had many more fights, till today. Then, we moved to the United States, where our family is completely alienated. We do not have many family friends, as compared to before. Recently, my dad has been suffering from increased stress which seems to have led to him having major depression. Today seemed to be the final straw. My mom made a comment which sent my dad off on a rant. He talked about how his life has been ruined by other people. He talked about how he spent the majority of his life in stress, working and working to get us here. Eventually, he started crying hysterically, saying he just wants to live to see his sons successful, after which he will willing fully kill himself. I really do feel sorry for my father, he has suffered a lot. I believe he just wants peace for once in his life. I also feel for my mother, who has lived her entire life as a housewife. It pains me when they fight, and it hurts me more to see my brother in this environment. I really don’t know what to do anymore. Sometimes I just want to go to sleep and not wake up in this mess. I can’t help but think of what will happen to my brother, and wonder who will support him if I pass.",16Nov2020,2
14,"I can't fucking breath in my own home. every single time I do the smallest thing I get hell from my parents. for instance today I god chicken wings for dinner and was sitting trying to eat. then my spaz of a dog decides to jump and eat it. of corse it is all my fault and I am going to kill the dog. I say i'm sorry but nothing Is ever enough. so then I stop eating and try to leave and my mom yells at me and says I always ""run away from my problems."" It is so degrading to live with them. my therapist thinks that I should just apologize to them every time. but, when I know i'm right its just building up my anger. this is just a small example unfortunately, these small things happen everyday. sometimes I'm just so tired from school and everything else in life that whenever they yell at me I just cry. so my entire life I've been called a cry baby. but in reality my dads just drunk and when he starts to insult me it hurts. his memories of everything in life are so different cause he's never in a clear mind. to add to it my mom is his bitch and refuses to see something wrong with him. my mom would be such a good single parent if she would just leave him. but instead he yells at us everyday and I often find myself in the hospital or in the never ending cycle of drug abuse. but I also justify my drug abuse because my doctor has been giving me a different prescription sense 3rd grade.",16Nov2020,4

17," 

I just want to disclaim that I don't have an eating disorder.

So I am 14 years old and I have never been overweight in my life, but I have been borderline overweight a lot of my life. I've always been at the end of the healthy weight range. Because of this my parents have both insulted me, commented on my weight, fought with me about weight, humiliated me, etc. At least 3 sort of jokes or comments have been made out of it since I was in 3rd grade. You might think this probably lowered my self-esteem, but it honestly didn't. If anything it made me more confident. I would hate them so much for this that it made me feel better about myself. Like I knew that what they would do is abusive and wrong and because of it I would tell myself, ""You're more than perfect just the way you""

Over the years every time I eat it has become something I have to think about way too many times. I avoid eating in front of my dad except dinner, which I have to, I eat light portions at dinner, or sometimes I'll eat a lot just to piss them off, or sometimes I will purposefully eat a lot of food like after having a meal just to piss off my parents. It's become such a convoluted thing and I have to think about everything before I eat. Whenever my parents aren't home I make myself eat junk food even if I don't necessarily want that food. Cause in my head I think well this is my chance to eat whatever I want and I can't waste this chance. If I don't eat junk food I think it's this terrible opportunity I missed and I get mad at myself. They make me so nervous and everything I eat. Especially in quarantine.

It becomes the most stressful thing and I have to decide if I'm trying to make them mad or just comply and it just it's all confusing and stressful. I feel really guilty when I don't eat junk food but I feel guilty when I do. Another thing I do is I always make sure I have all 3 meals, and you might think well that's a good thing, right. But a lot of the times I won't even be hungry for lunch but I force myself so my parents don't think I'm skipping a meal and trying to loose weight. In my mind my parents seeing me trying to loose weight would be the worst thing in the world, or seeing me willingly eat healthy foods. I'm sorry I'm being so confusing and inconsistent in this explanation but that's really how my diet is- confusing and inconsistent. Sometimes when I crave healthy foods I make sure to eat it when my parents aren't home. When my friends, family, and people online are talking about how much they ate in a day or the meals they skip I feel so guilty. On weekdays my parents don't get back home until lunch time and I either eat tons of junk food or I skip breakfast and contemplate skipping lunch out of guilt. I never do end up skipping lunch cause I realize than I'm letting my parents win.

But since quarantine I HAVE gained weight I'm at the very end of the healthy weight range scale and I feel so shitty because a lot of what my parents say is now well right. I just feel so shitty about myself and kinda wanna loose weight but I'll never admit to it, while living here. I just feel like one day I'll wake up and starve myself",16Nov2020,1
18,I have been recently overthinking on stuff that has been putting myself down like my future like if stuff turns out bad or lets say i overthink about what someone thinks about me.

  I’ve never been allowed to meet people in my age group outside of school. It’s always been go to school and then come home, with the additional grocery store trip and eating out on the weekends. No parties, sleepovers, meetups, or even just to stop in the store to say hello.

  I have a sibling, and they also suffer socially because we’re closed off from everyone else. I get the impression my parents plain out don’t like us being with other kids. My mom insults my friends to me a lot, has cancelled plans to go to school-related events, and got on me and my sibling’s case for playing with my cousins outside.

  Is this... normal? Am I gonna be messed up for life because of this on top of some other stuff??

  I think I’m already messed up... I get very hot and cold with relationships irl. Very nice and happy one moment and then I’m cold and hating them suddenly, or completely vacant, and don’t feel anything towards them. Online, I tend to obsess over making one person, (I call it, targetperson) usually conflicted, hurt people happy.

23,"Hi All,

My husband and I both suffer from depression and anxiety - I’m currently managing mine fairly well with 450 mg of Bupropion daily, and he has been working on finding his most effective combination for the past year or so, and it’s been challenging and upsetting for him, and me as I feel frustrated that I can’t help him.

Something that has always impacted him has been the “Sunday Blues,” where he starts to get very stressed and nervous about Monday, and it causes him to have heightened anxiety during some portion of the day on Sunday. As the years have passed, and things have gotten a bit more stressful for us (we have a toddler, serious financial challenges, living in a one bedroom but preparing to move some point this upcoming year) it seems that this has been getting worse. His entire Sunday seems to be derailed - wakes up frustrated, quiet/mopey/snippy most of the day, and develops into tears and frustration by the evening that the entire day went by. This happens nearly every Sunday, and it comments on the fact that he feels no desire to try anything new or do something proactive in any way in order to combat this.

I’m at a loss for what to do. I’m so upset for him, because I hate seeing what this does to him, and the fact that we cannot seem to find a winning medication combination to help him regain some energy and motivation. It’s also taking a toll on our family, as Sundays typically feel tense and somber, and I start to deal with creeping guilt that I’m not doing more for my toddler by planning outings on Sundays or something. I’m still dealing with serious depression myself, and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t feeling some amount of frustration or resentment that it feels like any opportunity for family time comes to a screeching halt every Sunday. 

He’s been on bupropion for the past few months and it’s helping a bit, and in the past month he started taking vyvanse for newly diagnosed adult ADHD (really positive step forward for him) but he went off the vyvanse because of severe headaches. Now he’s going to try some short acting Adderall, as prescribed by his physician.

If you have any thoughts, feedback, guidance, advice, resources that you’d care to share, I’d be so grateful. How do you get yourself to a place where you can try to take control of your day? Is there a way to reframe your thoughts or your approach so Sundays don’t feel so terrible? We are without a doubt currently in the most stressful part of our lives and our relationship that we’ve ever experienced (my mom died in January and it’s basically ruined me, we don’t have family nearby and we’re on a strict budget so there isn’t much option for babysitting), I remind myself to cut us both some slack until we get through this year of hell. I just feel powerless to help him, and it’s taking a toll on me and I don’t know what to do.

Thanks for any input!",16Nov2020,1
25,"So I (19W) have dealt with trauma, anxiety, depression, ED, all that “fun” stuff. And I’m much better than before, I can see that but there are three very very strong and annoying parts of me that I just don’t know how to improve. 

If you know how to improve it, or if you know the psychology behind it so I can understand better it would be highly appreciated ❤️

So 1, I am a very, very nervous person, part of me is afraid of absolutely everything even things I know and have done in the past, they make me so nervous that I get panic attacks and I can even shit myself out of panic. I have gone to psychologists but they always go around my trauma and then send me away but the nervousness has never left.

2. I have a hero complex, or however you would call it. I always tend to look out for others, be the mom of the group, be a healer all of that, but it drains me, a lot, and I help people that I barely know ignoring my own needs cause I can’t reject people in need. Idk why

3. I have major, major trust issues in relationships. I am a very sweet person, funny and chill, but whenever I like someone or they like me I get this mean bitchy attitude that lifts a wall, and I stop liking them after the minimum mistake and I just walk away. 

It’s good to have high standards but I am afraid that I’m doing a weird mix of holding the wrong people in my life, kicking people out to quickly out of fear and being scared of things that aren’t happening.

I'm a 27 y/o male that lives in the western world with ""free"" healthcare. I've been struggling with severe anxiety and depression for the last couple of years. I've been trying to cope with living just by getting through one day at the time, but for years on end at this point. I have in the past, when desperately needing professional help, been using and abusing pain killers and other sedating drugs, just to get through the day. I never touch alcohol, as it severely impacts my mental health immediately after consumed, and after that for weeks, worsening and deepening my depression while spiking my anxiety. Recently i got myself into a bad habit with benzodiazepines, as regular doctors are unsure of what to do with me. The reason for this is that i have a heart condition that makes all modern anti anxiety medication a hassle for me to use, since i keep getting severe palpations when used, thus worsening my anxiety and stressing me out. I've used thousands of dollars on private clinic doctors, but they all remain in the standard area when it comes to medicine.

The point of my post would be, is there anyone out there, or someone that knows one, that has been in a similar position as i am in right now? Because i need some advice / guidance as to where i go from here. I'm open to find/try unusal medicines/ herbs that can give me some mental relief so i can function better, and make my life a little better.

Probably about 18 years or so ago, when I was about 5 I had gone into my bother's room for some reason I don't remember and he was watching  a horror movie. I believe it was called Terror Toons and I happened to walk in on a highly disturbing scene. I prefer not to go into detail, but the scene pictured a girl getting her spine ripped out by the villains of the movie, and still to this day, that scene has caused severe anxiety (and possible trauma???) Any time the memory of the movie surfaces in my mind, it often keeps me up at night and I have trouble sleeping. As I have for many years now. And even though I know realistically it's probably not going to happen,  I just keep imagining some monster is going to come into my room at night and do the same to me.  And I get a lot of anxiety at night if I accidentally roll onto my stomach.  


So basically, I want to know... is it possible that this movie could have caused some trauma and is there any way I can recover from this so that it won't plague me for the rest of my life? I already go to therapy for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Depression but my next appointment is about a week or more away. And is this something I should bring my up to my therapist.

NHS mental health services are pretty much useless. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety four ish years ago. In that time I have seen I don't know how many mental health professionals. None have actually done anything to help me in any way.

First there was the CBT student therapist. She did her best, but she wasn't equipped to actually help. I got significantly worse. Second was the actually qualified CBT therapist. I tried CBT. I got significantly worse. I'm not willing to try again. It doesn't help that I also have dyspraxia, so the standard treatment i was given isn't fit for purpose. 

Then comes the joy of being referred to and from different services. IAPT have said my depression is treatment resistant because I've been on 4 SSRIs that have all made me very ill. Secondary services have said I'm not actually suicidal so they won't see me. I've also had a service flat out ignore the request I put in my referral form to please email me. I have hearing loss and anxiety around phone calls. I got discharged because they'd been trying to call me, and I didn't answer, like I said I wouldn't because I can't hear a phone call. 

I've also had a social worker telling me that I'm being melodramatic and too demanding because I want a therapy that actually helps. She's a bitch. Apparently I should just make do with the nothing I'm getting.

I did get some very good psychodynamic psychotherapy from a charity. It helped enormously and I got a lot better. Then the money ran out and I'm back to where I was.

I know my experience is not unique. I know people who've had worse experiences than me. I know friends who've died because the crisis team is 9-5, Monday to Friday.

Basically, the service is shit and it wants scrapping and rebuilding from scratch. In my area, there's lots of brief CBT if you have mild, brief depression or anxiety. If you're more complicated, it's fuck off and come back when you're actually trying to kill yourself. It sucks and it's cost people's lives. Plus they're all using the C word as an excuse to reduce services and shove people onto phone appointments, regardless of whether they're suitable.",16Nov2020,13

36,"Today my tattoo artist messaged me to reschedule an appointment and to my surprise she was able to schedule it a lot earlier. This was great, since I've been trying to get this tattoo done since August.

Took this news to my parent, elated, hoping I would at least get a ""that's great!"". Instead I got no response, she just stared back with a straight face and said nothing while I kept trying to get a positive response from her.

In an instant I was drained of whatever positivity I had and went back to locking myself in my room. I cried and wondered why it's so hard for someone to be happy for me at least once.

I'm so tired of not having anyone to share good news with. Rarely any good ever happens to me and when it does and I want to share my excitement and happiness, I'm beaten down. I'm tired.",16Nov2020,2

I'm on my 5th therapist I believe and with the past four, I was too much and eventually refused to see anyone. With this one I feel that although she's helpful, our work doesn't reach me at my core. I've been told that talking to your therapist about what you need from them helps and needing a different therapist is not an issue, and I believe that. It's so strange that I had a certain set of words to get this point across a moment ago but I'm explaining as best as I can.

But crying is a big part of letting my own emotions out and feeling better, so this “block” is counterintuitive. Did something happen to me?

45,"I have been struggling with mental health for the past 2 years. I am 16 and in the 11th grade. I ended up trying meds near the end of 10th grade after being diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I tried lexapro first and after experiencing suicidal thoughts for the first time while on them, I decided to swap to zoloft which didn’t help. I ended up attempting suicide after being on those meds for a few weeks and going through a really devastating breakup since my boyfriend couldn’t handle my mental health issues. I went to inpatient and came out feeling better, on Prozac this time. I quit prozac after the suicidal thoughts came back and haven’t been on meds since. Me and my boyfriend decided to get back to better afterwards as we both realized that we felt better together and knew we didn’t truly want to breakup at the time. I felt numb on antidepressants and lost who I was. I am a musician who bases all of my music off of my extreme emotions. It went away after the summer of 10th grade and I felt good, but now I’m here again, in this pit. I am back to struggling and I’ve lost all motivation for even the things I love. I don’t want to go back on meds because I hate how they make me feel and I wasn’t suicidal before them. I am still suicidal without them now but it’s worse with them. I recently had a falling out with my mom who lives in another state, and I’ve been struggling in my relationship again because I am constantly sad. I can’t open up to my therapist who I’ve had since I went to inpatient. I feel so stuck and lost, I used to self harm after inpatient (I hadn’t self harmed before that) and now I want to even more but can’t. If I try I just end up breaking down because i feel like I’ll just get in trouble for it. I’m immensely scared and just really struggling right now. I have no intentions of suicide but my mind starts to plan it subconsciously. I feel like such a burden to my boyfriend and family, I was supposed to be the promise child for my dad since my brother ended up as a deadbeat. I just want to feel better but at the same time I don’t. I like the safety and warmth of this depression yet it consists of missing classes and crying in bed. I have always been an honor student with a 3.8-3.9 gpa out of a 4.0 but lately I’ve been struggling to maintain anything above an 85 because I’m missing so much class work from laying in bed crying all day. I really miss my mom even though she said such horrible things to me, and I miss who I was in the 7th grade. I don’t know what to do.",16Nov2020,1
46,"It’s the early hours of the morning and I have an exam tomorrow and I have a tendency to shy away from my things relating to my emotions so if I don’t return to this post or you find it deleted at a later date forgive me I appreciate anyone who responds but I need to get this off my chest

A friend recently sent me (18m) a post with a list of symptoms of anxiety that I have never heard of before, pretty much all of which struck a chord with me;
•unpredictable bouts of rage or irritability
•’nit-pickiness”/hypersensitivity to disarray, change, etc. 
•fast talking, stuttering, stumbling over words
•not talking at all
•seeming ‘zoned out’ - staring into space

I’ve been to cbt before but I’m not sure I was as open as I should’ve been. I also didn’t go off of the back of a diagnosis so I’m not sure if I have any problems. 

I suppose I should say that for a long time I’ve felt like there’s some sort of issue. I’ve always struggled in social scenarios and had low self esteem. Despite having a lot of friends I have always felt like something of an outsider. Since my last relationship ended badly any sort of affection, platonic or otherwise, makes me quite uncomfortable. My mum has always called me a ‘worrier’ from a young age and my friends tend to point out that I worry a lot about minor things and overthink. 

Recently I think I had an anxiety attack. I’m not exactly sure because I’ve heard they’re all different but I’ll describe it as best I can. 
It was around 11pm and I think I had some work due for the next day (self-isolating due to covid so all online) this is as well as exams coming up so I was pretty stressed. I think I was looking over what I had to do or something, I’m not sure if there was a specific trigger, but I got this massive sense of just fear of just pretty much everything. I’m not sure how else to describe it. I wasn’t struggling to breathe in the way that I felt like I was suffocating, but it felt like I couldn’t get enough air in, yet I was never worried that I would actually not be able to get enough air in, if that makes sense. I also felt the urge to move and do something. While it didn’t seem to help much, it did seem to feel better than sitting doing nothing. So I ended up kind of tapping my foot/shaking my leg. 

I should mention that I do drink and smoke. It’s the norm where I come from from about the age of 14. I don’t smoke a massive amount, maybe 1 or 2 a day. But anyway I went out for a walk at this point (shortly after 11, I’d say) and a cigarette, which usually calms me down, but it didn’t seem to work all that well. It wasn’t definitely better than when I left but I felt drained and the underlying fear still seemed present, just not at the forefront of my mind. 
Honestly I’m not sure what I want from this post, perhaps someone can give me their perspective, or maybe I just want to rant, either way it feels like I needed to get this off my chest. 

P.S. I forgot to mention I have developed something of an obsession with working out. I’m in good shape and I like to look in the mirror and like what I see but it feels like it’s becoming a problem. If I don’t work out it will hang over me all day and I won’t be able to get anything done and I’ll feel like shit. If I retain any sort of fat and my abs are even slightly less visible I start to freak out. Honestly I feel like a narcissistic prick writing this so I hope I don’t come across that way but I feel that’s important to what I’m trying to say. I’ve always been athletic and I’ve always worked out to some degree since I was 11. I was quite big for my age back then and I’ve sort of developed a reputation for being ‘that guy’. It’s become a major part of my identity and I don’t think I could ever leave it behind. I’m not sure I think that’s pretty much everything 

If anyone has any thoughts at all please let me know them I’m not sure where to go from here but this mindless fucking slog through life of just constantly never being able to relax is wearing me down at this point. It’s been going on for years now I suppose and idk what to do.

48," So yesterday I realized that my entire life I've had all sorts of weird habits that are oddly similar to some symptoms of OCD but I'm not sure if it's extreme enough to be considered OCD. Based on the things I listed below, what would you do? For extra context, I have ADHD and anxiety.

* I constantly have to pick at parts of my body. For example, my scalp and hair, my lips, my ears and my earrings, my acne, my eyes, my eyelashes, my nails, my teeth, my skin.. Sometimes I try to rip out the hair on my body, mainly my arms and legs with just my nails. There was a point a few years ago where I would also rip pieces of my skin off on my arms and legs until they were covered in red marks from all the places I had picked at my skin(sometimes I would even bleed). When my hands aren’t busy doing something I often get the urge to pick at a part of my body. Sometimes it’s something that isn’t a body part, like two years ago I realized my science workbook was covered in a thin layer of plastic so I’d spend my classes trying to peel it off and I realized that it was making a lot of noise and people were noticing but I just HAD to keep on doing it. Things like that, but I mostly do it with different parts of my body, especially my scalp and lips. Doing this brings me comfort and satisfaction.
* I get urges to do certain things repeatedly until I’m satisfied. For example I sometimes will be in the middle of doing something and I’ll just need to squeeze my hand or shrug my shoulder or something, and then do it again, and again until my mind decides I’ve done it enough times. Or I could tap my finger against something and sometimes I’d need to do it again a specific number of times.
* I often need to re-read things for no reason or I have to re-write things because it doesn’t look “neat enough” and I’ll just have to erase and rewrite it over and over again until it looks perfect, even though it looked fine from the beginning. At some point in elementary school whenever I’d write in pencil I had to go over it again and again until it was as dark as possible and you could see the trace of it on the other pages under. It was really extreme, to the point where my mom and teacher noticed and would be really disappointed in me since it partly caused me to be \*really\* slow when working so I was always very behind.
* Sometimes I count how many times/how long it takes to do something. For example, counting steps. Or I’ll just give myself a specific amount of time to do things for no reason. For example, I could tell myself “You need to be downstairs in 15 seconds” and that’s all I’d focus on and I’d just run out of my room and down the stairs and if I don’t make it it really bothers me. Another example of a similar thing is when I’m walking to my bus stop, I tend to focus on the size of my steps and make sure the distance between each step is equal.
* Often, when I do something with one side of my body, I need to do it with the other. Like, if I hit my left foot against something I need to do it with my right foot. But it’s more complicated than that; if, when I hit my right foot I did it too hard and it didn’t match the hit my left foot took, then I need to hit my right foot again so this time it matches the impact my left foot had, but I also need to hit my left foot again, as hard as I hit my right foot the first time. Then I’ve hit both of my feet twice, with equal levels of impact, so I’m satisfied.
* Whenever I think of something bad/extreme/embarrassing happening I always specifically have to say the word “nevermind” in my head after to make sure it doesn’t happen. Like, “What if I’m supposed to get my period today but I forgot so I’m not wearing a pad or tampon and everyone will see and I’ll be humiliated and I won’t ever get to show my face in public again? Hmm.. Wait, no. Nevermind.” “I’m going to get coronavirus today. No, nevermind.” “What if I get burned alive? … Nevermind.” It’s weird, I know these things probably won’t actually happen but my brain seems to subconsciously think that whatever I think of will happen in the future, unless I say the word “nevermind.”
* I don’t know if this matters but I’m generally very paranoid. I always think I’m being watched and that somebody is reading my mind.
* I hoard things A LOT. I often want to get rid of things but I’m like, “Nah, I’m sure I’ll need it later.” even if it’s very clearly useless. I tend to uselessly collect things I don’t really need or already have enough of such as flannels, books I know I won’t have time to read, old photos on my phone, crystals/rocks... And on the weirder side of things, I once kept a whole ass tower of used empty tissue boxes in my room I didn’t want to get rid of. Another time when I was younger I collected those little things on the top of soft drink cans that are used to open them. I have a strange obsession with collecting things; in a weird way it makes me feel more organized?
* I often need to touch or feel things. For example, I’ve stopped doing this since I’m being really careful not to catch unnecessary germs cause of covid, but whenever I’d walk into a store I just had to touch, pick up or sometimes just feel everything that I saw and looked remotely interesting to me.
* I’ve been doing all of the things I mentioned above for as long as I can remember, since I was little. And yeah, I sort of realized that repeated twitching and obsessively picking dandruff out of your scalp until you feel pain whenever you gently tug your hair was kind of weirdo behaviour, but other than that I pretty much thought I was acting normal until like two hours ago?

52,"I’ve been looking around for an answer as to why I barely remember anything from my childhood. But, all I find are things relating to trauma and repressed memories. While I would say I grew up in a stressful environment (brother is non-verbally autistic) and I was verbally teased in elementary school I wouldn’t call any of it traumatic or anything.

For more context, I was diagnosed with AD(H)D at some time when I was around 6-to-10 yo. I did take medication then (don’t remember what) until 6th grade when I was taken out of public school to be homeschooled. I was also tested for autism and was just barely off the spectrum. Despite that, I do have some similarities with my brother (mainly rocking, niche interests, a distaste to being touched, and sound processing issues.) I would say I suffer from symptoms of anxiety and depression but I haven’t seen a professional to confirm if I have the conditions, if they’re side-problems from the ADHD, or if it’s just in my head.

Edit- just now because I forgot to add: I didn’t have any friends when I was younger and mainly played alone. Maybe my childhood was just so boring that I never really made memories?",16Nov2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

**I (20M) have been drifting away from my boyfriend (19) for a few months now**. We’re both college students, and this semester has been very, very rough for me due to school being online. My boyfriend has had a much easier semester and is doing well academically, but I’m not. **It’s caused some mental health issues for me – including depression, burn out, and anxiety – that I haven’t had before** (I’m seeking treatment though, so please, no comments about that: I’ll be fine). We’ve been together for almost two years now, and **he’s very much in love with me** (and I was in love with him).

As a result of my mental health, I’ve been slowly drifting away from my relationship. We’ve been in a rough patch for a few months now, and it’s only increased as time has drawn on. I still very much care about my boyfriend – he’s a great person with an amazing personality that I’m very lucky to have had a relationship with – but I know that at the current phase of my life, I am not able to handle a relationship. Being the sweet, kind, amazing person that my boyfriend is, he very much has tried to help me through my metal and academic hardships this semester. 

But to provide a little more background, it’s necessary to understand that **my boyfriend has been diagnosed with OCD and Major Depressive Disorder** (anyone who has experience with either of these will know exactly how hard it is for someone who is afflicted). This is something that has really never gotten in the way of our relationship, and I’ve always been happy to provide support through the good days and the bad, as he has done for me. With my current mental state, I know that I can’t be the person to provide support for him anymore.  I realized it was time to break up when I saw myself no longer wanting his help for my problems and getting frustrated and angry with him when he’s done nothing wrong. My **relationship feels burdensome to me and like one of the thousands of other tasks I’ve been juggling this semester just to try and stay afloat.** When I noticed this, I also noticed that my boyfriend was not my go-to person for support anymore, and that **I’m not in love with him.** This is coupled also with lessened sexual attraction as well.

&amp;#x200B;

The Central Issue: 

Given his history of mental illness and my history of being supportive of him, **I’m worried that if I break up with him, he’ll have no one to turn to for support when his mental health inevitably hits one of its low points, and there’s a chance he could harm himself**. When I met him, he was much worse off than he is now, and while I’m not taking sole credit for his improvement (because he is a very strong and capable individual that has fought for his recovery), I know that I’ve been his cushion to fall back on when he needs help. 

As a result of his OCD, he has intrusive thoughts that manifest in various ways and cause extreme anxieties and low self-worth. As a result of his Major Depressive Disorder, he has bouts of depression, and both illnesses cause ideations of self-harm. He’s never harmed himself before, but he’s come close, and I’ve always been there to stop him or provide support; he also knew that the next time I saw him naked, he wouldn’t be able to hide any of the cuts. **But without our relationship, he has no obligation to me (or anyone) not to harm himself.** He has friends that can help, but they aren’t nearly as close as I am to him with these issues, and his parents (whom he still lives with) are causing several anxieties for him at the moment. He goes to therapy, but only about once a month for reasons that are irrelevant to this post.

***What advice do you have for someone in my situation?*** I want to breakup, but I’m very worried that he’ll end up hurting himself from the pain of the breakup. **He’s very much in love with me, and I’m not in love with him.** I still deeply care about him as a friend, though, and I don’t want to lose him from my life either. I still want to be there to support him, too, but as a friend and not a partner. I realize this may not be possible, ***but is there any advice for at least how to hand the break up?***",16Nov2020,0
61,"Hi. Here's some back story, about 4 years ago I had met a girl that I fell pretty hard for. I was 14 years old at the time and still figuring out my sexuality. I didn't know how to handle my attraction to her so I starting writing a story about her and me. (well, kind of, I changed our names and setting and stuff like that.) Now, this girl I was falling for was a complete jerk to me, pretty much for no reason. I put the story away for a long while, only picking it up once in a blue moon to add details I thought would be fun. A couple months ago, I picked the story up again and started adding a lot of detail. I had written probably about 10 google doc pages. I really liked the story and my writing, but I noticed I was starting to feel yucky. I was getting stomach aches all the time, I felt like I was lying and being shady. I finally broke down and told my mom that I had started writing the story again and that I was ashamed  of how it was making me feel. She told me to delete it in it's entirety because, like I mentioned before, this girl was a jerk to me and I shouldn't be working on something that was built on a negative relationship. As soon as I deleted the story, I felt better. But then, the regret set in. I had worked on this story for 4 years! It keeps me up at night. It wracks my brain. I am so mad at myself all the time, every time I think about it! So, friends, how do I stop feeling so awful about deleting the story? I know in my heart it was the right thing to do but I don't understand why it hurts me so much. Thank you all so much, have a wonderful night.",16Nov2020,1
62,"Hey, so for the last 2 years my 'motivation' levels have severly dropped, I cant seem to find that 'umph' the force or gust of wind I need to complete the tasks I want. I have tried things like studying, and then rewarding myself with snacks etc, but it just doesnt seem to work. Everything I do has to be done through sheer force of will (Literally like fight a to the death) Even with simple things like washing dishes, making my bed, studying, or going to the gym or showering.

Psychologically im a very motivated, strong willed driven person, I want the best of the best and I know one day I will achieve the level of success I desire. However, I feel like theres an imbalance in my brain, Alot of it I know is because of porn addiction, and I know how it screws around with you Reward system and dopamine, as I am a Neuroscience student myself, and ive done countless research on what its doing to my brain, and Im still in the process of quitting after 2 years of battling and loosing.

 I WILL NEVER GIVE UP, I know how much I have to offer the world, myself , my families and friends. I believe in my abilities whole heartedly but I feel like a dog biting its own tail and running round in circles, I get a sudden burst of ideas and things that inspire me and even impress me by my own intelligence and creativity, I know I can organise them and work hard on them and bring them into reality, but I cant seem to overcome this hurdle or barrier, I cant keep treating myself like a slave and whipping myself to do things. How can I regain my motivation?

Ive recently tried LSD and it has re inspired my love of life, Im yet to do DMT and Im ready to try again with the struggle of life, even if it takes hard work, and whipping myself to work hard I will do it, but There has to be something more, how can I learn to love the work I know I need to do? 

Do I change my perception about work? do I change the neural association I have with hard work? Do I try and get prescribed Adderall? when im already on Antidepressants for social anxiety ( My mental health is good and bad at the same time )  Like I said I found my love of life, but if I cant go and achieve my goals, then whats the point, and thats where my depression comes in, and even if my goals fail atleast I will know ive tried.

69,"So... My great grandfather just passed today, when I woke up to see my dad's text, saying ""when you see this call me"", I knew that it had to do with my great grandpa, and I was right, I guessed exactly right. I knew the moment I saw that message that he had died, but I wasn't surprised or sad, I accepted it as life as I do with all deaths. I'm not sad at my great grandpa's death, he had a nice life and it was his time to go, but it the realization of many other things that really got me. I got hit with the strange feeling of wanting to be sad and not being able to at all... I was sad that I wasn't the right kind of sad, I was happy (not in a sadistic way) and that's all I've been feeling for a long while. I got out of a deep depression and stayed that way till I realized I wasn't happy with happy. I tried making myself sad by rewatching a show that is precious to me 'Clannad' and 'Clannad after story'. I haven't ended up even starting it again cause going into it I didn't feel right. I was afraid I would not be sad watching it again and it not having the magic it did when I first watched it. TL;DR I am not happy with being out of my depression because it feels so unnatural being happy, I'd be happier being able to feel sadness once again.",16Nov2020,3
70,"First time posting on here, mostly because I have no idea where else I could get some help from. 

To set the scene, I'm on the autism spectrum (used to be asperger's on the DSM4), I've been dealing with depression for years now, but the anxiety thing is pretty new to me (a little more than a year).

I'm currently working as a behavior therapist for children who are either on the spectrum or have a developmental delay, and although it's not my end goal, it's still a job where I can do what I like. 

That being said, my stress and anxiety have shot through the stratosphere. I've held down part time jobs with more hours for longer before, but for some reason I've already almost broke down crying while on shift, and it's only been a month. Breathing exercises didn't do Jack all for me and I had to leave for a minute. 

I have theories for a lot of this. My schedule makes it so I can't see my SO very often, the transition from college to work, my parents expectations for me to work a 40 hour week even though it takes me more than 2 days to ""reset"" after a work week, and of course the whole covid thing going on (I'm canadian btw)

Man, I'm really not wanting to post this now, but, I've got only my dignity and what little of my sanity I have left to lose. 

Could be a case of me not knowing how to handle stress, or something completely unrelated, I've got no clue. I'm hoping someone either has some advise or can link me to some resources that are free/cheap? I've got most of my money tied up in car insurance for the moment.

72,"I censored just in case, and potential trigger warning!! 

I cut for over a year after a really difficult move. I was really depressed, my best friends still lived in the same place while I moved to a different time zone on the opposite side of the country completely alone (with my family). I didn’t have a choice as I’m a military brat. It was really rough and once I started cutting I got so scared and went to therapy almost immediately. My mom found out, and my parents reactions definitely weren’t the best, lets leave it at that. Concerned for my well being, but didn’t quite deal with it in the best way IMO.

But anyways I’ve made amazing new friends here, keep in touch with my old friends (one of which is now my gf!!) and feel so much better about myself. I’ve been working out, studying hard, got a job and started making money to get supplise for my new hobbies. And I haven’t cut in almost four months now!! I still get urges, but I combat them by doodling excessively over the place I want to cut, or going on a walk or distracting myself with a fun workout instead.

Noone knows I cut in the first place (except my parents) and I kinda dont have anywhere to express myself freely and be proud of myself, but figured I could post here.

I feel like I can't think... My mind is blank. I'm having trouble remember a lot of things.  This is making it difficult for me to write my masters thesis, of which I am already overdue on (so much that it's delaying my graduation). I have  lost interest in the things I love and it's putting a strain on my relationship. 

I'm 23f and have diagnosed depression and anxiety. I have been involuntarily hospitalized once, in 2014. Now I am considering voluntarily committing myself. I feel that I need intensive therapy to get myself out of this. However, the one thing that keeps me going is talking to the few friends I have, and I would like to keep my phone (at least some of the time) while hospitalized. In addition, I would want to have access to my thesis materials in case I can start writing again.  I know some facilities are less strict than others, but I don't know how to go about finding one. I have plans to speak to both my therapist and psychiatrist this week, but I feel like I also want advice from others.  I'm located in on the northeastern coast of USA.

75,"TL:DR- 9 y/o daughter is showing signs of mental illness. Anyone here that started having problems young? What helped you? 

———

As the title says, I’m a mother with depression. I’ve been fortunate to have good medical care and a support system in place, and things are generally good.

Friday, my 12 year old expressed deep concern about her 9 year old sister. The 9 y/o (I’ll call her “A”) mentioned to her big sister that sometimes she wants to die and kill herself.  

So, yesterday, “A” and I went on a long walk and I carefully broached the subject. (I’ve taught teenagers for 15 years and have gotten really good at not asking leading questions) Thankfully her suicidal ideas are not specific and I don’t feel that there is any immediate danger. 

We had a great conversation about intrusive thoughts, how it’s normal for people to have these kinds of thoughts, and how there was nothing bad or wrong about it. I shared some of my experience with her and reassured her that her dad and I would always love and support her, and that she can come to us for help. She told me she felt relieved and that she was glad we talked. 

“A” struggles with ADHD, anxiety, and seemed to have some OCD tendencies with her thoughts. My husband and I are not against medication, but we don’t know that we want to start her so early.  “A” just turned 9 a few months ago. Husband and I knew that mental health concerns would probably impact our children, so it’s not a shock, but she’s just so young. 

Our primary care physician is fantastic and manages my medications. I am going to reach out to him this week because I think this needs to be on his radar.

My husband and I wonder how much her diet is impacting things- we notice that she tends to have more troubles when she eats too much sugar. 

So I guess my question is this... is there anyone here who began having mental health issues at a young age? How did you manage it? Was there anything that worked or didn’t work for you?",16Nov2020,5

Whenever we have an argument and I try to tell her some truth she just fucking threatens me to be quiet or she'll slap me if I don't, she always has to say everything in such an aggressive tone and than gets pissed when I respond back with anger, she reminds me of those high school girls that's gotta talk shit about everything and when you get into an argument with her it's not civil it always has to be taken the next level with her. I'm always in fear that I'm not doing anything right when I'm doing something, I fear that she'll yell at me or get annoyed and continue to yell at me. Whenever I argue with her she always brings up the point ""oh we give you everything you want and this is the thanks we get"" WHAT THE FUCK AM I NOT ALLOWED TO BEING UPSET OR ANGRY OR SAD, IS THAT JUST NOT ALLOWED AT ALL THE FUCK, ITS A HUMAN THING.

First I'll say that I was always quiet/shy I never really know what to say to people I don't know well enough, that was a reason for my feelings you'll read about later here.
Since last year I was completely away from any social life, had no friends or partner (never had one but that's another story) there was a reason for this but in retrospect wasn't a good enough reason, at least before covid.
Then this summer I got to the army and the first two months were almost the lowest point of my life, that's what it felt like, I wanted to die every day, wasn't even happy no matter what happened.
But then last week, after I got my post in the army and was there working for a week, something tragic happened in my family and they had to go out of town, so I was alone at home this week, and also in my birthday, and for some reason I feel great.
First day I was home in these circumstances I really felt like everything is going according to plan, I'll have friends and partner, I'll pass this and that thing, like inner peace in movies. I started working out! Even if only a bit.

I'm not necessarily passionate about anything. I'm not good at anything. With what I have, I can't survive here. I'm sorta good at art and cooking. But it's more helpful if you're good at math or science. I can't present anything in front of a crowd. But half of my grades depend on that...

Yesterday I was wondering why I'm even doing the smallest of things anymore. Like waking up, showering, watching tv etc. I was wondering why I hadn't given up on life considering I feel like I'm not meant to fit in this world. I found out its because I'm shit scared of death itself, I don't want the money my parents spent on me to go to waste, I don't want to traumatize my family members and because even if I do leave this earth, wherever I go, I won't be able to be with my pet dog and cats.

I realized I'm not living for myself but for others. If I'm only alive to satisfy others, where am I supposed to get the motivation for myself? I have a goal in life not because it's real but because I'm 18 and I'm supposed to have a goal. I'm not passionate about anything. I don't love or want to work hard for anything. With all this, what do I do. 

It's hard because i don't want to be here. But i have to. I'm forced to do these things and I'm always this close to ending it all but I never do because I'm afraid of what'll happen after I leave... it all just feels pointless that I'm existing for someone else and am forced to do shhit and feel like shit everyday just for these few reasons and none of them being, for myself.",16Nov2020,3
96,"I’ve been sexually assaulted by my “best friend” multiple times, and I forgave him everytime. Most instances I was either unconscious or too intoxicated to consent, I get flashbacks to one time I kinda woke up and realised his hands were down my pants and he was we penetrating me. I was a serious full on addict, he was my supplier and he used my addiction against me to hold power over me. He also systematically abused me mentally for years and years into a very toxic friendship where he relied on me emotionally and for affection, it started off slow and platonic, just like kind of leaning against me while watching a movie or putting a leg over mine, but somehow turned into “harmless” cuddling, I let him cuddle me because I didn’t want to be abandoned by my “best friend”

The worst instance though, I wasn’t like completely out of it, I was aware, so I feel like I should’ve been strong enough to stop it from happening to me, I was AWARE of his hands all over me and I hated every second of it. We were alone in a hotel room on a holiday when it happened. He asked to give me a massage, I didn’t want it, but I felt like if I said no, he would get angry and I was stuck alone with him in a hotel room, so I said okay (that was the only thing I said okay too) but then he started taking off my clothes and complimenting my body and by this point I was (too) gently telling him to stop please, but he wasn’t listening, I told him I do not want to have sex with him, and he kept trying to “convince me”, by continuing to put his hands on my body, I didn’t know how to make it stop and then he penetrated me with his finger and my insides shattered but outwardly I was too afraid to express it. I hate myself so much for this but I actually *pretended* to enjoy it for a second in the hopes that he would stop, I thought if he thought he had made me cum he would finally stop trying maybe? I don’t know why 😞 He put my hand on his dick, and my limp arm just laid there. At some point I got up, went into the bathroom and collapsed and cried in the shower, after about an hour I came out, still crying and asked him never to touch me again and he guilted me into feeling sorry for HIM by saying all this really self-depreciating stuff, how he loved me but he was too ugly for me, he literally made me feel bad that I didn’t want to have sex with him. 

This happened about 4 years ago, he’s no longer in my life, i wish I could say that was when our “friendship” ended, I FORGAVE him and blamed myself for letting it happen and then completely blocked out the memory until it hit me like a tonne of bricks the other night in bed, I could remember it all, his hands all over my body and inside me and how much I hated it and how scared and trapped I felt in that hotel room. 

The thing is, there’s a part of me telling me that I did let it happen. I put myself in a vulnerable situation, and I let him give me a back massage. Why didn’t I throw him off of me? Why didn’t I scream bloody murder and run? Why did I just disassociate and well, let it happen",16Nov2020,1

I know this may seem edgy but I wish stuff wasn't this hard. Life sucks right now and it's making me depressed. School used to be so fun and playing the Violin was so joyful to do. But the passion just kinda burned out.

My Asian parents have such high expectations for me because of my 2 older brothers that I feel so worthless compared to them. I'm expected to get at least a 3.9-4.0 (An A+) in all of my classes and it just gets harder and harder every day. I make the smallest mistakes and both my brothers and parents start nagging at me for it. My parents aren't abusive nor are my brothers, but I don't know how to even say hi to them without feeling awkward. Our relationship has been blocked by both a language barrier and culture that it's nearly impossible for me to bond with them in a positive way. I know a decent amount of Korean, but I can only do small talk.

My friends seem smarter than me in nearly every subject, AP classes are just building up in homework and stress, and I have no idea how to be relaxed anymore.

99,"This is something I’ve been extremely ashamed of for as long as I can remember, probably since it first happened. I’ve only told one person about it and could barely say it. 

I honestly can’t remember the first time this happened, but my parents would either get rid or me like tell me to go get something or to ask my sister a question to be able to have sex in the mean time. I’ve caught them every time when I came back. I can’t even count how many times they’ve done it, and I remember a specific time I was so scared of them doing it again that I was on the verge of tears to not go ask my sister a stupid question that just gave them time; I was yelled at and forced to do it, I cried and went to ask her, I remember being shaky. I went back to my parents and caught them again. 

It graduated to them having sex in bed with me. While I was sleeping I would wake up and see them both naked having sex right in front of me. They would have sex under the blankets when I was awake right next to them playing a video game, when I was awake in the room on the computer and could hear them. 

I was only 4-6 years old at the time I can remember it starting. 

I caught them once when they forced my sister and I to wash our cat for their own *needs*. I came out and saw it all on display, yet again, and began crying and they didn’t stop. My sister had to pull me away into the bathroom again and distract me. 

My mom refuses to admit or believe it affected me at all. I think otherwise. It wasn’t until a couple years ago I began thinking about it again, and I feel like it had a lot to do with my sexuality at a young age. My first sexual experience was at 7/8, and before that I was doing other things on my own, which I don’t think is normal(?). 

I also feel like it led me to believe being in bed with my uncle while he was either naked or in just underwear while he talked to me telling me certain things was normal. I feel like something bad happened during those times in bed with him and I don’t know if anyone knew about it. 

I think it’s affected me terribly. I’m ashamed of it. I thought I was being over dramatic about everything with my parents, but I learned having sex in front of your children is considered sexual abuse. I don’t know what to do about this. I’ve repressed it for so long, I’ve tried talking to my mom about it and she brushes it off. 

I think this is the root to the rest of my life (I’m 20 years old) becoming so sexually focused. Am I wrong for feeling this way? Is it normal for someone who has gone through what I have to feel this way?",16Nov2020,2

Many of my family members are very high risk of death and we just aren't willing to risk that for as long as possible. Secondly is that being stuck at home with my family is becoming an emotional nightmare. My brother is incredibly needy and it's not easy for us to get along. So I either stay in my room most of the day, or spend too much time every day hanging out with a family I feel I cannot easily connect with. Being alone or in a fight with a sibling for 8 months has been slowly ruining my mental state and I cant take it anymore. If someone has hope please tell me.

109,"I had just gotten out of the hospital and taken my first dose of ""kepra"" since being home . The seizures had stopped. Life was ""good"" for the first time in weeks . 
It was around 7pm, I know because sundown had just passed. I cant remember what was on the tv , but I know it was just another ""normal"" night , dinner was in the oven (or a pizza box on the counter let's be honest ) I was home with my girlfriend and we were getting ready to sit down with our dogs and wind down. We got into some kind of argument which led me to spiral into negative thoughts and the typical ""stream of bipolar schitzoassociative"" thoughts continued . Except this time it wasnt a stream . It was a floodgate  Under the influence of drugs I was not in the slightest warned about attributing to poor mental health otherwise I may have rejected this form of treatment . My mind was swarming with 1000 thoughts/ second and I didnt even have the cognizance to process one. 
My throat felt dry like I needed to drink a 5 gallon jug of water or I might combust or crack like fragile porcelain. I couldn't articulate what was going on , because I didnt know what was going on . The severity of my panic and the acceleration of ""I dont want to watch this movie "" turning to "" I dont understand my purpose "" continued . My girlfriend left to go get the mail. She said we can talk in one minute when she gets back. The lack of purpose quickly turned to lack of will to continue . I've never self harmed , I've never attempted to hurt myself , but the moment she left I sprinted and grabbed a glock 19 without hesitation . I pulled it back and put it to my head , I didnt say any goodbyes , I didnt stop and think about what I could accomplish if I continued perceviering through lifes temporary struggles , I didnt think about anything other than following through with what I started when I cocked it back five seconds ago. *Click* *I did it*......""What happened !?!?!?"" ""I'm still here"" The gun jammed. I looked down , I smacked the side of it in anger . *Boom* I shot a hole in the wall , dropped to my knees and the loop of negativity was gone. My ears are ringing , my body is trembling , and I'm processing what happened ,questioning how I got to that point . My girlfriend walked back from getting the mail . ""What'd you break "" ... ""myself "" . ""I'm sorry"" . 




Please use this story from 2018 that I am sharing with you now as a reminder . 

Gun safety is important . 

Stop and breathe before you act, often times your emotions shape your reality. 

Please seek advice on drug safety and awareness of any and all possible side effects . 

 If you ever need to talk and are struggling with mental health please, reach out. And if you do not have the courage to message me personally there are resources. Ultimately none of this wouldve helped me in that situation , and the only thing that would have pulled me from a toxicity fueled drug induced hypnotic state of existential dread would have been meditation and regular practice of self control in order to be better equipt for such an unexpected feeling. 

I love you , no matter who you are reading this. Thank you for being a part of my life. Your existence is Devine,  and you are a valued piece of the whole of creation.🖤🥀🕶",16Nov2020,9
110,"I am a sexual assault victim. Whenever I’ve been intimate with a boyfriend or even touched/poked by a family member, it sends me into a panic attack. I don’t have any sort of out of body experiences. What I do feel though is that I’m disconnected and trapped in my head. Like I can’t get out. I’m aware of everything that’s happening but I’m completely out of control of my body. I’m stuck in my head and I can’t leave it or gain any sort of control for several minutes. Part of what I’m doing to help me recover from my trauma is being able to name and identify what I’m feeling when I’m triggered. Kind of like putting a name to the face. It helps me accept it as real. Does anyone have any sort of idea what to call this?

The best way I could possibly describe it is that one Dr Who episode where Oswin is in the Dalek. Idk why that comes in my head because I saw it so many years ago but it’s the closest thing I can compare it to. There doesn’t seem to be a word I can attach to that feeling",16Nov2020,10
111,"Before I (m27) begin, I am already seeking professional help. However, due to the pandemic and it being the end of the year, there is currently no room at any of the psychologists in my area.

I have had a rough year. In August 2019 I kicked my girlfriend whom I lived together with out of my house due to cheating, which had previously also happened and which I forgave, in hindsight that was dumb and I have always felt that the trust was never going to fully recover. So I spent 3 years together walking on my toes. But I digress.

Not long after I met a new amazing girl, but as I was still recovering from the previous breakup I kept a bit of distance. We dated a bit, but ultimately I said I needed more time which she understood. I would not want to confess this, but I think it was a truly classic rebound situation.

I think in January this year we got together again and actually started dating, however I was still not done with the whole ex-situation and could not fully commit to her. My ex still had a large portion of mindshare, and I did believe that maybe we could stay in friendly contact. If you ask me now, I have no clue why I would have even wanted that. Imagine the lack of self-respect by somehow wanting to be friends with the person that truly betrayed you multiple times.

So, I ruined things from the get-go with a truly amazing person, as I could not take away her doubts because I did not fully mentally commit until months later. I was worried other people (friends, family) would judge me for moving into another relationship so quickly, I wanted friendship at the time with my ex, etcetera.  
 In the meantime, Covid popped up, I called in sick with a burnout in March (fully recovered work-hours wise in July), and I am struggling heavily with the empty house, empty evenings and not having people around to at least be able to take my mind off of things.

In the end, intimacy became less because I committed too late, I became frustrated and frightened because the same things happened with my previous relationship and I became possessive, jealous and unhappy. I wanted things to work out so badly, but a dynamic had began to exist between us that I felt jealous when she told me she was having a good time with friends, and instead of being happy for her I would become agitated that I could not offer that level of carefreeness. Especially once she said that it felt like we had been a couple for years, and that we had too many discussions instead of having fun conversation.

She was a great mirror as she did show me many sides I like to work on. I want to not feel jealous for other people having a good time, and I’m not sure if this is a remnant of what happened with my cheating ex, or if this something inherent. But also things like being the devil’s advocate a lot (or as I used to call it, empathizing with/seeing it from the other side), which only exaggerates the feeling of having lots of discussions.

In short, I feel like a gigantic mess, and I want to become a better person who is able to just choose for myself and not care at all about those who clearly expressed that they don’t care about me. To just shrug off hypothetical social fears.

Specifically for this relationship, I am not sure if there is a chance of salvaging it. Is there any way to get out of such a toxic dynamic? Do we just need time to “reset”? Or are there things I can do to change my less-than-ideal characteristics, even if I have only a broad feeling of what they are?

I think that this is not something I can begin to understand or treat with the basic cognitive behavioral therapy, as I feel that things have happened in my upbringing that can explain this behavior.",16Nov2020,2

119,"Back in 2018 a ""friend"" of mine raped me while we were drunk. For a variety of reasons, mostly because my mental health was shit, instead of reporting him or telling him to fuck right off, I developed a very toxic friendship with him. At the moment I thought I was in love with him but after getting better I realized that it was more of a sick obsession than actual love. 

FF to 2019, I finally find the guts to admit this relationship is unhealthy and in a moment of lucidity I am able to tell the guy I'm never going to hear from him again. I thought taking my distance would make me forget about him but it only made me hate him even more. And after one year and a half I'm still thinking about him. I have nightmares where I see him and they just feel so real that they cause me to have breakdowns and panic attacks.

I don't know what to do, I really need to get rid of him but I don't know what else to do. I don't use my socials anymore so I don't risk seeing pictures of him posted by our friends, I moved back to my hometown to stop seeing him around town, I avoid most topics that remind me of what happened, but it still keeps coming back. Can anyone help me figure it out?

Edit: thank you for all you kind responses. Many of you mentioned therapy, that's something I already do for a variety of other reasons.

127,"Hi, I apologize in advance if this is a stupid question or if this becomes too long. But I have an upcoming appointment with my doctor and I am at a lost. 

So back in June I was prescribed some antidepressants due to me being severely depressed. It had gotten to the point where I cried everyday and I was living in paranoia. I always had a feeling i was depressed but i was I never taken seriously. So after finally convincing my mom to take to me the doctor I get medicine. Great right? Well after a few months I was prescribed a higher dosage of medicine. since my depression had gotten worse. and that is where I started noticing some issues. I was having way too much energy and laughing fits. Along with having trouble sleeping and even talking a bit faster than normal. So I go and tell my doctor all about these issues and he asks me if anyone in my family suffers from maniac episodes or if anyone is bipolar. Which I reply that I don’t. So he makes get off of caffeine since he himself doesn’t know the exact problem as to why I have been feeling this way for more than two weeks. Along with lowering my dosage. Then Things starting going a bit back to normal for me. Kinda. After a week of taking lower the dosage I began to feel depressed and sorta Suicidal. It sorta also came from nowhere too, and I still feel the same. Now here is where the problem is and why I am asking my question. 

I was talking to some friends about how my visit had went and things like that. So as I was talking to my closest friend that I have know for a very long time, she tells me that she had always noticed a pattern with me and my moods. That throughout the years she had noticed that I tend to be on the extreme ends with my emotions. She said that I am either extremely happy or extremely sad, and that there wasn’t an between. So this surprises me because for a long time I have noticed that I was like this, but I just assumed I was a very emotional person. I ask some more friends and they all tell me the same thing. all of them saying that it’s like a switch that happens in me. Even my mom told me she has noticed it before. They all tell me that they all noticed this for a long time before I even got diagnosed with depression. 

So should I tell my doctor about my mood swings? Is this completely normal? I don’t want to assume anything yet, but does anyone have an idea why this might been happening? Could it just be the medicine affecting me or something else?",16Nov2020,2
128,"Sexual harassment

I am a 16 year old girl realizing so much experiences that was traumatic for me. When I was 14 years old that was the first time of my life that I ever felt attractive by boys. I would dress up and do my makeup and look cute everyday. One day me and my family were moving our boxes to a truck we borrowed since we were moving apartments at that time. Me and my family were carrying and moving boxes until I hear one construction working man start to whistle at me and holler at me. I ignored it because I didn’t think he was hollering at me. After minutes later when I came out with boxes to move to my truck, a group of construction working men sat down across me facing me. I just thought they must be resting, but they continued whistling and hollering at me for 4 hours straight across from me and facing towards me while I was moving boxes. I was wearing a pair of shorts and a tank top. I told my family that the construction men keep staring at me, my brother tells me it’s because what I’m wearing, he simply says that I am asking for it. At that time I was 14 and I got so mad at him saying what does it have to do with what I’m wearing. He keeps telling me that I’m begging for attention to the construction workers. My mom and sister simply said that what my brother said was wrong and that some men are like that in reality. They never said anything to my brother. I was so raged and angry at that time questioning why he said that to me. I’ve had multiple situations of catcalling and sexual harassment, multiple guy friends sexually harrassing me and insulting me and commenting on my body throughout the years.

129,"Hi everyone,

Basically, for years I’ve struggled with mental health but recently I’ve noticed a pattern in how I’m feeling and I’ll go through it;

I fluctuate a lot, I go from extremely sad to very happy in the space of a day, at my lowest I think I’m the worst thing ever and at my happiest I get the feeling that I am amazing

Sometimes I’m in a sort of ‘meh’ mood where I feel neither happy or sad which is really dull so I usually end up buying something (whether that be a new phone, laptop, whatever I feel like at the time)

When it comes to anger, it’s usually very sudden. It’s a full on 0-100 situation and when I get angry I tend to lash out and throw things, hit things, etc and as soon as I’ve calmed down from that anger I’ll be very upset at myself and end up hating myself for letting myself get angry.

This one is very hard to admit. But I when my partner used to go out drinking with his mates (Covid-19 put an end to that for now!) I had this massive fear that they would find someone else while they were in the club and leave me so I used to say to him that I’m feeling very sad and upset and then he would usually end up saying that he won’t stay out too late and he would meet up with me afterwards to make sure I was okay. Ouch, I hate the fact that I do that, but I honestly do not want to lose him!

And I honestly have no idea who I am, I’ll buy new clothes so I can change how I look quite often and I usually take on characteristics from people I watch on YouTube and TV. But I’m not sure what I like in terms of hobbies, or what I want to do for a job or just simply I don’t know who I am in terms of personality. 

Does anyone have any idea if this is just part of life or if I should talk to my doctor about this because I don’t want to overreact to something that’s normal! Thank you!",16Nov2020,1

132,"From the ages of about 16 to 18, I (young adult female) found that porn didn’t do a ton for me, so I mostly read erotica on sites like asstr.

With these stories, I didn’t really have any limits at the time. No matter how fucked up or illegal. A few of the stories I came across were genuinely horrible with extremely young characters. This made me a little uncomfortable but didn’t stop me from reading and rereading them. I guess I thought because it was fictional and I was inserting myself into the roles of the child characters, it was fine to get off to them.

I want to make it clear that I didn’t seek out these stories for the age factor, and these were not the only stories I was reading. Many of the erotica stories I read had 18+ characters. I never sought out anything illegal, and whenever I came across a picture of a child, (sometimes I masturbated just for the feeling while going about other activities), I quickly scrolled past because I didn’t want to see that while getting off.

I guess I sort of lost interest in these stories and I haven’t read them in a long while now. Nor do I have any current desire to read them, because I don’t need them at all to get off. I totally forgot about all of this until one day a few months back I suddenly remembered in a low moment while my OCD (which I had had for years but didn’t realize at this point) was getting progressively worse, and felt disgusted from then on.

Ever since then I have been so angry at and feel sick with myself. I used to volunteer with kids during the same time period I was reading these stories and never made any connection. I want to be a mom one day. I know it wasn’t the age factor that attracted me to these stories, it was the other content in them, but I am still so angry, devastated, and horrified by it.

I also do a lot of private writing, and I never plan on publishing any of it so really anything goes with these stories (definitely some wish-fulfillment type stuff), and I have never ever written about harming or abusing children, so I cling on to that, trying to convince myself that this wasn’t some perverted desire and I will be okay.

But still. I am so angry with myself. Everyday. I fear (I’m sure a lot of you know how deeply rooted and terrifying this fear is) I’m some kind of pedo and I hate myself because of it. I struggle to enjoy things because I feel like I don’t deserve to for what I used to read. I feel like a piece of shit.

For months I’ve been scrolling through reddit and other forums and have found many people in the same exact situation as me, but it doesn’t make me feel any better. I still feel like a freak. I am so remorseful and I guess this is my way of publicly apologizing for a private sin.

Does anyone have any advice on how I can deal with the shame? I have become so disconnected from everyone and everything. I can no longer do the things I enjoy.

136,"I'm sorry if I won't make much sense, I'll try and be as clear as possible (also English is not my first language). Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this.

I have memories going back to as early as elementary school where I would feel blocked and unable to fully express myself out of fear of doing something wrong probably. It's almost a physical feeling, no matter how hard I try for example I just can't speak up or the idea of dancing or laughing freely in front of other people is unthinkable, I just get anxious even thinking about it. Some things used to help when I was little, for example singing or acting were doable things, even if I was scared, but as I've gotten older (I'm 20) even those are out of the picture. The few times where I do manage to let myself go I am hit by a wave of anxiety immediately after or a few hours later as I overthink about every little thing I do every day to the point where I memorize entire conversations just by thinking about them too much.

I see a therapist regularly (not now due to Covid, but otherwise I do) and though therapy has helped me a lot with other (more important) problems, this problem is never really adressed as long as I can function normally (and I can I guess). I'm not diagnosed with anxiety and I don't think I suffer from it, when I read about experiences of people who do suffer from it, there's always something that doesn't really sound like me moreover I've never had a panick attack or felt overwhelmed by anxiety, it just blocks me.

I'm used to living like this and I'm sure there are people going through much worse, but I can't help but feel hopeless sometimes because of I am. I block and analyse so much everything I do and feel that I can never feel truly happy. I'm not sad all the time either, but I don't enjoy life. Things have changed a bit lately as I've gotten together with my boyfriend. He somehow got me to slowly open up and I am truly happy when I'm with him even though I still block myself sometimes. But the moment there are other people involved I go back to being anxious and blocked. I feel unable to function socially in a way that makes me happy, I am good at helping others because all I do is listen in silence and I always come off as the shy, polite girl (which I am I guess) when I could be so much more if I let myself be.

I'm sure there are much bigger problems in life, but I'm not happy (boyfriend aside, and I can't spend every waking moment alone with him) and I have never met someone who understands or feels the same way and not having a diagnosis makes it hard to find the right support groups among the mental health community. I just need to know if there is a way to get out of this and if anyone can relate.

I probably wasn't clear at all, but I already wrote too much. If anyone has questions I'll answer them. Thank you to anyone who read this far.",16Nov2020,1
137,"
[M17] I call it “rollercoaster effect”. It’s not easy to accept it, but i got to deal with it, as I still got to deal with my looks too. It’s like being on a rollercoaster: sometimes I feel good, and very optimistic about my future, and other times I feel very bad. It’s normal to have good and bad periods, normally, but I have ups and down every day.  Just like today… I started sleeping more, studying more, reading more this morning ( I want to have better habits ), but I suddenly felt very bad ( psychologically ) and stared crying and started having suicidal thoughts.

I’m used to this sudden switches… but I’m done with this today and decided to tell someone else too.

To sum it up, I got very bad social problems, linked to my low self esteem. I never talk to people, because I’m afraid I’ll annoy them, or that I’m not worth their time, also because I stutter often. I feel inadequate most of the times, and that’s because of my looks too. I look awful.

My psychotherapist is actually my only friend. I consider her a friend ( secretly ), but that’s just because I can talk to her and feel heeded. She’s actually helping me with my insecurities, but ofc she can’t do anything about how I see myself at the mirror/pictures.  The sad part is that, considering she’s a psychotherapist, she’s paid to listen to me and spend 1 hour of her time with me each week.

I deleted socials, i hated to compare myself with other people. I know it’s a fake reality, but i just hate it

Having this said, (thank you if you’re still reading) this rollercoaster doesn’t bring me anywhere: even if I feel good and want to socialize, as I go out for  walk, my confidence fades away, and I’m not the guy I’d like to be anymore. At least, when I feel good, I can go out and walk as a normal person. But, when I’m sad, I can’t do that neither.

I noticed that, when I go out, I often avoid watching couples of lovers, because it makes me feel very bad. Once, I started crying and feeling goosebumps in the middle of the street, as I saw an happy couple ( they both were 17 like me ). 

I’m just looking for a way to deal with loneliness, but i can’t. I’d just like to be an insensitive person, so i won’t have all of these problems related to girls and couples. I want to say i don’t think it’s girls’ fault, because i’ve seen different not handsome guys with stunning girls. I’m the problem and i feel guilty for it",16Nov2020,2
138,I’ve noticed that over the years I’ve developed a really nasty habit. Whenever I’m laughing and talking with someone I smile as expected but right as they’re out of eye sight my smile immediately drops.

141,"I have been dealing with my mental health for quite a while now and although I am not perfect, I do consider that I have a decent control over my life when it comes to dealing with my anxiety. But because of an horror game all this have changed and I feel like the worse idiot there is. 

I've always known I was a wuss and I accept it and the judgement that comes with it, but I dont want to be this way. I dont want to be super courageous and have run-into-fire kind of nerves, but being able to watch a scary movie of finish an horror game without regressing to the mental state of a 5 year old would be great. 

Everytime I see a trailer for an horror movie/game I always want to know more, I want to know what's the story, what will happen to the characters, but just the trailer is enough to get me running to switch the lights on. I know most good horror games there is, I know how they play, and some of them I checked the story because I dont have the console to play them (like Silent Hill 1 and 2). And I had to go READ the plot online because I couldn't even bring myself to watch a let's play. 

I feel so ridiculous for being such a wuss... So I tried forcing myself to do more horror stuff. And I am not getting dissensitized. I read all the tricks to not be scared. Dont play alone, don't play at night, dont play in the dark, play with no sounds. The thing is, my ""friends"" wont let me use those tricks. Insisting that I will get a better experience at night in the dark. Some even give me ultimatums like ""I will only be with you if you play at night in the dark, you wont need me if you play during the day""

Recently I tried playing Until Dawn. I've heard a lot of good thing about this game, and its actually my boyfriend's favorite game. I'm gonna be honest, I was spoiled a lot of the story. And I thought it would,make it easier. In one day I could only bring myself to do two chapters... And I did the first chapter in the morning... I just can't do it. I know,that 90% of the bad feelings I am feeling,is due to,anticipation (the joys of anxiety), but I can't control it. I hate jumpscares. I despises them. I dont think they are ""cheap scares"" I just can't handle adrenalin. 

""Fight flight or freeze"", I know for a fact that I freeze. Due to some motherly abuse, I mentally freeze under the influence of fear, especially loud noises. Any loud noises. Droped a pan and it was loud? Give my brain 5 seconds to restart. 5 seconds doesn't soumd that bad until you watch 5 seconds go by on a real clock, chronometers shows milliseconds, and psychologically when you see the millisecond it makes the seconds feel less long that they actually are. Then imagine this 5 second freeze in,the midle of an horror interactive movie like Until Dawn. Yay me. 

Not only am I bad at the game, but the extreme thoughts and fear I feel after and before playing is ridiculous. I get flashes of scary images in my mind everytime I hear a sound in my house. The thought imediately goes away as I know monsters aren't real, but my mind is basically jumpscaring me. Great. just. Great. 

I really want to finish this game as it is an,important game,for,my boyfriend, it's something,I want to do, but I dont,think I can. I'm just too much of a wuss... And,it makes me feel like an horrible person. I feel stupid, I feel ridiculous, and I feel this way on top of being scared out of my mind. If I didn't have any dignity, I would curl up in a ball and cry until the bad feelings goes away. 

Funnily enough, I can handle hauted houses pretty well. Me and my best friend went to a few of them and even made one and I have a blast every time. I scream, but I enjoy it. I am not scared of dead. I scream because of the jumpscare and not because I am terrified. I am nervous because I know somewhere somehow someone is going to jump at me, and still I want to go in and I have fun. I am not afraid of death in general. I have accepted the fact I could die at anytime (Memento Mori basically), so real physical threat dont scare me, plus I also know no one will hurt me. But somehow I cant bring myself to play a game I actually want to play...

I guess I just wanted to rant, there is not much tricks I haven't tried already, but I also... I need support for this anxiety... It's so intense every trick I know and usually give to people,on this sub wont work... Its 6 AM where I live and I have been wanting,to,pee for a couple,hours now and I cant bring myself out of bed in sheer terror and its been like 12 hours since I last played. Fear is still as raw as if I still had the controller in hand... I am so ashamed of myself...",16Nov2020,0

144,"TW: physical abuse

This is a very minuscule problem as opposed to the other ones that are discussed here but I’d though I’d just shoot my shot and post. (This is also my first time here and sorry if I do something wrong.)

I don’t have any mental health issues btw but if anything I begun feeling a lot of anxiousness and feelings of being overwhelmed since the beginning of last year. 

 I’ve found myself very far away from the person I want to be. I’m in my last year of high school and early this year I was physically abused by a family member and I feel as though that’s where I went downhill. I know I didn’t do the proper healing from that and it affected me not to mention the pandemic since I don’t even know where to start and have been avoiding it. So all this year I’ve felt like like a broken vase held together with tape. I haven’t confided to anyone about what happened also. 

With that being said in my country we’re allowed to go to social events and my school is having a formal (kind of like a prom for the seniors) and I didn’t really want to go in the first place but since another school trip got cancelled because of COVID I thought I might go to it and especially because my friends were really excited for it, which made me a little excited.

Well lately my mental health I fell has been declining rather fast and I really don’t want to go except that I don’t want to disappoint and let down my friends and my teachers who have been such amazing people to me this year without even knowing it. I’ve also already paid ~$80 for a dress with my own money and had my family pay ~$75 for a ticket to the event. I haven’t paid for hair or shoes or nails which would probably be ~$100 more. I really really don’t want to disappoint my friend and teacher who really wanted me to be there but when I think of going and then spending all that money I get so upset.  
There are also other factors contributing in my want to not go but this post is already long enough.

Should I go so I won’t regret it and is this just overthinking or should I not go and do something else with a couple other family members who I like.  Also the event is in 2 days on the 18th.",16Nov2020,1
145,"I am currently in online school, which I thought I would be able to handle, but I’m struggling. The work load is something I could normally handle, but I just can’t seem to get myself to do anything unless it’s last minute. I’ll try and start, but get sidetracked within a couple minutes. Either that or I’ll tell myself I’ll do it in x amount of time them keep pushing that further and further back. Now I have a whole essay, three economics assignments, and an Econ exam due by midnight and i’m panicking. I already don’t know anything in this economics class because the teacher doesn’t actually teach and we just read out of a book. I don’t why I keep doing this to myself, but I just can’t seem to keep myself focused. I wish I could go back to in-school learning, but my mom is immunocompromised and I don’t trust anyone at my school. I wish i hadn’t chosen to do dual-credit classes during online school either, but it’s far too late to do anything about that. I wish I could talk to my teachers and tell them that I don’t understand a single thing, but they’d just get angry at me. I want to fix myself but I just don’t know how.",16Nov2020,1
146,"So there's a momentary, very intense feeling that I (F 28) experienced maybe 10 times in my whole life and I am curious if anyone else has and if there's a name for it. 
So this feeling comes out of nowhere and if you imagine a panic attack being like a big wave, this feeling is like a tsunami. But panic doesn't even have time to set in. It's more of a strong feeling of disgust with everything around, but most of all with myself. As if being inside my body and in this room/house/world - just being is so unbearable, I could implode right that second. It's always the exact same feeling and it always lasts for a few seconds, thank f*ck for that.

For pure physical pain, I think of the time I broke my leg falling through a faulty set of bleachers at an event, which was itself very painful, and then in the first aid area I went to some volunteer staff there tried to force me to bend the leg while I screamed in agony for them to stop

I also have panic disorder and the panic attacks can be quite painful. People do mistake them for heart attacks for that reason.

For emotional pain, I think of the time early in my current depression episode when I was so painfully sad and lonely I felt like I could die if I didn’t talk to someone. It was 2am and I was so desperate I called the suicide hotline.

148,"My friend of about 10 years - we’ll call him Joe - is having a tough time coping with the death of our friend’s mother. Why? Because she killed herself after pushing her family away and feeling utterly alone. It reminded Joe of the time he tried killing himself a few years ago. After his suicide attempt, Joe learned that, on top of having ADHD and anger issues, he also has autism and depression. 

Throughout the years, Joe has struggled with forming and maintaining meaningful relationships. He’s made tons of friends and has been involved with plenty of ladies, but things seem to always go south. It’s not to say he’s always at fault - a lot of these people end up being jerks or hurting him. But, at some point, you have to wonder why he has such rotten luck. 

I’ve noticed that Joe is extremely sensitive. Things hit him much harder than it would someone else. For instance, he’s been struggling with our friends being too busy to hang out for different reasons. To him, it means they don’t care about him anymore, but I don’t think that’s true. While they could do better with making time, I understand that jobs, school, and relationships make that hard.

Joe’s the type whose love can be all-consuming. I see it in his hobbies and interests. When he likes hanging out with you, he’ll ALWAYS want to hang out with you. He can make grand plans involving you without you even knowing, like living together or starting a business. But if you turn those opportunities down, he can take it the wrong way. 

He’s struggled with understanding societal rules and social cues all his life, but at some point he became hyper aware of them. The way he rationalizes things can be a bit odd, and I think his hyper awareness can become another source of low self-esteem for him. In order to cope with his emotions, Joe smokes weed a lot, but I think it’s caused him to bury his feelings rather than deal with them. 

It’s tough to write this because I don’t want to make Joe sound unreasonable. Sometimes, it depends on his mood how he reacts to things. And I don’t want to blame a lot of his issues on his mental disorders. When he vents to me, I never try to invalidate his feelings since he’s so used to people doing that throughout his life. 

But I think I’m starting to see how those disorders affect him emotionally without him even realizing it. He’s thinking about moving out of the state or country, feeling like there’s nothing left for him in his hometown since he doesn’t see his friends much. We don’t live in the greatest area, so I support him moving. But I want to make sure he’s doing it for the right reasons. Not because he thinks he’s unloved and all alone. 

There’s way more I could write, but since this is long enough already, I’ll just ask the question - how do I help Joe? Sometimes it feels like an uphill battle making sure he’s okay.",16Nov2020,1

152,"Sounds like a pathetic thing to get down about, I know. But it's even more pathetic when you consider we've been broken up for 8 years. 

The thing is I don't even feel like I miss her, but my brain is harking back to the only reference point it has for when I last felt happy in my life, which was when I got with this ex 12 years ago. 

I am 30 years old now and most of my 20s were spent in a state of depression and social anxiety and loneliness. I've tried treating my neuroticism but nothing works. 

On my 30th birthday, I got a total of 5 happy birthday messages; 2 from my parents, 1 from my partner and 2 from my only 2 friends. 

I was feeling down last night and for some reason, I looked at this ex's Instagram (we haven't talked in years but I have this self-sabotaging habit of viewing her Insta page every few months).

Her page was filled with stories showing happy birthday messages from friends; there must have been 8 or 9 different messages. Stuff like ""best friend"", ""love this girl"", ""let's party in a few weeks"". Her neighbors even bought her some tequila. 

I guess it just reinforced how much of a sad loner I am and what a waste my youth was. It was her 29th birthday so it wasn't even a big birthday like my 30th (for which I did nothing because I don't have enough friends).  

Am I reading too much into these stories? What they conveyed to me on the face of it is someone with lots of friends who care enough to send happy birthday posts on social media. Someone who dumped me by text message after 3 years together yet she coasts through life being happy while I seem to go through continuous suffering.

First I'll say that I was always quiet/shy I never really know what to say to people I don't know well enough, that was a reason for my feelings you'll read about later here.
Since last year I was completely away from any social life, had no friends or partner (never had one but that's another story) there was a reason for this but in retrospect wasn't a good enough reason, at least before covid.
Then this summer I got to the army and the first two months were almost the lowest point of my life, that's what it felt like, I wanted to die every day, wasn't even happy no matter what happened.
But then last week, after I got my post in the army and was there working for a week, something tragic happened in my family and they had to go out of town, so I was alone at home this week, and also in my birthday, and for some reason I feel great.
First day I was home in these circumstances I really felt like everything is going according to plan, I'll have friends and partner, I'll pass this and that thing, like inner peace in movies. I started working out! Even if only a bit.
Now I'm going back to the base, hope I'll still be this positive and to not let this momentum of well-being stop.

All I had to say for now, so I hope we all will feel better soon

Edit: from the moment I arrived to the base I feel really bad, can't really describe it with words, it's like all the hope and motivation I had stayed home and left me in darkness.
I feel completely alone though I have some friends even though they're not close friends but that comes in time. 
Hope it'll get better, if you have any idea of how to feel better right now please help.

I have PTSD, Depression, anxiety and heavy chronic migraines. Generally the usual symptoms that comes with these diagnoses, fatigue, back and neck pain, nausea, loss of appetite, dizzyness etc.. 

Currently on 20mg escitalopram (antidepressant) and 50mg metropolol (for chronic migraines, prescribed by a shitty neurologist that didn't tell me this was going to worsen my depression and basically made me sicker than before). Slowly decreasing metropolol. 
Taking triptanes for migraines and ibuprofen/aspirin. 

Have been to a clinic this year (didn't really help) and will be going another psychiatric hospital soon but maybe someone here has some special advice from personal experience. 
Please keep in mind I have a heavy depression so while I appreciate tips regarding sport, pretty impossible to do for me right now.
I've been to a physiotherapist and currently visiting a ""healer"", I'm very sceptical about her but kinda desperate, she's been recommended by friends.

I went to the doctor last week for it, to see if anything can be done. She suggested that I can try antidepressants.
I am kind of hesitant about it, but considering it. The med in question is citalopram. Another option is wellbutrin, since I strongly suspect I have ADD, though I am still on a waiting list to get that diagnosis.

So. I got a very visualised thought processing. I often portray my thoughts in a visual in my head. Like a scene in a movie or something. In my head i transformed all my dark thoughts, anxiety and depression into a ""evil"" me. Like the worst version of myself. The person i never want to become. Every time i get into a situation, that is awkward for me, uncomfortable or embarrassing, i want to be removed immediatly from this situation/feeling. Just cut out of it. So in my head the ""evil me"" comes up to me and just shots me in the head or sometimes he would beat me down to the ground with a baseball bat. I also often find myself inside a heavy storm which i cant get out of. I think this all started when i had a dream about some person in a dark coat coming up to me and stabbing me like 30 times and i couldn´t do anything about it, because i was laying down on the ground and couldn´t move for some reason. After that the person revealed its face to me. It was another me. He looked right at me and just started laughing like the some insane psycho. Then i saw myself from 3rd person. It was so disturbing seeing myself with 30 knives burried into my lifeless body.

The anxiety that I could push him away with my mental illnesses is still there along with other stupid brain issues. I still think I’m not good enough for him, BUT I believe that he does love me, my personality. I also can trust that he loves me when I’m down and will care for me when I feel alone.

159,"I have not heard about closed-eye hallucinations involving things you were doing, like in my case, designing a website.

But no, it varies. Around last week, when I was messing with 3D modeling, I woke up 2 hours after falling asleep, hallucinating about it upon trying to fall back asleep.

My guess is that, since my mom has been occasionally going to the small parties my neighbors throw (that last beyond bedtime '-_- tho they're not always loud)...

She has to wake me up to open the door for her, because months ago I accidentally broke the key inside the lock. 

And it always happens to be 2 hours after I sleep. 

Now even at days when she doesn't go, I still wake up.

Note: some time ago I was having severe anxiety about random bs as a result of not adding anything meaningful to my life. It's gone now.

163,"The last couple years have been awful. I’m 23 now. My dad left 2-3 years ago. Had his issues, we told him get clean or go. He went. So that was an adjustment. 

Then September of last year, my grandma needed her 3rd heart surgery and we didn’t expect it to go well. She had it in November of 2019, stayed with us until end of January and went home. She’s fine now but that was a lot. 

During that time, in November 2019, I took my dog for his check up and told he had lymphoma and would die in a month. So I worked tirelessly to make extra money and took him for a second opinion and spending hundreds on his meds. Suddenly in January, he was perfectly fine and nobody knows what happened. But he’s here and healthy. 

August of 2020, my father had a heart aneurysm and passed at 46. It’s hard. I never got to talk with him and make things right. It’s just so hard to deal with. My mom was very depressed from it but she’s doing better. My brother is sad but okay. Neither one of them want to talk about him tho, when THATS all I want to do. Remember the good times. 

I started my first full time job in July of this year. Doing what I love. It’s a great job. They let me have 2 weeks off for my dad. They’re honestly a great place. But I can’t get myself to go all the time. I call off once, maybe twice a month. I’m just so tired. Even if I slept. Or I want to cry. I can’t handle this. I feel like I’m using my dad as an excuse. Sometimes that’s why but sometimes I just can’t go to work. I called off at previous jobs too sometimes just because. 

My family judges me anytime I call off. I hate it. They don’t understand just getting up is an accomplishment for me. I just feel lost. And tired. So so tired. I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t think it will ever get better. I’m on medications which definitely helped and improved my life but I think this is the best it’ll ever get.",16Nov2020,1

And here I am, studying for an upcoming test and at the same time dreading having to work again at the end of week.  

Working from home has really become unbearable for me right now. I cannot imagine being home all the time anymore  as I am completely exhausted with this environment (family at home don't exactly create a positive environment either). I don't like my work rn, which is completely opposite to what I had expected, as initially I was quite happy with it. But I am unable to quit it as I need to support my family financially. 

I feel like I'm in a big mess and there's just no hope left and it's drowning me. I can't seem to stay afloat anymore and I have no idea what to do. I cried for straight 3 hours last night and woke up with swollen eyes feeling pathetic as ever.
At regular intervals, I keep having these phases where I lose the purpose of living or the will to keep going.

I have literally no one to talk to who understands this. I wish I had more friends to hang out with and often meet, to maybe gain a different perspective or just clear my head. This has led me to believe that I am lonely and I have noone with whom I can go out and talk to.

166,"For those who’ve gotten diagnosed with PTSD, how were you treated/helped? I haven’t ever gone to the doctor for mental health before, but I have an appointment in a week and the doctor did tell me over our zoom consultation that his screening will be more geared towards depression and PTSD for me (based off of what I’ve told him).

I’m so scared that, if I’m diagnosed with anything, it’ll be PTSD from my trauma and they’ll give me something like pills. Addiction runs in my family and pills have done some nasty stuff to my parents.

167,"I am a very open book and I was thinking what I could do to reach out to others who's never heard of me, well here I am to help give some encouragement. So please sit back and read these words of love, understanding, and courage.

I am a child abuse survivor, for fourteen long years I endured the sexual and physical forms of abuse by the hands of my adoptive mother and a babysitter who was form my church. I had no safe place, I dealt with being bullied at school and would subconsciously scream at the fact I'll be going to house that was very close to killing me. My adoptive mother was a very religious woman who moved to St. Louis from Mississippi during the 60s to escape the events in the south. My adoptive mother never really spoke on my biological mother until I was around the age of thirteen, that was when she finally told me of being adopted, so for all that time I was lead to believe that my adoptive mother was my biological mother. The age of thirteen to fourteen was the worst three hundred and sixty-five days I've ever experienced. My was beaten, pistol whipped, among other things. When I turned fourteen I was at my end, I contemplated one end result, I wanted the last laugh but I couldn't. I packed some stuff in my school backpack and knew I would runaway from home, I felt that if I failed at running away then that's it. . .I am done. 

But no, as I opened the front door of the house while my adoptive mother was in her room napping the summer sun hit me in the face so hard because I wasn't allowed to leave the house often unless going to school. My friends asked what I was doing as I silently tried to hide my tears from them, as they approached I began to jog as to avoid them from seeing my fear and pain. I simply couldn't let them that I survived being abused right under their noses.

Lastly I leave you all with this: We fight unseen demons daily, some of us hide and cry, some hold it in until its too late. When you feel as if you are no longer viable, when you feel like all you do is for nothing I can tell you that is so far from the truth. I found poetry and became published. We all have the option to take our pain and tears and blood and turn those into stories of inspiration. Failure is not sitting in a bathroom at work crying because an even from ten years ago still haunts, no, my friend that is simply a form of strength. When we cry and then wipe away the tears THAT is strength, THAT is courage. Failure is when we simply do not cry or acknowledge that WE are not okay. It is okay to not be okay, it is okay to cry and dust yourself so you can take those tears, give them to another so they too can ""keep on keeping on."" You see, when we cry and speak on those tears to another human we are in essence giving a piece of our strong selves to another in hopes we passed on that light of strength and courage. Never give up, always know that every tear that falls is the real liquid strength, and every breath you and I and WE take. . .WE are worth every lung full.",16Nov2020,2
168,"I don't know where else to post this so I'll just ask here. I hope it's not off topic.

I'm extremely sensitive when it comes to opinions. My interests and views are often dictated by what other people think and I don't know what is causing this. In the past I used to be pretty thick skinned and It was easy for me to ignore other people's opinions but now whenever someone challenges my views, I instantly crumble and retreat back into my shell where I start questioning myself. It's driving my fucking insane and I don't know how to stop it.

Here's a simple example. I recently discovered a popular youtuber and I've started to like them (both them and their content). But I see a lot of people hating on this person and criticizing them (for no reason; they haven't done anything wrong). Each comment I read makes me wonder if I'm stupid for liking this creator. It's dumb, right? i know it is, but it's seriously ruining my days. I keep thinking things like what if those people are objectively right and I'm just wasting my time supporting someone who's nothing special (and creates nothing special)? I keep trying to justify my interest with solid arguments, so basically I'm arguing with myself. This is just one example. I feel this need to justify and validate my opinions and explain why I enjoy what I enjoy, or why I think the way I do about certain things. Sometimes I come up with logical and sensible explanations to end my inner arguments and then my mind goes  ""Yeah but what if you're actually wrong and you're just lying to yourself to calm yourself down? what if everyone else is right?"" I hate that I'm so fragile and sensitive but I can't help it. Whenever someone opposes my opinions I become paranoid and start thinking that I'm deluding myself and everyone else who disagrees with me is right. In order to justify my beliefs I keep trying to find an objective measurement by comparing everything. It's giving me headache. It's ruining my mood and it makes me feel super shitty. How do I stop caring about what people think? How do I stop giving a fuck about ""objectivity""? I want to enjoy things without worrying about the quality of what I'm enjoying. 

Sorry this is long. I hope it makes sense.",16Nov2020,1

170,"So, growing up I was always the outcast. I had  serious diagnosed OCD in 4th grade which resulted in me being bullied and such. The problem was extremely severe and led to multiple confrontations with the police, professional help, multiple suicide attempts, and medication. I don't want to regale you with details but it was bad. This experience really messed me up. I knew I was different and abnormal compared to everyone else. My schoolmates certainly treated me better after I solved the issue, but I always knew I was second tier. If someone had to leave the lunch table it was always me. As a result of feeling like an outcast I never really got involved in a lot of stuff other kids did. So, my best friend dated the girl I had a crush on and I was fine with that cause I didn't intend to date. This sorta mentality embedded itself in me. It resulted in me being reclusive in high school. As a result I never did a lot of stuff other kids did. For reference, my high school famously had a drug problem yet I was never even offered anything. Lots of kids hooked up, but I never did. I'm 19 years old and I still haven't had my first kiss. I googled it. You know how many college freshman have lost virginity? 70%. You know when most people have their first kiss? 13-15. I'm in the minority in both of those figures. I am once again abnormal. How can I be interesting to people when everyone else has done more interesting stuff with their lives? Why would anyone want to talk to me when they can talk to someone who has interesting stories about how the cops busted their alcohol infused high school party or whatever. I'm just fundamentally less interesting. 

Now, you may say: ""this is easy, if you feel too innocent compared to everyone, just go be not innocent"". Well here's the thing. Last night a bunch of my friends got together. I didn't find out until later was only get to hang with them for like an hour. They were together for several hours. I never get invited to shit I have to go over to their side of the dorm floor and invite myself. I constantly feel like a burden. I feel u welcome. This isn't a one time thing, it's happened a lot where I miss out on stuff. I can't do non innocent stuff alone, that's just sad. But if those people don't want me what do I do? Franky, what I want most in the world rn is to feel accepted by those people, but I just don't feel it. IDK how much this is self hate, ocd, or real. I want to sit down and talk to one of them and get them to be real with me and tell me what fears are justified and what ones aren't but frankly that seems wimpy and weak right?

I also have a very strong tendency to beat myself up over the slighest mistake. I beat myself up because I haven't done drugs but it i did do them I'd beat myself up cause I funded cartel violence. If I ask out a girl I'll beat myself cause I'll accuse myself of just doing it cause you felt like you should've done it by age 19 and don't actually want to be in a relationship. If I don't do it I beat myself up because I haven't done it by age 19. Then add onto thks the convene that a lot of what I'm insecure about reads like an incel wrote it so I'm worried that I'm misogynistic and bigoted at my core. This goes against all my values and so on top of all of this I'm worried I'm secretly a terrible person. There's no winning. I feel abnormal, different, and weird compared to everyone else and honestly I really hate myself for it. I haven't talked about these problems with people close to me because I would look weird and that's not what I want. At the same time, I worry that by not talking about it I am being unhealthy. And of course, all this worrying makes me anxious that I'm being too sensitive and not manly. Hell I beat myself up for a week cause I listened to a taylor swift song. I know that's stupid, but I still did it. So I came to you all. How do I stop hating myself and how do I stop being so insecure?

Occasionally when alone, my brain will make up social scenarios about being falsely told off by strangers, and being accused of things that never happened, such as pushing in line, planning to rob someone,  or other social etiquette. My brain starts to get angry, even though they didn't happen and it's all made up by my my own head.

182,"Hi all! So I recently offered to be a friend to high school students who struggle with their mental health! I got messaged by a user whose name I won't reveal. I was originally very sympathetic to her. This is what she told me and what I pieced together from our messages and her previous Reddit posts.

**TW: Abandonment, sexual abuse**

\- She's 10 years old, and she used to live in Mexico City.

\- She was kicked out by her adoptive parents today because she came out as a lesbian.

\- She said that she is disabled because she was in a car crash when she was 5. (however, when I asked her, the date changed to when she was 4.) She uses a wheelchair, but it's broken and she said she is currently dragging herself on the side of the road.

\- Her biological parents died in that car crash, and her adoptive parents were sexually and emotionally abusive towards her

\- She is suicidal, has depression, but her adoptive parents deny her the medication.

I originally was very sympathetic, because that sounds terrible. Nobody deserves to be in that situation. I asked her for some more info.

\- She said that she was outside by a highway, and she was near a frozen pond.

Now this made me suspicious. I searched up the weather near Mexico City, and it's currently 51 degrees Fahrenheit, nowhere near freezing. Furthermore, the weather is projected to get up to 71 degrees Fahrenheit.

\- She said that she was abandoned by her parents on the highway. The police found her and asked for her parent's address. The police then left her on the side of the highway and returned to the city to arrest her parents.

This is highly suspicious to me. I've never been to Mexico, but I'm pretty sure it's illegal to leave an abandoned 10-year old by herself on the highway. I confirmed that the law protects children. I also found it suspicious that her parents were arrested for abusing her, but she wasn't taken in by protective services.

\- She said that she was using her phone to use Reddit, and she had a solar charger with her.

This also made me suspicious. I found it unlikely that a 10-year-old child who was abused by her parents would have her own phone and a solar charger. Heck, even my brother who is 13 and lives happily doesn't have a phone.

\- I gave her the child support services number for Mexico city, but she said it was blocked. Then I gave her the suicide hotline number, but she said that that was also blocked.

Also suspicious.

\- I asked her to call 911 and explain her situation. She said that she had called 911 before, but the police didn't care. They had left her. I then asked her to call the police again and explain her situation. Less than 20 seconds after I asked this, she said that she had called the police and explained, but the police thought she was a scammer and hung up.

I don't know about you, but I can't fit all of that into a 20-second phone call. (However when questioned, she said that she had been ""calling the police for a while now"")

\- I asked her what phone she was using, she said an old iphone she had gotten in 2007. I asked her what model, and she said it was iPhone 4.

Now I googled the release date of iPhone 4, and it's in 2010. Furthermore, this person somehow forgot that she is supposed to be 10 years old. She wasn't alive in 2007. Also, iPhones are expensive. Why would her abusive parents buy her such an expensive device at 10 years old?

\- She also said that she was around and ""hour's walk away from the border.""

This sounds ridiculous. From Mexico City to the closest point in the U.S, it's almost 1000 kilometers. There is no way she could have ""dragged"" herself almost 1000 kilometers in this short period of time.

\- I asked her what the time was where she is. She says her parents ""drove her across a timezone and her phone didn't update"".

Suspicious, since her phone obviously has wifi to access Reddit, but it didn't change the time somehow.

\- Then she mentioned that she was born with no legs as a result of a birth defect, but in one of her earlier Reddit posts, she said that she had lost her legs during the car crash. When asked about this, she claimed that she had lost her prosthetics in the car crash.

There were many inconsistencies like this, and I'm reasonably sure that she is trying to trick me. I might add that all this information was obtained by lots of questioning. She would only reveal tiny bits and pieces about herself at a time. Furthermore, she is supposed to be 10. Her grammar and texting skills don't sound like a 10-year-old. They sound like a teenager or an adult pretending to be a teen.

So in the end, I'm don't think this is real. If this is true, then I'm disgusted. I was eager to help her because mental health is so important. She played the ""I'm suicidal"" card to trick me. Seh repeatedly said, ""we'll then I'll just kill myself"". Not I'm not saying that she isn't suicidal, but she is obviously fabricating her life to gain attention. If you're reading this, then you know who you are. Don't do this. It doesn't help anybody, least of all yourself. If you need anything, please just let people know truthfully. You don't have to make up tragic circumstances to make yourself seem better. I hope you'll be okay!",16Nov2020,2

It was a bad anxiety period for me, but I was able to pick myself up along the way somehow and realigned my plans and goals for the future. Now, I can’t seem to see the point of moving forward. Even with goals and ambitions that I have for myself and promised to work on them, one day I woke up feeling abnormally lighter (in burden) and ready to let go of this living absurdity. I don’t see the future anymore. Most of the time, I feel empty. Even with the stimulus I have around me (work and school), my brain wants me not to function anymore. And I would find myself spacing out often and not feel anything. It would take a whole lot of energy to get myself back on the daily track, but I still find myself falling into the void of just feeling empty. 

And all of a sudden, intense emotions would come in and they can get very overwhelming. These episodes would last for a good 30 minutes or longer especially when there’s a trigger (for example, being reminded of a one-sided feeling I have for someone). Having the emotions would make me feel sick from the torso up to the head. I would describe them as painful (not physically, I can’t seem to describe them well), sad and there’s always a tight feeling on my chest. On bad days, especially when they’re too intense, my body would suddenly act and I would slam my arms against the wall to keep myself from lingering on those thoughts and emotions. After that, I feel empty again.

I don’t understand myself. I don’t understand what I’m feeling. I’ve been drowning myself with cigarettes and alcohol to numb down intense emotions or sometimes even to just feel something. I really don’t understand what’s happening.",16Nov2020,2
186,"I am on model, this is my first post and I am not in the best mental state so I am so sorry if this is full of me rambling. If you need more examples of what I went through like the abuse and bullying I’ll try to give more but some like the sexual assaults are so painful to go into detail in.


I am an abuse victim. From k-2 grade I was abused by my school and developed issues in my social skills and mental health which was already strained after suffering from severe ADHD. After I was bullied and harassed until 9th grade. I was physically, emotionally, and mentally abused by the school and then was bullied physically, mentally, emotionally, and sexually and was attacked while the following schools looked by.

Every day I would watch Chima and LEGO Ninjago and it’s got me through the rough times. I had many toys that helped me get by and my brother would play with me. I know I am so fucked up for getting attached with the toys that I played with during my abuse and while I was being bullied. My family threw my toys away without my knowledge after I left many at my grandma’s, I trusted her not to get rid of them.

It’s sounds so childish as a 16 year old but they really did get me by even when I was thinking of ending myself at 10 years old.

I will never get those sets back and it was my dream to pass them to my children so that they could find happiness in the same toys that helped me through the darkest times. Now I feel like I lost a huge piece of me and lost trust in my grandmother.

I know it is so embarrassing that I am so attached but it really hurts and my depression which has gotten better is now really bad. It’s so painful and I feel so alone.

I lost my webkinz that I would cuddle with after a long day of being yelled at and hit and the toys that I had when my family had to leave me to go to another state to stay with my brother who had cancer at the time. They were with me for the darkest of times.

I am still in so much metal pain, I often pick at myself and turn to self destructive habits which have now worsened. For my grandmother to discard things that helped me so much just puts salt in the wounds. I know it’s been a decade since my abuse started and 8 years since it stopped but my bullying and harassment stoped a little over a year ago but it hurt so much, how so many adults watched me suffer and many tried to gaslight me.

In this troubling time it’s even harder because I don’t have my friends or soccer which helped me so much especially since I found a new friend group that didn’t use me and gaslight me. I have so much trouble trusting adults because of my past. After years I suffered in silence, unable to process what happened for so long and never able to get justice even after being sexually assaulted in 8th grade and then being gaslighted by my school.

Yes I live in an upper middle class white family but my father who is loving can get angry and really hurt me but he no longer hurts me nearly as bad as he use to do and has gotten much better, trying not to hit us anymore but he wasn’t like that during the time I was abused. My family loves me but only my brother understands me. He also has an attachment to his toys but his weren’t thrown away like mine were.

My brother is older than I am, 20 and his is a male while I am a female. He to went to the abusive school but my parents pulled him out long before they did for me because they thought it would be easier for me to stay and finish up my last year there while my brother was pulled out.

With my brother gone the school focused on just me as they went after both of us because we both have mental illnesses that we were born with and they didn’t follow their own rules and marketing, teaching us wrong and not caring for us properly which my parents called them out on which caused them to target us. It was just me there and they would do whatever it took to go after me.

My days would consist of going to school we’re kids would hurt and yell at me along with the teachers. I was hit and smack for getting things wrong even though I was special needs and they didn’t help me. I was isolated, being forced to sit alone in a room for hours if I didn’t trace where I was reading with my finger. Every day I was embarrassed in front of my classmates and like my three other schools that went from 3rd to 8th grade I couldn’t defend myself. They could call me all types of names and if I say one thing that is remotely mean like telling them to buss off I get into all sorts of trouble.

After a long day of just being abused physically, mentally, and emotionally along with being bullied, harassed and isolated I would just watch Chima or LEGO Ninjago with my brother and we would play with each other and it was cheered me up. 

Those toys were everything to me, my light in the darkness. No matter what I went through I had them. I wanted to see my children play with them, to see my toys bring them joy like they did for me.

I would look at my legos, just hold them and feel better or with my other toys. Each one had helped me so much and I always got really attached to them, even if I started to not play with them so much just knowing I still had them felt better. They were my friends and up to 9th grade all my friends abandoned me, often tiring to my bullies and started to bully me or just ignored me, some even gaslighted me because they wanted to be friends with the cool kids.

It’s easier to befriend objects because they can’t stab you in the back and we’re always there for you and losing them hurts so much. I always felt so helpless at school but toys were my escape, with legos I could build worlds that didn’t hurt me, were I had stuffed animals that brought me warmth and a feeling of love.

It’s not like I wanted to be born with severe ADHD but I was and for that I was subjected to the cruelty adults and kids, teachers and students, people who were suppose to take care of me and for me to trust and kids who were suppose to be my friends. Yes I wasn’t the best sociably, I was energetic and hyper, I was still having my medication sort out so I had so much trouble focusing, and I still do. I don’t take so well to certain social cues but for others I do. Yes I see why I was bullied by students but for my teachers to start the conflicts or just watch was so damaging.

I lost my comfort items and yes I had so many toys but I was so attached to them all. Yes I know I am so fucked up in the head and that losing your toys isn’t a big deal but they were special to me, they brought me so much joy.  I know I am over reacting, that being so depressed and hurt, feeling so betrayed over toys must really seem so stupid. Just please keep in mind that only until recently I had good friends and it didn’t last long since I can’t see them do to Covid. I live y family but I can’t look at my grandmother right now. This whole situation is fucked up and I know I’m fucked up just getting upset over this but I really just don’t know what to do, these are my feelings.

Please if anyone has any advise I need it.",16Nov2020,2

Some days I get hit hard with sadness and just want to go somewhere and cry.

196,"Hello, on this profile I want to share my story with the world. This is my first post here on reddit, and I decided to post this today,because I've been feeling really unwell lately and am gonna have a second stationary treatment in the next months, and after that I'm gonna have to live in a boarding school (I'm sorry for my bad english, I live in germany).In the start of April this year I was in an adolescent psychatrie for three months, because of depression, anxiety disorder, social anxiety,panic attacks,attachment disorder and a couple more things I'm too lazy to translate or can't remember. In 3 months I wasn't allowed to go home even once, and visits were only 1 person every 2 weeks for half an hour (corona). Well either way, it didn't help. I just got the feeling it got worse, but it helped a few people I got to know there, so everyone is different. I'm already taking therapy for 2 years, but since 2 years I got much worse, and I think no 1-or-2-hours-a-week therapy will help. I honestly don't think another clinic will help either, but because I don't visit school regularly, there is no other way. My family(mother, lil brother,little sister)isn't really helpful either, even though they support me. For example, my mother told me earlier that she doesn't know if I will be able to visit home( boarding school will probably be a few hours away from home)from boarding school, because our father only takes us every 2 weeks, and she wants to go hiking when my siblings are gone, so I can probably only visit really rarely. I was really mad after hearing that, I mean my mother already knows I'm not feeling well and still has to say stuff like ""when you're gone we can use your room as sports room, or I can have a new baby""(she literally said that, lol.) I feel a little cast out of the family, and I'm a little scared of a second psychatrie. That's it for now, thank you for reading all of this crap (I've got loads more tho)  ( ;  do you have any positive with mental clinics (well I don't have many)",16Nov2020,2

198,"People find absolutely hilarious that Kanye west clearly had a psychotic breakdown in the media and was off his bi-polar medication. Yes, depression is a serious mental illness and if left un treated it will more than likely end in suicide or an attempt. However, other mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and bi-polar that are not talked about. There is such as stigma around mental illnesses because people automatically assume that the individuals involved are violent and aggressive when in actual fact that is not the case at all. All people who suffer from any form of mental illness have that risk of committing suicide not just depression. For the individuals to get the the point that they feel like suicide is the only option, they feel that the world will be better off around them even if they have family, friends etc around them. Shouting a people who feel this way and judging them will not help them at all in fact it will probably make things worse. But because no one can see the many different mental illnesses, people don’t accept it. People see the effects mental health has but the ignorance is still there and the individuals are judged based on it. People are so quick to judge someone for their actions but never bother to get the facts of why they behave in the way that they do. 
I work daily with people who have personally disorders and various forms or schizophrenia and they are all absolutely lovely. A young girl, who I work with, told me that she doesn’t tell many people that suffers from paranoid schizophrenia because people in the past have judged her heavily and assume she’s violent because of the stigma shown throughout the media and television. This lady in particular is the friendliest, bubbly person I have had the pleasure of supporting. When she told me this, my heart sank because she’s right but in the 21st century this shouldn’t be acceptable!

200,"Expectations. We All Have Them. For ourself, from others. Why? How? What? When?

I have begun to learn that expectations that I create for myself and from others usually end up with feeling anxious, vulnerable, stressed and in a state of being and mind that isn't who I am meant to be. Its needed though for the time being.

Its allowing me to learn that as long as I am feeling good about whatever I am pursuing then thats all that matters. If I do something without receiving it back from someone else and feel stressed from that, than what I was doing initially was with a subconscious expectation in the future which is not a genuine action. I am Human. I am Learning. I am Healing.

The Best that can be done each day is simply that. These times we have been inside has been realigning, filled with many ups, many downs and everything in between. I am grateful.  
I learned the other day that God, Higher Power, The Universe wants us to Shine but doesn't care about the struggle we have to go through to get there, which to me........is so powerful and eye opening. The Shine and the Blooming has to have to many, many moments of struggles because it is preparing me for whats to come by living in the present, in the Now. Embrace. It. All. Its all Divine. Its all Valid. Its all Meant to Be. For Myself and for You. For Us.

Continue to do your best today. Continue to Hold Faith. Continue to Trust. God and the Universe isn't finished with us sister. Everyones time comes, usually which exceeds our own expectations that we set out to accomplish.

Everything is ok. Everything is happening for the Best.

I love you.

201,"Okay so, I'm a 22 year old guy, since the age of 13 I've watched quite a lot of porn and been masturbating since then too. About 5 months ago I started seeing this girl, we've since been dating and I am so crazy about her. I love her so much, she truly means the world to me, we're open about everything she's gorgeous and she cares about me, she is my first lover, I want to feel like I do now with her, forever.

Since starting dating her my porn intake has gone down massively. But recently I find myself looking at girls in public and thinking ""oh she has a nice ass"" or ""oh she's pretty"" etc. This in combination with the couple of times I've looked at stuff online, has PLAGUED me with guilt and anxiety. My gf has never even said to me that I need to stop watching it or it's over if I don't stop. (Not anything like that, she's not like that) I'm very open to her and tell her everything. She sees that I'm doing my best to watch less porn (it's mostly just girls with big tits, softcore type shit or like those overly provocative instagram pages) and loves me so much for it. She sees I'm trying to change, not even for her but for us and for me myself.

My question is, has anyone else gone through something like this, this gorgeous, beuatiful and kind caring, understanding girl has made me think differently about porn and about how I  view ""sexiness"" in general. I want her to be my only means by which I get off (for the most part she has been). But I feel like shit when I slip up and look up some sexy girl, and then I tell her and she gets so confused. I beat myself up for having passing, fleeting moments of finding someone else attractive, either in real life or online. She doesn't even ever ask me if I'm looking at her, or if I think she's hot etc.... I just over analyse it and it rips me apart

I just love her so much and I get super anxious anytime porn (which was a very very common part of my life before I met her and at times during our relationship too) enters my mind or anything.

Please help a confused boy out many thanks in advance.",16Nov2020,1
202,"I'm in my second year of college right now, and while I've had a constant dread of the future for a while now, it's really starting to crush me.

It just seems like adult life has no actual redeeming qualities? or at least not in my case.

Art, specifically illustration and character art, is what I love. (see my profile picture) 

But of course, illustration is not an easy job, and you're constantly going to be faced with people who are better than you, who'll do it for less. And if I were to become, say, a comic artist... my god, I can't even imagine the stress. 

So instead, I'm majoring in graphic design. Lots of the skills transfer, and it comes fairly easily to me (for the most part). But it isn't nearly as enjoyable, and trying to get projects done is an uphill battle against my focus.

So unless I got stupidly lucky, I wouldn't get a job I actually wanted. Granted, it would still be something I'm good at, but I can't imagine myself looking forward to it.

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm aro/ace, and DEFINITELY not interested in having a family, so that's something else I don't have to look forward to.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an introvert with social anxiety, and a very tiny circle of (nerdy) friends, so other than d&amp;d night, I'm not exactly going to many parties, or even getting out all that often.

&amp;#x200B;

And I also have a ludicrous list of health problems (ADD, scoliosis, and my liver is just ITCHING to fail, just to name a few) which I have to take 16 or so pills a day for, which I loathe with every fiber of my being, and am not looking forward to a life full of this.

&amp;#x200B;

The only good thing I can think of about adult life is I get to live by myself, but even then, I would have to deal with rent, and it's mostly ""good"" in the sense that I can finally just.... destroy myself in peace.

To be clear, I don't mean suicide. I don't necessarily *want* to die, and I definitely wouldn't have the balls to do it myself. I suppose, to put it in perspective, if I was going to be hit by a car, I'd try to get out of the way, but if it hit me anyway, I'd be SPRINTING to the light.

What I mean by destroying myself though, is I literally do not care enough to take care of myself. I'll brush my teeth, and take a shower when my hair itches, but I have a habit of accidentally skipping meals, not eating when I'm hungry (eating feels like a chore), and my sleep schedule is beyond fucked, even when we aren't in a lockdown. I skip almost all of my pills if I can get away with it (though I never miss my ADD meds) because a lot of them feel unnecessary 

&amp;#x200B;

But can anybody tell me what there is to look forward to? And not just vague things like ""oh it gets better"". it seems like pretty much nothing but stress and monotony.",16Nov2020,1

205,"Sorry in advance for typos and if this isn’t worded the best. 

I’m trying to trace where/when/what triggered my ptsd. While I don’t consider this situation traumatic, it still doesn’t sit with me well. When I was in grade school (new school, math class) I could never pay proper attention. The teacher called in my parents, who told him what I told them, I had learned everything they had the year before. Idk how it happened but the new school seemed to be teaching at a far slower rate or my old one was far ahead. Either way I wasn’t lying, I did know the material, but I did promise to behave. One day after he hands back a test, he begins to lecture the class about how they need to try harder, that the material was easy, and that I had performed better than the class on a harder test! He had given me a different test than the rest of the class, I didn’t even know until that moment.

As I type it out I felt used, I was made an example. I don’t remember much else of that day, that moment of being called out always bugged me though. I’m wondering if that’s where my anxiety of tests came from. Part of me thinks I’m reading too much into it. Opinions?",16Nov2020,1

207,"The heading I gave this is my best description for how I feel. I just do not feel right. I cannot pinpoint exactly when this started, I can only realize that it has gotten worse over time. My first experience with this feeling occurred my freshman year of college. I remember being rather drunk and becoming very agitated with something my gf at the time had done and just felt this overwhelming feeling of sadness, not wanting to hurt myself, but just not wanting to be alive. 

I am 22 years old now and every so often I go through phases of these ""funks"". I feel like I am not doing what I am supposed to be doing and that my life will ultimately amount to nothing. Other times I feel like an absolute king. My confidence will be high and I will be extremely motivated and other times I do not even want to get out of bed. I am in one of those funks currently and rather than tell my life story (which is not trauma filled or bad in any way) I will try and convey exactly how I am feeling in this present moment. 

I feel like life is pointless. I feel like everything happening around me is pointless. I cannot figure out if I am being dramatic, nihilistic, or I am completely right and there is literally no point to any of this because less than 100 years from now no one will remember who I am because I am not a genius, I am not going to be the president, and I am not sure that there is anything I will do for that sort of notoriety. I cant figure out if my expectations for myself are too high or if I think that everyone around me has high expectations that I cannot meet. I am so young but I cannot shake this feeling that I am doing something wrong with my life and I am a failure.

Now, I am not approaching this without really trying to understand why I may be feeling this way because I tend to come from a place of logic. So, right now, I think I have too much on my plate. I am the busiest I have ever been in my life and I think I need to give some things up right now so I can focus my attention on one thing at a time while incorporating some healthy habits into my life. I used to workout 5 days a week and now I have worked out twice in two months because I absolutely do not have the time. I work all day everyday 8AM to 12AM. Furthermore, I do not think I am mentally built to drink alcohol. It brings this feeling on far more intensely and I think that this would not continue if I gave up drinking. Lastly, I am newly single and have become so used to always having a gf that it is very hard for me to spend time with myself. I get extremely lonely and these feelings all compound on top of that which makes it even more difficult. 

This is really just me wanting to vent and get these things off my chest and into words. If you can relate please share your experience and some healthy habits of yours. Maybe Ill keep up with this post and share whatever transformation I experience in coming months as I take some things off my plate and get back to my healthy habits",16Nov2020,3
208,"Hi guys. Just had this moment of reflection while I was doing the dishes. Thought I’ll share this with you, maybe someone needs to hear it. 
I’m not gonna go into too much depth with my story, but the main thing is that I was severely depressed about 3 years ago. I was struggling with depression for most of my life by at that time I was definitely at my lowest. Constant suicidal thought, self harm, and dissociating. Zombies have more brain function that I did at the time. Anyway, because of how I was feeling my house was a mess. Like, a total mess. A tip. Never done any grocery shopping. Never did the dishes. It smelled so bad. Didn’t do the cat litter tray. You can imagine. Anyway, since I’ve been starting to get better at the begging of this year I notice things. And one of them is that I AM ACTUALLY DOING THINGS. It used to just be a thougt “I will take the bins out” and then I’d proceed to sit on my chair and stare out the window for hours until it’s bed time. And now it’s just a... simple process. I get the thought “I will take the bins out” and before that thought is fully acknowledged by my brain I’m already by the bin outside throwing the bing bag away. I watch TV, “dancing seems like a lot of fun” next thing I know I’m doing a dance class on YouTube. 
Guys... I only start noticing how unwell I was. And like I said, I’ve been feeling ok for about 10 months now and I am shocked by things I discover now. Recovery is SOOOOO worth the hard work that goes into it. Please go get help. Please start working on yourself. Please please please. As hard, painful, horrible and soul destroying this journey can be I still think it’s the most beautiful and amazing thing to do, it’s a lifelong investment and Jesus Christ I wish I had done it earlier and I wish I could just do something to give people that hope and that but of motivation so they can start their recovery too and I just... I’m speechless. 
Anyway. That’s it. Hope you’re all ok you beautiful people ❤️",16Nov2020,3
209,"Ive wanted to get into acting since reception, but no one thought I liked it. i was A,ways outshone by two other kids in my year (One of them is now with an agency). I’ve decided this year (age 13) to get my life together and apply for an agency. I’m going to send in my application the day before my birthday (because that would mean I send it in on a Sunday). I felt quite good about myself for the first time in about a year.

in dance at school today, we had to be in groups of four, I was with my girlfriend (one if the kids that always outshone me), my school friend, and my ‘acquaintance’ as she puts it. We had to make a dance that represents 5 Emotions, including expressive faces. Me and my girlfriend were happy about this, because of our love of acting. We tried really hard to make our parts work, and she was anger And I was fear. She fake punched me, and I rolled away. That was the start of the dance.

after we practiced, the class had to sit down and put our hands up if we wanted to perform to the class. My gf out her hand up, and my ‘acquaintance‘ (who I swear hates me btw, she annoyed me in computer science, then said it was ‘deliberate and for affection’) got cross and made her out her hand down. Then when it came to being asked again, I asked why my gf didn’t put her hand up, and she said she didn’t want to Perform. I jokingly said ‘why!? You spend hakf your life performing’.

One thing I've noticed since working from home is that my patience wears thin more easily compared to when we had to got to the office.

211,"I'll try to keep it short.

When I was 18 I started a relationship with a guy that later turned out to be emotionally abusive. That was nine years ago and we split up after two years. I'm pretty much over that and thought I had processed it quite well. I can talk to people about him and recently even saw a picture of him without any emotional reaction.  

The thing is that not only was he kinda toxic, his mother was as well. She was often two-faced (nice to me but complaining about me to her son all the time) and demanding. To give an example: my ex was on a buisness trip for six weeks out of the country and when he came back and I visited him, the first thing he said was how disappointed his parents were that I didn't visit them once in those six weeks. I have to say that in those six weeks I moved to another city, began college, even was homeless for a week and rarely saw my own parents.

Now to the trigger:

One day I was at his place (he still lived with his parents) and during cooking I broke a plate. It wasn't fine china or anything overly expensive, just something from Villeroy and Boch that isn't being produced any more. His mother first told me that's okay and mistakes happen, but a day later he told me his mum was furious and demanded I buy her a new plate or give her the money to do so. I didn't and she acted all passive aggressive for a few days before switching back to overly nice. I forgot about that until today.  

Today while browsing our country's version of craigslist I saw such a plate and it almost caused me to have a panic attack. I couldn't breathe normally any more, started crying and my heart was racing.

Or if I’m simply hearing someone speak, I have to count what THEY said on my fingers. I feel immensely satisfied if the sentence ends on seven or ten words. Also, while watching movies or series if a character says something in particular, I HAVE to repeat what they’ve said out loud more than once until it feels right and restart the scene afterwards (counting the words in their dialogue on my fingers as well).

So my sister with mental illness in Northern Virginia will probably be divorced by her husband soon.  He was active duty, but tricare will cover for 1 year post divorce.

Anyway, I would like to understand how I can plan for her to be covered for inpatient care that is inevitable for her to need.  

I do not want the cops picking her up again and dropping her off at a mental health facility and the insurance coverage beancounters at the mental health facility kicking her to the curb prematurely bc she doesn’t have coverage.

219,"There were two dogs, two small dogs, running in the road. We were maybe 3 minutes into a 3 hour long drive. We barely made it down the road. They were running in the road, they looked well cared for, and they definitely didn't understand that roads were dangerous. I think they got out of a loving home, escaped by accident. Only one had a collar, the other probably slipped out. They looked bonded, practically attached at the hip. I skidded to a stop just before hitting one, it was dark and the dog was black. We were on a hill, I saw lights coming over the hill and everything went in slow motion. The one dog ran into the other lane, the other ran back to safety off the road.  I honked my horn and flashed my lights but it was no use, the car was going too fast. I watched the dog get hit, no one else in the car saw. I saw it die instantly, frozen stiff from brain damage.I cant get the image of its face, the light leaving its eyes, out of my head. I saw it bounce off the road before landing flat, dead. I panicked, I thought maybe I could save it, I wanted to believe. I whipped into the driveway but forgot my car is stick and I didnt have the brake up. The car rolled back into traffic and I barely made it back to it before it hit another car.  I feel terrible for endangering my passengers like that. I should have known better. I pulled the car back into that driveway, pulled up the brake, but saw the other dog running into the road again. I chased that dog instead, trying to catch it because it had the collar, but it ran too fast and wouldnt come when I stopped and crouched down. It kept trying to run back to the dead dog. Eventually that dog disappeared. I had to run back to the car and my boyfriend helped me get a towel from the back. I got the dead dog off the road and wrapped it up. I can still feel the weight in my arms and hear the blood dripping on the ground and onto my feet. The owners of the house we pulled into wanted us out of the driveway so we pulled into a church across the road, there wasnt anywhere else to go. I just wanted to get the body to the owners, to give the dog a peaceful death and the owners some peace of mind that they at least knew what happened. I called the non-emergency line for the police but they said there wasnt much they could do. I had to be somewhere and I was already late and they wouldn't be able to get the body until the morning, and I know they wouldn't have found the owner, probably couldn't have, there were so many houses and the other dog didn't run to any specific one. So they told me to leave the body by the road. I had to leave it for the animals and flies to eat it. I had nothing else I could do. So I left it somewhere it wouldn't be seen by children and somewhere that it hopefully wouldn't be disturbed by animals and I told the operator exactly where I put it. I doubt they'll go get it. I feel sick just thinking about it. I can't hold my own dog, shes around the same size. The picture just keepa getting stuck in my head, I can't unsee it. I feel both sick and sad and horrible but I also feel nothing at all. Seeing that was the breaking point to an already bad day and now I don't know if I can forget how helpless I was to save it and how I couldn't even give it a peaceful feath, I couldn't do anything.

I've been in what I think is an existential crisis for, like, a year and a half or more. At the beginning, I had no idea what to do and was completely lost. Since then, I now know what I need to do, I have the answers, but I'm still completely lost. I'm at the point where I tell my therpist how I feel, he tells me what I need to do to help myself, I say ""I know""...and that's it. I know what my problem is. I know what's causing it, I know that I need to just do X, Y and Z in order to move forward...But I don't want to. Where before I was motivated by this internal desire to content, to find meaning in life, to be better - now I just don't care. And I haven't cared for a while. The idea of being happy seems so impossibly far away that I find it ridiculous that I ever thought it was attainable for me. I can't believe I was ever naive enough to want to be happy. Because now I know that I will always fail. Even if I try to stay motivated, I am designed to give up. I do not respond to stress with perserverance. I respond to stress by curling up into a ball and ignoring it. I was diagnosed with mild anxiety at a young age, but I honestly can't remember the last time I felt anxious. Now I just feel, I dont know, nothing? I've made myself so comfortable with failure that I no longer care about succeeding. And no one can help me. I know that. No one can make me want to be happy. No one can make me feel motivated. It's my decision. And I cannot see myself making that decision. So what do I do? Kill myself?That seems like the logical decision. I'm not happy, no one can make me happy, I can't make me happy. So my choice is either get up off my ass and do something with my life, or get up off my ass and kill myself already. I don't see myself doing either. So I'm stuck here, destined to whine and complain about my easy ass life while doing nothing to improve it.

222,"I have a low tolerance for people and I want this to stop. Lately, I think this low tolerance comes from my technology-based habits of surfing the web, playing video games, reading up on stuff, etc., which has made my already extreme introversion more addicting. Growing up, I was always an extremely shy and introverted kid who hated interacting with people. Because of this, I become easily irritated when I have to engage in small talk or attend social gatherings with anyone other than my closest friends. Even among my friends, I get tired around them after an hour or so unless we do something mentally stimulating, usually creating or playing games.

I'm the type of person who's usually deep in thought all of the time, usually about abstract concepts, and I noticed that I get easily distracted (and thus irritated) when there is too much stimuli around me. It's the reason why even my clothing style is very plain and simple, I hate visual and audio clutter since it makes me feel suffocated or hostage. Unfortunately, being around people (especially those who are rambunctious) causes this same feeling of clutter.

The few I have left live abroad or are otherwise unavailable.  I have no family.  I've been in therapy for a couple years now and it was a good ride except the last 2 months haven't done much for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I just took my first vacation of the year (yes, I know I should probably do it more often) and had the whole week to myself.  9 consecutive days.  Whether or not that much alone time is good for someone like me is hard to say.  I think I like it, but I have that bitter self loathing personality that just loves to bask in my misery.

The first 3 days went how vacations usually go - I'm ""on vacation"" but I'm still preoccupied with work.  Days 4-5 were lovely though.  Truly liberating.  I was proud of myself.  Optimistic about some schoolwork I've been doing on the side, and for those couple days I could even imagine having a future.  I was excited to finish classes and get into a new career.  I finally had the energy to get my schoolwork caught up.

Days 6-9 were not as good.  I started having panic attacks, I wasn't getting as much done as I had hoped and now I'm not sure I'll pass my classes.  And that's not doom saying.  I've been procrastinating and put off 4 months of work to get them done in the next 2 weeks.  That realization coupled with that it's the only ticket I see out of my current job makes me feel like shit.  More than anything I've let myself down.  I've failed on something I owe entirely to myself.  And I'm so mad.  There's nothing and no one I can blame or hide my failure from.  No one else will know, but that's not the point. It feels like I've finally sealed my casket. 

On Sunday evening I chatted with a friend briefly.  He's a very encouraging and supportive friend and I don't think I'd be here without him.  He believes in me (granted I lie to everyone about how classes are going because I can't face my own shame.  The fact I can't get anything done) .  But by the end of it I've calmed down a bit and feel as ready as I can be to go back to work.

It's noon now and I feel worse and more burnt out than I did before I went on vacation.  All I got from my vacation was the perspective of my failure.  I'm sure many would say I'm young (enough) to still put it all together.  But I'm a fan of statistics.  And if I saw my numbers on this loser getting it together I wouldn't put a dollar down even on 1:10000 returns if I succeed.

I don't know.  I'm new here.  I don't know what the usual response to venting is.  I'd be happy to hear someone change my mind, but I think I came here just to convince myself that the jig is up.  Maybe I just need to accept mediocrity and disappointment.  I've gotten good at living alone and just showing up for work and going home and sleeping.  At least my dreams are getting more interesting.",16Nov2020,3
224,"Hello there,

I have been dealing with what I suppose is bad anxiety. First off I have had all kinds of tests done to assure me I have nothing serious wrong with me. I'm a hypochondriac. I do believe doctors, I just can't seem to trust the diagnosis I get, and I'm starting to doubt my own thoughts. Which are rational and which are irrational? I always have an argument against my rational thoughts that keeps the anxiety going, even subconsciously. For example, this constant nausea could be anxiety but there is a chance it is something more. I also suffer from panic attacks which were more severe a few months ago, but occur occasionally when I think to much about a certain sensation I feel.

I've been to all kinds of psychologists, but none gave me tips on how I should be battling this. Only thing I got was, Exercise and don't think about it you are too young (20 years old currently). It also feels like I don't have symptoms because of my anxiety, but I have anxiety because of my symptoms. 

I'm so convinced I have something wrong with me. It feels like I just can't get the evidence to show my doctor there is indeed something wrong, because if there wasn't I wouldn't be feeling so terrible 24/7.

It all started when I got infected with COVID in early march. How do you deal with uncertainty, and how do I distinguish rational thoughts from irrational ones ? If anyone has any tips or something I could do or try, I would really appreciate it.",16Nov2020,1

232,"•Anxiety and Mental health•

While mental health is moving slowly to the forefront of people’s hearts and minds, there is still a long way to go in terms of tackling and speaking freely about mental health conditions. Conversations about mental health are everywhere owing to the lack of certainty about so many things during this time, and the stress associated with it. But it is so important to know that there’s nothing more normal than having a hard time right now, none of us is immune from experiencing feelings we've never dealt with before. 

~ If you're going through an anxious phase,

People around you may act all judgemental and make you feel like your mental health is not even a matter of discussion. 
You're already going through a lot on your own, the last thing you want is to get affected by others.  Keep everyone aside and focus on yourself simply because - you matter. 

As long as you acknowledge and understand what you're going through, you're already on the right track. Don't expect others to just know how you are feeling. They will only resonate with you to a certain extent. It's only you who will have to find and fight your way out of your anxiety. 

When your anxiety is at its peak, its going to exhaust you mentally and physically and it's going to be hard to get through the day. It'll give you all these thoughts about what you should be scared of. It tells you that you need to worry and seek reassurance about every single thought running in your mind. The problem with an anxious mind is that you take your thoughts too seriously.  At such times, you have two options to stop yourself from falling deeper into the trap. 
•You can either push the anxiety away and bury it so deep down and forget that it exists, or 
•You can confront your feelings and move away from the everything that triggers you. 
You have to find what works best for you and help you re wire your brain. 

•Think of these thoughts and feelings like an addictive song that's stuck in your head. If you let it play, it's never gonna end. You have to shift focus on other things around you and come out of the loop. And trust me, it's going to stay as long as you allow it to. Make sure you keep working on bringing about a transition from these feelings. Start small, take minimal efforts but don't stop moving away from them at your own pace. If you stop moving towards healing, the trap is just going to look bigger. It's probably going to be the hardest thing you will ever have to do, but you have to keep pushing.

•If you don't want to push it away and if you think it'll just be a matter of time until it spirals back, then spend time with your anxious thoughts. Discover yourself and decode how you feel. Sometimes, the more you resist these feelings, the more they are going to persist. Fight your way away from them by making some space for them and figuring your way out.  Anxiety is a fear based response, when we accept the anxiety, our body is no longer in fear.

Whether you push it all away or face it, one thing's for sure. It's not going to be easy. 
There will be times when you'll feel like giving up. There will be times when breaking the cycle of anxiety is going to look impossible. 

Always remember, you are not your anxiety, so don't let it define you. 
You deserve to be loved without having to hide the parts of yourself that you think are unloveable. 

~If someone reaches out to you,

If you're a person to whom someone opens up about their mental health issues, you basically have to do two things- let the other person know that you're there for them and then actually follow through and be ready to talk to them, judgment-free, and maybe even solution-free. 

Remember, if someone opens up to you, it is not because they expect answers. If answers were so easy to find, they wouldn't have even reached out to you in the first place. Listen to what they have to say and respect their boundaries instead of forcing them to be open about their thoughts.  All they want is to know that they are not alone and are loved. Creating a safe place for them to let it all out can be of great help. Knowing that there is someone around who knows what to do if they start to feel frightened or panicked could help them feel safer and calmer.

People suffering from mental health issues usually prefer to keep it all within themselves, thinking that nobody would really care to understand how they feel. Ask them about their experiences and make them believe they they are just suffering a temporary problem that has become out of control. 

Helping someone with anxiety can be intimidating and may seem beyond your ability. Ask the person how you can be of help and try to give them all the encouragement that you can.

Today, when most of them are pretending to be someone they aren't, let's be there for our loved ones who are strong enough to reach out and talk about something so sensitive. 

It always feels good to be a rainbow in someone's cloud :)

242,"Is it really just all in my head like people say or it’s actually not? I cannot decide anymore. So something stupid happened today and I wanted to vent. 
So I was at the bank today and had an rather embarassing moment. The cashier told me something. I didn’t understand. She told me the second time, still didn’t get her. At this point I could tell she was starting to get annoyed and i was already very nervous at this point.I asked for the third time. This time she replied. loudly. So loud that other people started looking at me. I was shitting myself by then. I could’t face her anymore so i said thanks and got out without actually having done what i was supposed to do. It’s 1 in the morning and I cannot stop thinking about it.It’s like... it’s not even the first time this happened to me.. it happens on a regular basis. but what i wanna know is.. was it really just in my head? was I over analyzing things? or it had something to do with their response also?",16Nov2020,1
243,"Hi guys, 

The backstory:
In June 2020 during the boosted movement of BLM, a past friend took it upon herself to scroll through a previous group chat in 2017 with myself, her and afew of my mates. Within this chat there was racial comments said as an inside joke (hence the private group chat), a lot of dark humour in this chat. With these messages she posted them on social media exposing myself and my friends as these raging racists. Resulting in the tweet generating nearly 2k retweets and serval hundred comments. 

Somehow my employer found out about this and I had to go through a disciplinary hearing etc, thankfully I still have my job. 

This tweet is still visible on Twitter, and if you type my name into google this tweet is the first result. I feel like this tweet can be detrimental to future careers. 

This whole fiasco has taken a massive toll on my mental health, there is not a single day which goes by when I do not think about this tweet. It’s honestly traumatised me I think. I get shivers even thinking about it. 

I feel like if the tweet was removed I would feel much better but I would need to get a solicitor involved costing £1k+ which is money I don’t have spare. 

I am also worried about ‘stirring the pot’ and reigniting the situation. Should I let sleeping lions lay, as they say? 

A lot of my previous school friends saw this tweet and now thinking I’m this massive raging racist. I feel like I have no friends. 

Is there anything I can do to improve my state of mind? Can therapy do anything? 

TIA",16Nov2020,1

245,"First off, let me say thank you for loving a person with mental illness.  Thank you for trying your hardest to support them through their tough times.  Before I get into what I feel must be said, please, if you're just starting this journey, google ""how best to support a person with mental illness.""  That is not what this post is about, but I know how much it helps.  

And now on to what I feel is an important topic for all of us.  I say the following as a mother with a severe mental illness, with an adult child with a fairly severe mental illness,  and over twenty years worth of intensive study about mental illnesses.  So please don't think I'm coming from either a place that lacks compassion, understanding, or education.  

I come across endless posts where there is a family dynamic where a person's behavior is excused due to mental illnesses.  The others in the family are required to make apologies for making the mentally ill person upset.  And those others are then left both feeling like they have no choice but to walk on eggshells and as though they are being held captive by the person's mental illness.

HOLD PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR.

Regardless of our illnesses, we have to deal with the outside world.  We have to learn that there are acceptable behaviors in society and those that are unacceptable.  Allowing people with mental illnesses to have consistently uncontrolled behavior doesn't give them the chance to learn the rules necessary for adulthood.  It enables them to continue to be more dependent and out of control as an adult. 

When my child was young, they would ask me why they had rules and chores and that when they were an adult, they wouldn't have to do anything.  I explained, many times over, that the rules for kids were to help them learn how to live with rules.  And that adults have countless rules and breaking them comes with much harsher consequences.  Like job loss.  Home loss.  Prison time.  Custody loss.  I'm not saying they were a perfect kid that never broke the rules or that they're now a perfect adult.  Neither am I.  But I am saying that adults have rules and standards of behavior.  And that doesn't change if you have a mental illness or not.  

The rest of your family shouldn't be held hostage because one person has out of control behavior.  

Yes, mental illnesses can make it harder to control your behavior.  Absolutely.  But harder doesn't mean impossible.  It's a skill that everyone needs to learn to varying degrees.  And just like any other kid, people with mental illnesses can learn it too.  Does it take work?  Yes.  Does it take time?  Yes.  Does it take practice?  Yes.  But everything good in life comes from hard work.  This is one of them.

There are certain rules that I live by, both as a means of controlling my illness, and as a means of controlling how it affects others.  

1) Having a mental illness doesn't give me a right to treat others like shit.  Nothing gives me that right.

2) Every action and every word that comes from my body is my responsibility.  Regardless of my illness.  No one comes over and physically picks up my leg and makes it go through a kicking motion towards another.  No one comes over and takes over my brain, my mouth, and my lungs to say terrible things.  

3)  There is a difference between behavior and thought.  I can think terrible things about the driver that just cut me off.  But I cannot justify actually doing anything about it.  I vent the thought in my car and move on.

4) It is my responsibility to maintain emotional awareness and do what is necessary and appropriate to cope with it.  It's not the responsibility of others to guess what's going on in my head.  

I see so many kids on reddit who are trying to figure out if they are wrong or bad for being upset that their sibling with a mental illness is out of control and hurting them (either physically, emotionally, or both).  Take mental illness out of the equation.  Is a sibling wrong for being upset that their sibling is hurting them?  No.  Not in the least.  And those poor kids are being failed by the parents.  Both of the kids.  The parents aren't protecting one from abusive behavior, and enabling the other to not learn the tools necessary to control their behavior.

But the failure to the person with mental illness is even deeper.  The family, no matter how well meaning, is seeing an illness before a person.  Can't do punishments because they're sick, they're fragile, they might get upset, and on and on.  The person with a mental illness is still, fundamentally a person.  And every person has to eventually learn the rules and standards for how to behave in society.  Or else all those potential consequences for breaking the adult rules become their lives.",16Nov2020,1
247,"I (20M) am currently going through some stuff and wanted to reach out anonymously to see if anyone has any advice. 

This year has obviously been tough on everyone and I am personally struggling with doing the most basic things. I hate university being online (obviously understand it’s necessary during the pandemic just struggle with seeing a lot less people than normal) and have very little motivation to do anything with my days at all. 

I don’t necessarily feel sad as per say, just sort of numb most days. Sort of existing rather than living. I don’t want to be dramatic and throw around words such as depression because they’re serious things and I am in no way feeling suicidal. I know many folk are worse off than myself I just can’t seem to shift a sort of weight off myself. I’d love to blame the pandemic and brush it off but i honestly can’t remember when I was last simply content.

249,"My partner of 20 years has said she no longer wants to be with me, we have children together and she's now gone to her parents and won't even return our oldest son's calls. She has schizophrenia and recently had a episode she went in hospital and came out and decided she no longer loves me.

Her family have decided I'm some sort of monster, based on rumours and lies 15 years ago and keep digging into me, reminding me she doesn't love me and that she doesn't want to be anywhere near me. Even though, my children's mother said she would come home for Christmas to be with her children, she's now decided she won't, she's still not answering our sons calls or mine, she's blocked me on Facebook so I can't even let our 3 year old daughter facetime her mommy.

Everyday brings something new with them finding ways to hurt me, I'm dreading Christmas, I've not eaten in 5 days and I honestly just want to throw myself under a train, if she takes our children I'll have nothing to live for. They want to make me into something I'm not, I've been polite and courteous every step af the way, even though she won't speak to her children, they see me hurting and she gets her aunt to tell me she wants them  for the weekend, she wants them for Christmas. I don't know how much more I can give.

I've tried to be understanding, even though she wont speak to me so I can find the reason she doesn't love me and wants to cause me so much pain, she was my best friend and I was there for her when no one else was. I just don't see the point in going on, if I'm dead they win and right now that's okay with me, it hurts too much.

253,"Hello, 

Background: bi-polar 2 w/ a hint of OCD (intrusive thoughts). Medicated (Lamictal &amp; fluvox) and self-aware. 

Looking to see if anyone else has experienced this. 

I have always struggled with intrusive thoughts (15ish years) ranging from social interactions, to shame (""You bitch"" and other similar things, to just random anxiety based. However, I am now experiencing ""Kill yourself"". It's a random intrusive thought, I am NOT hearing another voice. It comes and goes, some days I don't think it at all, some days it won't go away. I don't feel suicidal, I don't have any plans or anything like that and I'm a little depressed but overall pretty good. In the past for intrusive thoughts, I use the technique of ""just let them pass"" or I stop and think no, that's not true...so on and so forth. But this is new, continuous, and I am not comfortable with it. I lost my insurance recently and make too much to get on Medicaid but too little to afford insurance so therapy isn't an option right now (though I am a lifer, have a lot of experience with therapy/psychiatrists, and plan on getting back when I can access insurance). My anxiety is incredibly high right now due to \*gestures at everything\*, and I am in the middle of a big life adjustment as well. I have about every stressor possible happening except a family death. I'm using every coping mechanism and tool in my kit but definitely need to be getting more physical activity in.

I've started to think about different kinds of depressive shit. Like how unfair this world is, how many people suffered and that some of that suffering was caused by me, about my biggest fear of all: being lonely for the rest of my life.

255,"Even if I desperately want *simple* and *important* tasks done (such washing my dishes, doing my laundry, even just picking up and tidying the room), I literally will stand up to start the task and then just stop, feeling like I can't even tolerate any amount of work for a single second. As if lifting a finger for *anything* feels dreadful. Then I feel like every single second of the task will be in slow motion, drawn out. I can't just mindlessly get to work. I can't just *do* a task I really dislike and get it out of the way. I feel so physically aversed to work.

Then of course I stress about it, so the stress + the act of even thinking about the task makes me feel so tired that I need a nap.

I know it sounds like a simple low or depressed mood, but I just feel so embarrassed that I get so... lazy? Like I hate even the idea of work even if I want to do the task? Is such an extreme and specific reaction typical for anyone else?

I am 15 years old and recently my mental health has gone downhill because I could no longer hide it after over 2 years. My mother finally realized and even though she is more worried about my academic performance than me as the individual with said grades( from what her words suggest) , she has offered me the chance to get therapy since I do not want to be open with her about my problems. I have huge trust issues whether it be with close family and friends, to newly met strangers. My biggest fears for taking any sort of therapeutical service is:

1. The ability to be open with a stranger - I've somehow managed to overcome this but it's still there.

2. Confidentiality.- I need to know that my information that I divulged on stays between myself and the said professional. I cannot allow my mother to hear any such information.

260,"  I’m 41 years old.  I work as a senior software engineer.  I’ve had an amazing career and have been successful.  I’ve made a good amount of money and I’ve achieved much.   As a matter of fact most of my adult life has been committed to  career.   Almost the the point where it was literally a first class priority in my life.  

   Relationship wise it’s been a mixed bag.  But historically I’ve had a hard to creating attachments.  Occasionally I’ll have a relationship here or there but then I realize that I should be focusing on my career, and it ends naturally.

  Since COVID depression has really been coming over me.  I’ve felt isolated and lonely.  I’m surrounded constantly by my work, and it has been stressing me out.


  I recently met a woman online and it was a fantastic relationship.  I felt a deep connection I’ve never felt for another person. I really feel I’ve fell in love with her.   She even moved in with me and things were good.

   Since we are both overweight she has helped me learn to cook and we have lost weight.  We were a fantastic team.  But then she started to tell me she wanted to see other people and asked me if it was ok if she brought men into my place.    I was against it.

  Keep in mind we’re physical with each other.  She pattered told me she says what she says because she is afraid I may hurt her.  Anyway in a rash decision we had an argument and I decided to leave for a month.

  Since I left she processed her love for me.  But lately she has been distant and barely communicating.  Things got so bad that yesterday she said some brutal and nasty things to me.  Things that really signaled to me that, not only is it over, but she is probably using me in the process.

  I feel a level of devastation I’ve never felt before.  Like for the last 6 months my life has revolved around her and hers around me.  And to feel like it has to end is something I’m having a hard time dealing with.   I’ve been heart broken before, but I feel I’ve lost all meaning in my life.

  I’m just sad and as much as I’m trying to cope it’s just so overwhelming.   Money, other women, nothing cheers me up.  I know it feels childish but there is a level of dread within me that I can’t shake.

  And I know things between us will never be functional.  Anxiety has really really consumed me.  Even working out has not been able to help.  I just don’t know what to do.  Please help",16Nov2020,2

264,"I've met this guy that I'll call G years ago, and from day one I was completely obsessed with him. Not even in a romantic kind of way, I just found him the perfect person for me to have around. We became friends and started hanging out and for me he was always on a pedestal. I'd text G more than I text most of my friends, always seek for his approval and all those things. For the whole period, since before I met him to the present day, I have been with an amazing boyfriend which I love and would not want to leave for him.

At some point I thought I was in love with G, which made me feel extremely guilty towards my boyfriend. Through the years, G did a bunch of stupid things and ended up hurting me, but I kept justifying him cause he was just so perfect. I am pretty sure I was acting quite crazy towards him, not really in a ""you're all mine"" fashion, but more doing anything for his attention. 

After a while I cut all contacts because I realized how toxic I was being and I didn't want to be that person. That was more than one year ago. Even after this long, I keep thinking about him, about texting him again ""just to see how he's doing"", about what he would think of me or say if he was still around. I'm not gonna act upon those thoughts, I know I don't need him and I'm a much better person without him, but I am still very bothered by these thoughts. They ruin my mood and make me panic quite a bit when they happen. 

I've been to therapy for other reasons and this came up multiple times in my sessions, but talking about him with my therapist ended up being just another way to obsess over him so she decided to just teach me mindfulness (all the ""think about something else"" stuff) and avoid the topic as much as we could.

I know this phrase is more of a joke saying than anything but I got to thinking: is there a strong link between self awareness and mental health?
Mental health issues vary I know that and I’m not well versed in the science of it but I was just curious.
So two scenarios here:

1. Someone is learning about a simple issue (this as far as I know isn’t actually a diagnosable mental health problem but please correct me if I’m wrong) like a Messiah complex and thinks “that describes me, I should be more careful on how I view/conduct myself “.

2. The same as before but with an issue like an identity disorder, schizophrenia or bipolar.

How can self awareness affect the person suffering from these disorders, can it help or make it worse? And could the mentioned saying stop people from getting the help they need?",16Nov2020,1

For about a month or 2 tho I have been having an extremely hard time focusing in school, and I kinda wanna ask if I can see a doctor because I feel like if I do not I might start falling really behind in school, but I have anxiety and I still live with my parents so I do not really wanna ask if nothing is diagnosed because for some reason it gives me anxiety to ask them about stuff like that.

She knew i cut myself and asked me to show her the cuts and after some mental preparation i did and she took my arm and caressed and kissed the cuts and scars.
After that and she gave me a kiss on the cheek and because I hadn't felt that nice for a long time i started crying and she made me promise to try and get better for my sake.

I have Bipolar Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, Intrusive thoughts and anger/emotional issues. My support system is shit, my friends and family all know what I'm going through but I don't wanna bug them anymore with my shit. I feel like I fucked up my whole life. For the past 20 years I emasculated myself, I put myself down and treated myself like trash, I completely obliterated my self confidence. I'm 38 now and I haven't dated anyone since I was 19. I felt like I would never be a good boyfriend or husband to anyone so I just belittled myself and didn't try anything with any girls. I honestly probably won't do bad with girls, I'm just too slow and dense to pick up on hints. I fantasize about relationships with girls that I'm into but I don't ever befriend them at all. I'll do the whole thing in my head, dating, engagement, marriage, the girl cheating on me and divorce, only to go back to sadness like a fucking creep, better this than to get hurt in RL. I once fantasized like this about a co-worker for a year. I didn't even know that she was into me until two coworkers mentioned it but she already moved on. So FML. I didn't do anything with her because she had a boyfriend. I choke up when speaking to women if I am even remotely interested in them. I have a ton more issues but I don't wanna bore anyone reading this. I'm not suicidal even though I've tried twice in the past. But I can feel myself going into that mindset once again.

I grew up in an abusive home, my mom was doing drugs when she was pregnant with me, she's also fucking psycho and beat us every fucking day. Sorry if this sounds whinny. I don't fucking know what to do anymore. I don't even know if anyone is gonna read this.

276,"Back in August of this year I suddenly got a lot more emotional, which was a good thing as previously I really wasn't that emotional at all. That 'emotionality' died down over the course of a few months, but a few weeks after I got a lot more emotional, I remember that I went through a very short episode where I was just spewing out completely random stuff (in fact it essentially felt as if my brain had just turned to mush), had pretty much no impulse control and was pretty manic. I definitely hadn't gone through anything like it before and so I was pretty confused after. It only lasted for about an hour and any side effects died off completely after 1-2 days, but one thing was clear; I really didn't want to go through that again.

The thing is though, when I think about that mental state (and only really then), I have a weird, kinda primal urge to just return to that mental state. I control myself and try not to, but it's scarily easy. I just have to 'tell' my brain to do it and down I go. I don't find going back to it thrilling, as if it was some addiction; I find it pretty dangerous and scary, but that for some reason I have to go back to that mental state. I haven't succumbed to it ever other than that one episode (which just started off with something akin to 'why not?')

One really good analog of how I felt during that was Etika's final months; doing completely random things, being sorta manic.. it's very similar, and you can see why I really don't want to succumb to that urge.

I'm not bipolar or cyclothymic, and I haven't been diagnosed with anything other than Aspergers; I'm a bit narcissistic, but that's it pretty much. I live a pretty comfortable life and I've never experienced anything like it before. I'm 13 and male, if that helps.

EDIT: I 'let it out' for about 20 seconds and that combined with just thinking about how bad it was made the urge disappear. I wonder if it's just bottling something up and the way I let it out is in that crazy manic state.. that's pretty possible honestly. Not super sure though.",16Nov2020,1
277,"Hi all this is my first post here.

Somebody I love so so much is going through such a hard time right now.  They just want to be happy, thats it, but just cant.  This person is just so tired of feeling this way and has suicidal ideations.  They also recently got out of a very toxic relationship and growing up they felt worthless.

We're both minors and our parents dont think mental illness is serious so they are of no help.  I would take them to seek professional help but I cant right now but I will be able to drive soon(hopefully) so I will try to convince them to go with me.

So right now, we vent to each other, we share how we feel and we share our secrets.  I try to make them feel better by saying things like, Im glad you exist, thank you for being alive, I love you, Im always here for you, I appreciate you, things will get better, etc.

I was also depressed once so I know what not to say.  This person sometimes expresses deep gratitude to what I say and sometimes its just a short response like okay thank you.

When its the short responses, I feel like nothing I said actually touched them or helped, it feels like it just bounced right off.  I will keep saying these but I cant help but just feel so frustrated and bad that I cant help them with my words.

Am I not doing enough?  Am I really helping?  Im so worried and feel so much pain for them.  I guess this is all.  Thank you all in advance",16Nov2020,7
278,"Why I am who I am

 (this whole text is pulled from google trandlate but it is 100%my own story)

Hello i'm a 15 yo male from sweden, we might have diffrent age grade system but were i live you start first grade at 7 yo and after every summer a new grade starts.

Ever since I was little I have become the forgotten one in the family, of course I got a few years when I was very small but as soon as my brother came I was like forgotten because my brother has always been in focus after he has ADHD and  need a lot more attention and then I get none and I kind of never got that.  My parents want me to be like my sister who is a child who spends all her free time studying but what they do not understand is that I can not, as well as literally can not focus on what I want.  They want me to be perfect but they are not willing to help me.  They always compare with my sister even though I already know that I will never be like her but it does not make them.  I have felt lonely for a long time but it is not without reason, while I went in the 1-3th grade I had almost no friends but I had a friend (Liam).  Liam was the only one I had to talk to, we were best friends but he never wanted to be with me at school because he was ashamed to be friends with me.  This made me go and feel bad daily and cry almost every night I came home.  The first thing I did when I got home was literally go to bed and cry, this went on for several years every day.  I never had anyone to talk to about it because my parents just said either that it was nothing special because everyone had their periods where they felt bad or told them that it was just my fault and that I would blame myself for what I did.  did.  But the thing was that I had not done anything, I have now in retrospect talked to some from my old class who were sometimes kind to me behind closed doors and asked them why, the only answers I got was that they chose me to  I had glasses at the time and they had noticed that I was already feeling bad and that they thought it was fun when I got angry.  Between the 4-6th grade I felt even worse, it was even then at the beginning of the 4th that my ""friend"" abandoned me.  It was because it turned out that he was friends with me that he did not want to be with me because he knew he would become popular if he continued to be with me.  Time kept going and everything just got worse and worse, now it was not only at home that I felt bad, now it was also at school that I could lock myself in the toilet and skip whole lessons just to sit there and think about mine  life and if it was worth living at all because I already knew then that it would not be anything of me, I felt then that it was not worth living anymore, it was then that I decided to escape from home, I  packed a bag full of clothes and food and money.  I opened my window and was ready to jump out and escape but then my mother had heard my window open and then she went up to check what I was doing.  Then she found my bag that I had packed and then they put a child lock on my window and gave me a curfew for several months.  They just wanted to punish me, they refused to try to get help even though they had noticed that I never had any friends or talked to anyone and they knew I was very lonely.  When I had had enough of always being alone and not being able to talk to anyone, I went to my teacher and talked to her in a group room.  She immediately realized the seriousness of my situation and she understood why I felt the way I did and she actually wanted to help me.  She said that I would rather do an investigation for mental illness but that my parents would need to fix it.  I went to my parents and told them that I was feeling bad and that I had no friends and that I wanted an investigation but they just said that it was not needed and that it was just my fault and that it was just a period.  In that situation, I had no friends, I felt shit every day and I had no real will to live.  It was then that I decided for the first time to try to take my own life.  I told my parents that I was going out with a friend but really I went to school and climbed to the roof, where I sat for several hours and just looked down, I knew it was not very high but I thought I would still  die if I jumped.  So that's what I did, I jumped but I managed with only one sprained foot.  Nothing changed in a few months before my parents found me crying in my bed in the middle of the night, I told them how I had no friends and that I was bullied so I wanted to change schools.  For once, they believed in me and we applied to the only other school in hearing that was an alternative but it was full so nothing happened.  A few months later, two new boys started in the class (Sefti and Elias), they would be my best and only friends I had during that time, they managed to change me so that I did not want to die anymore, anyway for that moment.  I was friends with them until the end of the 6th grade when I changed school to ks because they did not have high school there.

 But when I started in high school and made new friends and a new start I became happier, and when I became happier I started eating more and then I got fat, this only made me start to feel bad about myself again and then it stopped  I eat for shorter periods and develop anorexia.  My anorexia lasted for almost the entire 7th grade when I felt that it was absolutely not good to starve myself as much as I did and finally managed to get rid of it before the summer holidays between the 7th and the 8th.  During the summer holidays I started to feel fat again and then I started to get anorexia back and I still have it today, I still feel bad about how my old class treated me and how my parents did not care, I still have a hard time  talking about my feelings and talking to people at all due to not having any friends for so long made me “socially awkward” and I do not know how to deal with certain situations.  I just want to be loved, I just want to experience everything I have missed out on.....

It is now today and i just got home from training and i instantly started crying again, it has bel like this the last 2 weeks now and i'm not thinking of comitting suecide again .",16Nov2020,2
279,"( First of all, I just want to say sorry for my bad English some part of this text will be translate by Google translate) 
So like I said I’ve been really depress lately cause I’m 20 years old, I don’t have a ""real"" job, one of my best friend pass away last week, I failed my class I get kick out of the school ( but I’m happy about it cause I really hate what I was studying for) and with the pandemic right now everything is closed in Canada so there nothing to do. I can’t see my friend too because in The province of Quebec meeting with friends at your house is prohibited because of the pandemic. So for a few months my mental health just go down. The only thing that make me feel better is the alcohol cause when I drink I just feel so good everything that make me stress or sad just disappears. But When the morning come and I’m hangover I really feel like a piece of shit all I do about my day is laying in my bed and when the night come I drink, I’ve been doing this for three months and I’m really tired of this kind of live. I’m really rude with my family and I feel really bad about it because they just want me to feel better and I’m just acting like a jerk. I really want to feel better because this is not a life... So I plan quitting alcohol because i think it’s the first step to help me feel better. It’s been 3 days that I don’t drink alcohol but now every night I’m just craving for a beer but I try to not drink cause I just want to be happy again loving life again and maybe find somethings to study for that I will really enjoy. 
So now the night come I really want to drink does somebody have advices for me to help me not drinking. Cause I’ve been doing this for like 3 month every day so it’s really not easy to do pass the night without drinking.

282,"Okay so, I usually use jodel for these kind of posts, but earlier I actually downloaded an app that blocks jodel because I spend so much time on it and there is nothing I can do right now to get on the app. So I made a reddit user of course.

I just need to write to someone what is going on.

To set the atmosphere, I am abroad at the moment, studying. I don't speak the language and they don't really know English either. 

Anyways, a week ago or so, I had gotten myself a nice UTI, and I had two tablets left from a packet from an earlier antibiotics treatment, so last night I thought, even though I have heard that you should not do this and I will regret it for the rest of my life, that I should just take the two and see if it would get any better. So I took one of them and I couldn't really swallow it. It got stuck in my throat. I spent the entire night, until 4 am trying to get it down, by eating bread, drinking tons of water, drinking hot water, hot water with baking soda, eating peanutbutter, you name it. Nothing worked. 

So today I still had the feeling that it was in my throat. I freaked out a little bit and I went to the emergency room. When I got there, I was too embarassed by the fact that I thought I had a pill in my throat, because I am known to be a hypochondriac, so I only told them that I had a UTI. I got antibiotics for the UTI and went home.

I still had the feeling of the pill in my throat when I went to bed and I started googling and I got more freaked out and just decided to go to the emergency room AGAIN at like 9.30 pm. This time they asked why the f I didn't tell them about the throat pill thing earlier today and I just answered that I didn't think it was that serious then, but now I did. So, very annoyed, they took my temperature, which was too high, and concluded that because of throat discomfort (that I explained several times was because of the pill I took) and fever, I had to go get tested for covid. I was directed to another emergency room, they also took my temperature. It was too low, but they tested me for covid anyway. So now I am sitting in a covid emergency room waiting for the covid results, and I am still freaking out about the antibiotic pill stuck in my throat. I don't even know what to do at this point. Just go home after I get the negative results and wait to die from a perforated esophagus or somethint. I am so fucking dumb, I amaze myself every day.",16Nov2020,1

294,"Let me just start off by saying that I have been struggling with extreme anxiety and depression for most of my life, but am just now getting comfortable with the idea of it. Comfortable saying I have it, just started therapy to get it under control... etc. It has caused some issues between me and my new husband - we just got married a few months ago and it hasn’t been easy and I blame myself for that. Now, I’ve really fucked up and need advice on what to do. I am so ashamed of myself and it hurts me to even talk about this, but I am at a loss. 

A few of weeks ago, we decided to go have some drinks and have a good time, but I made the mistake of drinking way too much. I should have known better to do that with the state of mind I have been in. We had a great time while we were out, but as soon as we got home, I don’t remember a single thing. (I am telling the rest of this story by HIS memory of it.) We hadn’t really gotten into an argument, but he was sitting on the edge of the bed with his hands together and I was trying to pry them apart and ended up bending his fingers back too far on accident. He pushes me off of him and I lost it. I punched him in the head over, and over again. Walked out, came back in for more, and threw a glass of water on him as well. He couldn’t move or defend himself. I finally left the room to go downstairs, he came downstairs 10 minutes later and he says it was like I had no idea what I had done to him. He said he needed to go to the hospital, and I said that he didn’t and he was fine... I acted like he was over reacting. The only thing I had to prove I had done this was a bruised hand and a traumatized husband the next day. I feel like a monster, I am a monster. I did not know I was capable of doing something like that. 

We have had our good-ish and bad days over the last few weeks, but there is still that elephant in the room. I have apologized over and over again, talked about how I am willing to do whatever it takes to make it up to him. He says all he needs me to do is get better, but on the other hand, says I haven’t done enough to make it right. I honestly thought I was, but our ideas of what “making it right” is are slightly different. He corrected me, and I did more things to make him feel special on top of what I had been doing. 

As I have mentioned earlier, I struggle with depression and anxiety, and have been really bad for a while. This situation has left me feeling even worse, but am trying by best to be mindful and take care of myself because that is how I will get better. 

The pressure that is being put on me to be that new person is beginning to weigh heavy on my shoulders. I can’t make a mistake, say the wrong thing, or have a bad day because he will not want to be around me. I am beginning to feel that I cannot do anything right. My anxiety is giving me anxiety, my thoughts are snowballing. My fear that he is going to leave me is growing stronger, even though he says he won’t. 

I am aware that I need to have patience and that it is going to take however long it is going to take for him to heal. He is going to go through phases of acceptance, anger, resentment and anything else that comes to mind. 

What more do I need to do? I am beginning to feel that I am putting his oxygen mask on before mine. I put us in this situation, so I am not thinking “woe is me” at all. I am just struggling with how to go about this from here. I need to be  better in order to make it right, but how do I do both?",16Nov2020,1

I get extreme paranoia and electrical feelings all over my body and I'm extremely confused. Sometimes I have weird thoughts like panda bears are going to Mars. Lol. But usually when this happens I have a normal heart rate and a stomach ache. And my visuals are weird amd I can see things stretch and swirl and go from 2D to 3D. It makes me feel ill. And coming out of it I feel very disoriented and I take time to recover. I have to do repetitive motions or  I just feel overall drained of energy and still quite confused. Sometimes I have mild confusions and my eyes get lazy and feel weird.
       Sometimes it effects my sleep. I can wake up or fall asleep hearing things and I feel delusional and psychotic. I get afraid of the dark and nothing seems to calm me down. I hate having sleep paralysis for 3 hours. Does it usually last that long? I don't know haha. But usally when I'm sleeping or waking up. Because my body feels like its on fire I want to call 911. Its scary. Ive had worse convulsions with my eyes rolling back in my head and fluttering and things jumping in my vision. Random blinking and tics and full body shaking where I'm aware. 
       Ive heard voices and smelled weird things before. It scares me but I know the voices aren't real. Amd when I hallucination scary things its usually when I close my eyes. I'm just tired.

299,"I’m not even a minor, and I know about confidentiality laws (United States) but I’m kind of worried he might talk about me to the family member.

The reason I’m considering it is because the family member brought my medications up to him, and he said it does a lot of bad things, while my current doctor refuses to believe in even COMMON side effects.

I’m kind of hoping this doctor knows about PSSD, as I’m concerned about getting it when or if I get off of my meds. One is an SSRI, and I don’t even know how the other one interacts with it.

I’ve taken high doses for 9 years, so I’m very doubtful that I WON’T experience long-term issues. People report not just loss of libido, genital numbness, loss of pleasure from orgasm, inability to orgasm, also inability to experience any kind of pleasure whatsoever. I’ve experienced degrees of these things while on the meds, who the hell knows what being on them for so long has done to me or will do to me from withdrawal.

Wellbutrin apparently (first causing extreme dysfunction when temporarily doubled) eventually allowed me to, for the first time in my life, orgasm so strongly I actually felt it as MINDBLOWING. I definitely want to share that experience with a girlfriend one day..... I want to be able to experience romantic AND sexual feelings, even if the relationship only lasts a short time (sea full of fish, right?).

The fact that he is more knowledge about one medicine, implies that he might be about more. Maybe he even knows about PSSD and other Post-SSRI side effects.

Reading on the PSSD subreddit, it sounds like even when these loss of feelings and functions are long-term, they’re not actually the result of permanent damage. As many people claim trying different things and experiencing windows of pleasure.

It gets worse, some people report losing the ability TO ENJOY MUSIC!!!!!!!! NO!!!",16Nov2020,0

Today and just now i have been feeling really bad and they have been saying mean things like telling me to hurt myself and try to kill myself because im a really bad person for not going to school. 
I am suicidle and my parents know but i have just taken a bunch of my medication and i hurt my arms pretty badly and i’m bleeding a bit and i feel sick. 
My parents are out to the shop and i don’t know what to do? But if i call someone like an ambulance or the hospital won’t they be mean because i hurt myself and it was my fault? And will they not be nice because i can hear voices but what if they don’t believe me and are mean because i will be crying? And will they know that i hear voices already?

304,"Hi! Thanks for clicking.


I had a very rough few weeks - working lots of overtime, a death in the family, a girl tried to get my boyfriend to cheat, etc.

During these weeks I felt nothing, I focused on staying functional so I could do my job well.

Then I had a 1 week vacation. During 3 nights, I cried like I haven't cried in years. On the last night, things got so bad that I was essentially paralyzed.

I was laying next to my boyfriend who was trying to talk to me and calm me down. Although I wanted to, I could not say a single word. I was completely unable to move. Whenever he moved my head or arms, they would stay put exactly as he positioned them.

I was in this state for 1.5 hours. I don't remember most of what he said. I had no thoughts. I just completely disconnected from the world. After a while, I managed to move the fingertips on my left hand. And 30 minutes later, I was able to stand up (after he literally moved my body to helped me sit).

The next day, we woke up at 10.30. And from then on, I stayed awake. 

Until 23.30 the next day. I literally didn't sleep for 37 hours. I didn't even feel tired. 

I felt ... elated. It's as if something that had been making me tired for weeks, has suddenly been lifted off my shoulders, and it provided me with an extra boost of energy. Like, the usual exhaustion was gone, and with nothing to exhaust me, I just stayed awake.

Has anyone else experienced something like this?
Are there any terms that could describe what I went through?

First time posting here btw.",16Nov2020,2
305,"Im a 25 year old male. I enjoy making music and art, and hanging out with friends and spoiling my girlfriend. She deserves it, she had a hard upbringing.

So in January I was working at my old job at a grocery store. I liked my job and all my coworkers were great plus I worked with my younger brother and we always had a blast. My manager used the speaker system to call me to the office which is something they do regularly when they want to tell you something. I dropped what I was working on and headed to the office. When I got there i saw two official looking guys. One holding a leather bound notepad thing. They asked me if they could ask me some questions and I realized they were investigators. I asked what it was about and they asked me if I knew a certain family. I said no because i didnt remember their last name. They kept asking me questions about the family and then I remembered that I did know them. My ex had been close with the family and considered them her uncle/cousins. I asked what it was all about and they still wouldn't tell me. I said that if they wouldn't tell me that I wouldn't answer any more questions. At that point he told me to put my hands behind my back and proceeded to handcuff me. I asked him what for and I was shaking and afraid but I let him cuff me. He said sexual assault of a minor and i said who? And he said the name of my exes 'cousin'.

I had stayed at these people's house, in the basement with my ex for two nights. My ex had invited me over there while she stayed there. I had spoken to the girl who was 11 at the time only a couple times. I barely knew her. But she always seemed a little too friendly and made me slightly uncomfortable. She had also randomly come up to me and told me some guy threatened to rape her and I was like oh.... I didnt know what to say to that.
Now her dad is a gun-nut ultra patriot, which is fine I guess but he also sells drugs for sexual favors to women around town. I saw weed and pills in his house and I was told about the sexual favors. So hes a shady dude. A big loud guy who goes to church but also sells drugs. So that's the kind of family they are.

Anyway. Skip back to the grocery store. I start freaking out and asking them for proof, but they just tell me to not resist arrest. They take me out of my work in handcuffs and there are three police SUVs out front and like 6 cops. They had found where I work because a friend of the girls dad had messaged me and asked me what I'd been up to lately. I assumed he was just being chatty. They searched me and put me in the cop car and drove me away to the jail. I started crying and trying to talk to the police. But they just ignored me pretty much. They strip searched me, and put me in an isolation cell. I collapsed on the floor crying and screaming for hours. I have a fear of being alone, and a history of self harm and depression and with this on top of it I cried and cried non stop for hours and hours. I'm a grown man, its not easy to admit. My heart was crushed, I didnt know what was going on. They gave me one phone call of 5 minutes after a while and I immediately called my parents. I tried to explain to them everything quickly but at that point I hadn't been told anything other than what the cops said.
They had me talk to a psychiatrist. She evaluated that I was suicidal which I told her I WAS NOT. They stripped me naked, took my blanket and bed and put me in a itchy green vest, the ""the turtle suit"". There I lay alone for about a day and a half. Endlessly crying, for my family, and my amazing girlfriend who I love so much. Screaming and asking why???
Then they had me do a video conference call with the judge.
He set my bail to $25,000 dollars. And charged me with first degree sexual assault of a minor under 11. The pentaly? 25-60 years in federal prison.
I could barely make it back to my cell. I collapsed on the floor when they brought me back.
So they gave me the police report, and I read it, hardly believing what i was reading. The girl was 14 now, and was claiming that 2 years prior, while staying at her house, I came upstairs and raped her when she was sleeping on their living room couch.
My parents scraped together money. And my aunt took out of her retirement money to bail me out. But I didnt really feel any better. I tried to go back to work but I quit half way through and went to live with my parents. I loked myself in my room and spent my days just starting at my computer playing video games and drinking heavily. I cried all the time and my felt so bad. Everything had changed all of a sudden in my life.
The court case still hasn't been dropped almost a year later. The judge wants it to go to trial. The girls twin sister was sleeping in the living room too on the night she is claiming this happened. She sister told the police she didnt hear or see anything happen. Both her parents would have been in their room and there was like 3 other kids plus my girlfriend downstairs all staying there that night. Everyone they interviewed said she hadn't said anything about it until she went to her school counselor on a day that they were talling about sexual assault at her school. Theres no evidence whatsoever. Her medical reports from a few months after say no signs of any sexual activity. Yet the judge won't dismiss the case. He wants a jury to decide.
Now I live by myself in a hotel and have a good job. My relationship with my incredible beautiful and wonderful girlfriend is extremely strained. I think about dying a lot. I think about the girl every single day. I cant figure out why she is doing this to me. I cant understand how a 14 year girl old can be so heartless and evil. I assume she is doing this for attention. Both her parents have threatened to shoot me. I only live about a half hour from them.
I toss and turn at night, when I wake up I think of her. When I am at work it creeps into my brain and it is hard to focus. My girlfriend and I were going to get married this year. But everything is on hold. My whole life is on hold. It feels like I have a terminal illness. And I know what they do to rapists in prison. I know how they treat them. I'd probably be treated the same way if I ended up there. It feels like the end of my life.

Has anyone been through anything similar?
Any advice or thoughts on the case?",16Nov2020,10

307,"I know this isnt the place and that i wont get a definitive  answer but anyway.

februrary 2019 i went to the hospital because i couldnt sleep and was having intrusive thoughts (eyes being slashed by razors and this kinda of thing) and i also was angry all the time, and have thoughts of inflicting violence upon other people, i always had these desires but they were generally directed at people that reminded me of people that hurt me, when i began my treatment the doctor said i might be schizophrenic  and gave me prozac for my depression and  respridone  (antipsychotic), one year later it seems that this medic didnt care about me or something, all he did was prescribe more meds that he didnt know if they were working or not, so i tried getting into a place here in my  town, there i would get better appointments  and acess to meds, but the doctor there said i wasnt ""fit"" to be there since they deal with more dire cases there, anyway i was off meds again (treating the ones i loved like crap) and wanting to kill people but this time it didnt matter that they didnt resemble the ones that hurt me, like  fantasizing about mass shooting or putting bombs in places (dont worry i dont have access to any firearm nor do i know how to make bombs) but the desire was there, i told the doctor all this for 10 minutes and she just said i was impulsive but i had it under control, the problem is that i didnt care about these people that i wanted  to hurt, there was no empathy, to be honest  i kinda lost  sympathy for most people ( i still love some members of my family and 1 friend)

i just dont know what to make of these things, when you talk to me irl im just a regular a guy on the outside (save sometimes i go back and forth because when i went forward i had a bad thought so i have to go back to ""nullify"" the thought) apart from what i mentioned i pass a normal person even tho i have these violent thoughts.

308,"I don't really understand what is happening to me, but maybe someone can relate?

For a while now, I've been noticing that I tend to forget that other people are real. I talk to them, I interact with them and they exist. But then suddenly I remember that they also exist while I'm not around and it scares me. Or if I don't talk to someone for a while, I kinda forget they exist.

The thought that everyone else around me is as real as I am, experiencing life just as I am, scares me so much. Whenever it comes up, I have to push it away and ignore it to continue functioning.

I don't use people, I don't view them as objects. But it terrifies me that they are real and I almost can't really grasp what that even means because it scares me so much.

309,"(Kinda serious) Covid 19 mentalHey people of Reddit, recently with the U.K. we have all gone into this lockdown and before this lockdown i finally became well disciplined and was making a lot of progress with the gym and learning to drive which have been my main goals and I was a lot happier, which I struggled with a lot previously as to put it bluntly I’ve had a really difficult year this year (failing 3 driving tests, losing family members, relationships falling apart, losing money and hours at my job, got out of shape etc.). but finally as I start to pull myself together and plow through it and find that sense of achievement I’ve needed to keep me busy it’s kind of all just been thrown back at my face like a massive ‘fuck you!!’ With this new lockdown situation happening.  Now I just feel everything slipping again and all my progress going to waist and it almost feels inevitable, I even struggle with more basic stuff now and lack motivation heavily as I was quite disciplined before hand and a lot more happier and to be honest cared about myself quite a bit more but now I just kind of have the fuck it attitude and really struggle to find the effort to care anymore this also really affects my self esteem as I can be quite confident, charismatic and well put together and that’s who I want to be but it just feels like I’m constantly being set back by shit that isn’t in my control and I really don’t know what to do with it anymore.

One particular instance is my boy cousin(26), I love him dearly but he says shit that really piss me off bc I think after the fact that they’re offensive, maybe? He has this i’m right all the time tone and he doesn’t see it bc well in my opinion he’s a man. He thinks he isn’t that “bad” bc he’s a POC, but the things he says really make me not want to hang out with him. Like this one time, my cousins and I were all hanging out and my other girl cousin had her black boyfriend in the room because she didn’t want my uncle to see him. And my boy cousin says, “who cares j**’s (me) boyfriend is her” in which my cousin and i respond with “she’s my GIRLFRIEND” “she’s her GIRLFRIEND” i know he isn’t homophobic, but he says shit like this that piss me off. at the moment i didn’t over react and just let it go but then i’ve been thinking about it ever since. I don’t know if it’s just me that’s being hypersensitive or that was just so insensitive. My gf isn’t girly and is labeled as “the man” in the relationship which is total bs bc we’re BOTH girls.

313,"I'm a 16 year old high school senior in the US. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for over 2 years, but my mental health has gotten to its lowest point lately.

I had a suicide attempt about a week ago. These past few months I've barely been eating, showering, or taking basic care of myself. If I'm not in class, I probably spend all my time online or gaming to distract myself from everything. I have at least 2 small mental breakdowns a day.

I'm usually a very good student but for the first time in my life I've been missing classes due to oversleeping, not handing in assignments, doing badly on tests, etc. It's affected my college application process. 

I am so burnt out and so defeated. Every waking moment is hard no matter how much I try to adopt a positive mindset. 

But I can still get out of bed in the morning and if I really push myself I can hand in assignments or concentrate for short periods of time, like how I am writing this post. It feels really dramatic and selfish of me to want to go to the hospital because in certain moments it feels like I am alright or like it’s not that bad.

Most of the teens who share their experience there say it was horrible and that they were treated like animals. Also, my parents aren't supportive and I know they will take it the wrong way or see me in a different light if I go. Not to mention, I would miss several school days and be even more behind.

im just so tired all the time. i dont really feel anything of particular substance, mild interests in vapid topics, distractions in the form of music, movies or videogames, thats all it ever really is. i dont have anyone, i did once, a long time ago, but not anymore. much of the time if i let my thoughts alone they wander back to when things felt like they mattered a little more, just because i thought i had someone to share it all with. now i pay people to talk about my problems, take pills that smell like paint, pursue a career i dont care about, and move on like everything is fine. all those sessions and programs i got put through to help with my mental state gave me skills to keep me stable, but i dont want to just be stable, i want to be happy. is that too much to ask? the good times pass just as quickly as the bad, it all feels so pointless, like trying to get a grip on running water. i just wish the people that mattered would stay, just so i could feel like i was living life again, instead of whatever this is. i keep waiting for it to get better, talking to people to maybe find someone else, it all just feels like running from the truth. like im moving towards an outcome i cant avoid, and no matter what i do i cant pull myself out of the riptide, i always just rebound back into it. i fucking hate it, i fucking hate being so tired, i fucking hate forcing myself to move. it never goes away, you can only distract from it. i hope this is coherent, does anyone else feel similarly? would be nice to feel less alone for a minute.",16Nov2020,2
