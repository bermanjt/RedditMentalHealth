0,"I'll be changing therapists soon and the idea of ""starting over"" seems so frustrating. what do you think is the best way to ""catch up"" the new therapist? if that makes sense",22Aug2020,1
1,How do I tell my therapist I think I have Borderline personality disorder? I have definitely done my research and the symptoms align but how would I go about telling her. I’m nervous because mental illness has become such a “trend” especially amongst people my age. I am also nervous because of the stigma around people w/ BPD specifically being difficult but I honestly really want help because Idk if I can keep doing this. And lastly because BPD is such a difficult thing to diagnose.,22Aug2020,1
2,"Many times in the past I felt this way about myself given how I act around people that are my friends or potential live interests. I care about these people and save I love them but the way that other people show love and embrace others and have intimacy with their significant others doesn’t match up to how I am.

My ex accused me of being cold and asked me once if I hated him. I’ve never been the cutesy, lovey dovey type of person and I connect with people through similar ideas- on an intellectual level, if you will. 

I’m only really intimate and loving per say when I’m aroused and interacting with someone sexually.

I didn’t hug much a child, only doing it because it socially acceptable and because I would receive them from people. 

My friend just told me today that he doesn’t feel love from me. I’ve known him for 3 years and we have kept in touch well throughout those years and I never thought I neglected that aspect of our friendship. 

There are times when I psychoanalyze myself and think I’m pretty selfish at times; I readily tell people about my problems but I’m not as willing to hear what ails others. I honestly don’t think I have as much of a care. I hate to say it because it makes me sound like an asshole but especially with my depression and how cynical I can be, I’m not too surprised. 

I care and give advice to people as if it’s an exercise to share knowledge. I want to help them but I also like informing people of something they don’t know and knowing that someone’s situation is better or improved because of my advising them.

Even with my ex, I waited for the special feeling of being “IN love” and I’m not sure if I ever felt that with him. I sort of just like having the company of another person, talking about deep things, and having sex with him... I got over the 6-month relationship ending within a week and believe I was only sad during that time because of the fear of loneliness.

I don’t know if I’m holding back that emotion or if I exercise it in a different way than others or if I’m not as capable of feeling it. I will say that I absolutely love my two cats as if they were my children. I always connected with animals more as they usually have an unconditional love for you, are more loyal, and don’t judge you for who you are. They are like children who can’t speak to me. I’ve said many times that I’d die for them and I would get beyond pissed if someone laid a finger in them in an attempt to hurt them but never have thought I could go to the same extent with friends and even family...

I’m not sure if I’m just different or if there’s some psychological thing the matter with me...",22Aug2020,1

4,"I've never had any friends in real life, always a loner. But I'm glad I found some really nice people on the internet.

Anything good about myself I sit and think 'we'll that's not hard to do. Everyone does this.' Which inevitably takes any worth away from that quality. I consistently see more bad then good, and fail to see any bright aspect about myself. Its like and endless void that continues to grow as the days go on.",22Aug2020,1

7,"I (17F) feel like there’s something wrong with me.

Emotionally, I feel completely numb from happiness. My only expressions right now are anger, anxiety, and sadness. I guess I explain it as, my brain is turned on but my heart is off. 

I sometimes make logical estimates for what I should be feeling when telling people how i feel about them or when people ask me how I am. It can seem like there’s an emotional part of me that’s cut off from my conscious self and that’s why I got upset over my recent break up, but I had no feelings for her whatsoever. 

I spoke to a psychiatrist a couple days ago and he said it was a personality type. “You’re trying to figure out where you fit in in the world.” I have no problem fitting in, I just don’t feel like a real person where my decisions matter. I seem less real the more I realize that I’m not feeling anything. I can’t picture a realistic future because it doesn’t feel like I’ll even have one

When my friends tell me they love me, I can’t feel that connection. They could be lying, they could be telling the truth, it means nothing to me. It doesn’t register that if I am friends with them, that means they HAVE to be friends with me too. Even with my family, they say they love me, and it makes sense, but I’m not connected to that. 

It’s not because I have a bad self image either, I just cannot view myself. I look different to myself every time I look in the mirror, and my opinions of my capabilities and my strengths/weaknesses can change so rapidly. 

I’ve been in therapy for almost a year, and I seem no closer to an answer. I’m ready to give up. One of my previous therapists made me take an evaluation for BPD and while the scoring 32 and up was considered severe (I scored in the 40s) she just ignored it. It’s not an illness I’d say I have, and I didn’t even go through some of my other mental health issues, but it’s like no mental health processional treats this seriously because I’m a teenager and they think it’s just mood. I just want to get closer to an idea of what’s going on with me. 

TLDR; I’m emotionally shut off and I have been for years, why can’t I feel love from/to others?",22Aug2020,1
8,"I've struggled with anxiety since I was 17. My senior year of high school I had panic attacks and so much anxiety but didn't get help. College it was more well managed but I definitely had some really hard times and my poor roommates dealt with my night terrors. 

About a year and a half ago I started seeing a really awesome therapist when things started getting hard again. We've talked in the past about trying out meds, but we never ended up going through with it (for a variety of reasons).

Well, today I talked with my therapist and told her I've had 2 panic attacks this week (I'm a teacher with a pre-existing health condition, and students will be back on campus starting Monday). Before this week, I've had panic attack in the past year. We decided to give meds a try. I got on the phone with my primary care, and within an hour my pharmacy had Zoloft and Ativan ready for me. I can't lie... I'm a little anxious about taking them (yeah, yeah, I get the irony).

14,"Hello, I’m (23F) finally getting therapy after I should have gotten it so many years ago. I was raped by a close relative at age 6, and my parents kind of pretended that it never happened. Coming from an Asian household, I’m sure that it has to do with culture as well, because my family always just acts as if problems don’t exist. I forgot about it till I started sexual education classes at school. My mom was a tiger mom growing up. She wanted to become a dancer and that’s how I started taking dance classes. She would always try to “teach” me even if she didn’t have more experience than I did, and I never got to practice on my own because she would always be up my ass, telling me what to do, and slapping me if I didn’t do things her way. When I started considering to compete for it at age 7, she never let me go and play with my friends anymore. I never got validation from my parents. Fast forward to now, I’m constantly trying to please people, and fix other people’s problems for them. I’m always so unhappy because people don’t go out of their way to help me, like I do for them. I constantly feel used. I finally signed up for therapy on Monday, but I feel like I don’t even know where to start. I don’t even have an inner dialogue and I’m terrified that my therapist will judge me for my rape, because that’s what my first ever therapist did last year.",22Aug2020,1

19,"I’m very confused about what’s been happening and need some help understanding.

To preface, I’m a twenty year old female with a history of anorexia and depression. I was displaced due to COVID and went from Australia to Canada with just the clothes on my back, after being given about 48 hours notice and having to sell everything I owned. I couldn’t get back to my own island I’m Canada so my boyfriends family took me into their home in a different province after only three weeks of dating, all of which had been during the beginning of COVID restrictions. Safe to say, it’s been a stressful six months.

These symptoms had happened before, but the past three weeks have me actually scared:
- Oftentimes feeling like I’m outside of my body. I have thoughts that are completely abnormal and it’s like I’m aware I’m thinking them but am incapable of changing my thought trajectory. Things like today, “what’s the point of being on the earth, it doesn’t matter.” I’m not suicidal??
- Suddenly being confused about where I am and who I’m with. I was falling asleep two days ago and suddenly got petrified because I didn’t recognize my own room and forgot how I got there.
- I’ll sometimes look at my boyfriend and literally think, “who are you and why are you hugging me?” Like I know he’s [name] but then I’ll be so confused because I’ll forget he’s dating me and forget why he’s next to me. 
- I lose all emotions for about thirty seconds. Not sure how to explain it, but I just stop being happy, sad, anything that I had been two seconds before and mainly just stare into space. 

Not sure if it’s relevant but I also have laugh attacks. The most unfunny or mundane things strike a cord and I laugh like an idiot to the point of pain. I literally try to force myself to stop laughing to the point where I’m crying because I feel so OUT of control.

23,"Last week, I discussed some of the cultural reasons for why [conflict was so terrifying for me as an Asian American](https://heem.substack.com/p/when-the-fear-of-conflict-meets-collectivism). But conflict in general can be intimidating for many reasons:

* It requires vulnerability.
* It tests the relationship between two people.
* It can end up being verbally, emotionally, or even physically painful.

However, conflict doesn’t have to be bad and it doesn’t always have to damage a relationship.

Conflict can be good. It can get people on the same page and prevent future misunderstandings from happening. It can even strengthen a relationship. In this way, there is freedom in embracing healthy conflict.

# My Friend Bob

I had a friend in seminary who was also in the Pastoral Care and Counseling program. One day, he got upset with one of the professors. He felt like the professor was a hypocrite and that the professor didn’t care about him. Because of this, Bob refused to forgive him until the professor apologized.

Bob ended up venting to me everyday in class for over month. He stewed in his anger and with each passing day, it grew worse. His frustration was palpable. It manifested in the way he slouched in his chair in class and the anger he had when he talked about the professor.

But here’s the thing. The professor had no idea that he had offended Bob. So Bob was essentially stuck in an endless cycle of anger and bitterness without an exit strategy. The professor wasn’t going to apologize because he wasn’t aware of what was going on!

Eventually I encouraged Bob to confront the professor and said, “Why don’t you talk to him about it? He has no idea that you feel this way. You’re holding him to a standard he isn’t aware of and you’re blaming him for not living up to it which is making you angrier. I’m sure he’d apologize if you brought it up.”

Watching Bob struggle like this was painful for me. Why? Because I was (am) Bob.

There have been several times in my life where I’ve held onto bitterness and have regretted it. I wasted so much time and energy being mad that it robbed me of my opportunity to enjoy life.

Had I only embraced conflict and not been so terrified of it, the quicker I could’ve resolved it and gotten more out of life. Looking back, there were several occasions where I had wasted years of a relationship due to a simple misunderstanding.

For example in High School, I had a close friend named James. He was a huge Lakers fan and I was a huge Clippers fan. I made a really dumb comment about Kobe and we ended up not talking for an entire year until he approached me to bury the hatchet. What a silly reason to miss out on a year’s worth of friendship!

Avoiding conflict has robbed me of many wonderful opportunities. But embracing it has given me the freedom to experience them.

## The Freedom of Embracing Conflict

By choosing conflict, several things happen:

1. You communicate that you care enough to fight for the relationship.
2. You stand up for yourself.
3. You create opportunities to strengthen the relationship.

When I was in therapy, there were a few rocky moments that occurred. One of them was when I felt like my therapist broke a promise he made with me. The week before, we had run out of time when I was processing something difficult and he assured me that he would bring it up first thing in our next session. Unfortunately, he ended up forgetting.

Because of this, my trust in him was slightly broken. I was hurt because I felt like maybe my issue wasn’t important enough for him to remember.

But the funny thing is, I was mentally aware that I was being very overly sensitive. He probably had several clients that week. He’s also human and so he should be allowed to make mistakes. If I really wanted to talk about the issue, I should be the one to bring it up. But it still bothered me so I decided to confront him.

At first I was scared. I didn’t want to further ruin the relationship because I was making a fuss over something so small. I was ashamed of how I felt. But it was important for me to give a voice to my feelings and so I confronted him.

When he apologized, the relationship was very quickly repaired and my trust in him grew even stronger. After that, I was able to go deeper in our sessions because I felt safe. Also, the other times he made a mistake didn’t affect me as much because our relationship was more secure.

By embracing conflict, I was able to clear the air and get on the same page. I was also able to stand up for myself by giving my feelings a voice. And finally, I felt the boldness and the freedom to go deeper in my sessions with my therapist.

26,"Very ashamed of a phase I went through a couple

A couple of months ago I went through a phase where I was obsessively copying my brothers friends personalities. At the time I was kind of an idiot and I was hanging out with bad people who had no aspirations whatsoever, to be honest I didn’t have much aspirations myself. My brothers friends were all really cool and funny people and were all in a band an I was developing an interest for music so I really looked up to them. 

Honestly I didn’t know who i was, all I knew was who I didn’t want to be and who I wanted to be. I had very low self esteem so I never trusted my own judgement. I would follow them on Spotify and only listen to music that they listened to. Probably because I thought it would make me more like them. I also started trying to dress like them. Do everything like them! I would always ask my brother questions about them and figure out irrelevant things about them so I could copy. 

A few months later things look a lot better for me. I’ve kinda gone my own way and started to build my own personality and feel comfortable I’m still very interested in music and I play guitar and bass. I still really look up to them but in a healthier way. 

However lately, I’ve been feeling very ashamed about this whole copycat phase of mine. Even though I’m kind of done with it for the most part, I keep thinking how creeped out they would be or how much respect they’d lose for me if they found out about it (which I know they won’t) but still I keep looking at myself as a weird desperate person and it’s not helping with my self esteem. 

Do you think what I did was creepy? Do you think you might have any idea why I might’ve gone through this phase? And should I really be ashamed of it right now?",22Aug2020,1

28,"So, first of all... Thank you in advance for listening and not judging. And I'm glad places like this exist. 

I have had a lot of mental health issues most of my life, but they got worse during high school. I'll save you the sob story, but I grew up with a family that made me feel like no matter what I did I would never do it right or reach their level of success. 

During school I would write stories about guys I had crushes on, focused on Disney and musical theater to make me feel less alone and ignore the bullying.

When I went to college things went well, until they didn't. I didn't get the help I needed and things got worse and worse. I had to get my parents help and things were semi normal for a little bit. 

Fast forward a few years, and I don't know if this happens to any of you, but when I found my now fiance...I realized that I've been masking. I am self diagnosed autistic, and after being able to talk through things with my autistic fiance and doing some research, I figured out that I've been just doing what I think I'm supposed to do. 

Let me explain a bit. I now know that I can't handle a 'normal' job. I get way too anxious about dealing with rude people, I have depression so it's hard to keep up with being on time, etc. But for most of my adult life, I had jobs, and even some for several years. So my mother and others in my life don't believe my troubles and my issues because I could press them down and get through them in the past and can't now. Other examples are: I now wear headphones almost everywhere I go when the noise is too much, I need to have a schedule and get overwhelmed when it changes too much. 

To end my three page story of a post, it's hard to feel like I'm a good adult by most people's standards. I know I shouldn't care, but part of me does. I can't make a lot of money, as I help my fiance but can't hold a job. I don't put too much attention into what I wear and putting on make up, and I can't handle my own mother when it comes to even semi hard to have conversations.  

I'm kind of bad at being negative too much and I'm working on that. I met my fiance, who I drove 29 hours from where I was living to be with, met on here funnily enough, and she has helped me become who I truly am meant to be. She helps me when I'm down, when I feel like I'll never be enough, and I'm so lucky that she's in my life. So I'm very very lucky to have her.

31,"Body Dysmorphia and the fitness industry

Body Dysmorphia is a mental health condition in which one has a negatively distorted view of one’s physical appearance. It is a condition that affects many young men and women today, and it largely has to do with distorted views/images pushed onto us by social media. Today, I am sharing a bit of my own experience with body dysmorphia. 

I studied martial arts from a very young age, but was never particularly athletic nor strong. Nevertheless, I never let my lack of physical strength bother me. However, because I wanted to join the Marines, it became necessary for me to meet certain strength thresholds. 

Naturally, I began to do more research on the Internet, and quickly found myself caught up in the world of fitness scams. Brawny men with road map vascularity and boulder shoulders promising that you can look just like then in just three months if you follow their program/supplement routine. As a naive boy, I believed what was being pushed onto me and began following their advice. 

However, as the months went by, I was never even remotely close to looking like them nor meeting my strength goals. I followed their advice (though I couldn’t afford supplements at the time) for years, but only found myself incurring injuries. I was disheartened but I also didn’t quit training as I eventually found my way trying to attend West Point to become a commissioned officer. 

As it turns out, the reason those guys look the way they do isn’t because of the supplements and training routines they push onto you; it’s because of the dangerous substances they take. As my knowledge of medical science expanded, I also began to realize those physiques were extremely unhealthy. 

The huge bulging veins, dry grainy striated muscles, and paper thin skin are actually signs of high blood pressure and dehydration. The wide backs and 3D capped shoulders aren’t a result of “extra wide gripped pull-up’s” (that’s actually a good way to injure your shoulders), they’re a result of the dangerous anabolic substances they take because androgen receptors are highly prolific in the shoulders and back. 

The skipping leg day memes aren’t because of skipping leg day, but moreover skipping the initial training process. The way you can tell someone has been taking those dangerous substances is by observing the rapid growth in their shoulders and back (traps in particular). 

Yet, because of the way social media glorifies those physiques, I subconsciously thought those physiques were the goals I needed to reach. When I finally had money to spend, I bought whatever supplements were being pushed out in hopes of achieving said physiques. It was an extremely toxic mindset that I had to overcome. 

Over my many years of training, I have managed to attain excellent results. But it’s not because of magic pills or a special training routine. It’s because of the many years of hard work and dedication I put towards training. 

After I got into West Point, I knew the lives of other men and women would be counting on me one day, so I never once faltered in my training. 
I trained 3 hours nearly every day for over 4 years, as I dreamed of one day becoming a Special Forces Officer. 

Sadly, that dream never came to be. I will admit, finding the motivation to train after you’ve lost your life’s dream is pretty difficult. I’ve definitely gained a lot of fat lately and am currently 6’0 210 lbs. 

But it’s because of this slight step backwards, I managed to finally gain a deeper insight to my own body dysmorphia. 

I looked back at photos close to my prime physique (about 6% body fat), and started thinking, “damn, I was way more chiseled than I remember.” I also thought about my own mindset back then of still thinking I was simultaneously too fat and too skinny. (Too much belly fat, arms too skinny). 

I don’t have many photos of my physique then. I was traveling the United States to officially visit every state. I wanted train at various martial arts dojo’s and have fun at casinos since I was finally 21 years old. I didn’t really care about taking progress photos. I only really have one that I took for the woman I was dating at the time as a tease for my return. There are also other photos I took close to that peak level in the months prior, such as the one time I took one just to goof around. 

But looking back now, I was in amazing shape. Sure, I’ll never have capped 3D shoulders with road map vascularity, but so what? I don’t need to! I’m perfectly healthy the way I am. 

I know that even now, although I see myself as fat, the reality is that it’s mostly just my mind playing tricks on me. 

Many other young men and women are affected by body image disorders, and I just wanted to remind everyone that most of what gets pushed out on social media is a facade. The physiques those Insta models have aren’t a result of squats and the supplements they push out. They’re a result of plastic surgery, distorted camera angles, filters, and photoshop. Also, you definitely don’t have to look like them to be attractive. Everyone is attracted to different things, but the norm has been twisted by dishonest marketing tactics. With that being said, this should not deter you from training. You should train to be the best/healthiest version of yourself. 

I never posted a photo of my prime physique nor will I take professional photos of my body because the purpose of my social media page isn’t to create a glorified, distorted image of myself. My purpose on social media is to share my work and teach life lessons based upon my experiences, whether that be from success or failure. 

I’m posting a photo of my prime physique because I want to provide tangible evidence for what you can achieve with hard work and dedication. A lot of people nowadays think that I’m some sort of prodigy, but that’s definitely not it. I was a very ordinary boy, who didn’t have much to eat growing up. (That $1.60 school lunch was my favorite time of the day since it meant I got to eat something decent). 

However, I had dreams of serving the Nation in honorable service, and never gave up on that dream. I am a warrior born from fighting countless battles across many different worlds. But in terms of talent? I’d say I was born with a mere power level of two! 

The thing is, you don’t need talent to do great things. All you need is a great mindset with willpower and conviction. You’re great just the way you are, but remember to always strive to be the best version of yourself. 
I hope reading this has been eye-opening and wish y’all the best of luck in your own journeys! Feel free to share your thoughts and own experiences. 

As always, thanks for reading.

32,"Ever since I was 6 and knew of my great grandmother’s passing, I’ve had death anxiety. It started when I was 6, went away until I went through a breakup, which caused me to have a depressive episode over the course of 6 months. It’s been popping up every now and then, but sometimes I feel helpless and scared when I have existential crises before I sleep and when I wake up. I used to have them while I showered and I cried because I was so scared of my thoughts. If anyone has gone through the same fears I have, could you please help me cope with my struggle? ;(",22Aug2020,1
33,"Ever since I was a kid I had deep rooted issues. I've had really bad anxiety and depression. I didn't realize that feeling so depressed wasn't normal. I thought that was just how being a person was like. I was hopeless and I couldn't feel happy at all. I was so deeply unhappy I couldn't connect with other kids, and I became severely insecure. I lashed out, I lied constantly, and I was extremely manipulative. I could only get friends after I manipulated them. I became so rapped up in my unhappiness that it transformed into intense anger and spite. I became intensely selfish in search of anything to make me happy. I tricked one of my only two friends into giving me 80 dollars in first grade. My two sibilings didn't like me and I lashed out because they were harder to control, so I threatened them and did a lot of things to regain a semblance of control. I started using fear as a tool to gain control. I was always larger and I did karate. I threatened people a lot. But the main thing was manipulation, I was extremely good at it and it was a constant in my behavior. I would plan ahead and use a remarkable amount of patience for a small child. I would let small lies slip do people thought I was a bad lier, they thought they saw through me so thry trusted me, but they were wrong. I was a remarkable liar. However deep down I had a lot of compassion, I could never lay a hand on another person. As I matured I starting realizing that I had problems that needed fixing, and that what I was doing was wrong. I gained a heavy amount of self hatred. In second grade and further I met two best friends. We did everything together. But I believed so deeply that I was a horrible person that I couldn't understand why someone would like spending time with me ir want to be my friend. I  started getting extremely paranoid, I began thi king they only would hang around me because they were afraid of me, so they wanted my favor to protect themselves. I began thinking everything they did was to trick me. I manipulated them and pulled them back in forth. I was awful, but they still stayed my friends. I couldn't comprehend why. As I got older I discovered music and I found out what it ment to be happy. I started forming an identity and getting better. I learned how to relate to my friends in another way then fear, but I didn't use it for a long time. I began exerting myself again to make my friends feel afraid of me because I was mentally rejecting the sensation of acceptance. I started forming more delusions that everyone hated me, and people who were nice to me were just lying, they still hated me.Then one of my best friends outed me to the whoke school, I got bullied a lot, and another best friend tried to commit s*icide. My depression got so awful and I could only stop the bullying by lashing out, using my intelligence to insult and manipulate and threaten my bullies until they were to scared to mess with me. I truly believed I was a terrible person. I had always thought about s*icide but I was closest then. I couldn't hane the amount of lain I was in so I started lying and making up reasons as to why I was so miserable. I wove so many lies and created fake evidence that eventually it started becoming difficult to tell what was a lie and what was true. I barely knew what was real. I had been r*ped by an ex boyfriend, but sometimes I don't know if that was real either. I'm so grateful I have good parents and a good home because I think I could've become a violent person without that. I worry about my sanity. I'm doing better and I don't intentionally manipulate or lie anymore. But I've noticed how much toxic behavior is engrained in me. I have so many deep seated delusions. I started reading up on personality disorders after seeing a Hello Future Me video on the psychology of Azula from Avatar the Last Airbender. I was terrified when I related to the symptoms of the personality disorders. I've been reading now and I'm going to talk to my therapist now. I'm now on depression meds so hopefully I get better in that aspect. Sorry for the rant but I had to get that off my chest.",22Aug2020,1

I go out in public, I avoid any kind of contact what so ever with people because I get these thoughts saying ""don't look at them or you will look like a creep"" so even glancing at them and it will mess with me for so long.

After I get home I will think ""what if I was staring at that persons ass, or what if I was looking at them creepy. Or what if they went past me and I touched them innapropriately.""


Or if I ride my bike, I get these thoughts when I get home like ""what if I rode close to that person and looked like I was trying to hurt them or scare them"".


Things like that. I'm terrified of being recorded because I have a fear that I will say something creepy and ruin my life.

I'm constantly thinking about recordings of myself that friends took, or just random people and thinking what if I did something weird in it that will ruin my life.

38,"I have sensory issues that my boyfriend tends to trigger. 

Tonight when i got upset bc he was triggering me and he ignored my pleas for him to stop, he suggested we use a safe word so he knows when i’m being serious vs. joking. 

Note: I told him what he was doing that overwhelms me and that i was overwhelmed. 

Not even 10 minutes later he starts doing more stuff that triggers me, i use the safeword. He stops for like a couple minutes but keeps doing it. I had to use the safeword 3 times and leave the room. He said he didn’t understand what he was doing that was  upsetting me. I pointed out to him i had to use the safeword multiple times for him to actually respect it. 

Que 20 minutes later. We’re watching a show, i’m not really paying attention. He turns the volume on my computer to max which is extremely loud. I get really upset and basically ask how he could do that to me, knowing i’m already overwhelmed and knowing it would upset me. 

We’re in separate rooms now but i think he’s upset w me bc i wasn’t paying attention to the show. It’s been at least 30 minutes and i still feel sensitive due to the over stimulation. 

How can i make it clear to him that i don’t think what he did was okay?


FOR CONTEXT: i get very easily overstimulated by noise. Full blown panic attacks. I can also get overwhelmed by essentially any of the senses including touching.  When i originally confronted him i brought up that him doing things loudly in my ear (literally) was upsetting and him touching me in his jokes (hell like lay on me, press his hands/face on me, “hold” me down) was overwhelming.

I have this big problem that I don't know how to tackle. I'm 31. I've made bad decisions and I was lost during the last decade, mainly because I never had any confidence that I could amount to anything or that I deserved anything good. At 29 I started to realize I could get better and I went back to school, got my degree, and settled down with a great bf. 

Now, even though I have said degree, I have been finding it extremely difficult to find a job. 

I've sent my resume to a bunch of places already, and have gone to multiple interviews but nothing comes out of it. As you know, the situation has worsened because of the virus.  I got a small job helping the wife of a relative, but because it's ""family"" I don't make a lot of money from it. 

I've come to realize recently that my biggest problem is that I don't really feel competent enough for a job in my field.  My bf says I have a major Impostor Syndrome, but I think it's also that I am not used to ""winning"". I've never dared, I've never gone after a big dream. I've tried to succeed in a couple of things that I liked in life but as soon as it gets difficult I quit. I think most people at this age have a thousand wins in their history, I have 0. And There's this feeling that I'm too old to catch up. That I'll never make it.  SO I get stuck in this infinite circle of negativity and self-deprecation because that's all my mind knows.  Am I being clear? It's difficult to understand it myself, but that's how I see it. 

&amp;#x200B;

So  I want to know if there's something I can do to shake off this mentality. I want to progress, I want to start chasing my goals, for the first time in my life I feel confident I can do better, but I need to know where to start and what to do to bring my own mind on my side.

57,"Hey, first time posting here, so forgive me if the flair is inappropriate or anything like that, I just need to talk.

TLDR; Am an introvert, despite having a small but really dedicated and caring friend group, and a loving family, I feel constantly alone in my life and want to make intimate connections but don't know how, any ideas on how to do so/where to look for help?

Yeah, so long story-long(?) I'm 19 and have never really struggled with any noticable depression before about December of last year, but ever since then I've just been experiencing a constant lack of energy and motivation but couldn't really figure out why, then in February, right after my birthday, I developed a numbing feeling of sadness that has only slowly grown since. 

My friend group has always been small, but extremely dedicated to one another, like ""if you need us at 3am then don't be afraid to call"" and ""our parents would freak if they heard us talk about that"" type of friends, like really good ones basically. Anyway, at the start of this year they really started getting into dating, which is cool, and luckily nothing about that really changed the dynamic of our group (so no-one feels like the ppl dating are abandoning us or anything like that), but I just started feeling really lonely when this all started. Like my friends just weren't enough anymore (thru no fault of their own tho) and I can't figure out why, though I suspect it has something to do with the lack of any real intimate connections in my life. 

 I want to be clear: I'm not about to pull some incel bs, this isn't anyone's fault, but just something I don't understand.
 I've never dated anyone in my life (other than a single lunch date with one of the friends mentioned) and really suck at ""people stuff"" on the whole, due to being an introvert. I just feel really upset at the thought of all my friends developing a deeper, and more intimate connection with someone (dating etc.) while I sit at home after work, wishing I had someone to care about and someone to care about me. 

Going out to a bar or anything (am legal drinking age here) isn't really a good option rn cause of Covid, and literally everyone I match with on Tinder ghosts me. So I don't know how to meet new people and make these connections, I mean like, today, as part of my now bi-weekly shower self-hatred sessions, I seriously contemplated just sitting by myself in the most depressed looking way possible in the college cafeteria until someone came up to me. Like, that's f-ing low. (Obv. Now that I'm thinking rationally again I realised what a sleazy and stupid idea that would have been but it just goes to show how desparetely my psyche wants this)

So I'm kinda shooting up a flare in the middle of the ocean rn, if anyone has any ideas on what I can do to help get over this mindset and/or help me develop the skills necessary to meet new people and make the types of connections I want to make, I would greatly appreciate it. 

I'm not trying to ask anyone to solve my problems for me but I just need some advice/support right now.

58,"
It has been a long 22 years. I have been heavily contemplating suicide for the last few months, and each new day spent thinking gets me closer to killing myself. Life looks like an uneven yard, and there are just too many holes to fill. I have so many questions that realistically might never be answered, one of them being ""did it really have to be like this?"" 

The last 10 years have been spent in fear. I am so goddamn afraid anymore. So deathly afraid of being alone I find myself posting on platforms such as Reddit to get attention and reassurance from people who literally do not even know me. I feel that alone speaks volumes. 

There are many things I still need to get out. Things I had never spoken about to anyone, or even fathom bringing up. This has been building up for such a long time and at this point the obvious cannot be denied. 

I was molested by 2 distant female cousins (they were both at least 16-17) after going up to Penn State to see a game. I was 12 and in 7th grade. I am a male by the way, just had no idea how to include that bit. They both made it seem so harmless and normal and I had just discovered what sex was by myself. I was afraid. So fucking afraid. But again they kept assuring me it was okay. They had me touch them and were touching me, took turns on top of me, I knew it was only a few minutes but it felt like hours. Then they shooed me away when it was all over and told me to go do something else. After that I tucked it away forcefully and decided to just forget about it. A few years later it hit me again like a brick wall and has never left. I feel so fucking disgusting. I was just their fucking vessel for pleasure. Fucking used. I guess I can say I've come to accept that the experience happened, but haven't been able to get over it.

When 8th grade rolled around I was incessantly bullied by 2 females. Both of which were my friends in the beginning of the school year. Eventually my other friends and the whole class would become a part of their fun. I wasn't fat then, still not now, but that was the big joke. I was just a fat useless fucking lard to everyone, and all they wanted to do was cut the fat right off of me. Sometimes it was my clothes ""where's the flood?"" because my grandmother fucked up my pantlegs when she hemmed them. Other times everyone would just pretend I didnt exist. There were many times where I spent the whole class silently crying with my head down. The walk to school was always so anxiety inducing I would already be crying by the time I got there. Was everyone going to hate me that day or was I going to make my friends laugh instead of being laughed at? Sometimes theyd get the whole class in on it and I wouldn't be able to talk to anyone even if I needed to. No one was there to defend me or be there for me.

During both of those years my relationship with my mother was speedily deteriorating, mainly because my grades were dropping and that was all she cared about. Constant arguing and screaming obviously never helped anyone in life, why the fuck would it help me? Why the fuck couldn't she just see that it was deeper than grades? I was always running away from home as home wasnt what it was meant to be. I ended up moving to my grandparents' house after 8th grade. 

Those years were when I began to try to get sympathy and positive attention from people. And these days i still fucking do it, such as posting on platforms like Reddit. I was depressed then but was in denial about it and still used it hoping my peers would stop calling me fat. That has just evolved into just wanting attention. 

My relationship with women as a whole has since been skewed. I dont hate them by any means, but i would be lying if I said I can trust any woman that walks into my life. I have never been able to maintain a healthy relationship with a woman because quite frankly I get attached way too quickly and begin to emotionally depend on them, pushing them away. Recently I had lost the one woman I truly thought was going to be my wife someday. I was good for a long time but somewhere along the line i lost it because I developed the fear that she was going to leave me. She left for the exact reasons I knew she would leave me for, but maybe that was partly my fault too. I was abusive and toxic to her in the end and that is something i cant forgive myself for considering she loved me more than anyone ever has.

Again, now 22, I can no longer find happiness by myself, looking to other people for happiness even if it is brief. 

The feelings of hopelessness are overwhelming, especially when I'm sitting alone in my room typing a Reddit post. No offense to you guys this is truly a great little operation. If you've made it this far, thank you for giving me the opportunity to say what I needed to say. There is so much regret and disdain I have for myself. My words don't do the feelings justice anymore. I am pitiful, I am ashamed, I am so fucking embarrassed, I am afraid and I am so desperately sorry for not being strong enough.",22Aug2020,1
59,"I've been trying to save up money for therapy for years. I went to a therapist in highschool and not only was the therapist just a bad fit for me but it caused us to go near broke while my mom had to struggle with money and the fact that her kid suddenly needed to go to therapy (it's not that she's not a good mom, I just don't talk to anyone about my issues much, I basically just told her out of the blue I needed a therapist) and I could tell she was beating herself up for some reason. She told me we needed to limit my visits because we couldnt afford it and I told her I didn't need to go anymore,  that I was okay. I wasnt okay but making us go broke over a therapist that wasn't helping me at all even though I was putting in effort on my side was making me feel infinitely worse. I decided I would fight off the bad thoughts and feelings until I could afford to go myself without needing to tell her. I graduated, went to college, got a job, moved out, but my job sucks, doesn't pay enough, and it was constant, and I mean constant, unexpected large expenses. Car broke down, tires popped, dog had to go to the vet multiple times, my boyfriend had to go to the emergency room twice, I had to go to the emergency room, rent was inflated constantly for a room that wasnt worth the price. I couldn't save any money for my own mental health because I was terrified there would be another new expense, and I was always right, there was always another expense. I was going a days without eating, or only eating one small meal, to conserve what food we had. I was working extra hours only to recieve the credit card bill and find out I need to borrow money from my mom because I had to go to the doctor and our insurance is actual garbage. I finally gave up, moved back in with my mom. I thought I was going to save money now that I don't have rent and utilities, get therapy, figure out whats wrong with me, go to the doctor for the numerous health issues I have. The first two weeks back, my dog decided to eat an entire ball of tinfoil while I was out for 15 minutes and later that night we had to rush her to the emergency vet for bloat. $1000 in vet bills, a car covered in dog vomit and tin foil. I hadn't even received my first paycheck since moving back in with my mom and I'm already 1k in debt. I don't even make 1k in a month. I'm going to have to ask my mom for money that she doesnt have. I had already gone grocery shopping with the last bit I had left from my last paycheck, I have no money. I'm back to not eating because I cant afford to eat. I'm trying to make my food last. I feel like all my money is already taken before I even make it. I cant afford to eat, I cant afford to live, its like a constant stream of shit and I'm never going to see the end of it. I just want therapy, I've been treading a mental wire for years and every time something like this happens I feel like I am just a little bit closer to falling off that wire. For the first week back home I found a love in cooking, it helped keep my mind busy, now I cant do that. I have nothing. My love for any hobbies are gone. I've done nothing but push away the people I love because I dont want them to know how much I'm hurting right now because there is absolutely nothing they can do to help and it would only make them sad, which would only make me feel worse. I'm close to breaking and I feel bad for coming here every time to vent into the void but I don't know what else to do. I want therapy so fucking bad, I want to know what is wrong with me, I want a name put to it so I know how to cope. But I can't afford it. It feels like I'll never be able to afford it. My money is gone before I make it. Everyone says money cant buy happiness but fuck it can at least buy me the tools to build it myself",22Aug2020,1
60,"A week ago I started to feel sad again, I didn't really think that much about it because I was still for the most part happy, and I only got sad at night, but a few days ago things got really bad, and I only realized when I started thinking about cutting myself, I was able to resist doing it for a day or two, but did it for the first time last night, and again tonight. But when I cut myself I wasn't crying, or having a mental breakdown, I just kind of sat there and did it. I am worried that I am not actually sad, and that I am just forcing myself to feel this way, nothing really bad has happened recently to make me sad. I feel like I only cut myself because I hoped I would stop thinking about it, It wasn't like I really wanted to do it, it was more of an intrusive thought, and something I wanted to do impulsively. My understanding of self harm has always been that you are so sad you want to hurt yourself, but it doesn't feel that way for me, it was just that I wanted the thoughts to go away.

Is this normal?

That's the main thing that I wanted to say, but there is something else I want to put in here because I probably will never say it if I don't now.

I have noticed that I haven't been eating enough recently, I have been overweight ever since my parents got divorced and have been trying to lose weight for a while, I hadn't managed to lose any weight up untill the start of quarantine where I lost 10 pounds and was healthier than ever, but I gained that weight back, because I stopped excersising, I started excersising regularly again about 2 weeks ago, and have only missed one or two days of excersising, but I have noticed that the past week I haven't been eating enough, I have barely eaten two full meals every day, usually I eat a full dinner (although haven't some days) and have a small breakfast around 1:00 PM when I wake up ( I usually fall asleep around 5 AM) today I eat a pretzel for breakfast, and another day I eat a packet of dried mangos, the first few days like this I would eat a small snack around 4:00 PM usually an apple and a few chips to satisfy cravings. But  now I have noticed that even though I am constantly hungry, when I eat I get full quickly, and recently haven't had the small snack at all, because I felt so guilty about eating, even though I was fully aware that I have been practically starving myself. I have already lost the 10 pounds in two weeks that it took me a month to lose the first time I was losing weight. I have eaten less than 1000 calories yesterday and today, while that isn't healthy, it isn't insanely bad, my worry is that this will get worse.

I feel like I am forcing myself to have all of these issues so I can prove something to myself (I don't know what I would be proving, but that's just how I feel)  when I found out I had tourettes a couple of years ago, for some stupid reason I went around telling everyone I knew, I cringe at this stuff now, but I probably did this for attention, I likely have anxiety, and am 90% sure I have been diagnosed with depression, and now I am worried that I may have, or be developing an eating disorder,  I rarely cry (mabye once every 5 months), and when I do it's over petty things, most of 5he tkme I am not  feeling sad or happy, just empty, I am not sure if I am just so used to feeling sad that it doesn't bother me, or if I am just really not that sad. I am worried that I am faking everything and that I am doing all of this for attention.

I don't feel comfortable talking about most of these things with anyone irl, partly because it's embarrassing, and partly because I don't want my family to worry about me. Because I didn't have a way to say these things to someone irl (comfortably) I figured that I would post them here anonymously.

I feel like the divine providence just gave me the shitty life I had years ago, man, I fought my ass off to get things in life going and I feel as if the virus just took that from me, and most recently, my mental health is going down the drain, while I'm not feeling great at least its not as bad as like 5 years ago, but my anger management issues just came back, the sheer thought of not having my life the way it was set when the year started makes me want to punch the wall till something breaks.

And what gets me the worse is the fact that the solution for the current state of my life would be a few words away if it weren't for the virus, my resolve is there, growing inside me, I do feel it growing every night as I think of the woulds, coulds, shoulds, and the never was, my resolve is just there, aging.

I have tourettes. Its annoying and it stresses me out. I also have severe anxiety, So I cry a lot and i get too sensitive or panicky too quick . And that pisses me off. I also have severe anger issues, so I tend to have large outbursts towards a lot of people. This includes insulting friends and/or family really hard, and then regretting it immensely afterwards. Due to all these qualities, I feel like people find me annoying. When im in a “good mood”, i feel like I can suddenly get either too rude, too annoying, or just too awkward in total. I feel like my friends hate me, and recently I lost a friend because i posted something that was supposed to be a joke against her and she accused me of “calling out for attention”. I tried starting a convo with her on insta and she just liked it, so i ss it and (I COVERED HER NAME, ACCOUNT AND EVERYTHING) and posted it saying that i hate when people do that cause i wanna start a convo and theyre making it impossible. I feel like everything I do is wrong, rude, awkward, or just plain stupid. I hate everything about myself. Im tired of it, though. And I wanna be a better person but whats the point of changing if everyone already hates me? What if I cant change their view on me? What if my tourettes and anxiety become too much?

I would like some advice about this thing I'm going through, and I would like to hear other people's experiences to see if anything with me aligns.

There isn't a whole lot to say. I have this 'sad' mood most of the time. I can't really describe it, 'sad' isn't really what it feels like, but I don't know what else to say. I have this mood a lot, and I feel like crying frequently. I used to have specific words that triggered crying depending on the situation at the time, or stress at the time. Now, I just feel like crying with no triggers, or whenever my mother gets annoyed with me being so tired I come off as uncaring or ungrateful. It sucks. I'm also stressed all the time, probably in the Adaptation stage more often than not, which is probably not healthy. The main thing that's going on is the bad mood though. I just want some advice. Oh, also, I feel uncomfortable telling my parents about this stuff, and I do kinda want to see a therapist (for other reasons, but also this I guess), but I don't want to have to explain why. My parents like knowing things. They also like asking questions. Before anyone suggests a school counsellor, I feel uncomfortable around them and I don't know them. They look really severe and that puts me off a whole lot. Also, I feel like my school would tell my parents that I was getting counselling, which I really do not want. I don't feel comfortable telling my parents anything about my mental health, and I don't have the courage to tell any adult.

So yeah. Any advice would be much appreciated. I don't know if I have any mental health issues, but this doesn't seem healthy. Cheers.",22Aug2020,1

So I've been dealing with severe depression for more than a decade by now. Been in and out of therapy and hospitals for years but for the last year or two things had really gotten better.
But lately I've entered a downwards spiral... the last friend I've had stopped answering me about two weeks ago and I have absolutely no clue why. At work I messed up my progress of the better part of a month and have begun to question the point of the things I do there in general. And apart from that my girlfriend of 8 years just told me that she, while wanting to hold on to our relationship, has lost any interest in every form of physical interaction whatsoever. I know that the last point will sound quite shallow and no it is not the only reason for a relationship and I love here dearly regardless. Nevertheless this was quite devastating.
The worst part is that I have absolutely no one to turn to. I spent my days waiting but have no idea what I am waiting for. This all feels completely pointless... I have no idea what to do...

It is often [depression](https://themighty.com/topic/depression/?label=depression), with a blackness or complete nothingness. A numbness that can feel painful at the same time. Flashbacks, in emotional and physical forms, with feelings of terror and / or physical pain. You can have auditory flashbacks, be hyper vigilant and it can have a huge impact on ability to create and maintain [relationships](https://themighty.com/topic/relationships/?label=relationships). Friendships can be strained (I often want to push people away first so they ‘can’t hurt me’) and finding compassionate and understanding people to surround yourself with can be difficult, although there are some wonderful gems out there! Many can struggle with addictions and often people deal with intense [anxiety](https://themighty.com/topic/anxiety/?label=anxiety) and some physical ill health, such as pain, as the body carries the memories that the brain has hidden away. Dissociation is a way of the human body protecting you from [trauma](https://themighty.com/topic/trauma/?label=trauma). So, while a negative event is happening you can feel like you have left your body completely or that you are watching yourself from a distance. Your brain cannot allow you to be fully present in some of these moments. You may remember sounds or smells, for example (that many years later trigger you) or a brief snapshot of what happened. This is perfectly natural. Dissociation can then become your body’s go – to strategy and every time you feel scared or threatened you leave (some feel as though they are floating) which may not be obvious to people around you. Many may dissociate, for what feels like, no reason at all and days later they may or may not make a connection (I heard …. noise, even if I didn’t realise at the time). You can’t quite connect. Your brain goes fuzzy. Everything feels just out of reach. It is different for everyone. You don’t know how to feel safe.

87,"First of all please don't mind the formatting and language, my native language isn't english. 

I don't know where to start. I guess I'm going through the worst part of my life. I haven't been happy in a very long time. I had some issues with myself before the lockdown but, I used to figure it out myself. But the lockdown forced me to be caged in my room which made everything worse. 
From where I'm living it's impossible to get professional help with what I'm dealing at the moment. The problem is I overthink, a lot. My mind gets frustrated to even the most trivial things. 

I overthink to a point where I ruin everything. It's like a plague in my mind, destroying everything I love. It's literally like a plague guys, I'm not exaggerating. 
The things I love most in my life apart from my parents and friends are-motorcycles, movies and everything about space, stars and stuff. I live and breathe on these things, it's like the very essence of my life. 

The things i enjoy most in my life apart from being with my parents and friends are- motorcycles, movies and reading about the universe and stuff. The plague in my mind ruined everything. First one was movies. I couldn't enjoy movies anymore. My mind keeps reminding me like movies are fake and scripted so there's no point in watching it. I tried to watch a lot of movies but I failed, I couldn't enjoy any of them. The mind plague infected me for the first time. Finally I surrendered and accepted the fact that I can't watch movies anymore. Y'all know how sad it can be when you lose something you love the most, for me the first one was movies. The mind plague killed one of the most entertaining thing in my life. 

The second one was motorcycles. Words can't describe how much I love motorcycles, everything about motorcycles keeps me engaged and amused. But I don't have a good motorcycle, I ride a 100cc moped because I'm a student and I can't afford a good one atm. I used to watch every motorcycle related videos, be it vlogs, reviews, rides.. everything. 
My friends had some pretty good motorcycles, but they never me ride one, because they think I don't have the pre requisite to ride it. I did made me sad, but I didn't complain because I knew I'll be able to buy one for myself someday.
That's when the plague struck me again. My mind started thinking if I'll be able to ride it. Since high end motorcycles require some skills to be ridden, my mind started questioning whether I'll be able to ride it or if I have the skills to ride it. And this messed up my brain for real. The thing got worse over time and I couldn't watch anything related to motorcycles anymore.  Whenever I see a motorcycle related content my heart will start beating fast, like it would beat If I just sprinted around a 400m lap. But the difference here from running is, instead of slowing down my heart will keep beating fast until I feel soo stressed and finally collapse. Not like getting unconscious, but I feel super tired and can't think straight. I could feel the cortisol in my blood guys, that's how much stressed I was. 

Just think of it, I lost my another most loved thing. This too happened a year ago, but it's kinda better now. I can now watch motorcycle contents. But the heart problem persisted, my heart would now beat fast for absolutely no reason, yeah no reason. I'm super sure it's not a heart disease, it's just anxiety.

It's fine when I'm busy or engaged but once it's over, my heart would start beating fast again, which can persist continously for a day without stopping. At that point I'll really really wish I was dead. Because the stress was too much to handle. This heart problem thing lasted till last month until I started meditating. It did help me a lot, but I do often get the it once in a while. 

After the heart problem thing was somehow over the problem got transferred to my legs. You know the feeling in our legs when we get super anxious? Now I get it for no reason, yes, for absolutely no reason! My legs would get tensed and start aching. It isn't anything related to physical bruises or damage but simply because of anxiety. It goes away the instant I'm distracted, but once I think of my problems my leg will start aching again. 

Tbh, I could keep my control over all these problems, I knew I'll have control over it, but then came the worse thing that's ever happened to me. 
It's something like existential crisis or existential anxiety not sure what it is. The plague now reached the last one in my most loved things. Now I feel like the space, our planet and everything is just an illusion, like they are not real. Whenever I look up into the sky, instead of appreciating the beauty of the sky and the stars like I used to, now my mind makes me think all these are just an illusion and we are living in a matrix controlled by some superior being. The point is I came into all these conclusion for absolutely no reason. When I think of the source of this absurd thoughts, I have no answer. But still I just can't convince my mind into thinking otherwise. 

Another thing that's bugging me now is, I feel I'm being framed my some superior power and everyone around me is part of the superior power and is ""acting"" around me and I'm being watched by them. This then stopped me from going outside too.

I don't do drugs, weed, alcohol, don't have PTSD, haven't had any single trauma other than a breakup, which is the least of my concern at this point. Had a pretty dope childhood with awesome parents and family. I don't know why this is happening to me.
Is there any truth to what I'm thinking. What do I need to do to get back all the things I lost? I want to look up in the sky again and appreciate the stars. I want to ride my motorcycle without getting anxious about being judged. I want to live like our world isn't in a matrix and the earth is not an illusion. I want a free mind which could help me enjoy the small things in my life. I want to be happy guys, I really want to. I'm in the verge of breaking down. 

I have an exam coming up to which there are 1.8 million participants for just 4000 vacancies. I know I can crack it, as I was always good at my studies. But because of all this anxiety which is stripping away my happiness day by day I can't concentrate in my studies either. That last thing I'd want is my anxiety affecting my career. PLEASE HELP ME GUYS, I'm tearing up writing this. Will I ever be able to get out from this stupid phase of my life? I have no one else to say all these to. I reached out to a lot of online counciling sites but all of them are paid and I'm broke. You guys are my last resort.

89,"I feel like my whole life for the past few years has been completely defined by the fact that I left high school due to illness/mental illness. The stress and anxiety and depression that I have gone through over the past few years, trying everything to escape my situation. People have been complaining about being in lockdown for a few months, but I have been here for years :-(

I'm always at home, I don't have any friends or any social life. I don't feel like I have any redeeming qualities either. I crawled out of that last year, and struggled to get into a year long course at a community college due to my having no academic qualifications as I had to leave high school in my final year, which is really annoying to me as I have done 12 years of school and have absolutely nothing to show for it.

This year, I decided to apply to a few high schools in different countries so that I could meet entrance requirements for universities. It is my dream to study physics. I got a place at a nice high school in another country who understood my condition and situation. It finally felt like things were turning around for me, the years of pain and loneliness were not in vain. Then of course everything had to go wrong. 

Covid means that I can't travel. I received an email today to say that I won't be able to study online as a high school student because they're going for a model where in-person attendance is required. I don't really know what to do now. I have no qualifications or professional skills, I'm horribly introverted and I can't hold down a job or even get one. 

I can't get into any institution. I have a neurological condition that means I'm always in a fair bit of pain, but I can't get welfare or anything. I found out this week that my dog is dying. I felt that I had an oppurtunity to start over, I was so looking forward to leaving not only my country, but this horrible hole I have dug myself into. Really all I want to do is study. I want to meet people and make friends but it seems that I should just give up on everything.

For the context: I'm in the middle of a big anxiety attack, and frankly that's the only justification I'll have to have. 

This is a rough translation of a text I rode severe times. 

We humans really take ourselves for the masters, the appearance of men is a kind of statistical impossibility on the scale of the universe.

More than the birth of man, the birth of life itself is miracle. You were as lucky to see the light of day as a fly, or a fucking chicken.

We don't deserve more credit than any other species, we're just as lucky. 

We're all miracles, and we should be aware of that. It would put the place that humans occupy in the universe into perspective. It would put some humility back in our minds. 

Then we'd see that there's nothing more precious than life, and we'd be able to get excited about everything, because it's all incredible. 

...


But no, we decided to fuck it up. 

What went through people's minds when they decided to start battery farming? When did they decide to file the teeth, the beak of the animals in our industries? When did we make people sick through genetic manipulation of creatures for our consumption?

I am alone I only have my family but I have no friends anymore. In pure agony being alone but it hurts more to attempt to connect and look like a anti social weirdo. I'm so tired of doing anything. I recently started neglecting my responsibilities. I'm starting to gain weight, I cant stop fapping, I run away from social situation, I'm not doing anything productive. I feel pretty pathetic because I am super lucky. I have a good family and had a good childhood. Now I'm a pathetic fool who is running from the fire trying to get warm instead burning himself and i resorts to staying in the freezing cold. 

I'm so lazy. I'm a glutton and I hate it. I still love my self though I know I am redeemable in some way but I hate my life right now and I'm too tired to improve.

95,"I've been hearing about this way too much lately. If a woman has got the balls to be in a man's face being verbally abusive, even physically they should be prepared to cop the same back. NO one deserves to be screamed at in nose to nose distance. NO one deserves to be constantly threatened that they're going to leave or going to take their kids away. NO one deserves to be belittled infront of family and friends. if you want to treat someone worse then you'd treat your worst enemy then fucking leave. Dont control and manipulate them, don't make them out to be this or that. Fucking leave  

Any man OR woman who is going through this and sees this please get help. Men barely ever have a voice in abusive relationships and their pride for their family blinds them from what they're actually being put through until they're either being jailed, taken everything for, giving up and contemplating suicide.. or drug and alcohol abuse to numb the pain.

They gave me CT scans because I was experiencing stroke symptoms but they came back totally fine. they gave me an EKG to see how my heart is beating and it was fine. These panic attacks are terrifying. I think it’s a result of me constantly worrying about my anemia, worrying about every little pain that I have, worrying that something and will happen and I’ll end up nearly dying again or actually dying. My last one was just a random burst of confusion, followed by lightheadedness and numbness. When I checked my pulse it was 125. Since everything came back normal in the ER they chalked it up to a panic attack. I need help because I clearly can’t keep panicking like this and going to the ER everytime that I get one.

What I would suggest is like life you will find staff or people you can talk to. Try them. Once you find this person thoughts and feelings can start to change..

Pre text: first time poster on this sub. I am not trying to undermine or belittle anyone else’s problems. I understand that being a sociopath is much less life threatening than dealing with suicidal thoughts, severe depression, or anxiety. If this is not the place to post something like this, any guidance or suggestions would be helpful. 

Without much context, as I believe the problem is much more complicated, I’m aware of the fact that I’ve lied and cheated on some of the people that I care most about. 3-4 relationships over the past 6 years. Or I guess I claim to care most about them because, do I really care if I lie and cheat? I think worst of all is that I’ve been lying to myself about why what I do is ok under the guise of polyamory. Or the fact that it’s ok to love more than one person. I say “guise” because I want to truly believe that it is ok to do so, but I’ve lacked the honesty that it takes out of fear that I won’t find anyone like me. One relationship ends, I feel defeated, I date around to fill the void until I find someone I really fall for, they usually are not keen to the idea, so one person decides to compromise, and it inevitably ends in hurt. I’ve now lost 3 people that I really do believe I loved, because of my compulsive lying. I don’t want to believe I’m a sociopath. I don’t lie in many other facets of life, I don’t feel the need to. I have stolen once from work without returning the things I stole (there is no excuse for stealing, what I did was wrong) and the second time I stole from work I felt so guilty and fearful that I returned the thing as soon as I was asked about it, without consequence. 

I tried the r/sociopath sub, but it just kind of seemed like a bunch of people patting themselves on the back, believing they are better than other people. It didn’t seem like there were any resources for people to get better or deal with their condition. I don’t want to hurt people. I don’t want to lie to people, or lie to myself to convince myself that wrong-doing is ok. When I search on google, all of the writing I can find on sociopaths are warning signs, how to avoid them, and why they are bad people. Nothing about how to get better. I don’t want to be a bad person. I want to change for the better. I want to seek help and don’t know where to start. 

If you have any advice, questions to help confirm or deny, or any words that make me feel any less crazy, I’d appreciate it. However I would rather hear the truth than be coddled and told that I’m not a sociopath. I just want to be better. 

TLDR; I’ve lied and cheated on the ones I love resulting in failed relationships that end in pain and burnt bridges. I want to get better and seek help but don’t know where to start. 

Thanks for reading. I hope you reply.",22Aug2020,1
114,"(I've been wanting to make a post about this for a while now)

First of all, of course, I must give a disclaimer: do not substitute this for any clinically accepted methods you've been practicing or have heard. 

Consider this an additive to any methods you have faith in and are accepted in mainstream psychology.

But I must say - don't forget - Radical Acceptance!

Radical Acceptance has been my way for about a couple of months now. 

And I have to say, after a lifetime of reliving trauma - pain - suffering - mental anguish - I have finally turned things around.

However this is only my suffering (I will give you more details about my experience in a second).

But as of now I do praise --- Radical Accpetance!

What is Radical Acceptance? 

Well as I have defined it is: accept your situation - now and forever.

From the fragile age of 12 I have dealt with... whatever you want to call it... I call it depression, anxiety, mental anguish... an incongruency with my experience. I have dealt with more... psychosis, paranoia, hospitalizations... a mess of existence. 

BUT I am here to tell you that there MAY be a better way. The way that has worked for me, bar none.

RADICAL ACCEPTANCE.

What does this mean?

Well for me this means accepting whatever sorrow, pain, anguish, mental strain - the list goes on - disillusionments, failures, disappointments, follies - the list goes on...

And start from there. Acceptance. Radical Acceptance. 

It's radical because you accept EVERYTHING. The good, the bad, and everything in between.

With this Way you can not lose. Because if tomorrow is just as bad or worse than than the day before, you have already accepted it. THEREFORE, it loses its power over you.

I urge you brothers and sisters give this a try. 

Perhaps, you are like I was - constantly striving for some method, medicine, mentality, strategy that would improve your life. For me, all was folly because I was always disappointed if the results amounted to nothing.

THIS way - the way of Acceptance - is full proof (in my experience) because I was one step ahead of fate. I was willing to accept the worse and therefore the worse had no power over me.




Anyway, in conclusion (because I feel I have ranted on enough - and, believe me, I could go on), accept everything. Accept your position, your tragedies, your depression, your sad state - whatever it may be - and go from there.

This is not the only message. Because me it only gets better from here --- when you LET GO.

And, like I said, this fail proof. Because if this doesn't help - you've already accepted the outcome. And in my experience, this gives you the power back. 




I could go on, and I will if that what people here on this outlet want. 

But I'm telling you this is the greatest truth, experience, mentality (whatever you wanna call it) that I have experienced yet. And it's only - WHATEVER from here. 



Let acceptance pervade your mind from here.



Note: please tell me if I am off base. The last thing I want to do is exacerbate anyone's mental anguish. Feel free to comment but I encourage you to try this way first. (More to come, if requested, about this way that has radically improved my quality of life.)",22Aug2020,1

So I’m an anxious over thinker

This is a bit of a random post but yesterday I bought a new pair of jeans and I washed them last night. I’m staying at my friends in Essex for the weekend then going back to where I live next week.

I was gonna wear these jeans back home on the train and wear them as my casual pair outside of work. 

I have another pair of jeans I wear to and back from work as I change when I get there in the locker room, those jeans I’ve worn to work already and will wash them on my next days off.

So basically because of corona virus should I wash my jeans again when I get home? Even though it’s bad for the environment to wash too much and it could ruin the jeans in the long run.

According to a recent study, researchers found smiling — even a fake smile — can have positive impact on mood. Essentially, triggering certain facial muscles by smiling can “trick” your brain into thinking you’re happy.⁠

“For mental health, this has interesting implications. If we can trick the brain into perceiving stimuli as ‘happy,’ then we can potentially use this mechanism to help boost mental health,” the study’s author said.⁠

126,"For a brief moment in my life from ages 15 to the summer before I turned 17, I lived with my dad and his girlfriend. My dad was a passive, quiet guy that wasn't around much. He didn't want custody, but accepted to take me and my brother who was 12 at the time to live with him while my mom was in Europe taking care of someone. The whole situation was odd. This woman, let's call her C, had an 11 year old son and was not happy about two more kids being added onto her plate. My dad promised we were no trouble and that I was old enough not to need babysitting. 

I was rebellious, like most 15 year olds. I was energetic, popular, and sporty. I had just broken up with my boyfriend, and I was just starting high school. Things are already horrible, and to add a stranger to the mix was ever more shitty. After we moved out and went back to live with my mother, I was never the same person. I told my therapist that I wanted to go back to that 15 year old girl again. I was so happy and fun. He asked me to describe when things changed, and this all came up... 

This woman legit abused me, and nobody said anything. Nobody defended me, and I blamed myself. I thought I was troubled, that I was difficult, that it was my fault, that my dad didn't like me. 

I bleached the lower part of my hair and colored it hot pink. When she found out, she dragged me to the bathroom and locked the door and stood in front of it. She didn't let me out until I cut the parts I had bleached. My hair went from almost above my bra to shoulder length. It looked horrible too. All the while, this large woman with shaved tattooed eyebrows stood behind me and yelled at me. 

*Your father will blame me for this! What an idiot! I should just make you cut it all off! Either you do it or I'll do it for you!* 

I clearly remember shaking and cutting my hair. She made me clean the bathroom, explain to my dad that I had made a mess of my hair and had to do this and apologize for it. 

She convinced my dad not to let me go on a 3-day school trip because she thought I must be grounded for a month because I had stolen her wifi password. Her stupid 0000 wifi password. She said that I couldn't be trusted, and how could my dad let me go on this trip? So, I was grounded and not allowed to go - and I was the ONLY freshman not there. 

She took my phone and only gave it back when I called my mom crying about it and she had to have a fight with dad from across the world. Finally, my dad decided my phone was out of the question. 

The worst thing, aside from the hair, was when my friends and I decided to go to a party when I was 16. We got ready at our place, and were just leaving when she stopped us yelling and screaming. 

*Why would you think it's ok to leave my house looking like a whore? get back here!* 

And then she dragged me back to the house and pushed me to my room, legit attacked me and took off my clothes and made me wipe off my make-up and change into something else. My friends were frozen out of fear, I came out looking beaten (she didn't actually hit me, though) and miserable and crying. I just told them to just go - and we all ran out of that house. I was humiliated. I wanted to die. My friends didn't know what to do. One of them asked if she always treated me like that. ""What a bitch"" 

That night, she came into my room to let me know she only did that because she cares about my dad and what he thinks of her. Also that she doesn't want her son to see these things at his age! 

She did that a lot. Randomly talking to me about what a great person she was and how wise she was. Once she sat me down to tell me I was acting out and that she knew I was a good girl deep down, but trying to fight her and that it was natural. She made me feel crazy and ungrateful. She would play the victim constantly. My dad was barely there, much like before, but when he was - he was yelling at me because she'd told him I was nothing but trouble. 

She broke my spirit. I was too tired to fight her. I gave up fighting her, I just legit gave up. When I told these to my therapist, he said that abuse is exactly like this. They close a door on you, but don't teach you how to open another one... so you're just lost. I needed someone to love me, to pay attention, to tell me I was doing a good job getting straight A's in school. Instead, I got constant yelling and criticism and guilt. 

I'm 26 years old now... and I've just realized what this monster has done to me. She's the reason my life is miserable now. I wasn't a bad kid. I wasn't a trouble maker. I was just a teenager, and this woman made it her mission to break me and she did. My dad never married her, and I have no idea what's happened to her. I've also never told my mom. I mean, she knew that I was having ""trouble"" but I never told her my side of the story. 

I don't know how I'm going to overcome this, but I'm done feeling like the victim. I now know why I'm no longer happy and care-free and energetic. I know exactly when things changed. I'm the same person, I just had a door closed on my face and nobody showed me how to open another one. I'm gonna build one and walk through it now. Fuck you, C. I hope you get what you deserve. I'm sure she kept telling herself she was being ""responsible"" or that was her job - but all she had to do was NOT ruin some kid's life.",22Aug2020,1
127,"Hello friends,  


I am doing a lot of self improvement and one area I've always struggled with was my work (employment). I always have crippling anxiety, and part of the reason I had to quit my internship early this summer (I have been there for three summers now and just couldn't take it anymore). One area I have pinpointed is that I am anxious and afraid of responsibility.  


I am afraid of making mistakes. I'm afraid of looking unintelligent or making a massive mistake and causing problems for others, or even just little mistakes and looking immature/lazy for not noticing or catching it beforehand. What if I'm given something and I don't know how to do or cant figure out? Whenever my boss would start to give me something, my heart would immediately fall into my stomach (something you can't really run away from in the professional world or even just a work place setting). It's almost like a personal attack on my identity if I get it wrong. Every single task is fight or flight for me. (Part of the reason I am now on a beta blocker). I will look stupid, or like an imposter, or cause emotional and physical distress for others and myself.  


I have been focusing a lot on meditation or just helpful youtube hypnosis videos to restructure my subconscious. Does anyone have any advice or support as to how I can start to heal this wound? Ive been going to therapy for a few years now with different providers which have helped some but not enough. I briefly tried an antidepressant and hated it so medication isn’t really on the table for me.

Thank you all so very much!",22Aug2020,1

129,Hey I’m looking for some people to chat with on discord about my problems if you want you can’t add me at BellaDaWarm#8677,22Aug2020,1
130,"**TW for descriptions/chatter about childhood physical and sexual abuse, and gaslighting.**

I have a lot of amnesia from my life, and also a good chunk of partial memories where I feel some context for a situation is missing. If you feel comfortable, I'd like to here about your instances of this and how you deal with it, because it's - if you'll pardon the pun - maddening, sometimes.

**Honestly just seeking a bit of validation, I feel like I make up everything, even though it's right there in my head, thanks to my abuse. Have bolded the TLDR parts.**

# Partial Memory #1:

**What I was told:** At **3 years old**, my mum (who was very abusive to me until the day she died) was carrying me up the concrete steps towards our home on her shoulders, when **she slipped on some black ice**. She put her hands out as one does when falling, and **I went sailing over her shoulders, hitting my entire face on a concrete step** that was that sort of concrete with gravel in, very jagged and sharp. Easy to cut yourself.

**What I remember:** Sitting on the couch at home. Mum was looking at her hands doing that ""painful hiss"". My dad was looking at her. **Mum still had her outside coat on, dad was in a t-shirt** (suggesting that mum and I had just come home, and dad was already there).

**Inconsistency 1: No blood, cuts or grazes, only bruises.** Despite falling from over five feet in the air, my skin didn't even graze, or cut on those jagged steps. I had (in my mum's words) ""A bruise that was black as the ace of spades and it covered your entire face"". 

**Inconsistency 2: We were alone.** My mum only ever hit me when she wasn't in front of my dad. I have memories of this, and as mentioned before I have a small memory that suggests we had just come into the house (whether this memory is 'real' or not idk).

**Inconsistency 3:** **I'm told that the doctor asked me, ""over and over and over again"" whether my mum was the one who hit me.** They seemingly refused to let it go, and apparently my mum went ballistic at them (which an abuser would, of course). I've worked in a children's hospital, and they do NOT ask such things lightly. If they think it, it's because they've seen it before and are advised what to check for. **I am 100% unsure what I said to him, my mum never told me this. It's possible I said no, possible I was silent.**

**Further Context:** Around the same age, after this incident, my mom told me about another time that I ""got out of my pushchair straps"" (not impossible in the 1980s, they were kinda crap) ""and fell out of the pushchair... onto the concrete sidewalk"". Again. NO cuts, likely just marks or bruises. We were alone. I hit my head quite severely a LOT as a toddler, apparently.

# Partial Memory #2:

At around 9-10 years old, I was at a family party. M**y mum's brother (my uncle) lightheartedly asked for a kiss, so I obliged, as family do. Then he said ""No, no. An adult kiss, come on.""** he moved towards me to kiss me. I laughed and said euw no, and that's all I remember.

Around the same age, perhaps a little younger, my mother's *other* brother came to the house. I gave him a hug, as one does. I was wearing a long night-dress, as it was Saturday or Sunday morning. My mom said she would brb, she's gonna get me some ""clothes and knickers so I can dress"". **My uncle said ""you're not wearing any underwear? You've put me off hugging girls forever now I know this.""**

**The Inconsistency:** These memories feel very... island-like. Like I am missing some history or context. 

Later in life my sister casually mentioned Uncle 1 was ""really sleazy"" from what she remembered, although my sister endured no abuse growing up, she was treated very well by the family, which is in no way a bad thing. But again, that one incident feels unlikely to be the ONLY incident. 

I remember Uncle 2 always wanting me to go round his house, only me. If I didn't go round, he'd come round and try to arrange a time for me to stay with him. Could've been completely innocent, but now I recall, it was ONLY me, never my sister.

**Sorry for the ramble, that got WAY longer than I wanted, but these memories only came back to me 6-7 years ago, and ever since they keep pinging back as if I'm missing a few scenes and it drives me up the wall.**",22Aug2020,1

132,"Lately I've been having really weird ""Dreams"". I say ""Dreams"" because I'm half awake, I'm aware of what's going on, In the moment I believe I'm awake, but my minds tricking me. I guess I'm half awake. For about two months now I'll randomly wake up around 1am and freak out because of a bunch of little bugs are in my bed. For example, last night I woke up and I believed I dumped a bunch of little spiders all over my bed, I always panic, jump out of bed, throw my blanket/pillow/sheets into the corner of my room to ""get rid of the bugs"" then go right back to sleep. I believe I'm still asleep during this because I always see the bugs, they're not there, but my mind thinks they are. If it helps at all, I've always had a problem with bugs, I've never been a fan of them, and I've always been pretty paranoid about them.

My question is, could this be an anxiety issue? Or should I consider going to a therapist and try to get to the root of the problem? I've always had anxiety and depression, but this problem only started happening a few months ago.",22Aug2020,1
133,"This all started this year. I was going through a rough time and I couldn't think of my past. I knew the things that had happened, but I didn't remember them happening. If I tried to remember it, I'd get dizzy and it could even become a headache. There was this day that I couldn't even work, as I was really sad (for no reason whatsoever). Then, the following day, I was 100% happy, as if those sad days hadn't happened, and I could actually remember my past. Although I didn't get dizzy while thinking of my past, I started getting dizzy whenever I thought of my health (both physical and mental health).

138,"My girlfriend made me promise one thing after an episode. She said, ""don't hurt yourself again or I will be really mad at you."" I did promise and I held on for two months.

She realized I haven't been taking care of myself and got mad at me for it.

It's undiagnosed but she's been through very traumatic events in her life. I don't get mad at her when she refuses to eat or sleep. I just try to be there for her, make her drink water and stuff. Even when she physically hurt herself I never blamed her for it. But now, she's mad at me for going through the same thing.

I love her so much and she's definitely the reason why I'm still alive today. I know she's just worried about me but I feel like shit knowing she's mad and want to hurt myself more because of it. I don't know what to do. I just want to fix it but I don't even know where to begin.",22Aug2020,1

I just feel like I need to talk to someone about this. 

I was cutting my hair about an hour ago and while I was doing so I accidentally snipped my wrist with the scissors, leaving a cut. 

At that moment, my mind was telling me to do it again. But I haven’t cut myself in years, so I resisted. It felt good to see the open wound and the blood dripping. I had never actually cut my wrists before, I usually did it on the top of my arm or my thigh. So one of the reasons that stopped me from continuing was that I didn’t want to kill myself. I have no desire to do so. 

But now I’m afraid I might have cravings to hurt myself again. I’m scared that if I talk about this with my mom or my friends that they’ll worry too much about me. I’m fine, it’s just weird how these old feelings came back.

Lately, I’ve been expressing some behaviors (perhaps symptoms?) that have been concerning to me:

- Vivid recurrent nightmares, often with COVID-19 in the subject matter or playing a part somehow. A fairly common one is returning to work (closed due to the pandemic) to find many of my coworkers and regulars (customers) dead. This one always feels horribly vivid and leaves me with feelings of fear and guilt after I wake.

- Unnerving events or situations causing “waves” of nausea — I’ve never experienced this before — and pushing me to the brink of tears.

- Increase in anxiety issues that I already was coping with.

- Decreased appetite and exacerbated insomnia.

153,"tw // Death, Suicide

&amp;#x200B;

I died Nov 1st 2015. This isn't the first time I have talked about this, I talk about it, nearly every damn day.   


I was hit by a blue Thunderbird right outside the Dunwoody apartments in Atlanta GA, where the AI students used to stay. It was raining, I looked to see if my attacker was going to take the green light, he didn't so I crossed the crosswalk that was showing the little walk sign. It was a shared light for myself and him turning left. The last thing I heard was a horn and myself screaming ""Don't!"", the last thing I saw was headlights.   


It was a hit and run, and to this fucking day he is still out there. I wish I knew who he was, because I am a low income adult who doesn't have insurance and cannot afford the therapy and medical care I need.   


I died that night, for a short time, due to the two blows to my head, one being an open head injury that lost me a lot of blood. I remember coming to, to see red lights and rain drops blinding my eyes. My skin was pale and I was so cold. I couldn't move, i didn't know what was going on, and all I remembered was an elderly lady begging me not to move as I sat up and dragged my legs towards my body, wondering why the hell i couldn't get up and walk away.   


I was pinned back down by EMT who strapped me into a stretcher and placed a brace around my neck. I was so terrified, what the fuck happened? Where was I? Then I was filled in, and tbh I didn't know how lucky I was or how badly I was hurt. I just asked them to help me call my friend.   


The night was hell, the adrenaline was wearing off and morphine can only do so much. I could both feel and not feel my head. My left hand was mangled and had to be set, my body was covered in bruises and scrapes. I was put through a CAT scan, then had to have stitches in my head. Lucky me the open head injury wasn't to terrible.   


My friend arrived and I gained confidence to use the bathroom, struggling to walk, and saw my face. It was like I was looking at a body in a horror film. My right eye was swelled shut, black and blue already. My nose was red, black and blue. I had blood crusting on my face and hair. Blood was coming out of my nose and ears, and I was scared I was going to lose my eye.   


I come back into the room and see the blood soaked pillow and apologize to the doctor who entertains the apology because how are ya gunna argue with someone who is half aware of whatever the fuck is going on?   


My friend took me to get the medication I would need, pain killers, ibuprofen, they wanted to give me another shot of morphine but I refused, wish I took it... and a cane.   


I healed for the most part. I limp, my left hand has lost strength and the index and middle finger are disabled and cause me pain. My vision is blurred, and I have constant headaches. The worst though, is the effects a TBI has on you. Memory issues, depression, PTSD, anxiety, focusing issues, and some body functions not working properly.   


That was my first brush with death and it sparked my fear of dying. I still to this day have not received therapy, nor medical aid for this event, my head has been hurting more and more over the years, and things that were fucked by it are getting worse.  


My second brush was in 2019, the year I tried to join the Navy.  I was told by my recruiter to lie about my injury and just get in. Well, I worked hard. I was in JROTC for three years so I entered a E3, knew what I was doing and was even picked to be the AROC. I did well for two weeks P-days that officially passed was 5 if memory is serving me right. (We had an extended week due to the 4th of July) I did my job without cracking, I did above and beyond in our first week of learning how to obey orders to the T. I folded neatly, wrote neatly, cleaned, made my bunk, kept people in line, sang cadence, even helped during a crisis moment. The P-5 came, medical day. I wasn't worried, I have had to have plenty of needles in me over my life. From blood and plasma donations to blood tests. I put on a brave face for my division and then I got called to wait.   


I was on Tricare when I was hit by that damn car. It was all there, I already HAD a medical record. My recruiter has met my father, who has introduced himself as a Army man, of 16 years, and told me, ""they will never find out.""   


I had to see the Captain of the corpsman team. She wasn't happy, wanted me to explain why I would have been flagged before she even dug deep. I first told her about the accident, then I let slip the other traumatic event that happened literally three days before I left for MEPS.   


I found the dead mother of my best friend, she shot herself in the head. During my time before boot camp, I was staying with my friend and his family a few times. During those times she never once looked suicidal. Hell the day before, her and I went to Lowes to grab some stuff to make the neat planters. She then bought a new car, then was told by her husband that he wanted a divorce. She had apperently been suffering from years of depression and mental health disabilities.   


We came home and the moment I opened the door inside I could feel that something was wrong, then I could smell it the closer I got to her bedroom door. I begged my friend not to open the door, he did and I saw a pale white body. He ran over to her, touched her and fainted, I rushed over to apply aid, I guess, telling myself we arrived just in time to apply aid and get her help. I wish I hadn't. I went to check vitals and that was when I saw everything. I'll spare you the details.   


I saw the gun and grabbed for my friend and called 911. I never had to do this, no one teaches you how to report a dead body. I stayed as calm as I could with him panicking and trying to go back in there, telling him it was a crime scene and informing the operator that I needed to report a suicide. Having to answer questions that made me sick and nervous.   


The three days were so I could come back after feeling hallow. I went to MEPS, and I was so quiet.   


I passed though, and come July I was leaving.   


I told her this, I told her about the TBI. She looked surprised, she had went from angry to concerned and it was then when I finally cracked and broke down crying. I wanted to be in the Navy so badly, but what she said was right. I needed help, I couldn't run from this. So she sent me to SEPS, told me it wasn't worth fighting the call. I wasn't, I lost my dignity after having the breakdown. SEPS was a nightmare. I actually snapped at one of the Petty Officers after she tried some controlling bullshit on us, saying ""None of you have ever had to witness the dead body of someone you loved killed in a violent way/ None of you have had PTSD"" I snapped hard and went off telling my stories, asked her if witnessing a suicide by a gunshot to the head counted. She never came back. I wasn't in trouble luckily, though I was told to next time take it to the office.   


I came home and felt like a failure. My mental health worsened. What's worse was, that friend who lost his mother? The one I witnessed alongside with? I moved in with him, he turned out to be an abusive piece of shit, used me and then when I stopped allowing him to use me, he kicked me out.   


I'm in a better living situation, finally gave up smoking for good this time, mostly cause I got sick of how shitty I felt. But I am struggling to find work now with the virus, I cannot do customer service because a nasty thing about TBI/PTSD is irritability, if you walk up to me mad, I will literally copy that and throw it back 10x as much and I don't even mean to. I cannot afford therapy because I do not have insurance nor a job. So I am without mental help. I am disabled and dunno how to get on disability if I cannot find the hospital I went to the night I was hit to get medical records.   


I feel useless and hopeless.   


What's worse is now, I have a fear of death, so very fucking bad. It's not the process of dying so much, though that scares me, it's what happens after. I am not a religious man. I am afraid of dying and leaving nothing, having accomplished nothing. I fear leaving my partner behind, I fear the empty. It gets so bad I have panic attacks when I think of death. I have no coping for this or anyone to talk to who can help. For fucks sake a bad storm came through here last night, and we got a tornado watch and I saw the winds shift and pick up and felt my blood turn to ice.   


My head has been hurting more often and I have been told TBI survivors have a %60 chance of living of living a long life after the head injury, I am coming up on year five and it's usually year 5-7 that is the worst. So I have been told and that scares me every time I think of that.   


I do not want to die because I appreciate life so much. Even if I am a low income, disabled man, I find value in my partner, my roommate, my siblings. The park I go to, the life around me, the sun, the stars, the moon. I want to live till i am well into my old age, and I know that sounds silly or selfish, but I truly do not want to die. I know everyone has to, but I just... don't want to as dumb as that sounds.   


Anyways I am sorry this is long and may not make a lotta sense, I appropriate y'all for listening to my ranting. I am 24 years old, I am surviving the best I can, I just want things to get better, I know that is selfish to ask, but I really do want at the least a happy life for my partner of eight years and I, mostly for him, he deserves the world, better than what I can give him. He's been so patient with me. I may not have a therapist, but he has always been there even at my very worst. He keeps me grounded.   


Take care all!",22Aug2020,1
154,"So I finally have to come to terms with the fact that my mental health has been getting very toxic lately to The point that I feel like I need some sort of intervention to fix it but is it therapy that I need or is this something I should try to sort out on my own? Basically I’ve always been very defensive but it’s been ramped up extremely high recently where I feel like everything people say to me is against me almost, like I find myself feeling negatively about most interactions that I’ve had and I only realized that this is becoming a problem because I’ve sent some text conversations to other people and I’ve asked questions like “ are they being rude to me, why are they using this tone with me, what the hell is this attitude.” And almost always everyone will tell me that they weren’t being rude or whatever. I’ve kind of shut myself away from people because I find myself feeling negatively about most of the interactions I have maybe because I’m just sensitive I’m not entirely sure tbh. 

I really wish I could gain some confidence or just be able to not be affected by others as much as I am. I find myself ruminating (hope I’m using that correctly) overthinking conversations I’ve had feeling like I was being belittled or that they want something for me or they’re being rude. I don’t like having these thoughts but I just keep having them but I’m also very anxious about scenarios I keep making up for the incoming school year because there’s these people at my school who say these things to me and it will completely ruin my day to the point that that’s kind of all I think about. 

But... I am only 16 so I don’t always know what’s best for me and I’m hesitant to ask if I could get therapy because most of the people in my family are in therapy and I feel like my mom has a lot of guilt and I am her only child left who isn’t in therapy and I don’t want to insist if that’s not what I need. She’s in therapy and we got into a fight today and I said how I’ve been feeling like my life is stagnant and unfulfilling and she suggested therapy, I felt like she was just joking or invalidating my feelings or something, she said she wasn’t but I’m not sure. The strange thing about it is admittedly I’m kind of conceited, the best way to describe it is that I have a very big ego but it’s very fragile if that makes any sense? I have a kind of “you can’t count on others to be their for you so be their for yourself attitude.” Maybe I just have an inferiority complex and I’m blowing it out of proportion so I’m hoping Reddit could give me some perspective? 

Ps Thank you for making it this far, this is pretty long or maybe just to me because I’m dyslexic idk, I made a post similar to this one on r/introvert but I deleted it because like I said I don’t do well with harsh criticism so if this is deleted I’m sorry I’m just very sensitive lately for some reason and I do t want to embarrass myself by lashing out. ❤️ I’ll make sure to read any input anyone has to give.",22Aug2020,1
155,"So I was pre-studying for my next semester, which is mostly about reproduction. (I'm a vet student). I came across the chapter about lactation and was reminded of my own condition. I have tuberous breasts and am unable to produce milk. I'm getting them fixed (aesthetically) in a couple of weeks (have been waiting months) by a surgeon. Even though I know I'm getting them fixed, and so it is a bit easier for me to tolerate my breasts, I still constantly get stuck in this cycle where I feel like a complete victim. I cry for hours on end because I don't understand why I had to have this condition. I tell myself that I am devoid of all feminity because I don't have functioning boobs and have to get surgery for them to have any value sexually. I cannot be intimate with anyone without crying (and since that's a turnoff I just can't be intimate). I know that much of my self-image issues will disappear once I have the surgery done, but I find it hard to deal with the reality that I will never be able to breastfeed a child. 

I'm also aware that I must be so whiny that I feel this much of a victim with a condition that only impacts my aesthetics, mental health, and my ability to breastfeed, and the first two are fixable... I just don't know how to get out of this cycle of victim mentality. Everything could be so much worse, and I know that, but somehow it doesn't feel like that.",22Aug2020,1

157,"Back in February I had a voluntary trip to the hospital that ended in me getting drugged against my will until I went unconscious, then while I was blacked out I had multiple medications dropped in my mouth against my consent. They drugged me with a party drug called Ketamine , giving me two large doses back to back that ended up leaving a bruise on my arm that resembles getting hit with a paintball gun its so deep. They said i had an allergic reaction but I've had allergy tests done before and have never been allergic to any medications and they listed no active allergens on my chart. 
I think they overdosed me, and what I experienced in its entirety borders psychological torture. I experienced hallucinations that genuinely convinced me I was dying. I was very literally coming to terms and accepting my own death because I felt like my soul was leaving my body. Once I had finally regained full consciousness, i literally was begging them and crying to stop drugging me between convulsive vomiting fits. I woke up on an EKG , oxygen monitor, with an IV in my arm, and another bruise from the IV despite already being unconscious at this point and strapped down when then IV went in. This hospital has my medical records , both for psych and for general health , and they knew I didn't have any of the disorders they were giving me medications for , and also knew I had no history of drug use outside of smoking weed. I don't even use tobacco products and only recently started drinking more than once every three months as I turned 21. They violated my bodily autonomy. I need help bringing attention to this so I can find a lawyer to take on the case. I have the case available on https://www.legalmatch.com/home/viewCase.do?caseNumber=C2022645957248 and have the paperwork with the list of medications and pictures of the bruises 4 days after I left the hospital on the 26th of February",22Aug2020,1

165,"As per the opening question, how do I stop seeing people as utterly disgusting? There are exceptions — once in awhile I manage to make something like a friend, and I of course don't see them as bad. But for everyone, aquaintances and strangers, I cannot stand them. People to me just seem shallow, mean/nasty, hateful, and/or dangerous. My reaction seems partly visceral/emotional, given how poorly I was treated growing up by both parents, adults outside of my family, and peers — but there is also an intellectual component, i.e. I look at all the things wrong in the world today and reason that if the majority of people weren't scum and cowards, not even a half of such things would happen. I still am not treated well today, either, as evidently, something about me invites abuse.   


Between those two things, I seem to have very well precluded ever being able to tolerate much of anyone, but I know that's going to kill me, because you have to get along with others just to earn a living or otherwise keep the taxman off your back, at least. The thought of that makes me hate people even more, though, i.e. being forced to interact with them. My main goal in life has been to do something that allows me to be as isolated as possible, but there are very few things that you can do to be completely isolated, it seems like, these days — other than being a wandering hobo in a desert with the know-how to survive. And who knows, maybe I will be that, just to save myself, but the know-how is currently lacking. I don't know if any of that is an actual mental condition — I know I have all kinds of hormonal problems that could contribute to some feelings there, like my anger and anxiety issues. I don't know if it is paranoia, either, because, again, the heuristic that most people must be some sort of shit seems pretty well rationalised, though maybe that has something to do with some sort of perfectionism on my part. I at any rate am sure that at this rate, I either need to get a solid plan to get away from pretty much everyone, or else end up killing myself for the same end.",22Aug2020,1

She's going to kick me out and I'll be forced to stay with my dad for a few days over this.

none of my friends seem to try to talk to me and I have to start conversations but they don't seem to really understand what I'm going through. I had a 30min call with one waiting for them to come back after saying brb and then nothing for over 6+ hours. then trying to call out for help and my friends not responding because they have other things to do so I just sit there holding it all in unable to talk to my family because it's just abuse, my mother just insults me and treats me like a burden because i feel so low I can't even stay awake or wash up a one or two bowls while she leaves pots and pans in the sink for me to wash up, I try talking to her about this and it just ends up being insulted, a blamed for things out of my control or even saying I'm lying about things I'm telling the truth about.

I'm trying to see my GP but my local practitioner's reception just treats people like scum and I haven't heard anything back from them, they're review is a 2.2 only because of them.

I rushed over to see if I could talk to him. It took him a long time to start talking to me and when he did he talked about how he believes he’s the second coming of Jesus and he’s been chosen to save the world. He was not the friend I knew and it was very scary. I got in touch with his parents and they made it over and took him to stay with them for a bit. 

To my surprise they never took him to get any sort of help. He eventually sort of snapped out of his episode and while was definitely not back to normal he was not ranting and thinking he was the savior. I was bothered that his parents didn’t try to get some sort of help.

Fast forward a few months I receive some news from his coworkers that he’s sending all sorts of strange emails to superiors at work saying he is their lord and must be obeyed. I messages his parents to let them know but my fear is they will not do anything about it. 

I’m curious what my options are. I want him to seek help but I feel like the only people who could make him do that is his parents. I’m afraid he will eventually hurt himself or others and just lose himself to his own mind. Who can I call? If he has no desire to seek help on his own I feel so helpless.

I have zero interest in sex and zero experience. I am afraid of it. I spent a lot of my teenage life longing for the emotional connection of a relationship but fearing potential escalation. I see sex as something I have to do someday if I want to have a family but it feels like some great trauma I will go through.

Besides my anxiety in general, the only partial explanation I can think of for this is that I've witnessed many women in my life experience abuse. My sisters have both been assaulted multiple times and my mom was physically abused by her previous husband. 

I want to overcome this fear but I don't know how. I am on my dad's insurance and don't want to talk about it with him. I don't have much money. I live out of state currently. I don't know who I can see without anyone I know finding out.

The worst part is that I'm dating someone and beginning to fall in love with him. We have taken it slow up to now and I've been comfortable with the pace but I know that things are going to continue evolving and I don't want my mind to destroy our bond. I am normally afraid of men and I feel incredibly safe with him but thinking of having sex with him is even worse than thinking about it in general because I know it is a very real possibility.

179,"I'm 15, but I've attempted/considered suicide too many times. I count 4 attempts that i distinctly remember from the age of 11 i think. The first time, I put half my body over the window of the 42nd floor. I remember what it felt like. I wanted it to fucking end. I wanted the pain to just fucking go away. Every time I've attempted has felt so damn visceral, seared into my brain. I'm not sure if it's because of the emotional events right before that caused it, or how much in a shitty place I was in at the time. Im not comfortable explaining why i leaned out the 42nd floor btw, its too personal.

But i'm not super fucked up either, i gues??? I live with a forgive and forget mentality, and I think that I repressed my feelings well for a long time. Id just put them away. Guess i didn't forsee a mental breakdown happening. my first anxiety attack was scary as shit, and neither of my parents were supportive in the slightest. Those idiots thought i was mentally ill.

I've considered suicide a lot this year. I can most definetely say i was depressed for a lot of the winter because of how much was expected of me. I felt angry, sad, and lonely at the same time. I really felt alone, and I couldn't even reach out for help. Away from my best friends at a boarding school, I felt trapped and very much alone. Again, i dont feel comfortable explaining my exact situation, but I definetely changed a lot after the winter.

I feel very different nowadays. I'm happier, but I also feel, for lack of a better word, very different. I've changed, and i dont know if it's for the better or worse. I can't tell you what day it happened, but one day the pain and exhaustion of my past experiences broke something in me. I now like being alone a lot more. Id say theres a fine line between being alone and lonely, and I like being alone. I was loud, rambunctious, extroverted, and kinda annoying a year ago. Yet, now I'm quiet, reserved, introverted, and just kind of a shadow. I feel happier, but I don't know why. I feel that I shouldn't be happier, but I am. I feel kind of broken, and I can't tell if im happy or not.

that brings me to my point. As far as i can tell, i might be happier now, but I'm nowhere near as happy as I was before. Worse, I easily get really sad, and kind of back in that depressed state for no good reason. Sometimes I just wake up sad, sometimes it'll be something that triggers me and I kinda spiral downward. I just dont feel right sometimes, and I feel very indifferent and cold and not in my own skin a lot.

181,"My (28m) partner (28f) is a medical resident and is currently in clinical depression, and to my knowledge this is her first instance in such a state. She exhibits a wide range of symptoms--excess fatigue, helplessness, pessimism, irritability, loss of interest in most everything, craving of high sugar foods, aches, empty, ""black hole"". She is adamant on trying to figure it out herself and isolate, and her opinion is that she's overwhelmed with work and life and needs time alone. I have suggested professional help and offered my own ear to no avail.

We don't live together, but I spent every night with her until she really feel deep into the depression last week. Now she doesn't permit me to see her, and when we do barely communicate, her texts are foreboding and dark. However, I am not concerned about self harm right now.

I do agree she is overwhelmed and overstressed at work, and I know depression is more common among medical residents, but I do not believe she will be able to find a cure alone and isolated. I have made it clear to her, essentially daily, that I am available to talk when she is, that I love her unconditionally, and that I want what's best for her. Nonetheless, her pushing me away completely is very difficult to deal with, and she has no real hope of a less stressful work environment for at least the next 5 weeks (not even considering that residency will continually be stressful to different degrees for another 3.5 years for her).

Given this information, how can I get through to her? I haven't dealt with depression in myself or others before, and her complete indifference to me causes me great anguish. I put out a great deal of love and emotion towards her, and she provides absolutely nothing in return.

185,"I don’t know what to call my problem to get help and/or be taken seriously.

My life is empty and meaningless, devoid of connection to other people or drive for any selfish wants.

I told the last doc I couldn’t connect to people at all and she suggested I just keep trying and I’d find someone eventually. I’m f***ing 30. I’m social and charismatic. I make ‘friends’ when I want to but when we part ways I may as well forget they exist. I know that’s not okay. But aside from a shitty way to treat people, when I’m being social it doesn’t feel... any less hollow than being alone. It’s just more tiring, so I’ve stopped trying so much lately.

I’ve tried saying I don’t feel anything and then I got put through a round of depression treatment. Lots of help on how to ‘not hate myself’ and how to deal with ‘feelings of guilt’, no matter how often I told them I don’t feel any of that. I’m pretty generally awesome, with a normal amount of flaws and how other people live their lives isn’t a reflection on me. Never been under any assumptions otherwise. But somehow my way of seeing and processing the world is divorced and disconnected from how almost anyone else does.

I’m smart. I might be ADHD but nobody can seem to tell me. Currently the private practice I paid out of pocket for a test is still deliberating a month later. The last word was an official ‘you’re too smart to tell clearly, we gotta do a second round of tests’.

If I have a real ‘want’ it’s to be able to feel... a part of something. I’d settle for probably anything at all. But I can’t manage to find anything. I’m pretty sure by now it’s got to be me. It’s so improbable that the whole rest of the world goes around as isolated and numb as I do.

Emotional Neglect is pretty much a given. My whole childhood may as well have happened in an isolated sterile cell, devoid of meaningful human interaction. But I have to find something that’s actually in the DSM to get treated.

I was supposed to have my first appointment via video call this morning. I anxiously had breakfast, coffee, walked the dog, and spent way too much time making sure my laptop was ready to go and charged.....only for the therapist not to log on. I called the office and left a message explainingwhat happened.

I got a voicemail later from the therapist apologizing and explaining that she was new to the practice and that she was never informed she had an appointment scheduled. She did sound very sincere and apologetic, and I do understand that accidents happen and people mess up...but I just don't know how to feel.

It was big for me to make the appointment at all and the amount of nervous energy I had up to that point was incredible, only to have them not show? Lots of trust and confidence was lost, and I don't know if I can move forward with this therapist or her practice. But I also don't want this to be my excuse to not keep trying to get help.

When all I worried about was what to eat, what to say and what excuse to go out. Nowadays I can’t even do the things I want, I feel so trapped in just one moment.

189,"My wife has BPD and she has had significant improvement through counseling over the past 2 years. But one of the issues that always comes up is that whenever I calmly bring up something that upsets her, she blows up. She gets angry and either raises her voice at me or she just shuts the whole conversation down without resolving my concerns. For instance, today I brought up (calmly) that its frustrating and hurts my feelings that I can’t share how I feel because she takes it as a personal attack and immediately gets angry. She literally got angry by me saying that she often gets angry at me . Is this my life forever? Has anyone else experienced this and how did you handle these situations?

I’m already in dialectical behavior therapy, and I’m on medication for my bipolar disorder. It’s not like I’m self-diagnosing or taking my treatment solely into my hands. 

I just wanna know if there’s any else I can do? Any words of wisdom? SOMETHING? I feel so trapped. I wanna eat so badly. So so badly. My body won’t even let me do a basic human function. I haven’t known what it was like to genuinely enjoy food in awhile.

I don’t really purge anymore. I haven’t in about a month. I used to eat in insane excess then throw it all up (bulimia). But now.. I can’t even eat in excess. I can’t eat in general. I should be celebrating the fact that I haven’t purged in a good bit, but I can’t considering I feel like I’m getting worse. I have little to no appetite now. I definitely do not get the right amount of calories in a day, despite my efforts. 

I’m also in an environment that can enable me. My mom clearly has an eating disorder also, but she won’t admit it, despite the fact that she never has an appetite and barely eats. 

The only thing that’s helped more is medicinal marijuana, but it’s not affordable whatsoever. I also don’t wanna go through illegal means. The last thing I need right now is a potential possession charge.

I appreciate any (most?) comments, as long as you don’t invalidate what’s going on with me. I had this happen in another sub, so it makes me apprehensive to even post this. I just wanna talk to someone else about this besides my therapists. I want to know what helped you recover, or what’s helping a loved one to recover. I do not want advice to go to therapy, because I am. 3 hours a week in an outpatient program. I hope I don’t sound mean. Advice like that just really doesn’t help me or make me feel even a sliver of hope.

193,"I didn’t know where else to ask this, but it interests me and I’ve noticed it happens to me every once in a while. To be clear, I don’t see extremely clear words on walls or anything like that, my experience is every once in a blue moon I’ll see words arranged in some surface. For example, sticks on the ground or even in my food. I don’t really remember any specific ones, but they always seem to be innocuous random words, like last time it happened it was “father”. Sometimes I do wonder if they mean something though, like if it’s some kind of spiritual sign or something.

Is this something harmless akin to pareidolia? Or is it some kind of psychotic symptom? I’m not really worried. I don’t have a history of any psychotic disorders and it doesn’t run in my family, but I’m curious to hear a consensus. Thanks!",22Aug2020,1

So until 2019, I had 2 major goals in life :- 
1. To move away from my old house
2. To move away from my mom

And I graduated from my Master's last year, got into 2 UNI abroad. But couldn't go because of personal reasons. I mainly applied abroad to get away from the above 2 situations

But now the thing is both situation got resolved themselves. We sold the old house, and my mom moved away to a new country. 
And now as I was living on rent, I moved in with my long term bf and got two cats. I left two jobs cz wasn't happy and started working from home. I am earning the amount by which I am able to pay for food and utilities. Bf is working on his startup. And I have some support from my father who is helping in paying rent. I am happy n content. I am actually feeling fine.  
But this is not where I want to stop. I dont know, I had plans for PhD but have no idea what topic, so no motivation. Want to work in companies like Google, Microsoft but have no desperation like the feeling I WANT IT. NOP. Don't feel that way at all. I actually seem to have no motivation to move forward and this is killing me. I don't know why I am not able to set GOALS anymore. 

P.S. Had a very rough life before Mid 2019. And I finally got a break but I am not doing anything I liked at alllll. I dont even have materialistic desires anymore. I have no desire to grow. Why????

198,"We have a 5 week old baby so our mental health isn't great at the moment due to exhaustion. 

I briefly mentioned a childhood incident of mine when we first got together, but never really went into detail. The other night we somehow got onto the topic of it and he asked me more questions about what happened... And ever since then, he's been really affected. He says it's all he can think about and it has traumatised him that something so awful could happen to the love of his life. He's had trouble sleeping, and when I go to bed he's up for hours crying :(
He's struggled with OCD in the past and it has been triggered recently by this. My parents took us to the street and house I grew up in to show him, and once he associated it with my abuse he started to panic and think he was ""breathing in bad air"". 

It breaks my heart that he's so affected by it. He says he will feel better once they are behind bars, but whilst I'm open to seeking justice, I'm not ready yet and am feeling pressured. 
I'm ringing up the mental health clinic for him on Monday to get him some CBT which I think will really help, he responds really well to talking through his feelings. 

We love each other SO MUCH and when one of us is upset it really affects the other. We're very codependent, and connected with our emotions. I guess all I can do for now is comfort him and give him lots of TLC like he does with me when I'm struggling.",22Aug2020,1

203,"It's all in the title, I have found the girl of my dreams. It seems too good to be true and my cyclothymia picks at it everyday but whenever I tell her how my mental disorder is being annoying she just reassures me about how much she cares about me. She actually accepts my mental disorder and understands it and wants to help me overcome it. It genuinely made me cry when I realized how amazing she truly is.

In my past I was always trying to fill some void in my heart and use other people to complete me but after a suicide attempt and getting some help I decided to take time for myself. I wasn't looking for a relationship or even for sex, I spent around 6-7 months focusing on myself trying to make myself the most whole and real version of myself I could and I did. I walked my path and lived life not seeking love and it found me for the first time in forever.

With this girl I can genuinely be my true self and she loves it. I ask her almost everyday ""Why do you like me"" and she almost always responds ""because you're a good person"". It's as if she knows the exact words to say to make me feel better, like not something similar, the EXACT words. In one of my past relationships things ended horribly leaving both me and her scarred and I still have nightmares to this day about it. The girl I recently met told me while we were cuddling one night ""you make me feel so safe and comfortable"" and I deadass started crying because they were words I needed to hear that I didn't even realize I needed to hear.

Everything about this girl is just so perfect and it feels like every single bad thing that has happened in my life has led me to her. It feels ""cosmically correct"" I guess? She's perfect for me and I hope I never mess things up.

206,"Hello. 
I’m writing because of seeking advice about my girlfriend. 
The story: 
I’ve been together with my girlfriend for 3 years now. We love each other deeply, but she has always had mental issues. She has been diagnosed with borderline at a young age, but now she is at a new treatment facility which have said that it is more likely Schizotypal personality disorder. In the past she has tried to commit suicide, and occasionally hurt herself. We have also had an open relationship because that’s how she dealt with some of the damaging thoughts. Not something I like, and I we have also closed it again a year ago. Since her new treatment, she has showed tremendous progress. She began to be happy, and actually just this month begun to work for the first time in her life. 
The past 2 weeks though, I noticed she was not herself. She was not present, and rarely happy. 
I confronted her, and she said that she couldn’t control her thoughts anymore. She wanted to open the relationship again, because she couldn’t control herself anymore. She has begun to hurt herself again, because she feels a physical pain is easier to deal with than her emotional pain. 
She has cried multiple times this week, but she can’t get explain why. She just says, that she feels that she is broken inside and everything hurts. She doesn’t understand why. She loves me, and want me to be part of her future, but she can’t understand or control her mind/feelings. She doesn’t want me to leave. 
Off course she feels guilt because she knows that she hurts me because of the open relationships, but it’s more than that. 
I have made a compromise, and said to her, she can have the open relationship for a month, but she has to write down her feelings and find out, just what it is she is missing. 
But it just seems like she just wants to disappear. 
She doesn’t want to get admitted again. I have told her, that she needs to tell her psychiatrist how she feels, but she said; “I can’t, because I don’t know what I feel.” 
She doesn’t feel happy anymore. 
To be fair, I’m actually almost convinced I’m the problem, since I can’t live with an open relationship, maybe she would be better off without me? 
I dunno. Maybe I just needed to vent. Sorry for this ramble. I’m just frustrated.",22Aug2020,1
207,"Earlier this morning I had a mini tennis match among my tennis teammates. I'm a sophomore in high school (15F) , and it's my first time playing on the freshman/sophomore team. I competed against a freshmen- and lost. All five games. I lost and I feel worthless.

When I came home later my mother noticed I was upset, and tried to console me saying it was not a big deal and that I have yet to improve anyways. But on the other hand, I was told that throughout my life, I was not ""flexible"" and had a hard time mastering physical movements throughout all the attempts of kiddie tennis, swimming, and ice skating I had over the years. I was stubborn back in the day (the aforementioned classes mentioned were not my choice to be in lol) and I am currently paying the price for my previous reluctance (please tell me in the comments if this makes 100% sense to you, because it kind of doesn't to me). 

What I did notice is that I'm a slow learner at almost everything: academics, house chores, even favorites hobbies of mine, like drawing. I don't know what's wrong with me. I should be really good at drawing considering how long I've been practicing for (over a decade now), but compared to other people my age with experience, I am so bad. If I've been practicing drawing for years and am still not that good, how am I supposed to improve at *tennis*? It seems practice won't fully cut it in my case.

208,"Not sure where to begin, but basically, my mother and father have a very bad relationship (sporadic arguments, yelling, threatening to kill with a knife, etc.). It's been like this for more than 20 years, and while my dad is fine physically, my mother has very high blood pressure and continues to take medication for it. About a few weeks ago, there was a huge argument between my mother and father again in which my mother locked herself in her room for 4-5 days (My father hid alcohol in his bag and car because he doesn't want her to see it, and she absolutely hates being deceived). When she came out, she had brief spell of amnesia(?) because she tried to overdose on blood pressure pills (she also tried to hang herself in the bathroom as I saw her tie clothes to the shower rack). After about a week later (which would be about 2 days ago from today), she had an incident where she was accidentally bitten by one of our dogs (she was trying to feed him ice cream). There was a slightly deep laceration on the middle of her lip, and we had to go to the hospital to get her stitches. When we were at the hospital, she told me about how she has always felt ""worried"" about something her entire life because of my father (he used to be in the military, and I was told that there were incidents where she had to lock herself in her room with my older brother because he was threatening to kill them with a knife; I also wasn't born for this). There were also many other issues, such as alcohol and money. My father has since regretted everything he did, but my mother is unable to let go of the past (resulting in periodic mood swings that causes her to yell at my father). She even specifically told me that she would want to go to a counselor to cry her heart out and ventilate. Regardless, when we took her the hospital for the dog bite, she had a blood pressure of about 180 (can't remember what it was over). While it's obvious that it was that high due to the pain of the laceration, it's obviously still very concerning.

Today, my father and I heard her crying continuously in her room with the doors locked. I opened the door forcibly and saw her crawling around and crying (it genuinely seemed like a scene straight out of Paranormal Activity). She watches a lot of Asian ""ghost"" stories and whatnot (not stories in the sense that they are TV shows but camera crews that follow around priests and people who deal with the supernatural. Not really sure about it myself.) When she finally calmed down after about 10 mins, she told me that she couldn't breathe and that crying helped her relieve some of the pain (she told me how she felt a burning pain in her chest). What frightened me was how even though I tried to talk to her while she was crying and crawling around her room, it's as if she didn't hear or notice me at all. Afterwards, I kept watching her as she slept for about 30 mins (she was crying on-and-off while sleeping; I noticed her arms and fingers were twitching the entire time). When she got up, she acted like everything was normal and won't speak a word of what just happened.

For some background info, my mother is of Asian descent, and we live in the US. She doesn't speak English very well, but we fortunately live in a community that speak her native language. However, she often still feels very lonely as it can be somewhat difficult for her to make friends.

Regarding our situation now, my older brother and I have lucrative careers. We are financially very secure. My father, however, recently lost his job and is currently working a different job with a lower pay (he's also financially secure though). At this point, it's really my mother being unable to move on from how my father has treated her over the years.

There might be some key details that I'm missing, but I'm not quite sure. I apologize for the grammar, and if there are parts that are confusing, I'll be more than happy to clarify it. My reason for this post is that I'm just not sure what to do at this point.

212,"Hi, I am a bit reluctant to post about this but it just recently came up and I was hoping to get possible opinions or answers on this. I also apologize for the very unorganized post I am about to make, I’m just typing it as it comes.

This came home a few days ago when I was on the phone with my girlfriend. Somehow the topic of past sexual encounters came up and I realized I only actually remember sleeping with a select few amount of people if I really try to sit and think about it. 

I am 21, I always felt like I was mostly healthy. I am slightly prone to depressive bouts, but they usually have a reason for them. I know a couple psychiatrists have told me they think I might have (very) high functioning autism BUT I never decided to fully go through an official test or whatever was needed because even if it was the case I haven’t had any issues with it since I was under 10 years old or so. I do have fairly bad PTSD though from an armed robbery.

It feels like the time between my 8th grade year to the beginning of 10th grade just, didn’t happen. All the memories I have from then, I don’t feel like they are actually mine. Like, I was told there were things I did, and I feel like after being told once or twice I just kind of accepted it as the truth because those 2 years or so are just kind of blank in my memory.

But if I truly sit here and try to think about the events I’ve been touting as the truth, I can’t recall any memories about it other than details I’ve been told.

I guess what I’m scared of is that the life I’ve told people about for that potion of my life just wasn’t true. And to be honest I would love for a lot of those things to have not been true. But the issue is that I accepted them as the truth until recently and if it is the case that some of them aren’t true, how would I go about figuring out what is and isn’t true. How would I tell people what wasn’t true?

I wouldn’t even know how to approach it, because I didn’t go into it lying, or at least I didn’t think I was. But now I’m scared that portion of my life just wasn’t factual. 

Was it that I just don’t remember it well so I let other people fill in the memories, or did those things really happen and my brain is just trying to repress it?",22Aug2020,1

214,"if this doesn't make sense I apologize. I know this is Long but please read the whole Thing :)

short Backround:

i (17m) grew up in a middle class Household with 2 parents and a brother who are all awesome and supportive. I had Problems with anxiety, bullying, and generally Feeling unimportant, left alone etc. for all my life.

In the past there we're multiple times where i felt left alone and betrayed by the ones closest to me like bestfriends, Family (My brother is 2 years older(19) and like the perfect being. He is really good in School Always nice, good Looking etc. and everyone has him as their favorite. My grandparents don't even die it anymore) etc. . I am a Person who is really affectionate and caring and am Ready to do anything for my Friends, often if they are not Ready to give back. I know this naturally leaves me open to be hurt but i just can't do it differently no matter how much I try.

I also have severe ADHD which has made School basically a Living hell for me. I could only concentrate for About 20 minutes every day. I now receive methyphenidat(80mgs a day) which helps but i still struggle a lot because i just can't motivate me which further frustrates me.

I am in therapy for Depression and take prozac. Both mediacations have severe effects on me. I am regularily shaking and have Panic and stress attacks as well as constant anxiety. I  experience intense highs and intense lows where i consider ending it all(never thought About it before and would never do it because of my Family). I have a solid Group of Friends but i feel like I am the dependable friend. If hes there is alright but i feel like I'm not missed when im not there. For all my life I have wished to be someones fav Person and never archived that.

In Summer break(6 weeks here in Germany) i felt like it generally went uphill but in the last week before the School started I started to get intense lows and feel terrible and a General sense of emptiness i have never felt before. I can't cry even tho i want to i cant find anything to do and get aggressive towards others. I just lie in bed listening to Music and try to think of things that could improve my Situation.

My mother is really stressed with everything because she started working again and is workong 70-80hrs a week and even tho she wants to help me she just doenst have the capabilities atm. She is constantly stressed by work and my illness contributes to that  which is why i dont want her knowing why my condition is getting worse and worse every day. my Father even tho trying to be supportive doesn't get my situationn. He as well as my brother has always been the favorite and best in everything. He just says i have to bite trough it and it will get better but its not that easy for me. My brother even tho he tries to help me is not helpful at all. I just cant deal with him being better in everything and him being the one giving advice because i dont like to feel like the weak one even tho i am.

All my grandparents and relatives dont know anything in order not to get them scared etc.

The only exception to that is my Uncle who is a doctor and is the one who deals with my ADHD. I love him and even tho he is really supportive he as well as my therapist just dont get me.  They think it's an illness that will go by if they give me meds and tell me to feel great and do this and that and it will help.

Since I got in therapy and am taking meds my Situation has gotten far worse and i feel like it's going Downhill everyday. I love being in School and just concentrating on Topic i love and not deal with anything else(english and history being my fav subjects). Only there i feel like i am good at something and able to archieve something. I mostly get my highs there and in other lessons i try to concentrate to the best of my ability but i just cant motivate myself. My mom gives herself the fault for my illness and i cant convince her that it's not her and never has been her fault.

Even tho my Friends know About my condition i just feel like they dont care. When is started Smoking weed they got really annoyed with me and told me to stop(what i did but because of other reasons). Because of the medication i am not allowed to drink alcohol in any way which is the main Thing we do. After being sober at These Meetings for About 4 or 5 weeks i thought if they get wasted on alc which i cant be a part of because i am sober and feel left out i could just smoke weed and fit in again. After i did that they became extremely annoyed with me. I was just sitting watching tv and laughing but they got annoyed with me and threw me out.

216,"Yeah, i can accept it. I can kind of see beauty in it. It's a soothing feeling. 

Today i was having a day for me, i played the guitar and listened to music. A little bit of tidying up. Was mostly in my room and went outside a bit for a couple of strolls. Talked to my father and a good friend. I can see it in other people too. The loneliness... We shouldn't fight it, it's ours. You can't give up on yourself, it's a part of you. Music kind of led me to it. 

If someone is curios about the music this made me think. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qm0ru2iBuB0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qm0ru2iBuB0)",22Aug2020,1
217,"I've had longterm depression and anxiety. I saw 1 psychiatrist about 7 years ago whom simply wrote on my notes ""EUPD"" this session lasted 1 hour. I saw another recently who wants me to seek treatment for a year and a half for EUPD due to this although they admit that I'm very stable. I would have to pay for this treatment privately and every session would require me to take a train to a different city as it isn't available here.

The latest psychiatrist used the term ""working diagnosis"". To me, I don't feel like the diagnosis fits. I have been quite well for many years now and at the time that I recieved the working diagnosis, it was following a death and family upheaval, very stressful time for me and not reflective of normal life.

The psychiatrists wants me to accept the diagnosis or thinks that treatment wont work. Is stating that I'm downplaying and not accepting the diagnosis, even if it is a working one.

Can EUPD even have a formal diagnosis? How firm is a working diagnosis? Would you accept one? If I dont accept the diagnosis and treatment it can be held against me later on.",22Aug2020,1

I eat healthy and reasonable portions, but I still compare myself constantly. One of my roommates seems to barely eat and it's triggering me. This morning she only had an apple for breakfast. I was going to have an apple, avocado toast, and a hard boiled egg but I didn't make the egg because she was eating so little and I felt guilty. Then I felt hungry after. I know this is extremely unhealthy and I'm scared that I will continue this way and start restricting myself more and more. I'm not sure what to do at this point.

i said i would. but she just goes on and on about how i need to read it and how i started this whole fight.
i feel like i’m insane idk what i’m doing wrong she tells me one thing then tells me the complete opposite 5 seconds later.

In a way these things have also affected my sleep, and which in turn have worsened my mentall stress and made anxiety and depression more severe.

The mental health professionals I've been meeting recently suggested melatonin to help me sleep better. So far, I've had two good nights of sleep, and I've felt better...

But it feels weird. As if my anxiety and depression, at least at the moment, would be as good as gone. Like I suddebly could just do anything wirhput a worry. However, it feels like part of me also knows that it's not the case, as what I know I've suffeted from troughout my life would not be cured instantly by sleeping well. I guess it's that my mind is not in tired and thysly exhausted and more easily anxious and depressive state right now.

This is probably what also made it easier to ignore the severity of my mental healt as long as I did. It was always easy to think ""maybe I was just tired"".

She was saying today that i was using my mental health as an excuse and that basically it was my fault i caused this big argument where my dad got involved (he only gets involved in kinda serious and becoming out of hand arguments)

going when walking down the stairs.”

He didn't like that and started yelling calling me names all of a sudden he was very scary told me I was worthless I stood there in shock, he then told me I should just go kill myself o could feel my cheeks getting red (he knows I have my own mental problems) I yelled back at him absolutely enraged ""how could you tell me that"" ""I'll take you down with me"" I'd even tell him I'd rip his throat out and watch him suffocate :/ 

I looked over to my mom how could she let him talk to me like that?! I was about to have an absolute meltdown and yell at her but, she started crying and she had a very worried look on her face it kinda shook me and I looked over to my dad who wasn't pissed but had the same worried look I was confused and lost.

Now I don’t really have that option. I’ve tried meeting people with Tinder and joining communities online with lackluster results so far (mostly due to a bit of social anxiety).

The thing is that I am living alone, I never had any real friends since my teen years (I am now 23). Well, I made some acquaintances in the college, but I never felt that they are the friends to the point where I can tell them my problems. So pretty much complex situation with my dating life too - I never had a girlfriend. This year I graduated college and I am currently in a job that I will probably quit this upcoming week, because I feel extremely unmotivated. I am working in a field, where you always have to study to keep your competences, but I struggle to keep doing that, instead I chose to watch movies or distance myself to other things that are completely unrelated and useless in my future career and in general will not bring me any meaningful value. I would like to become more social and instead of doing the things that are useless to me, I would like to get back my motivation and spend time productively. 

Right now I am bit depressed with my current life situation and sometimes I catch myself thinking some extreme thoughts. I try to avoid all these topics I mentioned before when I am on the phone with my parents, I just lie to them and tell them that everything is going fine, I have a job and live the normal life that most people live, I think they don't believe me anymore.

253,"This is a classic/typical story, but I'll share with you regardless. 
Unfortunately I was raised my one of the many parents that don't have enough experience in expressing their emotions. When I was born, they already had their own problems, and they carried them until today. I don't entirely blame them, because they're not terrible people, but doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.
Like any parent, they would ask me what I wanna do when I grow up, but me and my mother in particular would always ended up fighting about it.
Whether any parent wants to admit it or not, they're gonna have an idealised image of their kids. So it feels like my mom always has this image of me sitting in a big tall office taking care of her company, with long hair and heels and a wedding ring. And whenever I detached or ruin her image, she makes such a big deal about it. Of course I changed my mind over the years like anyone would, but its because I never thought I'd be an artist, I mean, she really made it seem like I can't be an artist ever. 
It took 19 years for me to start making money from being a freelance, and she finally started to be open about it once I told her how much MONEY I make. 
This artist thing is only one thing that I have to be so stubborn of.
Another is hair, she wants me to keep the long hair and she almost forbids me of getting a pixie cut, because I've been wanting to, but all I ever gotten was a bob. Yea we fought about hair several times.
It took me to live alone in college to actually cut my hair short, and she had no clue until I showed it to her. I know hair is probably not a big deal to you guys but it is to me. We also fought about clothes because she hates the things I wear, she thinks I look  like trash (I was only wearing a Kiss shirt and ripped jeans)
Of course mental health, when I decided to be open about her because my therapist told me to (he was kinda shit though), my mom made me promised to never go to therapy ever again. She thinks they're just a waste of money and she tells me to talk to her whenever there's something, but I would never get the chance to talk about everything and it always ends up me listening to her, and she just makes it about her.
Now I want to pursue my career as a tattoo artist, but I don't think I need to explain how much she's against it, you guys probably know by now.
There's so many people that tell me the complete opposite, saying that I have potential, I'm beautiful with short hair, I have good taste in fashion, I'm this, I'm that, except my own mother. And whenever she says that she's proud of me its so hard to believe it.
Because I feel like I'm such a big flaw in her eyes, I'm such a disappointment for not being the person she wants me to be. I don't fit in her standards at all. I'm not conventionally pretty, I'm not tall, I don't have long silky hair anymore, I'm not in Oxford, I want to be an artist (tattooist even), I have anxiety, OCD, and I cry about them. I'm not bubbly and positive, I've been suspended from school, been interrogated by my principals, and all of these things make me hate myself.
So I don't tell her things anymore and I still won't even when she's questioning it. I'm just as stubborn as her, and I'll still be myself regardless. But whenever I think of this, it still makes me really sad and it still makes me cry. If I come off as a bratty spoiled child, I don't mean to. This is just one of the many issues I want to have clarity on, so I'm writing this. Hopefully it'll make you guys feel less alone too.",22Aug2020,1

255,"So when I first started drinking at parties at 15 (ish), I liked it. This was because it helped me escape my mild yet socially inhibiting social anxiety, and I genuinely felt amazing when drunk due to being able to have seemingly great conversations with most people who I’d normally be awkward around. The buzz was great, and I looked forward to it as much as all my friends did.

I am now 19, and while at my first year at university, I started to develop weird side effects to drinking. It started like I’d get this weird feeling when I didn’t have a drink in my hand when drunk at a club- because I’d start to think to myself ‘wait what if this drunkness wears off in the middle of this party??’ ‘I don’t want to slowly feel sober at midnight and then have a bad time!?’ So I’d make sure I had a drink, even if I wasn’t drinking it, it made me feel better knowing I could if I wanted to, and the feeling would disappear. 

Predictably, soon after this developed, I started getting this feeling at the end of most club nights out, because I wouldn’t have a drink with me due to clubs not allowing you to take drinks out etcetera...

So now I’m in this position where, a thing I used to love to do is being ruined by a strange yet intense sad feeling I get when a night-out comes to an end. It’s not a hangover (I rarely get them), it’s something else. It’s just a general sadness which really puts a bad spin on the whole previous night even if it was great.

I think some of you may tell me to stop drinking full stop- but you must understand this is difficult because I dislike smoking, and going sober on a night out just isn’t my thing due to social anxiety. I don’t want to give up nights out with my friends at the young age of 19! Especially when I know how much fun I used to have on them. 

Pretty sure I’m not an alcoholic because I never drink outside of clubbing which is like once a fortnight. Also, I am not depressed I’m usually happy (if anyone thinks this is the reason)

TLDR: get weird sad feeling when I stop drinking on nights out clubbing, that usually lasts about 2 hours. It’s beginning to ruin nights out but I don’t want to give up drinking because I’m 19 and I don’t smoke and I have mild anxiety so I like something to take the edge off when clubbing. Anyone else know what this is and can give some advise please. Thanks a bunch 😀!",22Aug2020,1
256,"I'm really not sure if it has to do with the outlook of life or not. 
I've grown to feel nothing.

I workout, I go on hikes, etc. I'm relatively active but nothing really seems to spark interest. 

I don't want to drink but that's the way how can feel anything. I hate to admit it but I also cut. I'm tired of seeing my scars and want to stop. Doing these are bad coping mechanisms and I want that to change. 

Any suggestions? I want to feel again and I'm getting really tired of this.",22Aug2020,1
257,"I just can't bear it anymore. I'm having a lot of suicidal thoughts but at the same time I dont want to end my life so early. I'm 14 but I have a lot of problems. First of all, I have severe back pain because I dont really move that much. I have anxiety and I'm scared only to get outside so 90% of the time I stay in house. In 6th grade I was diagnosed by a school doctor with scoliosis but I didn't go further (go to see a specialist for example) because my parents didn't have time for me. Then, in 7th grade a classmate punched me really hard (for no reason, I was a shy student) and he basically moved my scapula bone and I have really bad pain when I try to move my left arm too much. Along that, I have a little brother (1 yr old) and my mother puts me to look after him 24/7. My father is doing nothing, he's just sitting all day, no job, doesn't help me with HIS son and along that, emotionally abuses me. He yells at me for no damn reason and over the years, built me a fear. For the past few days, all of my pains worsen and I couldn't look after my little brother because that implies holding him (13 kilograms) and a lot of other things because he's very agitated. Since then, my mother doesn't speak to me because I don't help her anymore, my bigger sister is angry at me because now she has to look after my brother instead of just doing nothing all day and along that I lost appetite and weight. I lost 10 kilograms the past 2 months (I'm not doing any sport, I'm just staying in house all day) just because I don't eat. Plus I have insomnia, currently it's 3 am. Usually I sleep from 4 am to 3 pm but I still have no energy and feel really tired. I can't even hold a 1.5kg dumbbell. I keep having these mental breakdowns, crying for no fu#kin@ reason just because I hate my life and feeling worthless. My parents never helped me emotionally and it breaks my heart. That father and son bond was never there. I hate my dad with all my soul, he made my life worse and he keeps doing that every day. My mother did everything so she didn't have time for me. I tried to tell my mother about a psychologist but she said that I'm not crazy and it's not my place to go. I've been saving up money for an appointment but I can't afford it. My parents will definitely not pay for it and my only hope is that I will overcome it on my own. These are just a few reasons that I hate my life, and the massive bullying that I've received in school doesn't help me.
I don't know if I didn't explain correctly and I'm sorry if I made any grammar mistakes but English is not my native language and I'm trying my best. I just want this to end and maybe reddit is not the right place to speak about it but Im looking forward to find help and discover myself, be happy and live my life...if I get the chance to live anymore.",22Aug2020,1
