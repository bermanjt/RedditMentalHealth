0,"Hey I'm a 21yr male who has been dealing with social anxiety for pretty much my whole life, on top of me avoiding large events or social gatherings, It has caused me to have self esteem issues as well. I'm black and has never told anybody about all these feelings, not that I have any friends to vent to anyway , but I should at least have my family right? Unfortunately being black and mentally ill is taboo, or at least it feels that way, Every day feels like a emotional rollercoaster and its tiring, life isn't perfect but I just want to be content with the things I do have, and feel more comfortable in my own skin.    

Ps If anybody has felt the same way would love some feedback, I'm new to this so it doesn't have to be advice just want to vent.",05Jun2020,1
1,"I will turn thirty years old in a few months and even that feels alien to me.  I have always felt aged despite not having spent the years alive to justify it...

In the three decades I have been alive I feel like I have never become a fully realized person... If you compared me to the average person, I would appear to be a 2-D cardboard cutout lacking substance and definition.  People have likes/dislikes, passions, hopes, desires and feelings. I feel things and I appreciate things but my feelings are stunted and shallow, like they too are not fully realized.

In those thirty years, I have maintained no relationships with people outside of my family and only one consistent albeit emotionally awkward connection with one of my parents.  Since April 3rd of this year, outside of work, I have only seen and spoken to two people.  I do not have game nights, lake trips, super bowl parties, Christmas or Thanksgiving celebrations. I do not have friends that I visit or text or talk to or video call.  I work to generate an income and come back to a home where I keep myself alive and occupied until it’s time to go to work to keep the cycle going.  I don’t feel bad about it most of the time but I think I am numb and almost watching my life from afar. The only intense emotions I seem to feel are negative.  I can feel intense fear, intense anger and while few and fleeting intense sadness. I do not feel joy, happiness, contentment or excitement. I do feel love and empathy and I can laugh and I have a cherished dog who has been by my side for almost a decade. 

I have a very difficult time making decisions, surviving social situations, expressing wants/needs/feelings and most of the time I do not know why... I do not have hobbies, interests, passions or dreams. I feel half-human  and unresolved.  As I turn thirty, I wonder why I am here.  Life is hard and hostilely textured; for me it is very rarely and never consistently peaceful much less enjoyable.  I have these fleeting memories from childhood where I remember feeling still... The last time I can remember I smelled chlorine, I felt the heat radiating off the living room window and I felt quiet inside, contented.  I would think you attain this by meeting your needs...shelter, food, and general safety but I have never been able to recreate that sense of peace or comfort.  How does one feel so little and yet remain so discontented and uncomfortable? 

I don’t know who I am, if I am or why I need to be here. I have one person and one canine to look out for in this world and when they are gone I don’t think there will be anything left for me.  I feel like I am running out a clock by making sure the remainder of their lives are not subjected to undue negativity or hurt. When that time is up, I think mine will be too.",05Jun2020,1
2,"I have social anxiety, general anxiety, am shy, quiet, and an introvert, and no matter what I do, I can't seem to improve. I have tried taking professional speech classes at my university, and I've even taken AP French in highschool ( where I've had to give daily speeches in French). But no matter what I do, I still get very anxious before a presentation or speech to the point I'm unable to sleep or eat. My general anxiety is something I've come to manage, but not my social anxiety. Whenever I do something out of my comfort zone, I feel so anxious for hours that I can't concentrate on anything else. I've tried breathing exercises and the techniques my therapist gave me, but nothing seems to help. It doesn't help that I have a naturally quiet voice and that I'm very shy. People( teachers and my family) are also always telling me that my quietness is annoying. I've never gotten bullied, because to most people, I don't even exist. 

I've always heard that being an introvert is different than being shy or having social anxiety, so it feels worse when you have all three of them.",05Jun2020,1
3,"I've been trying to avoid this feeling for a long time but, I'm alone. My only friend is my boyfriend and I'm ruining that too. I just want to bawl because I go through the days numb yet hurting. But poor me, right lol. We all have it rough",05Jun2020,1
4,"I changed jobs around late October last year, I knew it was a bad idea but I did it anyway. I was sadly right, I despise my job and it is eating away at my sanity. I took the job thinking maybe I could do it, it had decent health insurance, but I'm not the right person to be a corrections officer. I do the job to the best of my ability and make sure everyone is always safe including our clients within the work release facility. 

I have put out over 40 applications and not so much as one interview, which is quite disheartening. 

To add to all of this I have been home for nearly two weeks because I was sick. My first covid 19 test was inconclusive, I'm awaiting the results of the second test. Being home has only reinforced my desire to never go back, while my anxiety and depression have gone through the roof. 

Part of me wants to say sod it and just tell them I want go back, I know it will be a huge relief. However, I can't risk my family's wellbeing. I have always done and sacrificed anything to make sure they were never at risk from losing a roof over their head or being hungry. 

I feel very lost and mixing that with my major depressive disorder and anxiety is making it impossible to think clearly.",05Jun2020,1
5,"So something that I deal with, some days worse than others, is a really weird mental ""black out"" if I had to describe it. I still can function normally and I'm not zoning out I'm still paying attention, but when it happens, if I'm thinking to myself, reading, talking, listening to someone talk, etc. I lose all understanding of what is being said or read.

It's like if you were in a conversation with someone and they immediately switched to a foreign language and continued like they hadn't.

For background, I have depression, haven't had any major head injuries, and have had an MRI that showed nothing. This happens multiple times a day for about a minute at a time, sometime longer.

I've mentioned it to doctors before, hence the MRI, but they didn't find anything. So I guess I'm just looking to see if anyone else has had this happen before?",05Jun2020,1
6,"Ive been on hold for over 10 hours, I need help I am starting to go crazy I dont feel like a human anymore.

7,"For anyone that takes a benzo before bed, does it ever just not work for you on particularly anxious nights? Last night I took mine at 11:30, and fell asleep at 4 or later. I got 2 hours of sleep, so today has been miserable, especially with the added anxiety and fear of it happening again..

9,"I've been depressed for quite some time now. Growing up with an emotionally abusive mother took it's toll on me throughout my adolescence and adult life. 

Lately I have been even more depressed than usual considering the state of the world. Both of my parents were affected and almost died from COVID-19 and now the civil unrest around the world are really taking its toll on me. Going to a local protest and being teargassed and shot with rubber bullets was pretty traumatic as well. I hate to see others across the U.S getting brutalized by the police and having their constitutional rights being violated really breaks me down. I hate seeing our black brothers and sisters being discriminated against and brutalized, I hate hearing pro-trump supporters or anti-BLM being racist and ignorant still, I hate how our President is handling his whole presidency, and I hate that I feel hopeless and am worried that nothing will or in a sense, everything will change. Nothing is going to be the same after this.  Our children, our future are going to face the repercussions.

I quit my job a couple days ago due to my mental health and I haven't been eating and sleeping A LOT, I barely want to get out of bed, let alone my room. My family is really worried about me and cry when they see me.

I hope others are being stronger than I am and do not feel the same way I do but I know that I am not alone in feeling this way and there are many others out there suffering in silence. I cannot even begin to imagine what the black community is feeling. I do not know what to do anymore. I really need some help. Where and how can I find it?",05Jun2020,1
10,"I’ve been struggling to manage my mental illnesses since I was a teenager—I’m now in my late 20s. Between depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and possibly ADHD, I feel very tired. I am tired. This year has been especially hard. And I don’t just mean 2020 because we all know how hard these last six months have been for everyone, but I mean my last 365 days. My husband and I separated after being together for ten years. I had two failed relationships following. 

I don’t really feel like I have anyone in my life to talk to about how I feel. And I certainly don’t have the ability to seek professional help. Between pandemics and living in the US as a working poor “essential employee” means I don’t have access to healthcare. I don’t want to live, but I’m not going to kill myself. I explained it best to someone by saying this: “Like am I really going to do ‘the thing’ ? No but being alive right now is too hard for me mentally and I’d rather be absolute nothingness in a cosmic void but instead I’m a lump of flesh that’s piloted by an electric pile of meat”

Sometimes I wonder how long I have to fight until things get better. Not just for me, but for the many people who are also in a similar position. I’m tired of being a lump of flesh piloted by an electric pile of meat.",05Jun2020,1
11,"I keep losing time. Waking up, blacking up, not knowing where I am, posting about wanting to hurt others, myself. I feel so off. I’ve been in the ward before, it hasn’t helped much, but I feel like I might do something bad. Maybe this new place can help.",05Jun2020,1
12,"I take 20mg of Prozac daily. I’m having a particularly anxious evening, would it be okay to take Hydroxyzine (Vistaril) to calm me down and put me to sleep even when taking Prozac?",05Jun2020,1
13,"For years, I’ve been around the wrong people, friends and lovers alike. I’m a really giving person, and always wanting to be there for others no matter what, I would push the fact that they were toxic because I wanted something that everybody had, friends and somebody to start a family with because I always wanted kids and always wanted to just settle down. Had an abusive ex who caused me to miscarry physically. Immediately after that, came across “Leeches” who saw me as a target because of how trusting I was and such, one girl even pimped me out because “Oh, we can do this and this and get tattoos.” My own mom said that I’m the type who’d follow somebody off the cliff to make them happy-type. And when I got raped in August the girl pimping me out, her only advice was to “Move on and get over it.” and every time I’d question her motives, she’d manipulate and make me question myself, I feel so alone and lost trust for anybody after the leeches. New relationship happens, and he’s the sweetest guy there is. He knows everything about my past, that I have abandonment issues, depression, anxiety, a rape victim/survivor who is struggling mentally.

I’m scared, I’m scared that things will never get better for me. I’ve been pretty suicidal lately, I feel as if even if I tell others, it won’t matter because of everything happening lately. Because of the rape, I’ve been relying on sex to cope mentally. Though lately, boyfriend has been rejecting me (My ex would always act like something is sexually wrong with me and a lot of things make me self-conscious.) I know there is something medically happening bacterial-wise down there and I’m getting it fixed soon. I’m always trying to stop and tell myself “No, he’s not rejecting you because he’s tired of you.” “He’s not at his friend’s because he wants to get away from you.”

I was in special ed class, a little slow with a case of being born hard of hearing. People think I’m just not responding to them but I’m internally processing what they said. I panic when told “No, let’s go through the math.” Because I was always bad at math because again, special ed classes, but I always feel embarrassed because all I’ve known, is being humiliated and treated as if I’m a burden by other people. My boyfriend is leaving out of the state soon, since we live together, I’m not even sure if I feel safe with myself. I even feel like a burden to my boyfriend when I know it isn’t what he feels about me but it’s torture. 
I just want to be able to start a family with my boyfriend (We’re trying) and to just have a new start, but it feels like it’ll never happen, not with everything shitty going on along with having to see my rapist again in Trial during everything.

I just wanted to write this out and get it out like a journal, but with sharing it to the world. 

I’m so emotionally and mentally exhausted, all I feel like I can do is just be silent and let things happen in my life.

I’m tired of feeling like a burden to everybody, had to leave my 7 year job because it just got worse there.

I really don’t know what more to do for myself.",05Jun2020,1

17,"A couple years ago a new girl moved to my school and I bullied her and made racist jokes to her just because she enjoyed a certain brand of clothing. She ignored the bullying and then I escalated it to a fight she didn’t want or ask for. I knew fully she won but I never admitted it and I told everyone I knew that I won, due to me being more popular at the time most people agreed I won. A couple year passed and she began doing drugs, smoking, drinking and driving. She began getting more popular and ended up hanging around with the same group of friends as me and we made up. I apologised and we were on good terms, so good that we would joke about it. And fast forward to about 5 months ago she posted on Instagram that she didn’t want to live and he talked to me about it the next day at school. She had a tough relationship with her mom and when she went to visit her dad who lives in India it was a terrible time. A couple days later she got into a street fight and told me after how it was my fault that she was the way he is, I don’t disagree with her. From that day forward I said to myself “I’ll help her, I’ll give her the support she needs”. Later she posted the same thing saying she didn’t want to live, but I didn’t do anything I saw it but didn’t talk to her. My reason was “she probably has a ton of people giving her support right now.”. And the same things happened again a week ago but now it was a picture of her holding a knife to her wrist. I messaged my friend asking if she saw it too and I asked her if she messaged her. After this I messaged her myself asking if she was alright she said yes. I’ve only just the last few days realised how much of a evil person I am. The reason I didn’t message wasn’t because “she had too much support” but rather I just didn’t want to because it made me uncomfortable. The reason I even said I’d give her support in the first place wasn’t because it’s what I should’ve done after causing this but rather “if I didn’t do it she would have called me out for it, and maybe even start another fight. One I didn’t want”. I asked my friend first is she had seen or messaged her hoping that she would say “yeah I did message her” so I wouldn’t have to. I made the mess but I try my best not to clean it up myself and have others do the work. And the recent black lives matter protest have made me realise that I’d rather let others suffer if it makes me a bit less uncomfortable. I don’t like talking about racism so I haven’t. I don’t really know why I’m posting this maybe for sympathy? Or to vent. The worst part is that now I know I’m a piece of shit and what makes it worse is that I most likely won’t change, I’ll probably stay a piece of shit my whole life.",05Jun2020,1

21,"Basically the title. I was diagnosed with severe depressions and numerous anxiety disorders on top of minor OCD about three years ago (I also have ADHD, but that was diagnosed well before that), and around that time, I, and some of the people around me, realized that my personality changed quite a bit pretty much instantly in the sense that I was always very irritable, very bitter, and would snap at everything. I didn't have the best temper before, but it was nothing like this. My counsellor and my doctor both believed that it probably had to do either with mental illnesses themselves or the medication I was on, but as I have been getting significantly better, the irritability and nightmarness isn't going away AT ALL, if anything, it's getting worse. I am currently titrating off one of my two antidepressants, but I decided to nitrate off BECAUSE I was feeling so much better and the irritability was persisting/increasing even before I started titrating down. I've worked through numerous anger management programs and I've been doing mindfulness meditations for the last like 6 months as well. Any advice or info that may help me out here?",05Jun2020,1

23,"I get on with my life trying to be one of the good guys, be nice to people, respectful etc etc.

I recently noticed that I can't decide if I'm trying to be a good person, or that I'm simply confrontation adverse.

I had an intense upbringing and had it drilled into me not to cause trouble.

Even on the Internet, my heart rate elevates and I feel like I'm having a mild anxiety attack when someone criticises me. It got to a point where I felt gaslit on several forums. I don't think I'm trying to be incendiary but it definitely led to me feeling like I'm being harshly judged.

I try to make light of everything in real life and I don't know if it's a mask to hide what I'm really feeling deep down.

I don't have anyone else to measure my emotional reactivity with. My sister used to call me short fused. I don't smash things up but I think it shows in my face or something. Im not one to voice my frustrations externally.

I was bullied as a kid and when I feel like I'm going to deal with confrontation, I feel like I'm clamming up on the inside and feel like crying. It's compounding my feeling like a wuss.

I feel like I've reached the point where I'm scared to voice my opinion, even anonymously on the Internet, in feae of negative reactions.

24,"I think I have a mental illness. I do not know. I never have sought for help and never told anyone about this. Recently, I get more frequent panic attacks. I'm also worried that I'm having extreme mood swings. I tried searching for bipolar disorder and Im not sure since bipolar is long term mood swing and mine is different. 

The thing that made me think my mood swings aren't normal is when I feel down, it's extreme. It isn't just feeling sad anymore and I get suicidal thoughts. I also started to cut myself. Right now im not in ""the lows"" and not having suicidal thoughts. It's weird.

My sleep pattern is completely fucked up too. I sleep on the day and am awake ALL NIGHT. This has been going on for weeks. I can not stay too for longer than 6-7 hours of sleep. It's driving me mad. As much as I like to sleep, I can not have peace. My head hurts when I try to, so I just get up and tire myself up.

My phone is my distraction. I think it keeps me from ""the lows"" (I call it that now). I also started to not want to talk to anybody nor have any contact. I became more irritable. Is it weird that a while ago I started panicking after killing a cockroach? Fuck this sounds like some crazy shit. Lol I PANICKED OVER A COCKROACH wtf

Idk if they are panic attacks but what's for sure is IM NOT CALM

I have also avoided to watch some movies when people start arguing or shouting. It was last week when it started. It never happened before but suddenly a memory started to resurface and made me panic AGAIN. I cried non-stop for minutes and was not able to calm down. ended up not finishing what I was watching. I tried watching a different movie and when people start shouting at each other, the same uneasy feeling comes again. It makes me extremely uncomfortable. 

Im not taking this seriously. Im still young. Im just 15. This could be wrong. I might just be faking. But im worried that if im alone when I have to move for school I might hurt or kill myself. It's like im a different person when im at ""the lows"" and when stable.",05Jun2020,1

30,"I have never actually posted anything on reddit and I am pretty anxious about doing so. I originally wrote this with the intention of solely writing about me and my brother’s relationship, but somehow it turned into this really long story about my life. So, if anyone takes the time to read this thank you for listening. There might be some triggering topics in this post so be wary of that if topics of rape/self harm/suicide/drug addiction are triggering to you. 

My brother and I have never had a good relationship. Growing up in a dysfunctional family and with a father that struggled with drug addiction throughout our childhood, one would think that would draw us closer together and allow us to lean on each other for support having dealt with the same traumas. However that is not even close to how the dynamic of our relationship works. My brother growing up kept to himself. He didn’t want to talk about anything going on and understandably so. I know people handle traumas in different ways. But as the younger sister I always looked up to my brother for support, but I never got that. He didn’t want anything to do with me. When I would turn to him for comfort he would get so angry, scream at me to leave him alone. I remember years later after we both were in college and our dad had been sober for several years I confessed to him how much our dad’s addiction had affected me and continues to affect me to this day. I cried to him and he was completely stoic and only said “stop acting so privileged. Many people have it much worse”. Growing up in a household that turned a blind eye to the addiction and abuse we all endured and especially with a brother who claims it has had no effect on him at all made me feel extremely alone. I had no one to turn to. When I got older, in my early teenage years, I hit a very rough patch. My dad had again relapsed and left our family for weeks draining the bank accounts to use for drugs. One day my mom and I drove around our town trying to find him and when we finally did he was in his car with this extremely pale, gaunt woman. It was clear years of drug abuse had taken a toll on her body. My mom followed his car and got out at a stop light to try to talk to him. When she grabbed the door handle, my dad drove off causing my mom to fall hard on the concrete. She quickly got back in the car and continued to follow him and he led us to a crack house on the sketchy side of town. At that point I was hysterically crying. I felt so betrayed and honestly in shock of how my dad was treating his own family. I felt unwanted by my own dad. I begged him to come home and he lied straight to my face saying he’d come back that night. He didn’t come home for weeks. When he finally did it was because he owed some drug dealer money and they had shot at him while he was driving. After this whole ordeal my dad went to a baker-act facility and then stayed at a halfway house for about a month. My mom claimed throughout this time that she would finally divorce my dad so we’d never have to go through this again. But to my surprise he moved back in not even a month later. It seemed like my mom did a complete 180 and now that my dad was home we were expected to treat him like nothing had happened. My dad constantly would demand respect from me. I was so angry at this time. I hated living there and I hated having to see my dad every day. I felt betrayed by my dad, by my mom, and by my brother who completely shut me out. During this time is when I really started to act out. I was 14 years old when I met a group of not so good friends. I started smoking weed, drinking, smoking cigarettes, and becoming sexually active. I would stay out way past curfew and honestly just defied my parents in every sort of way. At the time I didn’t realize why I was acting that way. I don’t think you ever really do when you’re going through it. Only in retrospect do I realize how much my father’s addiction had affected me. I would cut myself every night and I still have scars to this day from years of self mutilation. I hated myself very much and still struggle with self hate even now. On the night I tried vodka for the first time ever, I got black out drunk. At the time I thought I was with reliable friends. But later that night, I came to completely naked on the beach with random people trying to dress me. They took me home and the next day when I checked my Instagram, pictures of me naked on the beach were all over my timeline. A hate account was made about me that posted the picture with a caption that said how much of a disgusting slut I was. A bunch of kids from my high school commented on it agreeing, calling me a whore and a slut. Come to find out later that the guy friend I was with that night took advantage of my state, raped me on the beach, and left me there for random people to find me. And the people who took the photo and posted it were my friends that just so happened to come across me on the beach that night. After this I fell into the darkest depression I had ever experienced before. I cut myself twice as much and would walk home directly after being dropped off at school. I knew everyone was talking about what happened and could hear the whispers of slut being passed around as I walked by. Even this wasn’t the end all for me. The reason I tried to take my life that night was ultimately because of what my dad said to me. I returned home that night after a full day of skipping school and hiding out at the community recreation center. My parents had gotten another call from my school that I had skipped yet again and they were understandably very angry. I understand why they were so mad but they knew what had happened and they weren’t sympathetic at all. They didn’t understand that I couldn’t show my face at that school. I felt so ashamed and hated by everyone. And most of all I hated myself. The argument escalated and my dad told me “you will never amount to anything but a hooker” and that was it. I was defeated and I knew I couldn’t do it any longer. I didn’t know how to kill myself but I tried taking all the pills I could find in my house. I took two whole bottles of melatonin, a bottle of ibuprofen, and I tried to drink bleach but couldn’t make myself drink more than a sip. I laid down in my bed so tired, so exhausted and fell asleep. I woke up abruptly in the middle of the night in complete agony. The amount of pain I was in was incomprehensible. I was vomiting violently everywhere. I just couldn’t keep in it. I felt like I was dying. My parents rushed me to the hospital where I was stabilized. From there a cop hand cuffed me, put me in the back of the patrol car, and transferred me to the same baker act facility my dad had been to so many times before. I stayed there a full week and was diagnosed with a copious amount of mental disorders and put on medicine. When I came back home nothing had changed. My brother still didn’t want anything to do with me. My dad was still expecting the utmost respect and discipline from me and my mom still followed my dads orders like a puppy dog. And I was still just as broken as ever before. I was expected to change though and when I didn’t well... all hell broke loose. Unfortunately, my suicide attempt open my parents to the door of mental health rehabilitation. They put me in and out of psych wards for the next several months, each time a new mental disorder was assigned to me. The third time I was put in they diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and put me on probably the worse medicine I have ever been on: abilify. The doctor gave me way too high of a dose to start off on. Keep in mind I am a 90 pound 15 year old at this time being given a high dosage of an anti-psychotic drug. A day after starting the drug I got extremely ill. I had a splitting migraine that lasted for days and was throwing up every half hour or so. They gave me Benadryl to try to calm me down I guess which only made me extremely high as I physically could not fall asleep because of the pain I was in. I remember calling out for my mom in a daze as I sat high as a kite in the common room while everyone else slept. After being discharged from the facility and being on abilify for at least a month, it had completely deteriorated me as a person. I was a shell of my past self and felt like a zombie. I had a hard time concentrating on anything and couldn’t keep up a conversation. When I went to visit my guidance counselor (who was the worst guidance counselor in existence and told me I had screws loose in my head, but that’s a story for another time) at school she asked me if I was on drugs because apparently I had a dead pan stare. I was on the verge of exploding. Every day was a struggle for me and the only time I felt anything at all is when I was drunk with my friends. One specific day I went to the beach with friends and got very drunk. We were hanging out with a man who I’d never met before. He was in his 20s and provided the alcohol. At one point during the day he brought up the idea to get some cocaine. I was extremely drunk and thought this was a good idea. We got the coke and started doing bump after bump. Me and my girl friend then decided we wanted to run away and start a new life in Miami. The older guy agreed to drive us down there. We drove for hours down to Miami drunk and high off our asses and he dropped us off on a corner. My friend said she had a friend down there that could give us a place to stay but when she tried to call him on a pay phone he wouldn’t answer. So two 15 year old girls were stuck in downtown Miami with only bathing suits and cover ups on. We walked miles to Miami Beach and sat outside a restaurant where we met two Argentinian men that sat down with us and talked. Another man joined us and the Argentinian men offered for us to go back to their place to drink and hang out. We said yes. The man who had joined later said he would give all of us a lift there. Right as we were getting dropped off the two Argentinian men were talking in Spanish and the man who drove told them to get the fuck out of the car and that we weren’t going with them. Apparently the two men were planning on getting us really drunk and having sex with us not knowing the other man knew Spanish. For the sake of not making this any more confusing than it already is I’m going to call the man who drove, Tony. Tony took us to his place and let us stay there that night. He probably saved us from being raped or worse that night but unfortunately he wasn’t a saint either. He tried to sleep in the same bed as us and with each passing second I felt more and more uncomfortable. The drunk and high was long worn off by this point and I was regretting every decision we made. I wanted to go home but I didn’t know how. The next day Tony dropped us off back at Miami Beach. We asked him if he could spare some cash for us and he said he would for a kiss. We decided against that and were left at the beach with no money and no idea what we were going to do next. We spent the day at the beach trying not to think about nightfall but as it was growing closer I knew we couldn’t stay here. We went into the lobby of a hotel and I connected to the WiFi on a iPod I had brought with me. I called my mom on some app I had downloaded and to my surprise she was already on her way down to Miami to try to find me. She had called the cops and talked to my friends and figured out where we had gone. My mom picked us up drove us hours back home and immediately to the psych ward where I stayed for a week and from there was sent to a long term behavioral rehabilitation facility. To be very clear, I am not condoning anything that I did. I know how wrong it was. I know I fucked up real bad and there are no excuses. The thing is now looking back I can understand how it had gotten to that point. I wish I could change a lot of things I did in the past. I wish I never got involved with that group of friends. I wish I never got drunk that fateful night on the beach. I wish I never tried to kill myself. I wish I didn’t try to run away so many times. I wish I never did coke and go to Miami. But I was in an environment that left me completely vulnerable to the actions of people around me. As a child I could never escape the cycle of addiction and abuse from my father. I was trapped in a crumbling household that acted like it wasn’t crumbling! That we were perfectly fine. I was the malfunctioning piece to my family and I think instead of finding the root of the problem and fixing it my parents tried to fix the thing that from the outside looking in was broken. But if you looked just past that outside layer, all our wires were frayed. Our family was broken. Our whole family was malfunctioning. I was just the scape goat. And so I spent 2 months in this rehab facility. From the outside, mental health facilities look like a perfect place to send misbehaving children. The website says they have pet therapy! And arts and crafts! The first day in I knew this new environment was going to be hell. We had very strict rules. Single file lines, waking up at 7am and to bed by 8pm. Immediately after waking up we had to sit in the common room completely silent while they handed out medication. This took literal hours for everyone to get their drugs and if you talked or got up when you weren’t supposed to you would get something called “hours”. Hours were a punishment given where you had to sit in a chair for a MINIMUM of 4 hours. You couldn’t speak, you couldn’t sleep. You literally had to sit there for hours doing nothing and many of the times they made you face the chair towards the wall. If you fell asleep the hours wouldn’t count and you’d have to redo them. Hours were a minimum of 4 and depending on the severity of your crime it would go up by 4. So you could get 4 hours, 8, 12, and so on. If you spoke or got up during the time they gave you medication you would get 4 hours. I met with my psychiatrist once a week for a few minutes. I didn’t even know his name. My therapist there was the worst therapist I’ve ever had. He was unsympathetic and didn’t listen to me. He would drag on and on and hardly let me speak. He told me I needed to accept the blame for causing my family so much pain. I already felt so ashamed. I cried nearly every day. The kids in there were very abrasive. If you were violent you’d be transferred to basically the “bad” girls ward where you were placed with other violent girls. I remember one time this girl was mad because this other girl was talking bad about her. The day before the other girl was going to be discharged she took all her belongings out of her dresser (she was her roommate so she was allowed in their room) and pissed all over her stuff. Yes, she urinated on her belongings. When the other girl found out she flipped shit and they got in a physical fight and the whole unit was on lock down meaning we weren’t allowed to leave the common room and go to the gym or cafeteria for days afterward. The girl was transferred to the violent girls ward. This kind of thing happened a lot while I was there. Somehow kids snuck in drugs. People would get away with having sex under the technicians noses. There was a place called the quiet room where if you were acting up they would lock you in there. It was all white with padded walls. I remember kids getting put in there and hearing their screams go on for hours. This wasn’t a healthy place to be is what I’m trying to get across. Also there was no pet therapy like the website said. I felt so hopeless. So alone. I was on the most medication than I ever had been on before. When I finally got out I cannot tell you how depressed I was. I didn’t know how to function anymore. I didn’t have any friends as I completely stopped talking to all my friends from before. I stopped going to school so all I really did was stay home every day doing absolutely nothing. I didn’t go out in public and I didn’t talk to anyone. Finally a few months later I went back to school. At this point I was a sophomore in high school and I was doing really really poorly. I met a group of friends that again weren’t the best influence but I didn’t run away anymore due to fear of being put back in the facility again. I met an older guy through this group of friends. He was 19, drove a car, didn’t have a job but that didn’t matter to me. I thought he was so cool and he liked me which made me feel even more special. We started dating and my parents did not approve of it at all. But what can you do as a parent? They tried getting the cops involved but they couldn’t do anything because of some vague law that allows for that sort of thing. I didn’t realize it then but this man was taking advantage of my vulnerability and age once again. It was a very toxic relationship and extremely emotionally abusive. He strung me along as he cheated on me multiple times. He’d ignore me and manipulate the situation so I would be begging him to forgive me. I felt like I was falling apart but I couldn’t let go of him. I looked to him for validation and if he didn’t give me it then I was nothing. I tried to get out after he cheated once again. But he would text me everyday and tell me how sorry he was how much he loved me and needed me. So I took him back. He ended up getting involved with a girl a year younger than me. He helped her move across country while we were dating and I learned later on that he took her virginity on this trip. I was devastated. It felt like my whole world was falling apart. And so I finally cut him off completely after 6 months of manipulation and abuse. It was so painful at the time. I remember crying every night for weeks. The thing is when you’re in an abusive relationship you feel like you can’t ever get out. You feel like you need them but after a few months I realized just how horrible my life was with him in it. And now looking back I am disgusted with myself for ever getting involved with him. He preyed on my age. He took advantage of me being so much younger than him and so influential at the time. It’s just another thing on my list of things I regret. Junior year was a good year for me. I got out of that relationship and really started focusing on myself. I had been on and off medication during this whole time and I was completely off at the start of junior year. I felt clearer than I ever had before. Not to say medication is a bad thing I know it has helped many people but I was put on so many drugs and they had so many horrible side effects. Abilify made me a zombie and made me gain at least 20 pounds within a few months. I took another that gave me nose bleeds daily and made my vision blurry. Overall my medicine experience has not been a good one and I’ve never seen a positive effect from being on them. So when I went into my junior year I focused solely on school. I went to all my classes and did really well. I got straight As that year and my GPA went up a pretty good amount because of it. I took my SAT and got a decent score and I started thinking about college. I really just made a complete 180 during this time and I’m so glad I did. The problem is my depression and anxiety never truly went away. I’m not really sure what’s wrong with me. They told me I was bipolar then later said I had borderline personality disorder. I know you can’t fully diagnose someone with those things during this age so it wasn’t a for sure thing. I don’t know if I really need a label I guess. I fall into deep depressive episodes a lot and I struggle with anxiety and especially social anxiety every day of my life. I don’t have any self confidence and I question everything I do. I struggle to make friends and I don’t trust people easily. I know I have a problem with basing my self worth on what other people think of me and especially men. I get involved with someone and I get so excited and think I’ll finally find someone that’s going to treat me right and they end up being an asshole or completely ghosting me. I stopped cutting myself junior year too but it is still something I still struggle with to this day. When you spent so many years relying on that to help cope it’s hard to not fall back into that self destructive behavior. And even now I sometimes wish I could just go off the deep end like I did when I was younger. A lot of times I feel like I’m just standing on the edge peering down at the abyss. I wanna just jump off head first. But now I wouldn’t even know how to. My feet won’t move. So I’m stuck in this in between place of not totally off the edge but so close I feel it’s presence weighing me down all the time. I really couldn’t tell you a time I felt totally free. Maybe when I was younger and didn’t understand anything. When I didn’t know how awful humans could be to one another. I remember when I was really young at least 5 years old. I was sleeping in my moms bed. My dad had come home probably from a long night of drinking and drugs and I wanted to go out to the kitchen to get a snack. I snuck out of my moms room and out into the hallway. Everything was dark except the luminescent light of the bathroom breaking the darkness. I walked down the hallway and slipped in front of the bathroom doorway. My dad was standing there doing something over the sink. There was a knife and thick blood dripping from his arm. Only later did I realize I had witnessed my dad cutting himself. My memory gets fuzzy sometimes of that event and I see blood covering the walls like a sick horror movie in my dreams. I know it’s not real but when I think of it it makes me shudder. I am now 20 years old. I have spent 2 years in college jumping around to different majors not really knowing what I want to do. I’m transferring to a new university this fall hoping that will make my college experience better but to be quite honest with you I don’t feel like I belong anywhere. I feel disconnected from the rest of society. Like everyone else is in on the joke and I just never got it. Back to the point before I got way too deep about my life, my brother and I just don’t have a good relationship. I have always wanted to be his friend and I feel like he just shuts me out or doesn’t even like me. Whenever we get into an argument he always has to bring up the fact that I was on medication. He says that I’m fucking crazy and that I need to go back on meds. It makes me feel like no matter what I do I will never escape my past. I will always just be that crazy teenage girl. He told me once that I embarrassed him in high school. My brother is only one grade above me so he was aware of everything when it happened. When I hear him say that it makes me feel even more ashamed of myself. Like all I am is just an embarrassment to him. He never tries to talk to me about anything from our past or anything I went through. He’s a very angry person and isn’t very self aware. I know our childhood trauma has affected him in ways that he will never realize. He was in a relationship with a girl for almost 2 years in which he was verbally and emotionally abusive to her. He decided to break it off but later regretted that decision and begged for her back. When she said no he took to social media to bash her and victimize himself. His explosive anger and total lack of self awareness in certain situations just goes to show the impact our childhood has had on him. I love my brother and I always have. I think that’s my weakness too. I care too much about what he thinks of me and the things he says to me. He’s very condescending and loves to tell me that I’m a disappointment. He says “I know you can act smarter than you do and it’s disappointing that you act that way anyways” over pretty simple mistakes I make. It’s like he expects the people around him to be perfect and when they aren’t he sees them as inferior. I want to have a good relationship with my brother but I have tried for years and to no avail. I think we will never see eye to eye and that to me is so upsetting because there is no one else in the world that has experienced exactly what I have except him. Through out our childhood we both experienced our father leaving and returning, going on drug binge after drug binge, the explosive fights between our parents, the house going into foreclosure. We experienced it all together and yet completely separate. And now we’re here years later and we couldn’t be anymore distant. It’s sad and I don’t think I will ever find a single person who truly understands me. 

Sorry for the very long post. Honestly I could write a book with all my experiences. I just want to be very clear about one thing I am not looking for sympathy or pity. I think sometimes it’s good to get all of this out and I contemplated a lot on whether or not to even post this. If anyone has gone through similar experiences feel free to reach out. This world can be so hard sometimes and so lonely. I hope we can all find our way and maybe there is a reason for all this suffering.

If you have made it this far, again thank you for listening and I hope you have a great night/day. I know everyone on this subreddit is struggling with their own unique adversities and I truly hope everything works out in the best way it can for all of us❤️",05Jun2020,1
31,"I have never actually posted anything on reddit and I am pretty anxious about doing so. I originally wrote this with the intention of solely writing about me and my brother’s relationship, but somehow it turned into this really long story about my life. So, if anyone takes the time to read this thank you for listening. There might be some triggering topics in this post so be wary of that if topics of rape/self harm/suicide/drug addiction are triggering to you. 

My brother and I have never had a good relationship. Growing up in a dysfunctional family and with a father that struggled with drug addiction throughout our childhood, one would think that would draw us closer together and allow us to lean on each other for support having dealt with the same traumas. However that is not even close to how the dynamic of our relationship works. My brother growing up kept to himself. He didn’t want to talk about anything going on and understandably so. I know people handle traumas in different ways. But as the younger sister I always looked up to my brother for support, but I never got that. He didn’t want anything to do with me. When I would turn to him for comfort he would get so angry, scream at me to leave him alone. I remember years later after we both were in college and our dad had been sober for several years I confessed to him how much our dad’s addiction had affected me and continues to affect me to this day. I cried to him and he was completely stoic and only said “stop acting so privileged. Many people have it much worse”. Growing up in a household that turned a blind eye to the addiction and abuse we all endured and especially with a brother who claims it has had no effect on him at all made me feel extremely alone. I had no one to turn to. When I got older, in my early teenage years, I hit a very rough patch. My dad had again relapsed and left our family for weeks draining the bank accounts to use for drugs. One day my mom and I drove around our town trying to find him and when we finally did he was in his car with this extremely pale, gaunt woman. It was clear years of drug abuse had taken a toll on her body. My mom followed his car and got out at a stop light to try to talk to him. When she grabbed the door handle, my dad drove off causing my mom to fall hard on the concrete. She quickly got back in the car and continued to follow him and he led us to a crack house on the sketchy side of town. At that point I was hysterically crying. I felt so betrayed and honestly in shock of how my dad was treating his own family. I felt unwanted by my own dad. I begged him to come home and he lied straight to my face saying he’d come back that night. He didn’t come home for weeks. When he finally did it was because he owed some drug dealer money and they had shot at him while he was driving. After this whole ordeal my dad went to a baker-act facility and then stayed at a halfway house for about a month. My mom claimed throughout this time that she would finally divorce my dad so we’d never have to go through this again. But to my surprise he moved back in not even a month later. It seemed like my mom did a complete 180 and now that my dad was home we were expected to treat him like nothing had happened. My dad constantly would demand respect from me. I was so angry at this time. I hated living there and I hated having to see my dad every day. I felt betrayed by my dad, by my mom, and by my brother who completely shut me out. During this time is when I really started to act out. I was 14 years old when I met a group of not so good friends. I started smoking weed, drinking, smoking cigarettes, and becoming sexually active. I would stay out way past curfew and honestly just defied my parents in every sort of way. At the time I didn’t realize why I was acting that way. I don’t think you ever really do when you’re going through it. Only in retrospect do I realize how much my father’s addiction had affected me. I would cut myself every night and I still have scars to this day from years of self mutilation. I hated myself very much and still struggle with self hate even now. On the night I tried vodka for the first time ever, I got black out drunk. At the time I thought I was with reliable friends. But later that night, I came to completely naked on the beach with random people trying to dress me. They took me home and the next day when I checked my Instagram, pictures of me naked on the beach were all over my timeline. A hate account was made about me that posted the picture with a caption that said how much of a disgusting slut I was. A bunch of kids from my high school commented on it agreeing, calling me a whore and a slut. Come to find out later that the guy friend I was with that night took advantage of my state, raped me on the beach, and left me there for random people to find me. And the people who took the photo and posted it were my friends that just so happened to come across me on the beach that night. After this I fell into the darkest depression I had ever experienced before. I cut myself twice as much and would walk home directly after being dropped off at school. I knew everyone was talking about what happened and could hear the whispers of slut being passed around as I walked by. Even this wasn’t the end all for me. The reason I tried to take my life that night was ultimately because of what my dad said to me.

I took two whole bottles of melatonin, a bottle of ibuprofen, and I tried to drink bleach but couldn’t make myself drink more than a sip. I laid down in my bed so tired, so exhausted and fell asleep.

I felt like I was dying. My parents rushed me to the hospital where I was stabilized. From there a cop hand cuffed me, put me in the back of the patrol car, and transferred me to the same baker act facility my dad had been to so many times before.

And I was still just as broken as ever before. I was expected to change though and when I didn’t well... all hell broke loose. Unfortunately, my suicide attempt open my parents to the door of mental health rehabilitation. They put me in and out of psych wards for the next several months, each time a new mental disorder was assigned to me. The third time I was put in they diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and put me on probably the worse medicine I have ever been on: abilify. The doctor gave me way too high of a dose to start off on. Keep in mind I am a 90 pound 15 year old at this time being given a high dosage of an anti-psychotic drug. A day after starting the drug I got extremely ill. I had a splitting migraine that lasted for days and was throwing up every half hour or so.

My therapist there was the worst therapist I’ve ever had. He was unsympathetic and didn’t listen to me. He would drag on and on and hardly let me speak. He told me I needed to accept the blame for causing my family so much pain. I already felt so ashamed. I cried nearly every day. The kids in there were very abrasive. If you were violent you’d be transferred to basically the “bad” girls ward where you were placed with other violent girls. I remember one time this girl was mad because this other girl was talking bad about her. The day before the other girl was going to be discharged she took all her belongings out of her dresser (she was her roommate so she was allowed in their room) and pissed all over her stuff. Yes, she urinated on her belongings. When the other girl found out she flipped shit and they got in a physical fight and the whole unit was on lock down meaning we weren’t allowed to leave the common room and go to the gym or cafeteria for days afterward. The girl was transferred to the violent girls ward. This kind of thing happened a lot while I was there. Somehow kids snuck in drugs. People would get away with having sex under the technicians noses. There was a place called the quiet room where if you were acting up they would lock you in there. It was all white with padded walls. I remember kids getting put in there and hearing their screams go on for hours. This wasn’t a healthy place to be is what I’m trying to get across. Also there was no pet therapy like the website said. I felt so hopeless. So alone. I was on the most medication than I ever had been on before. When I finally got out I cannot tell you how depressed I was. I didn’t know how to function anymore. I didn’t have any friends as I completely stopped talking to all my friends from before. I stopped going to school so all I really did was stay home every day doing absolutely nothing. I didn’t go out in public and I didn’t talk to anyone. Finally a few months later I went back to school. At this point I was a sophomore in high school and I was doing really really poorly. I met a group of friends that again weren’t the best influence but I didn’t run away anymore due to fear of being put back in the facility again. I met an older guy through this group of friends. He was 19, drove a car, didn’t have a job but that didn’t matter to me. I thought he was so cool and he liked me which made me feel even more special. We started dating and my parents did not approve of it at all. But what can you do as a parent? They tried getting the cops involved but they couldn’t do anything because of some vague law that allows for that sort of thing. I didn’t realize it then but this man was taking advantage of my vulnerability and age once again. It was a very toxic relationship and extremely emotionally abusive. He strung me along as he cheated on me multiple times. He’d ignore me and manipulate the situation so I would be begging him to forgive me. I felt like I was falling apart but I couldn’t let go of him. I looked to him for validation and if he didn’t give me it then I was nothing. I tried to get out after he cheated once again. But he would text me everyday and tell me how sorry he was how much he loved me and needed me. So I took him back. He ended up getting involved with a girl a year younger than me. He helped her move across country while we were dating and I learned later on that he took her virginity on this trip. I was devastated. It felt like my whole world was falling apart. And so I finally cut him off completely after 6 months of manipulation and abuse. It was so painful at the time. I remember crying every night for weeks. The thing is when you’re in an abusive relationship you feel like you can’t ever get out. You feel like you need them but after a few months I realized just how horrible my life was with him in it. And now looking back I am disgusted with myself for ever getting involved with him. He preyed on my age. He took advantage of me being so much younger than him and so influential at the time. It’s just another thing on my list of things I regret. Junior year was a good year for me. I got out of that relationship and really started focusing on myself. I had been on and off medication during this whole time and I was completely off at the start of junior year. I felt clearer than I ever had before. Not to say medication is a bad thing I know it has helped many people but I was put on so many drugs and they had so many horrible side effects. Abilify made me a zombie and made me gain at least 20 pounds within a few months. I took another that gave me nose bleeds daily and made my vision blurry. Overall my medicine experience has not been a good one and I’ve never seen a positive effect from being on them. So when I went into my junior year I focused solely on school. I went to all my classes and did really well. I got straight As that year and my GPA went up a pretty good amount because of it. I took my SAT and got a decent score and I started thinking about college. I really just made a complete 180 during this time and I’m so glad I did. The problem is my depression and anxiety never truly went away. I’m not really sure what’s wrong with me. They told me I was bipolar then later said I had borderline personality disorder. I know you can’t fully diagnose someone with those things during this age so it wasn’t a for sure thing. I don’t know if I really need a label I guess. I fall into deep depressive episodes a lot and I struggle with anxiety and especially social anxiety every day of my life. I don’t have any self confidence and I question everything I do. I struggle to make friends and I don’t trust people easily. I know I have a problem with basing my self worth on what other people think of me and especially men. I get involved with someone and I get so excited and think I’ll finally find someone that’s going to treat me right and they end up being an asshole or completely ghosting me. I stopped cutting myself junior year too but it is still something I still struggle with to this day. When you spent so many years relying on that to help cope it’s hard to not fall back into that self destructive behavior. And even now I sometimes wish I could just go off the deep end like I did when I was younger. A lot of times I feel like I’m just standing on the edge peering down at the abyss. I wanna just jump off head first. But now I wouldn’t even know how to. My feet won’t move. So I’m stuck in this in between place of not totally off the edge but so close I feel it’s presence weighing me down all the time. I really couldn’t tell you a time I felt totally free. Maybe when I was younger and didn’t understand anything. When I didn’t know how awful humans could be to one another. I remember when I was really young at least 5 years old. I was sleeping in my moms bed. My dad had come home probably from a long night of drinking and drugs and I wanted to go out to the kitchen to get a snack. I snuck out of my moms room and out into the hallway. Everything was dark except the luminescent light of the bathroom breaking the darkness. I walked down the hallway and slipped in front of the bathroom doorway. My dad was standing there doing something over the sink. There was a knife and thick blood dripping from his arm. Only later did I realize I had witnessed my dad cutting himself. My memory gets fuzzy sometimes of that event and I see blood covering the walls like a sick horror movie in my dreams. I know it’s not real but when I think of it it makes me shudder. I am now 20 years old. I have spent 2 years in college jumping around to different majors not really knowing what I want to do. I’m transferring to a new university this fall hoping that will make my college experience better but to be quite honest with you I don’t feel like I belong anywhere. I feel disconnected from the rest of society. Like everyone else is in on the joke and I just never got it. Back to the point before I got way too deep about my life, my brother and I just don’t have a good relationship. I have always wanted to be his friend and I feel like he just shuts me out or doesn’t even like me. Whenever we get into an argument he always has to bring up the fact that I was on medication. He says that I’m fucking crazy and that I need to go back on meds. It makes me feel like no matter what I do I will never escape my past. I will always just be that crazy teenage girl. He told me once that I embarrassed him in high school. My brother is only one grade above me so he was aware of everything when it happened. When I hear him say that it makes me feel even more ashamed of myself. Like all I am is just an embarrassment to him. He never tries to talk to me about anything from our past or anything I went through. He’s a very angry person and isn’t very self aware. I know our childhood trauma has affected him in ways that he will never realize. He was in a relationship with a girl for almost 2 years in which he was verbally and emotionally abusive to her. He decided to break it off but later regretted that decision and begged for her back. When she said no he took to social media to bash her and victimize himself. His explosive anger and total lack of self awareness in certain situations just goes to show the impact our childhood has had on him. I love my brother and I always have. I think that’s my weakness too. I care too much about what he thinks of me and the things he says to me. He’s very condescending and loves to tell me that I’m a disappointment. He says “I know you can act smarter than you do and it’s disappointing that you act that way anyways” over pretty simple mistakes I make. It’s like he expects the people around him to be perfect and when they aren’t he sees them as inferior. I want to have a good relationship with my brother but I have tried for years and to no avail. I think we will never see eye to eye and that to me is so upsetting because there is no one else in the world that has experienced exactly what I have except him. Through out our childhood we both experienced our father leaving and returning, going on drug binge after drug binge, the explosive fights between our parents, the house going into foreclosure. We experienced it all together and yet completely separate. And now we’re here years later and we couldn’t be anymore distant. It’s sad and I don’t think I will ever find a single person who truly understands me. 

Sorry for the very long post. Honestly I could write a book with all my experiences. I just want to be very clear about one thing I am not looking for sympathy or pity. I think sometimes it’s good to get all of this out and I contemplated a lot on whether or not to even post this. If anyone has gone through similar experiences feel free to reach out. This world can be so hard sometimes and so lonely. I hope we can all find our way and maybe there is a reason for all this suffering.

If you have made it this far, again thank you for listening and I hope you have a great night/day. I know everyone on this subreddit is struggling with their own unique adversities and I truly hope everything works out in the best way it can for all of us❤️",05Jun2020,1

Hiya! My name's CJ. I'm 21 years old. I'm an aspiring writer and have a huge interest in mental and behavioral health. I've been working on an informational book (AFAIK to be called ""Skies of Grey: Mind's Eyes"" ) that more or less encapsulates dozens of known and some unknown mental health/behavioral or otherwise relevant disorders and disabilities that affect how the mind perceives certain situations.

**But CJ, how can I help?** I need people who are willing to have interviews about disorders/conditions that they may be experiencing. It's a simple 10-question informal text interview. The purpose of the interview is to provide a first-person perspective on whatever topic the consumer/reader may be looking at. As I'll only be taking select quotes from the interview it's left anonymous, so elect anyone you want for it. Just shoot me a message/DM if you're interested! 

Topics available for interview are here (Recently updated with bonus/optional topics ): [https://pastebin.com/hc3UsS6y](https://pastebin.com/hc3UsS6y) Bipolar, Depression, and DID interviews are not available, I've gotten multiple for each already. I need one more interview for any form of ASD or PTSD (after some complications with other interviewers).   
Anything else is on the table!

35,"I’m 27. Diagnosed Bipolar Type 1 with PTSD and anxiety.

I take: Lamictal (mood stabilizer) Abilify (anti psychotic) Adderall (stimulant) Fluvoxamine (antidepressant) and recently prescribed Prazosin (lower blood pressure) for my sleep disorder. Psychiatrist told me it prevents REM sleep which is helpful with PTSD patients that experience nightmares.


Here’s my thing: All I can find online about it being used to treat my sleep disorder, are very small trials that yielded different results. And even then, there weren’t many.
I tried it last night. I didn’t have nightmares but I still woke up constantly. Possibly more than usual. I’m going to give it another go tonight.


The recommended treatment for my sleep disorder is melatonin and a low dosage of Klonopin. I was prescribed this for anxiety but after I worked through it and no longer needed the medication, I was prescribed Adderall to help motivate me and keep me awake.


Psychiatrist won’t prescribe both because “You can’t have an upper with a downer” but I need the Adderall because I’m so exhausted all the time and I feel like without the klanopin, I won’t ever be able to feel rested. I also assume if I could finally get some rest, I won’t need Adderall anymore. Regular doctor refuses to give any recommendations because I’m on so many psych meds.


Sorry for the ramble. If anyone has experience with REM behavioral disorder treatment or just any advice in general, it’d be greatly appreciated. I’m exhausted.",05Jun2020,1

39,"You sometimes feel like it's impossible to speak about past trauma, even with a mental health expert? For some reason I'm only able to speak about things that seem ""less severe"" to me, hoping I'll be able to talk about the bigger things later, but the day never comes. I've had different therapists over the past few years and one of them was really nice and helpful, but I still couldn't.

 It's like even when I'm scratching on the surface I'll get very realistic dreams, I'm scared to fall asleep because I either relive those events or dream about stuff that gives me the exact same feeling of helplessness. - it throws me back into the state I was 5 years ago at my absolute worst, every single time - it's like I want to tell someone so he can work with me but I also really DON'T want to tell anyone, I need to keep it to myself even if it means I'll break. I'm physically unable to talk about it. I'm kinda okay now, even though I feel my mental health is getting worse again, but at my worst I got triggered by so many things, certain loud noises, some burnt smells, a specific perfume even fire crackers like I'm a fucking dog. Really random things that are around in real life every now and then. 

I guess I'm really bad at reliving the helpless feeling in a potentially life threatening situation, even though I KNOW I'll be physically fine. It's like I lack the energy and balls to talk about it and work on it but I also feel like I can't keep going anymore. I basically stand by myself when things get really bad and I'm just a major inconvenience for everyone around me when I have to go to a clinic, I wish I could do it and also be mentally okay so I can keep fully functioning. :(

Sometimes I feel like I'm also scared of getting ridiculed when I tell someone. Like I assume people won't believe me or something, and it makes me vulnerable. And there is always this underlying feeling of knowing how fucked up some things really are, it's almost surreal and makes me scared of being weak. 

How can I get myself to do it and just talk about the hard hitting stuff that stuck with me?",05Jun2020,1

42,I think this has been happening for a long time now however recently this problem has been getting worse. I'll be with people and they'll be talking and I'm actively listening but sometimes I just cant respond to them and I'm never able to think of things to start a conversation you know. My mind is just empty I literally am thinking of nothing if that makes any sense. Unless I am specifically addressed I will almost never say anything. I can do the same thing on purpose when I stare at something for a long ass time and my mind is completely void of any thoughts like some sort of auto pilot. I don't know if it's a mental problem or just a skill I need to develop. Listening to people talk it seems like a lot of the time they are just spitting out whatever they are thinking at that current moment and conversations just keep going from there and I wish I could do that too.

43,So about a couple weeks ago I used to stay up all night and sleep all day. I went to bed at about 9 am each morning and slept until about usually 8 pm. I had just turned my phone off and was going to lay down one morning and I suddenly hallucinated music and a bird chirping sound. I automatically panicked and genuinely believed I developed schizophrenia. I’ve read online where people would hallucinate when sleep deprived. Nights prior to when it happened my body wanted to sleep but I stayed up anyway. My family has said that I’m a hypochondriac before but I just don’t know. My mind is making me think I’m hallucinating and making me hear things. I’ve also read that people with schizophrenia aren’t aware that they’re ill. Is it all anxiety in my head or am I really schizophrenic? Part of me knows there’s nothing wrong but I feel like I developed psychosis.,05Jun2020,1

I get what I thought of as phases of not being harassed by depression, I'd be pretty much opposite of depressed, but it was suggested to me that it might be bipolar, I really hope not, I hate self diagnoses I know they're shit and often very inaccurate, but the things I've read are relatable, not just horoscope level relatable but the stuff from people's detailed experiences and actions during their phases, from random bursts of aggression, creative plans and ideas I couldn't have dreamt of, a bunch of motivation for anything from cycling and working out to woodworking and trying to make something that I rarely actually finish and after one or two sessions I never get back to it, I also do stupid and reckless shit nothing that would be too bad for others but could be deadly to me. 

I've gone a bit off track, I want to join the armed forces but I also want to get help with my depression and get tested for bipolar, it's not that I'm in danger of committing suicide, I have decided that I'm not going down that path, but I do want help dealing with the depression, I want to be able to suppress it, here's the problem, I can't get both, I can either take military path and pretty much keep my mental health issues to myself which sounds stupid in itself, or I can go get professional help which does mean kissing the military goodbye, I know on paper the choice is obvious, go get help, but I'm struggling to make the choice, I just really don't know what to do here, I can't really do either till after lockdown is eased so I guess I've still got time to think it over.",05Jun2020,1

it sucks so much when you have to lie to the doctor about your mental health. I’m almost 17 and I live with my parents. My mom lies about her family history of mental health to professionals when in questions and I don’t know if it’s genetics and/or the environment I grew up in that makes things harder for me. I can’t seek help because it would make things so much worse for me in my external life.

51,"I was diagnosed as bipolar II after one ten minute appointment directly after a suicide attempt. I was immediately put on lithium and have been on it for around 8 years. Now after my mental health has actually never been better, both my therapist and psychiatrist mentioned that I should consider that have been misdiagnosed, because in their eyes I did not seem bipolar. Instead they felt I had an anxiety disorder, PTSD, and ADHD. I had suspected as well, but I didn't know that my experience with the doctor who gave me that label wasn't the norm and it often takes several appointments, longer than ten minutes for sure.

So my psych has decided to wean me off lithium, as we suspected I have not experienced any sort of mood swings (not that I ever really had them in a cyclical fashion anyway). But it has only been a week or so.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? I can only find resources for people who ARE bipolar coming off of lithium. What can I expect from the process? I already feel I can think a little clearer, but I really have no idea what to expect after being on it for so long.",05Jun2020,1

Note: Field Day was before the COVID-19 pandemic, so stay safe out there!

But there was one person I hated the most, his name I'll call him Rob. (Name changed due to privacy)

At recess, I would play soccer and I think my legs were pretty strong but not as much as him. 

One simple mistake, and wouldn't you know, he would lash out on me like a 7th grade English teacher.

And he would always say to me if I accidentally passed to an opponent, he would say ""You should of passed to me."" While having 4 men covering him, good job Rob. And he had his buddy, I'd call him, Jim, he wasn't as much as a arrogant douchebag as Rob, I actually used to be best friends with Rob.

 But this is where this gets interesting.

A couple of months ago, I was told I was getting a packet due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But I had to wait 3 weeks just to get a packet, 3 F***ING WEEKS! And I was damn stressed out of the packet, since it had like I don't know, 30 F***ING PAGES, and guess the time I was supposed to complete it by, 1 F***ING WEEK! So I had to complete a average of 6 pages per day. Mine that that's more than we do in a day at regular school. I am pretty fed up of this, but didn't tell my parents since they laughed at me before when I told him that I might be messed up.

I listened to music, especially rock music. But I felt like that there was a comparison between Me and a album that is unknown when people talking to new music and all that things I'm not into. Enter Pink Floyd's The Wall, a album I consider to be the greatest of all time.

This album is a 26 song masterpiece double album about a man that struggles through his dad dying in WWII and his overprotective mother, and School. Doesn't stop there when he has to deal with his girlfriend cheating on him while he is a well known rockstar.
10/10 would recommend but it has some really feel songs like Don't Leave Me Now.

The School part with that album, really hits me.

Fast forward to a week ago, I wasn't doing any school work since I have been burnt out of everything, I have been isolating myself against my family since I have just been burnt out of everything except YouTube, Anime, Roblox, and Bloons TD Battles. My parents don't think I have some sort of mental issues, School is just been a living hell to me and sucking my life out, my brother just annoys the hell out of me, my friends at this point just think my mental issues are fake just like they told me about me getting hurt, and I don't think I would want to live in a place where everything and everyone treats me like shit.

55,"So, I’ve (23, F) kind of got years of baggage to unpack, but right now I’m so scared. 

I feel like crap. I’m pissing away my college education. I want to graduate, I really do. I want to do well. I keep failing classes. I don’t set out to, and I start with every intention to do better. But my mom is abusive. She sucks me into her misery. She’s an alcoholic. I’m tired of letting myself get pulled into the cycle all over again. 

But really, there’s no excuse. This is my responsibility and I’m fucking up. I’m scared to talk to my administrators or instructors because I know it’s my fault. I know I don’t deserve sympathy. I need to be stronger than my mother. Than the trauma from my abusive ex. 

Honestly, I’d be better off dead. I’m going nowhere. I want to stop trying.",05Jun2020,1

57,"I am not okay. 

Honestly, it's taken me a lot of time and self-reflection to accept this. For a long time, I've done everything to convince myself that I *was* okay. I tried telling myself I was. I tried ignoring the problems. I tried running from them. I convinced myself the constant exhaustion, the irritability, the lack of self-confidence and abundance of self-doubt, the ever present fear and trepidation were all normal. That they were just part of living life. 

And occasionally, it worked. For a while at least. But the issues always came back. And each time they were worse. They hit harder, and put me on my ass for longer. And it cost me more and more each time. It's cost me two jobs I loved. It cost me any confidence I've ever had in a better future for myself. And every time, I told myself that I can just pick myself up, dust myself off, and keep moving. 

But I can't. No matter how hard I try, I can't just keep pushing myself. I can't keep doing what I've been doing. It doesn't work. It took me a long time to admit this to myself. It took me a long time to listen to everything that I've been telling myself, and everything that the people around me have been telling me, because I didn't want them to worry. I didn't want to put extra strain on them, especially because I know that many of them are going through some of the exact same things I am. I wanted to be there for everyone. But I finally realized that I can't be there for anyone if I can't be here for *me.*

So it's taken me a long time to finally say this: I am not okay. And that's okay. Because someday, maybe someday soon, but more likely quite some time from now, I will be.",05Jun2020,1
58,"Hi guys, my mom just got prescribed 10mg of olanzapine and it’s her first night taking it. She hasn’t slept for more than 2 hours in the past week.

59,"I think I rewrote this about a million times. And each time I feel I cannot get the words out that I want to say. But it feels good to rewrite because then I am no longer thinking of ending my life or the pain that has brought me to it. I feel like I’m caught in a limbo. I have been for years now. And everyday that passes, the next bout of sadness that comes makes me more desperate than the last. 

Some context to where I am coming from. I have a sick (has epilepsy) younger brother I no longer am close to. My parents have always hit me and yelled at me a lot but only me, my brother was never hit even when he was not sick . My mother and I are basically estranged. My mother adores and loves my brother. My father scares me but can act like a goof and makes me forget why I fear him. I have been hit and yelled cruel words at. I wake up to the words almost every day and if not when I wake up then it will be definitely during the day. Its become so that I wake up with cold sweat and a racing heart. I don’t get yelled at once or twice, it’s constant. I sometimes think if I cannot kill myself then maybe I should go deaf. I will not have to hear such words and I can pretend all is well. It was almost  nine years ago when I had decided that living was not worth the pain. The night I decided it I had planned everything out and decided that the next day I would ride out and do it. Ofc that did not happen since I am here now. and that is all because I dreamt that night that I had been loved and Ever since I have held on to that dream, that one day I will be loved, that this will all work out, that I will no longer feel like this and that I can live because life will get better. 

And so here I am years later and still stuck. I may not cry myself to sleep everyday as I used to but when I do I am desperate to fall asleep to dream the same dream that made me keep living and unfortunately dreams don’t work like that and I don’t always dream the reason to stay alive. And what has prompted me to post this today is that I had been yelled at to start to study for next term in September. Yelled at in a way that I felt if I did not obey my likelihood to getting hit was very f***ing high. I’m a uni student and so I have a bit longer summer break than others. I see why I should study but this is the first summer where I am not in school and I wanted to take this summer to enjoy life, to once again remember or find reason to keep going on. Ofc I cannot go travel as I had planned but I thought being at “home” will not hinder that determination. But being 22 and still not having the courage to stand up for myself in fear of getting hit, hurts. I think of taking my life and ending it all but two things stop me. 1. It would mean I have given up on the idea that I will be happy one day (and this is a problem because I am stubborn and I don’t like to give up) 2. It would mean my parents will find out I did end my life and they will have to live with that and I cannot put them through that after what they went through with my brother. Even after all the hate, I love my parents and it’s a reason why I fear being in a relationship. If I love them as deep as my parents such that I cannot let go even when I know it is what is hurting me. I don’t think I could take being hurt from both my family and the man I love. 

And so here I am, wanting to die but can’t put myself through it. But with every passing argument, I end up not caring a bit more and I can just feel it, that I’m on the way to one day ending it all and maybe I can finally find some peace. 

I do not know where to go from here. I wish to live to find love and peace one day but I know if I continue on the way I am, I don’t think I will make it. And so my question to whoever is reading is, can u help me?",05Jun2020,1

62,"So I'm a 14 y/o currently studying in grade-10 or high school to some of you, and recently I have been overwhelmed by this thought of the purpose of my existence. I have been asking myself I wanna really live, right now I'm just existing. No I'm not depressed, I don't think there's anything pushing me to the edge of a cliff rather it's more like there's nothing to pull me back, there's nothing I wanna live for. I usually busy myself in what normal teens do these days: videogames, anime and internet. Not very long ago I realized that to  properly live and enjoy life I'm going to have to indulge myself in activities that I genuinely cant get enough of, something which I will be willing to do not because of it's result but because I wanna do it no matter what comes of it, I wanna take the hardship and struggle that I will enjoy and at the end of the day all the hardwork will be worth it regardless if I succeed or fail, only there's nothing I wanna do in life. I don't know the purpose of my existence. And I don't wanna be one of those people who study hard and get a good pay and get all the riches they want and in the end realize that life is more than money and a respectable position in society, so long story-short there's nothing I think I want to do in life. When I was in grade 6 my test result went from 80+ to range of 60 or lower and my family and teachers started acting like most parent and teacher would react and because of that I thought I was a nuisance to my family and ran away from home. I subconsciously was pressured from study and didn't even realize I was being study-pressured until my uncle told me that was the reason I ran away. I was about 10-11years of age at that time, so I don't wanna get a good degree. I respect skill and knowledge, I'm a guy who is interested in science but I don't pay much attention at class, I have told myself that whatever I am to become in the future wont be because of my academic grades or degrees but because of the time and effort I will have invested in an activity solely. I haven't found a purpose and I cant live depending on other people forever and I'm thinking if I will be better of dead, not like I'm doing anything existing anyway; neither for myself neither for others.",05Jun2020,1

65,"Hello everyone, I am 21F.

My long term partner (22M) has had depression for the last 4 years and a few weeks back, he fell into(? sorry if that is the wrong terminology) a depressive episode. It is the first one he has had while we are a couple and I am finding it hard to know what to do.

I am reading sites and books and trying to understand what is happening but my emotions get in the way. I get really tearful because it is so hard seeing the person I love become a shell of himself. But I feel like this thinking makes the situation worse and I want to find coping mechanisms so that I can support him better and also protect my own mental health.

I have looked for psychologists/therapists/counsellors for myself online but since there is so much going on in the world, it is difficult to get an appointment soon. But I want to start getting advice and coping mechanisms as soon as I can.

Does anyone have any advice or coping mechanisms or thought processes that I can use to better support him and also not be super upset myself?

66,"(Not asking for a diagnosis, just wondering it all in about to state below is just normal intrusive thoughts)

So anyway, hello. I'm 14 and from the USA. I'm making this post because recently I've wondered if my thoughts/actions were normal. 
I don't really remember the first time I've thought about hurting someone, but the earliest I can remember is of me wanting to kill my friends. I've always wanted to hurt them, but about 5 years (maybe) ago I had planned on killing them. I had gotten a knife from the kitchen and wrapped the handle with paper towels, so finger prints wouldn't be on it, and had sat on my couch thinking it over. Looking back on it the way I would have done it would have immediately gotten me caught. I think this has happened 2 times I think? 
Skip now a year later in May or so of 2016. I was going over to my cousins (which I hate and have always and do plan on hurting him some way one day) I was in some angsty mood or something and thought that ""this is the night I'm gonna kill him "" so I grabbed a butter knife before we left and put it in my pocket. I don't really remember much but I do remember holding him down and putting the knife against his neck. A few seconds later I removed the knife and tried to put it off and tried to make it seem like a joke after I decided against it. He's ran off and told but boy, I wish I could remember the look of fear on his face all the way, it's exciting. 
Now skip to this year and the previous, I'm not gonna go into much detail but one night of being verbally abused I had such, strong urges to hurt the person who was doing it. That happens ALOT. And I've recently (few months ago) called CPS on them so it does down.
I have thoughts of cutting off someone's limbs and making some way of keeping their mouth open, then stabbing them in the lungs and throw them into our lake so they struggle to breath, but can't do anything.
Also of forcing a big object down their throats or up the other end nd watch them writhe in pain. Don't wanna get too detailed
 
But I just wanted to know if this could possibly be homicidal ideation",05Jun2020,1
67,"My step dad was really abusive and being a girly girl teenager I hated sweating. My anxiety around sweating started when my step dad would yell at me about it.

Like in his mind you aren't working hard unless you're sweating? So he'd scream and threaten me about how he'd make me sweat (plus that I was useless etc)

In retrospect it's a weird thing to be hung up about on his part. But it's made me super anxious about being  sweaty, or doing a lot of physical activity that leads to sweating. Like when it happens I feel the same as I did when we would scream and yell at me.

But I'm overweight, and I want to be healthier. And I've started with ring fit adventure on switch (pretty good if you want to try).

69,"Several days ago my dad and I got into a physical altercation. My dad has been known to have a violent temper and responds to any of our criticisms with ""shut the fuck up"", ""be quiet"" or other means of intimidation because he is the ""father"" and we should know our place. Over the years, I've learned to suppress my emotions and sit quietly

We were having lunch as a family when we started having a conversation regarding the current events happening. At this point, my dad was at a disagreement with me and yelled ""be quiet. stop talking"". This time I told him ""I'm not going to be quiet anymore"". Everything escalated from there as he told me to leave. I was gathering my things to leave and as I walked towards the door, he got up to physically fight me. My mom got in between us as we ended up on the couch. After about 20 mins of yelling, he left the house.

That night my sister and mom talked to me and I had thought we had an understanding that we need to fix his behavior and that it was wrong. Unfortunately, I guess I was wrong. My mom's solution was to tell me to avoid him ""for now"" thinking that she would talk to him first. That hasn't happened. My sister contacted a priest who told me "" to think of my mom and sister's health"".

Not knowing where to go from here, this has honestly been the worst feeling ever. Am I wrong? Did I just fuck up my family? I thought I had support but I guess not.

70,"Hello,

I have a lot of personal issues. I have a lot of anxiety and my own mental health issues (I think I'm bipolar) but this is beside the issue I'm asking for help with.

I'm 30, and despite everything, I live home with my parents. And they HATE each other. I don't know how else to explain it. My dad is in AA (and I think suffers from brain damage from surgery) and the easiest way to describe him is a complete narcissist. Everything is about him. Everything. Like it's okay to see a movie he's interested in, or buy something he wants to buy, or talk about something he wants to talk about. He's sexist, slightly racist, he calls my mom fat a lot because she has gained weight. And my mom is someone super kind-hearted, has slightly alcoholic tendencies (from my viewpoint related to my dad), shes likes this hopeless romantic, with liberal viewpoints who just wants like a proper partner in her life. I think my dad has cheated on her, like I have every reason to believe she has (he particularly hints towards it when we're smoking weed together, like all the women he has had).

I guess what I'm asking for advice with. I'm stuck here while I'm trying to finish school, trying to put my own life on track. How do I play the neutral medium here. How can I stay out of their marital problems when I completely think my mom should dump his ass and start her life anew (she doesn't because she has a huge pension and would give half of it to him). He's a terrible human being but I'd be homeless without being allowed to live here. How do I deal with it? 

I honestly don't know what to do. I'm just trying to get through the day-to-day drama. I'm just trying to get through my own shit, ya know? How can I get through this. I feel like if I pick a side, I'm going to be the bad guy. And I don't want to pick a side, I don't want to be the guy that caused their divorce. I don't know if anyone has been through this before, but I just need to get through the next 2 years or so before I plan to move away and let them sort their own problems out.

I’ve also struggled with my own mental health and been in situations where I’ve had to help friends before.

74,"This is going to be long.

So I’ve been keeping track of all the times I’ve hit low points these past couple months. Ever since late March, I’ve been feeling incredibly awful and the idea of self harm has been looking better and better the more time passes. I’ve been able to keep myself from physically harming myself, but I still have serious thoughts of suicide and wanting to disappear entirely. I may not have the courage to ever follow through on suicide, but the pain is so great that I constantly wish I could dissolve into dust and cease to exist. I argue back and forth with myself, as I’m aware certain thoughts are lies my brain is trying to tell me, but it’s gotten harder and harder to push those thoughts away. Ever since the month mentioned above, I haven’t been able to go more than two weeks without a depressive episode (this phrase is the best way I can describe what’s happening, but I have not been formally diagnosed with depression, nor am I self-diagnosing).

Tonight, things came to a head and I was unable to fight off many of the awful thoughts I’ve had about myself. The summer semester of college has started; it’s only week one and I’m already behind. I only work weekends and otherwise stay at home since COVID-19 is still a major factor. I don’t have an exercise routine and my eating habits have been slipping a lot again. Tonight, everything came crashing in on me and I couldn’t think of myself as anything more than a lazy, good-for-nothing leech who can’t even be bothered to handle the responsibilities they have. I beat myself up for not being able to handle something so simple as schoolwork, for not buckling down and getting shit done. I called myself a terrible, awful human being who contributes nothing to society and thought everyone would be better off if I just stopped existing. That’s something I dream about a lot. Not *dying,* but just...disappearing into nothing as if I were never there in the first place. Falling asleep and never waking up. I thought the world would be better off if I had never existed in the first place.

Having told close friends and family about such thoughts, my mom gave me the number to a suicide hotline. A small part of me reasoned that this was a good time to try and call, but I’ve always had a lot of anxiety about phone calls, so I opted for the online chat option instead.

...It...took a while.

I had to psych myself up for it in the first place because not only was I afraid to connect, but I also felt guilt and shame because I believed it was stupid to go running to the hotline over *schoolwork,* even though I knew there were a lot more detrimental thoughts that needed to be addressed than just that. Even then, there was a waiting line, and I couldn’t stop shaking and crying because I was so terrified they would think I was just another whiny bitch who wanted attention and was too lazy for college. I was still afraid once I got to the front of the waiting line, but once I hit connect and entered in the information it asked for...nothing. All the counselors were busy.

I threw my phone down and cried some more, feeling like a total moron for even *attempting* something so stupid. It wasn’t their fault. They had more important people to talk to, people that *really* needed the help. Not lazy freeloaders like me.

All the crying tired me out soon enough and I just felt *tired.* I still do. I thought I was doing something right by using a resource  given to me by my mom in an attempt to help, but I came out of it feeling like a fucking idiot. Now I’m exhausted and am no closer to getting any of my schoolwork done that’s due by 5:00pm tomorrow (it’s 1:37am here).

Overall, tonight was a disaster. I don’t know how I’ve made it this far, but I’m not sure how much longer I can keep going. I was too afraid to reach out to anyone close because I felt they would tell me I was being over dramatic, or that they deserved better than to hear about my woes and sorrows again. My doctor gave me a list of therapists that are covered under my insurance, but I haven’t done anything with it yet. I’m just... I guess I’m afraid. Frozen. Once I’m in that low point, I become paralyzed and can’t see a clear way out, even though I’ve been told time and time again to reach out to others for support when things get bad like that. I’ve said to others that I can only help them so much and that it’s up to them to help themselves, but then what the hell am *I* doing? Sitting here, letting my mind eat away at me again.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know why I’m writing this. Maybe to finally speak up since I couldn’t seem to open my mouth earlier. I don’t know how to talk when deep in the throes of sadness, but I can’t keep going on like this. Something’s got to give sooner or later and I’m afraid it’ll eventually be *me.* If I could just learn how to *act,* then maybe something could change, but... Deep down, I’m a coward.

And I hate myself that much more for it.",05Jun2020,1

I have major depression and general anxiety, so with the current situation involving protests, riots, and the whole pandemic bullshit, I'm starting to doubt that I truly have a future. I feel like once I get out of college its just the edge of a cliff and I'll have nowhere to go. The country I live in is turning into a fascist dystopia and I fear for the safety of many of my friends and family since they are people of colour, yet I can't do anything to help them besides the bare minimum since I'm only 15. When I was younger I used to have suicidal ideations since I doubted that I even had a future after 13 and now I'm starting to get them again. I want to keep the people I love safe and I hate that they have to live in a world where they get scared for their lives when a cop pulls them over for a traffic violation but I can't protect them in the way I want to. The whole world feels like a prison and I don't know if there's anywhere to go, since it feels like right now every single fucking country has racist law enforcement. We can't escape it at all, and every day it just feels like its getting worse and worse. protestors are being unjustly arrested, gassed, and shot every fucking day. More and more people of colour are being killed. More events involving police brutality are being put in the spotlight, which is not a bad thing. It's amazing that these are coming to light so that more victims can have justice and their murderers can be given the consequences they deserve, but it's fucking horrible that it takes weeks, months, years even for this to happen. I just want the people I love to be safe but there is nowhere to run and hide and tell them its okay. If feels like there is no safe haven aside from death. Everywhere people are dying. Everywhere there is teargas and bombs and guns and military and cops and prisons and fascists and fucking evil evil evil people who don't care how many people die as long as they get their 5 figure paycheck at the end of the month. It makes me just want to kill myself since clearly there's nowhere else to go. I most likely won't do anything since I have a younger brother, and he looks up to me. I don't want him to grow up knowing his older sister killed herself because she couldn't take it, he doesn't deserve to have that on his conscious. Still, I have the desire, and I have a deep dark hole in me that I can't make just go away for a minute and let me up for air.",05Jun2020,1

77,"Background info: This situation involves me and my friends M, K, and P. We were friends since middle school; we will be juniors this fall. 
P's dad had died back in September, and her dog also passed away a few months later that same year. She stopped coming to school and started therapy, and my friends and I did stay in contact with her for a while, but M and I eventually stopped talking to her. She just stopped confiding in us and we had nothing else to talk about like we used to, so we just sort of fell out with her. K talked with her, I don't know how often, but they remained pretty close. 

Two days ago, K and M told me that P was planning her suicide. K had been following her spam on instagram, and apparently P had blocked M and I on it. I don't know when or why, I just knew we were blocked, and that K was the only irl friend P had on there. The rest were internet friends. On that account, P had been expressing that she was in pain and she just wanted it to end. Throughout the captions on her posts, we were able to figure out that she felt as though therapy wasn't working and that her therapist knew ""one part"" of her plan. She was on suicide watch and her mom had hidden the pills, but she said it didn't matter for now because she planned to do it in August and that her method would be a surprise. She also posted some pics of her scarred arm and scissors. She did mention that she wouldn't go through with it if a miracle happened and that she wanted to experience happiness again, but this was all still concerning so we decided to call authorities to perform a wellness check on her yesterday. However, this backfired, so she confronted K and M and blocked them, knowing they had called authorities because they were the only ones who had directly told her that they were concerned. We still had hope she was sent to the hospital for her safety, but today, I was able to see that she was actively posting on instagram meaning she was still home. I don't know if her mom took further precautions to prevent her from hurting herself, but I still think it would be better if she were in the hospital under close professional watch. 

Since she hasn't blocked me and doesn't know that I know of her plan, I am the only one who can reach out to her now. I plan to befriend her again so she knows she is not alone, but I'm scared that she will ask if K and M told me about her condition. I don't want her to block me because we will never be able to help her anymore if that happens. I'm so scared and I really don't want her to kill herself and I'm trying so hard to give her the best chances without losing her from my sight. I know she has her mom and her three siblings, but if she was able to hurt herself even after being put on watch, I don't think leaving her at home would be the best for her. 

What do I do now? Am I doing the right thing by befriending her and risking being blocked? Or is it just best to watch from afar and hope her posts don't stop once it hits August?",05Jun2020,1
78,"Hi I’ll preface this with a bit of my background. I have Bipolar I, and some other issues. I have had life long struggles starting since early childhood due to being raised in a very volatile environment. I had extreme behavioral issues as child and was in and out of therapy, in patient behavioral institutions/psych hospitals, and long term residential programs. I think due to a combination of mental health issues and my environment. During these times where I was institutionalized I was raped, beaten, starved etc. I spent much of my childhood in these scenarios as my parents while successful weren’t equipped to parent. I graduated high school a year late and it took me until I was nearly 21 to get into college. 25 to get my Bach. I’m nearly 29, and finished my masters degree last summer. I spent my time post graduate school traveling and selectively applying to jobs. I finally landed my dream job...during all of this. I moved to SF and spent several thousand dollars for moving costs, furniture, etc. recently we received work from home orders for another year plus+. I decided to break my lease to Move in with family and am spending thousands more to do so to move out (about 15k total past 3 months) so I don’t have to pay Bay Area rent. 

I feel so detached from reality. I’m having full on night terrors and nightmares. Multiple panic attacks a week. I’m having breakdowns. I’ve fought so hard for everything I have to get where I am now. and then the world collapses. I’m staring to dissociate from realty. It’s impacting my job which I started remotely and will be indefinitely. I can’t afford to not have this job. I literally climbed Mount Everest with no arms and legs to get to this point. But every waking moment I’m thinking about killing myself. I can barley function and have to drag myself through my work day for the dream job I spent 7 years in college with overlap of years of internships/work to get. I couldn’t think of a more perfect place to work or job position to have. I don’t know want to do. I can’t even fathom my situation where I start my career remotely and will be working remotely until further notice. I’m somebody who is very outgoing and extroverted and always on the move. But now I’m just existing. And I want to die. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m experiencing severe suicidal ideations. I’m barely sleeping. I’m barley eating. I just want to die. I know I have to push through this but I don’t know how. I don’t know how I can make. I finally escaped my life circumstances and ended back at the starting point. Idk.",05Jun2020,1
79,"Hi, (oblig on my phone formatting apologies)

About a year and a half ago I was in the process of dropping out of college, but at that point I was still forcing myself to go to class about two days a week. I was walking from my house to school, about a mile, and I was crossing the street when a girl coming the opposite way smiled and said something to me that in retrospect was probably hello or something like it, and the more I think about now, it was probably someone I had met before because it was a small school, but I didn't recognize her at the time.For some reason, all I heard her say was ""I know what you did"". 

Obviously I felt attacked and my instinct was both fight and flight and so my response was an angry ""WHAT?"" as I kept walking. I looked back when I crossed the street and she didn't look back. I think I scared her. Ive felt bad about it since almost immediately after it happened.

I've never felt that attacked before and I've never behaved that way before either. I'm not an angry person and never angry like that. It's probably worth noting that I was a bit stoned and sleep deprived at the time, but no more than ordinary for me.

I've been doing my own research but I'd be really interested in other people's opinions about that situation. Thanks, appreciate you all.",05Jun2020,1

83,"My dad grew up with an extremely abusive cop Dad, my mom grew up with a recovering alcoholic but still abusive dad as well. My dad has beat me my whole life, to the point I’d characterize it as beyond “spanking” or “reprimanding” which I don’t agree with but like, I was thrown against a wall and to the floor and dragged by my hair by a man 5 times my size a couple of times. My TV was thrown into the wall and there’s a dent in it still, we also had to cover up a closet door with some dumb wall art to hide the hole he punched through it. 
      My younger sister has faced the same but now acknowledges I was more targeted by the violence and she would try to protect me and felt so bad when it happened. My Mother who I love to death and I know wants the best for me turned a blind eye, she said her abuse was worse and what I was going through was nothing in comparison.
     I want to break this cycle and if I have kids never I’ll fucking never hurt them. But the issue is I still love my Dad. The man who has psychically abused me most of my life. I seek his approval to this day. He had a hard childhood and his father was even more abusive so he see’s this as normal, he also has severe OCD and I feel bad for him and like he doesn’t know any better or any different.

Although, I think I'm slowly sinking back into all of this and I'm trying my best to keep my head up but recently with the pandemic I've been feeling worst than ever... I want to communicate with a therapist or at least a psychologist but I don't really have to money to afford it, and I'm so scared to even call one

My mom keep trying to shove pills down my throat saying they will help me, half of the time I'm high on aphrodisiacs and have difficulty breathing if i stay awake for too long, but then i fall back into those disgusting nightmares and the cycle restart. insomnia. panic. breakdown. pills. sleep. nightmares.

I tried hiding all this suppressed frustration and anxiety for so long to my friends and my boyfriend but I think they're slowly realizing my mask is breaking down and that i'm not fine, i'm scared, i don't want them to see me like this

85,"I (19F) just want to preface this by saying that in real life I do not feel attracted to children. 

But recently (and I feel disgusted with myself saying this) I found this anime character that I really connected with and found myself attracted to. So much so I masturbated to him. But he is 12. 

Oh god just writing that out is gross.

He doesn't look like he's gone through puberty so there is no excuse. I'm still attracted to him.

He's the cool type of character and he gets so much character development throughout the show, I wondered if maybe I'm just attracted to his personality. But I know its definitely his aesthetic too. He’s so cute, but can be so hot sometimes but *gag* he’s a fucking kid, but it doesn’t matter to me in the moment like wtf. 

Worse is that I especially like the parts when he's crying, like when he's going through a breakdown. I am sickened by myself. I am getting turned on watching a 12 year old anime boy crying for his friend, like what the fuck is wrong with me? 

I have not been attracted to a character this young before ever. And l've never been attracted to kids in real life either. It’s just this one fucking character.

I am still attracted to people my own age and older and I would never ever touch a kid in real life. But I googled it and you don’t need to to still be considered a pedophile.

87,"I'm currently 19 year old male. I've just decided to take a hiatus from editing videos for a friend of mine across the country.  I felt like I had little reason to do it other than I felt bored and didn't want to do it. I was being paid weekly but after about 6 months of doing it I just got bored. And now I feel like the only job that suited me is slipping away. I have many other interests and hobbies that I've wanted to pursue. Now I currently want to get into fighting game tournaments even though I know jack shit about fighting games (I know it's crazy) But whats even crazier is that I just started playing a fighting game (Guilty Gear xrd) for only 2 weeks. And whats even weirder is that I feel like I'm either sabotaging my enjoyment of the game because I want to commit every fiber of my being to get good at it or I've already lost interest in the game but I'm trying my best to trick my brain into thinking that. The reason I'm taking about this situation in particular is because it feels like an example of patterns in my life were I decide to pursue this passion of mine but decide to walk away because I feel like it's too hard or some other stupid excuse. It's drives me crazy and it makes me feel like I'm going to end up a lazy fucking failure. I don't want a ""real"" job. I can't imagine doing shit like being a lawyer or a doctor and not wanting to blow your brains out. I worked part time in retail for two months bagging most of the time and cashiering on the side. After being unable to handle the pressure of customers, I had a mental breakdown at home. Having mental breakdowns every 3 months has been a common occurrence since I was a freshman in highschool. I was diagnosed with anxiety at that time and my parents (especially my mom) are extremely overprotective even today and rightfully so due to the amount of time I wailed shit like, ""I WANT TO FUCKING DIE!"" or something like that. Thing is though, I don't want to die. In fact, I'm fucking scared of dying. I want to live my life to the fullest. Have my own roof to live under, I kind and thoughtful girlfriend with similar tastes, freedom to travel and all that good shit but the real world tells my that I'm not mentally fit or strong enough to get to that state. I've been scared of talking to girls, my height has always bothered me (currently around 5'4), and as I've said before I don't even want a real job and If I aspire to be something like a participant in fighting game tournaments (terrible example I know) it'll take sacrifices that I feel like I don't have the balls to make. On top of that I haven't bothered getting a drivers licence and the recent pandemic has stopped me from doing so. Honestly, I don't even know where I'm going with this. At the moment, I just don't want to get into another spell of angry outbursts and breakdowns. My life just feels like a cycle of me feeling great one day and feeling like shit the next and it feels like there is no way to end the cycle. Theres a voice in my head that screams ""I want to die"" even though I don't. I know things take time but I'm fucking impatient. So fucking impatient.",05Jun2020,1

It feels like a itchy-dry spot but it's really just because it's where the waves of my hair change course.

Also, is there any way to tell if my potential symptoms are real or made up? I have behaved in ways that seem to fit multiple warning symptoms and others have pointed some of these things out to me.

But they steer clear from such people as if it's a contagious disease which hurts alot. My mom has been diagnosed with schizophrenia paranoid. She have been showing it's symptoms for many years but as our society was not very aware of mental diseases up untill recently, it took many many years to know about the diagnosis let alone treatment. She is 46 and reluctant to get any treatment because she doesn't believe she needs it. Call it lack of education or awareness, for her to even understand that whatever she is feeling and dealing with can be helped through medicines is very difficult. It's been 6 years now from her diagnosis and without any treatment despite of my family trying our best to get her treated.

I just want to tell you what I'm feeling, and hopefully you can hear me out. This won't be that long and I hope you stand by.

I was a psychology student graduate, so I have some  knowledge about mental health problems. As I assess myself, I have two underlying problem. First is FEAR and the other one is DELUSION. 

My first story is about me training for mixed martial arts with my friends, and as a beginner you will need sparring to enhance your skills. My very first sparring was my mind felt like I was beat up bad even when my friend barely touched me with his gloves. And me same to him, I didn't execute anything. After that everything changes. I get away from trainings to gyms and make excuses and I'll do everything to stay away from him. Time past by and I challenge myself to train again and I did well. I did well in sparring even they are pro fighters and Im not. I throw some good exchanges with my other sparring partners, I hurt them they hurt me. The problem is until now my mind never forget my first sparring and continue to evade the specific person even some of my sparring partners hit me well than him. It makes me anxious, clouded mind and afraid. 

My second story is that I always have this automatic thoughts of every male strangers is my enemy. When I walk them through streets my heart always pound fast and it's like 'Fight or Flight' mode. The backstory about this is my girlfriend was been harrased in public while he was with me and I didnt know about it then I made sure that I will protect her THAT'S WHY I TRAINED FOR MIXED MARTIAL ARTS but worse thing happened for my mental health. 

What are your thoughts? I need to hear you out. It's been around 2016-2017 and I'm still living through this hell. Any opinions are welcome.

97,"Background:
Since the end of 5th grade, I’ve had trouble doing schoolwork. It began when I zoned out for 10-20 minutes during a geography lesson and missed some important information about rivers that was part of an index card-based project. I had never zoned out like this before and didn’t give it much thought. When asked why I wasn’t doing the project, I (who was very socially awkward) didn’t say anything. I didn’t feel comfortable asking about what I had missed. I begin zoning out in every class, frequently. My grades went down and I felt really bad about it. To cope with this, I stopped caring. In 6th grade, I didn’t do any work as a result of an absence of focus and no motivation. It continued and still is today. 

This year (I’m a freshman in high school) I’ve really been trying to improve my ability to focus and get my schoolwork done but there’s always something in my mind holding me back. Sometimes I can’t concentrate and spend hours doing everything other than schoolwork, sometimes I get frustrated at the amount I have left (which grows the more frustrated I get, creating a feedback loop), and other times I can’t make myself continue doing an assignment because the amount of work left on just that single assignment overwhelms me. 

Occasionally I can finish one or even two assignments in a day, but then I’m exhausted and waste the next day doing nothing. I am assigned about 3-4 things to do per day, so obviously this isn’t sustainable.

I feel guilty because part of me thinks that I’m holding myself back because I’m lazy, but the other part of me is saying that maybe there’s something else going on. I also feel guilty because everyone tells me I’m extremely smart and my scores prove it, and whenever I hear that or am reminded of it I feel like a waste of intelligence. This demotivates me and I end up sitting in my chair ruminating about my negative qualities.

There was one day I woke up and looked at my assignments. I cried a lot trying to do the first one and eventually stopped crying and started doing it. Throughout the course of the assignment, I cried a few more times. After that, I started doing very well and I managed to complete 8 assignments by 4 pm, but my brother wanted me to help him unload a U-Haul and build a wall in his new residence. I didn’t want to go at all because I was doing so much work and could go on for a while, but my father made me. 

Since that day I’ve performed even worse than usual. All of my work is due on June 12th and the days are slipping by so fast because I’m just distracting myself from my work instead of going back to it and feeling bad.

A third perspective and/or words of encouragement would help a lot. Also, any idea why I cried that one day?",05Jun2020,1
98," It has always been like that (F23) and there's a certain context to it so I understand why I'm like that but I always feel uncomfortable in front of people if something is really sad and everybody's crying (real life situations, movies, tough stories) and they look at me and I just can't cry.

I mean, whenever everybody else is crying I don't feel well and I feel like everything's in my throat and I can feel my chest burning but I can't open up to people just like that and say what's the reason for it. They always look at me in a weird way, expecting me to cry with them and I simply can't. I feel like they are analyzing that in their heads trying to find a proper answer or a reason why I'm not crying. Especially because I'm a female and it would be somehow 'normal or expected' for boys not to cry, which is a terrible way of thinking about emotions.

Last time I really cried was back in 2017 when I lost my friend in a car accident and that was the first time my friends and other people saw me crying.

I just had to get it off my chest because many times I wish I could sit and cry my eyes out but I can't. I know there are people like me who will get this and since I can't talk about this with anybody else, I just want to shout out to you. In my country we have a beautiful song that says: *Crying without tears hurts terribly.*",05Jun2020,1
99,"How I feel is difficult to explain but here is my best shot.

There are very few people I would trade my life for. I have a good career, above average looks, am well traveled, acceptable social life for a thirty year old in a medium sized town. I live every day doing pretty much anything I want. 

Yet.....

I feel totally disconnected from life. It's hard to describe but it's like a feeling of not being in control. Like life is pushing you in a certain direction. Although I have friends and family, I feel like I am acting. All the time. And that not only does no one really understand what's going on behind the scenes but, would they even care? Are they doing the same thing I'm doing to them to me? Are we all trying to pretend to be a certain thing around certain people at certain times? The seeming total disconnect from other people gives me an overwhelming sense of loneliness, sadness, and a feeling of nihilism. 

I have randomly decided quit jobs and travel for several weeks to months at a time. I have taken on new activities of rock climbing, and aggressively skiing. And I've been in love. I am aware of the intense anxiety of being in a totally new country, the fear of climbing, the adrenaline of a dangerous ski run, the love in a romantic relationship, but it's like it's not real. It's like a small feeling of control that occurs for a brief moment then fades away into meaninglessness. 


Thanks for hearing me out. Glad this community is out here.",05Jun2020,1
100,"Hi everyone,
 Around three to four months ago I started meditating. Now I feel as if I am observing my thoughts ALL THE TIME. It’s like I’m getting lost in thoughts. 
 After months of fighting with my parents my mom told me that I was “schizophrenic.” I didn’t believe in it at first. I had seen therapists before, a few times. One therapist told me that I could have OCD, but I wasn’t diagnosed. I do check locks, or before going to sleep, I used to touch the empty plug to make sure there was nothing plugged in. The latter must have happened after I had watched a video on OCD patients. I may had been influenced by that, I don’t know. 
 When my mom told me that I was schizophrenic, I saw a therapist. He said I had major depressive disorder. But I must have misinformed him about my situation by using big words or something, I don’t know. I mean I did cry more than ten times in a month, (I had a period in my life where I didn’t cry a single tear for A YEAR) and felt generally bad. I remember back in February I sat on the school stairs. I felt so alone, like I had never felt before. I also told the therapist about a few nightmares I had. I think I had one or two nightmares between June 2019 and March 2020. Back in summer I had a nightmare where my cat fell down the window and I was screaming “HELP” as the sky was dark red. I had eaten lots of sugary foods before falling asleep that night. And I had also slept late. 
 So after my mom told me that I was schizophrenic, I checked online for schizophrenia. I used to check ocd or anxiety symptoms, but it was not that prominent in my life. I think after checking online for schizophrenia symptoms, I got into a rabbit hole where I became OBSESSED (underlined, bold, a million fucking points) with mental health, psychology, mood, thinking, thoughts... I then started meditation, I remember searching on YouTube for “meditation for emotional healing.”
 After meditation I also became very focused on my breath. I breathe so loud now. I used to breathe deep when I used to feel anxious, now I take deep breaths very, very frequently. 
  After my mom called me schizophrenic, I also started to self diagnose myself, or check for symptoms that are related to schizophrenia. I became very focused in sounds around me. I think there was a construction that day at my school, or something, I don’t remember well. But there was a sound. I asked my classmate if she heard the same sound that I heard, I asked “do you hear that sound or am I the only one?” She said “Yes, I heard that too.”
 I also became obsessed with my mood. I was watching my mood all the time. I didn’t take the antidepressants. It’s like I was this mood-hunter, where I chased happiness, and googled “happiness,” and mood, etc. I wanted to fix depression if there was depression, so I ran, stayed away from stress, tried to eat well etc. but it wasn’t me. 
 I also believed that what we said would change reality. Which I think it’s false now. I thought I was rewiring my brain, or changing my set of thoughts. I tried affirmations. I used to repeat affirmations to myself to fix myself after fights with my parents.",05Jun2020,1
101,"Not sure if this is the right community for it but I wanna know. I never thought it was torettes before because I thought TS was only shouting things. 

But I found out it’s also other things, shoulder shrugging was one the website mentioned which I have. I’ve always felt weird urges to shrug, or twitch my eye to or nose because it’s like an itch, like my muscles are itchy and I need to stretch them or something. It’s pretty annoying and sometimes I constantly feel like I need to do it, which probably looks weird. It’s not out of my control, it’s like scratching an itch. Some days it’s not bad tho. Is that torrets, for those who have it? Or what would it be?",05Jun2020,1
102,"This sounds really bad, but I don't think it's for attention. I just feel terrible a lot of the time and it feels like this can't be something that people just deal with everyday. TW for stuff like self harming, food issues, pedophilia, general stuff. This is just going to be a massive list of things that might have screwed me up so feel free to skip around. I've seen a therapist, I've seen school counsellors, and I've done some online counselling, but after a few sessions I feel better after venting and then I give myself time and then I get worse again. I feel too scared to go back and tell them. 

A lot of not so great stuff has happened in my relatively short life. The priest who did my confirmation was a p\*dophile (although he never did anything to me or my family, and we found out a few weeks after he left our church. The news did use a photo from my confirmation though.) My grandma had a stroke on a plane and my dad was away a lot to see her in Hong Kong. To get her home took a lot of resources and she died shortly after. I honestly don't know how these things have affected me, sometimes I feel bad because I don't think I actually mourned properly.

I used to scratch myself with a pin when I had a major breakdown, but now I do it because it's generally calming. Sometimes I feel bad, but the other day I actually got an amazing result on a test and did it anyway. I've preplanned it, like in the middle of the day I unscrewed the blade from a sharpener and kept it for that night instead of it being a spontaneous decision. I don't think I'm actually properly hurting myself, because it's not deep and there's no scars. (Although they are just scabs right now so I guess there's time.) I'm not really suicidal, I want to die but I'm not going to put effort into it at the moment. Sometimes I think about dying in my sleep, but most methods seem too painful or ineffective to try.

The other day my mum had a bad time and called a friend (I think, I'm not sure) about how me and my brothers were being raised selfish and lazy. I think I'm dealing with that, mostly by writing my graduation speech where I turn that around in my head, but it might have set off a lot of the stuff that happened. My two brothers have had ADHD tests, one is on medication for it and I'm not sure about the other (that sounds bad, but he's in year 8 and it's up to him if he wants me to know about it). Two of my uncles have epilepsy, one I used to see every week and we are quite close.

I thought I might have had social anxiety or something similar because I couldn't talk to strangers if I was by myself. I can't ask things of people on public transport, I overthink where I can sit. It's not severely affecting me at the moment, just bouts of fear of doing something wrong or not following some unwritten rule, but I still take public transport everyday after school.

I'm sort of questioning my sexuality, I'm pretty sure I'm sexually attracted to both men and women, but I don't think I've ever had a crush. I had a girlfriend for a while but that was just us both trying something new and it never got serious. I don't know what love towards someone feels like, and I don't know if I've felt it and just didn't realise. Or just overreacting.

Now some random bits and pieces that might be of importance. I sleep in a nest and like layering blankets like a weight. I run around the house because my head gets too full. When in social situations I get drained easily and often start creating fanfic in my head of characters in my position (this often overtakes the situation, like I will actively switch off to think. I regret this a lot.) I'm turning 18 in less than a month and I'm terrified of the future. I know our family is okay, but also not in the best position money-wise, we go on holidays to visit family every 2 years or so but I'm still worried about bills going up. I eat regularly, but will often ignore if I'm hungry or if I know I'm not quite eating enough, I'm fine with my weight and body (I actually enjoy it more than other physical aspects of myself).

Anyway, thank you for sticking to the end. The main thing I'm asking I guess is if there might be something wrong, because I feel like I'm overreacting or exaggerating sometimes, but I do have good days, just not the majority. Thank you!",05Jun2020,1
103,"I think I’ve been here posting about it before but I’m honestly scared now. Throughout the last six months my boyfriend 28m and I 25f have been renting with housemates. I was already worried as it wasn’t planned to be share housing. We moved out so we could move in to a place just for us but instead we made a move for an in between. I have a neurological condition called Misophonia. Since I was 14 when I came to telling my family and putting a name to the condition, it’s been a serious struggle with eating with my family let alone my bf. The condition not only puts strain on me but also on him and everyone else close to me. As I get agitated easily with it. Making anything with sounds and visual to do with food and restaurants difficult. I’ve gotten to a point where I am off my meds as I’ve needed to change them. And I haven’t seen my psych for months, half a year at least. I’m thankful that I can go and see her in another week from now, however I would not be surprised if my partner wants to separate. We’ve struggled with my condition before but right now since I asked him quietly at dinner to ‘be aware, I’m not dealing too well right now, this might sound sharp’ and it did, he doesn’t want to see my face he wants me to go away from him for at least a few hours. I already struggle with anxiety but my partner is I think past breaking point and has clearly had enough of me right now. I’m just wondering what more I can do as I’m numb right now and at a loss as for what I could possibly do. I cannot right more wrongs when I said I was doing my best to improve. When I haven’t, sadly. We’re supposed to be moving out again together as the housemates situation was not working out. They’re not happy with our effort’s. I’m always trying to fix things but I think this is long gone. I don’t know what I can do. I have no control over the bf, I have mistakenly put pressures on him unintentionally expecting him to comply consistently. No one can. That’s horrible and I feel like I’m a fuck up.",05Jun2020,1

I've been meaning to post about this on reddit for some time but I couldnt find the words to describe how I feel but I will give it my best shot. Putting my life in words is not easy so please bare with me and help me.

I have never been able to figure out what I WANT. I just do what feels FUN at the moment. When I was young, I played many sports but never fully COMMITED to one so I never got really good at any. Just an guy who knows many sports (all rounder). This also has carried on to school and now college. 
I do what feels GOOD at the moment. Most of the time, what makes me feel good is usually something that is a short term reward. The things that make me feel good right now are: anime, tv shows, video games, food. For example, I could motivate myself to study by telling myself I will order a burger or watch an anime if I finish studying. In other orders, I am not thinking about anything else when I do these things that I enjoy, I am merely doing them for pleasure. I could go out with friends (thats a lie, I only have one friend) just to feel that I have done something different and not to feel like a hermit when I binge watch. 

Praying, Studying, Friends, etc. are just there to make not feel guilty about doing the thing I enjoy which is their only purpose to me. If they lose that purpose they are pointless. For example, I am watching anime right now while I have final exams and I have no guilt for skipping 3 exams. 

I dont know what I am supposed to do in life but I know that this isnt healthy. I thought about this many times and came up with potential solutions. You know how many times that was? Literally over 100 times. I have broken promises to myslef to CHANGE so many times that I dont trust myself anymore. I have sought help because people may belittle my problems and tell me to ""man up"" ""others have bigger problems"" ""you are just lazy but with excuses"". Men dont talk about mental problems where I am from.

Please, I just need your opinions on what I should do. Feel free to ask for additonal information. 

Thank you",05Jun2020,1
105,"? Possible just incase TW: Abuse, Anxiety, Medication, Worries, Distressed, Suicide

A apologise in advanced for the poor gramma, possible spelling mistakes and the long paragraphs. I just really want to get this off my chest anonymously and gain some sort of advice. This is longer than expected but it outlines almost my life and the first time I’ve been truthful about it. I’m not in my twenties yet but I really want to change before I am.

Firstly, a bit of background and context. I am currently a university student, in England, studying to go into the medical field but don’t quite want to go into details on what profession it may be. I recently only got diagnosed with Adult ADHD Combined Type with Generalised Anxiety, Social anxiety and emotional dysregulation associated with ADHD. I’m still quite young, that being a teenager and I know I have my whole life ahead of me but for most of my life, different situations and circumstances were never normal for me. At school i always got away with doing things, not turning up to lessons, poor behaviour, messing around in class and distracting others. I was with Camhs quite a bit but never had a diagnosis for anything. But, I was still top set in every subject. Despite all this, I still got quite good/decent grades and went to college. In college, pretty much the same, messed around, lazy but again, reworded friends assignments etc and got 100% after the two years. I then started university and just finishing my first year in about a months time. My childhood was abusive, I was abused physically and verbally at home, I was bullied at school but at the same time I was well known and popular. People wanted to hang with me at times and other times they didn’t. I had loads of friends but didn’t at the same time. I had such a different experience to life as some people and it’s hard to explain. 

University has been challenging as it was a complete reality shock. I found literally trying to survive a lot harder on my own than others. Cooking, washing clothes, managing my time, studying and generally trying to sustain life in general has been extremely difficult and I could never explain it to anyone until I got a diagnoses of ADHD and started medication which has help in some aspect. I had to use my student loan to seek the diagnoses from a private psychiatry service because the waiting list would’ve been two years. 

During University, I had a period where I was taking street benzodiazepines and got to a very low point in my life where I attempted to overdose multiple times on these benzos but again, after a few days, I did not feel as if I wanted to even do that and felt completely fine. I have attempted a few times previously and the same, I felt completely different after a few days. No one really believed that and said it was unusual so there’s another reason why my life is just not typical or normal. I was sent home from uni but continued online learning with the rest of the cohort as corona virus pandemic occurred and it didn’t make much difference. I am struggling SO hard with the remote work and lectures, even though I am receiving help etc. Nothing is working, my brain is just not processing anything as if my brains CPU has just slowed down significantly. 

People have always told me to speak to my family etc for help but being home has been the worst. I have NEVER been close to my family and I don’t think I ever will be. I never speak to them, I feel awkward speaking to my family; my mother especially. Since being home, (Roughly 10 weeks ago) I have stopped the benzodiazepines but I feel as if that has contributed to constant day for day anxiety. My anxiety is related to health issues and friends and how others judge me. I constantly feel as if I have something wrong with my health and that leads to me doing hours of research and googling symptoms hoping to find an answer to relieve me knowing i’m fine but as you know, it will always state the worst case scenario. I know this but I still do it because I want an answer and it’s never the answer that I want. 

On top of all of this, a healthcare job that i used to work for over a two years ago has just dismissed me for gross misconduct. I was in inpatient briefly because I smoked cannabis and it exacerbated my paranoia and feelings at the time. I had gone to work after, which i knew i shouldn’t have, and when I came back I was tested positive for THC on the day I worked. This was because THC lasts such a long time and I had not smoked or been under the influence whilst working. They believed me when I said this but because if anything happened to someone at work and i tested positive, it would have been a legal issue. This now plays on my mind on how it will affect me in the future when applying to my regulatory body for my profession. I rang a solicitor and my course lead at university and councillors and they all believe that it will be okay but it still plays on my mind as if I have completely messed up my life. 

Recently (last three months maybe) I have been so cautious on what people may think about me, are they really wanting me to be here? Why am i always the third person in the corridor behind them? Why does no one pay attention to my questions when I ask in our uni groupchat? Why am I always last to be invited or even never? I almost NEVER call my friend but they call me because I just fear that rejection. It is ruining my life and I have tried meditation everyday, tried noting and mindfulness, tried to change myself. I have never had that one best friend and I have no idea what the hell is wrong with me. I feel as if recently i struggle to talk to people, I stutter my words, I have difficulty phrasing things unless I am writing them down. My reading and writing have become so bad. 

I woke up this morning thinking the world is falling apart and so is my life. There’s a global pandemic, there are multiple riots and students all over the country are devastated and outraged by how they are proceeding with teachings. 

I don’t have anyone, I don’t speak to my family, my friends back at home don’t want to hang around with my and my university friends don’t talk to me, they prefer other people since I have became riddled with this anxiety and I believe it might be because I am constant worrying about my health in some aspect or my mental health or judgement from others. I am due to have an assessment for therapy again but I can’t even think of how to explain what I need help with or how it can help! 

I kind of want some sort of advice and if anyone is willing to read this to see what I actually need help with and mention to a professional again because I don’t even know what’s wrong, even though I have briefly explained my life story. Even right now, my memory is HORRENDOUS and I can’t even remember what I wrote so writing the TL;DR will consist of me going back and forth reading what I’ve wrote and condensing it. 

I really just want everything to go back to a time where I did not care so much, was briefly happy for a while, had some friends. Didn’t worry constantly about judgement (even if the things i was doing is normal), I wasn’t so afraid of saying no to people and I want to change. I want to be able to not fear rejection, I want to not constantly focus on negatives and I want to be a normal person. I am in a social awkwardness hole and it’s filling up with thoughts of past regrets, previous wrong doings, fear, worries, financial struggles and loneliness. 

Any advice would be appreciated so much❤️

TL;DR: My life has been completely different to others. I have ADHD-Combined, social anxiety, generalised anxiety and emotional dysregulation. I take medication which helps when active slightly with productivity. I constantly worry about my health and how others judge me. I have no one, not even my family, never been close to my family. I do receive professional help but they don’t work. I have an assessment for therapy soon but don’t even know what’s wrong or how to explain what’s wrong. I feel awkward asking for help. I need some advice. My life has turned for the worst and I think it may have been to do with the time I was taking high amounts of benzodiazepines and have damaged my brain. My life is basically a lie and I just want to go back to being happy and not caring/worrying so much again. I am a mess. My experience with life has been so different to others and it’s hard to explain.",05Jun2020,1
106,"Exactly one year on, and about 6 weeks after starting antidepressants i feel like the sun has come out!

almost everyone forgot until I after 8pm when I posted about it on Facebook and I’ve had a sudden guilty rush of messages, but I don’t care, I feel like people love me every day.

107,"This is my first time posting here and i don't know if this really belongs here but i have a hard time finding more specific subreddit for my vent. I know that other people here might have more serious problems but i just need to write about it somewhere and i have a hard time telling this to people in my life. 
I have incredibly low self esteem, i cry a lot and cannot control it. Im anxious and afraid of everything and on top of that im introverted and really bad at communicating with other people.
So naturally many things don't come as easy to me as to other people. Even though i am quite successful academically, in real life outside of school im completely useless.
Many people in my life have noticed this and clearly want to help me but i just feel like that their advice in not getting me anywhere. I just don't get how advice like 'just believe in yourself more!!' or 'don't be so afraid' or 'just be more assertive and decisive' is supposed to get me anywhere if anxiety and sensitivity is just how i react to things and have almost no control over that.
I would really like to get better at these things and i know that its me who has to do the work but i just don't know where to start because its not like i can just change my personality in a matter of days.
I just feel like such a burden to everyone around me and sometimes i feel like it would be better if i just didn't exist at all and saved everyone the trouble.",05Jun2020,1
108,"I don't know what to do, this has happened before a few months ago but it feels worse now.

It starts with thinking about a recent mistake (last post if you want to read more) and feeling ashamed intensely, and I'll go down a shame spiral and remember every mistake I've made and who I used to be and hate it. I have changed a lot but I used to think lying was more okay and gossip behind people's back, but I don't even know who I am or what I stand for anymore.

I had a problem with drinking and getting blackout drunk and have said nasty things to people I love on a few occasions, I have apologised profusely to all of those people but now I am thinking back and wondering if I did other fucked up things while blackout drunk and I just don't remember them.

I don't know how to forgive myself and I managed to bury it for months but now all the obsessive ruminating thoughts are back, and they are my fault.

I have a really nice life and don't think I deserve it, I have tried to help people and change who I am and I am still messing up and bowing to peer pressure or avoiding confrontation at 22. I can't help but compare myself and feel I have done worse things than others even though I don't judge them as harshly.

I find it hard to take compliments because I don't think I'm lovely and don't think it's true.

I really don't want to worry my boyfriend and feel bad for making it about me when so much is going on in the world. He doesn't know that I've hardly eaten these past 5 days either, don't understand why I'm not but I just don't have the motivation to do much because there isn't much to do. Feel quite disgusted even more that I'm just wallowing in my self-pity and it's not helping anyone.",05Jun2020,1
109,"Hello guys, I am writing this post because I read a lot of posts from people feeling badly, hopeless, as losers, without any purpose in life or with the feeling of being out of control.
At first I would like to tell you that it is ok to feel like this sometimes.
Life is not like in the movies and it is full of challenges, difficult times, wrong choices, bad attitude, down moments, mistakes and laziness.
We are not all the same, we do not follow the same paths or rules and there are no assured steps that can be done to avoid suffering in life or mistakes. Most of us are not brilliant successful entrepreneurs with excellent curricula,genius ideas,wonderful friends and a perfect family always laughing and having fun.
Actually I do not know anybody with a perfect life and perfect people around.
Most of us are just ordinary people that are facing everyday life  step by step and trying to make ends meet with some creativity.
Now, you need to acknowledge that you are not different from anybody else and you deserve to forgive yourself, to feel better and reach out for happiness. You are capable to make your life better as anybody else.
We all have down moments to reset our lives and gain new energies and many of us need help to face those moments and to deal with what our brain is making us to think and feel.
Sometimes you feel being in this deep down dark hole without any exit:please just breath and cry, you cannot believe it because is not what you are feeling but there is a way out.
What you can do about it?
At first reach out for help, if you can afford mental health services contact them, if you cannot you need to contact the suicidal helpdesk in your country,it is extremely important to get professional help to identify the exact problem and what you need to do in order to face it, contact also the people you can really trust (your family or friends) , do not be ashamed or afraid of scaring them or to disappoint them, ask them for help, speak frankly and openly about how you feel, start to help yourself with art, sport and creativity:draw,sing,write,play music,listen to music,do sports, write on reddit if it helps you, if you can or just have a walk, take your time to reflect but do not isolate yourself, involve yourself in community activities with others.
I know that you can feel totally desperate and that is why you need to give yourself a chance and take action!
I am not a doctor and my purpose is just trying to give you some strength and courage to activate yourself.

110,"Growing up, my mother would make me feel manipulative for expressing feelings, be it sadness or even joy. 

By the time I hit puberty I had been diagnosed with bipolar. This was later rediagnosed as TL Epilepsy. The mood swings made it hard to diagnose I guess. But really it had instilled this fear that what I felt was invalid. It was a chemical imbalance. I've been unable to open up to people on a deeper level, have relationships, fearing that I'm manipulating them into my life, all followed by deep guilt and shame for what I feel. 

Around 17 my mom was diagnosed with BPD so what was perhaps gaslighting on her side is almost justified by her personality disorder. 

I can't open up to people. Even now writing this it's heavy hearted and filled with shame. I get to be anonymous. 

The guy I really like and have gotten to know, I can't open up to and I know I'm pushing away. He thinks I'm covered in red flags. I don't know if he's joking. I don't know how to tell him that I'm really scared to tell him how I feel because my feelings are accompanied with me also feeling like I'm manipulating him, and then with that guilt. Like I'm tricking him into being with me. 

The rational side of me knows its not true. The side of me, that scared little girl, still hears her moms voice telling her to stop being so manipulative.",05Jun2020,1

ive never had a proper diagnosis before as my therapist refused to. i feel like shit. i constantly need validation about my feelings, my parents constantly keep telling me that i have nothing and im just lazy but i cant do anything anymore, ive self harmed, ive made plans to kill myself, i’m anxious to go out or do just about anything. i mean i started having a panic attack when i couldn’t find a shirt. i’ve been constantly like this for the past two years - i cant do this anymore. anyways, his diagnosis was social anxiety and obsessive thoughts. i just felt really bad about myself and i feel like utter shit. why am i feeling like this ??? there’s absolutely no reason, a frigging doctor confirmed it for god’s sake.......",05Jun2020,1
112,"Hey everyone, now for starters I’m not posting this because I want pitty, this isn’t about “oh I’m sad please give me attention” but I just want to see if anyone else feels similar, and maybe if someone can maybe help me.

I’m a 20 y/o US Marine who works a “POG” job. (For those of you not enlisted it means “Position Other than Grunt” where “grunt” meaning infantry, boots on the ground killing terrorists kinda stuff) 

If you looked at me on paper (which is how 85% of the Marine Corps sees you) I’m a pretty good Marine. I’ve got goods Proficiency and Conduct scores, I’m good at my job according to my leadership, I’m just starting college courses, I have over 200 volunteer hours this year alone, I’ve been working to get certifications, I have high first class Physical and Combat fitness test scores.

Everything apart from my Rifle Score, which stands at 250 (the lowest passing score) because I didn’t qualify twice, barely making it in bootcamp. 

Apart from my poor marksmanship (literally, for you marines) it appears I’m great. My Staff Sergeant is even having me go on a meritorious promotion board for Corporal. Hell, one of the Gunnery Sergeants in my unit refers to me as “Future Sergeant Major”.

Regardless of all of that I don’t feel like I deserve the patch I wear on my chest. “U.S. Marine”. I don’t fee l like I’m good at my job, because every week I mess something up. Even though I have volunteer hours all I did was coach a few kids. 

It’s more than just feeling like I don’t deserve this stuff, whenever I’m not at work I just crash, I just feel really depressed for no real reason, usually alcohol or nicotine helps that (I’m a lightweight so a 3 beers will have me good) but recently it’s not been distracting me. Had to leave a party while drunk a few weeks ago just because I couldn’t pretend anymore. Hell im drinking a beer as I type this. 

It usually starts with me judging myself, I think back to how I can’t shoot, or how I messed up this week, or whatever, then it turns to tears, with a roommate I can’t really do that, so I hold them back, that’s when the internal screaming starts, it’s almost like I’m not in control of my own mind sometimes. It’s to the point where hobbies that used to light up my eyes and make me lose myself feel just so numb.

Maybe it’s just burnout, I’ve heard a lot about that. I’ve been looking around and I’ve heard things about imposter syndrome and high functioning depression, which maybe I fit the billet for.

The thing is, if to everyone else I’m do great, then maybe I don’t need to get help, really part of being a Marine is putting others before yourself, so as long as I can get up, do my job and then some, why should I worry. As long as I do what I’m told, when I’m told, and still somehow go above and beyond, why should I stop. 

I’m sorry if this is really long, there’s a lot more to it, but I don’t want to drop my walls to the people who know me who think I’m some kinda legend. If anyone else feels this way, even if it’s not in the military sense please let me know, and tell me about how you handle it. Right now I’m doing fine, but the pressure is building and I cannot afford to snap. 

Thanks guys.",05Jun2020,1
113,"Im a 27 year old Male from Hawaii, USA. Bipolar disorder runs in the family on my dad's side, at least for 3 generations. I've been able to manage pretty well without medication despite having symptoms since I was 15. However, I find it increasingly difficult to manage. Some times I feel euphoric and creative and productive for weeks at a time, but other times I feel the opposite. I am a musician, and I am afraid medication might hinder my creative side, and I must admit that I relish in what might be called mania.

I would like to know from other people with the disorder, did getting on medication help? I would appreciate your personal anecdotes and experiences. Thank you",05Jun2020,1

115,"My girlfriend was been in the hospital for 2 days now. She disappeared with her car the night before going to the hospital and I was so worried so I called the police to find her(Im in a different city). She's been okay since yesterday but isnt released yet due to the Baker act. 

My main 3 concerns are:

She wants a CAT scan since she was assaulted, however she's worried about being held longer and shes thinking of doing the CAT scan after she's discharged.

Her doctor has not seen her not once before prescribing 4x the amount of her usual dose which is fucked up. Is that legal for a doctor to do? To prescribe without seeing  your patient?

Can she refuse to take the medication they are giving her? I dont want her in there any longer then needed and she's been okay to be released. We dont want them keeping her longer over  fucking pills. This is in Miami.

116,Because of the pandemic my therapy is happening over the phone. Sometimes it's annoying because my therapist is very hard to hear sometimes and we can't read each others body language (which is somewhat important with me because I'm not the most talkative although i'm getting better) but I do have the pleasure of not having to go out in public after having therapeutically bawled my eyes out.

117,"I'm 19, FtM, I've been diagnosed with BPD, clinical depression and severe anxiety (I don't know if any of these things matter). I have no idea how to name this but I feel like I need help. I've been dealing with this quite a while, I'm very interested in true crime as well as crime novels/comics whatever and whenever the killer/abuser has a troubled childhood or past I feel like if I've been there I could've helped them somehow, fixing them in some way, I would've be there for them. Most of these killers had some type of family issues or romantic issues and since I was raised in a toxic household I feel too much empathy towards them ignoring completely what they've done but I don't feel this way towards anyone who isn't a bad person for example any guy who has treated me badly I still want to be there for them and I romanticize being abused mentally and physically by them. I also have a weird view of how romance should be expressed; stalking, obsessing, jealousy and possessiveness are some ways I think it should be expressed towards me. But when someone I like gets mad at me I feel like I should apologize but I also feel like they should apologize to me. This is mainly my problem because I started dating more guys recently and I'm meeting a lot of people so I feel this type of mentality will affect my relationships but I don't know what else to do, I'm trying to get back into therapy but it's a bit difficult to have sessions online since I don't have much privacy.

I'm in Ontario, Canada. I've been to many of the crisis bullshit things, they are ok and help in the moment enough to get you out of your head enough that the urge to die subsides. But trying to find any long term help isn't as simple.

I feel like I'm just in cycle, repeating the same things, but getting no help. Where the only outcome is I'll succeed at some point and just die.

It was like pulling teeth with my GP just to get the meds I have now, but since I asked about a specialist she doesn't seem very interested in helping me, she just tells me I'm on s list. I've been waiting for years now, last time I saw her I asked and she just said she'll start it again. So I'm other words I'm SOL.

123,"Hi

It's my first post ever here on reddit, even though I read a lot of stories, but yeah, a bit nervous.

Also, English is not my mother tongue so I'm sorry if the grammar is all messed up.

I decided to write here today because I'm not really in a good place mentally speaking, which, honestly is fine and understandable with all the things that are happening in the world. I am used of having depressing episodes and I can usually deal with them. But every time I'm in a bad place I can't help but wondering if something happened in my life, something that would have caused all of that, but that I would have forget about. It's a thought that I began to have when I was in middle school, that somehow something went wrong when I was younger but my brain just erased it. I tried doing research on it but couldn't find anything at the time, didn't have any evidence and it felt like it was just something that I wanted to make my life easier (having a nice and neat example of a singular trauma that would just explain everything) so I dropped it.

But I have been talking to this new friend recently, and we were amazed to find that we had a lot in common especially about our childhood. Except this friend family is blatantly toxic where mine is fine. But she told me they were a lot of traumatic events that she forgot about until going in therapy so that it didn't feel like her family was that bad. So I was wondering if maybe it wasn't the same for me.

To be honest, a huge part of me doesn't believe that anything wrong happened to me but as I said this thought has been bugging me for years (I'm 21 now, it began around 11/12) so I thought that maybe having an external point of view would help me sorting things out.

First is a hella long introduction :

When I was around ten, my family decided to move out and my parents opened a restaurant in a small town. Me and my older brother were easy kids, we never caused any problems, were really calm and nice and good in class. When we moved out the family structure changed a lot, my parents suddenly didn't have time for us, they were stressed and exhausted all the time. A year after we moved out my brother who was 17 decided to continue his studies at the other end of the country and I basically found myself alone in this big, old and scary house (to this day I'm still convinced that it is haunted, but that's another story). Even thought I used to be a very extroverted child  I struggled making new friends, it was a very lonely time and I eventually turned out bitter, angry and eventually depressed. Things got a bit better when I entered high school (I know high school is view as being hell on earth, especially for american but were I live, we consider middle school to be the worse) and was in a boarding school two hours away from home. I tried to take this as a new opportunity to make friend (and I made plenty of them), and being happy again. But I was already deep down into depression and I realized I couldn't get myself out of it alone, so I decided to talk with my parents and to go and see a psychologue, and then a psychiatrist. They diagnosed me with depression (duh) but it always felt like an easy diagnosis, when I think about it I'm pretty sure I also had severe anxiety, eating disorders, OCD episodes, was constantly living in a daydream state (I later found out about maladaptive daydreaming) and I'm pretty sure I had visual hallucinations at a certain point (but again, could be that my house really is haunted). Anyway, with the help of professionals i started to get out of it, and after seven awful years I began a life without depression.

And then the problem :

Basically, when I picture my life before we moved, it's all happy moments and nice things. But when I look more into it they are a lot of weird things and I just don't know if they are normal (and I know normal is a hug word but... yeah). Moving out has messed me up pretty badly and I can accuse most of the thing I have today on this fact, but the more I think about it, the more it feels like it was an older problem.

So, some things that I don't know if they are weird or not (it all happened before I was ten) :

\- I never slept alone, since I am old enough to remember and even before that, I would always scream and cry until my parents let me sleep with them, when they became tired of it, they just made me sleep with my brother (who was really nice and didn't mind all this time)

\- when I was around six, I remember having a conversation with my mother, telling her I wished I could be reborn into a nice, rich family. They wasn't notion of wanting to die as far as I remember, but I clearly remember wanting to be reborn somewhere else. My mother talked about it with my father who became very angry/sad and told me that if I wanted to go I could. So in the middle of dinner, I just left. My father didn't think I would do it and run after me, I remember crying a lot that night. It's a very weird memory because I remember feeling a lot of negative emotions, but my parents forget about it until I brought it up when I was 16 and find this funny/cute.

\- I was a very nice kid, always polite and well behaved. But this one time there was this town party with little stands and everything, and a fifty something guy would announce things and talk about each stands. I don't know why, but I hated him so much, I never saw him before but his voice on the speaker would make me mad. I know that it asked me a question at a certain moment, and that I must have said something bad because the next thing I remember is being in the car with my father lecturing me while I was sobbing uncontrollably.

\- After we moved out I had pretty weird sexual dreams including my father but I just put that in the whole ""eodipian thing you have when you grow up"" box

and finally...

\- I had a pretty early sexual awakening. The first time i consciously masturbate was around five or six with a... very weird fantasy. I was sitting near a pool with old men smoking, and they used me as an ashtray. They weren't burning me or anything but it was really heavy in the shaming category. I began watching pornography around ten, and almost immediately started watching quite heavy stuff. Since then I almost always had a pretty messed up sexual life.

\- I had this friend, a neighborhood of mine, she was two years older than me and I used to sleep at her house pretty frequently. She would also came to my house pretty frequently, I don't know when or how it began, but we started having weird game. We would do catwalk that would end up in strip tease (she usually played the role of the man/boss). In another game, she pretended she was taking care of me and I had to seat on her lap, I don't remember much of this one but it's the one that gave me the strongest sickening feeling. In the most disturbing one, that I completely forgot about until recently, we would tie one of my baby doll on the swing, hurt it and call it names, the disturbing part (appart from the obvious) is that I remember feeling a mixture of awful/really excited and it was no doubt a sexual game. We also had sexual intercourse multiple times (I can remember two but might have been more). Most of the weird stuff happened at my house, but she would almost never sleep at mine. I was the one sleeping in her house, and when I did I only remember playing barbie and doing normal stuff. I don't know what to think about this. I don't remember who came up with all those things, and I don't remember being against it, but it feels very wrong and unhealthy now.

Also, after we moved out I refused to sleep over my friends house, but I don't know if it's related

There was several pedophilia related incident that happened when I grew up, it was a really small town, everyone new everyone but I somehow only learnt about it all when I was way older. Some of those incident included people I didn't know about, some of them included people really close to me.

The second one, she had become my 'centre', could understand me without me even saying anything and is always there. Kind of had become dependent on our friendship which was stupid of me but didn't relise until now. But we had a falling out and she has been ignoring me since and wouldn't talk to me even when I reached out (you can know the story if you want by reading my last post). The third friend, well he talks to me but as he is working doesn't really have time to talk all the time whenever I need to. 

So through all this my anxiety has risen tremendously. I haven't had a attack in a while which I am thankful for but  not a day passes by crying over loosing that friend and being lonely and not being able to talk to anyone. The loneliness is eating at me.

A couple days ago my old depression just hit me all at once, although the only thing that changed was the fact that I took the last pill of my medication for the month (Concerta, pretty close to Aderall but not exactly the same, I have ADHD). 

My nutrition is really good, I workout daily for around an hour, I entirely stopped drinking and smoking recently (it wasn't an actual problem, I just felt like it was best) and I've been getting plenty enough sleep. 

 Now mark my word, I have no reason to be depressed. And it pisses me off so much that I am. I hate being negative and almost never am in my everyday life but I'm physically unable to feel or imagine anything good right now, although I'm doing great in almost every aspect. I'm not excited by anything.  

I just need an answer on why I sleep 11 hours a day, feel exhausted until I go to bed, and still get great performances when I workout. I don't feel like doing anything, don't get pleasure no matter what I do and constantly feel stress I cannot pinpoint.

Concerta is not supposed to do this but it's not the first time I feel like this when I get off it. I am not diagnosed with any disorder like bipolar or borderline but the possibility has been considered by my therapists in the past.

137,"Hey! I'm not sure if this subreddit is the best place to ask this question, so please tell me if there is a better sub for this where I can get some answers.

First of all, I know I shouldn't ask strangers on reddit what the hell is wrong with me, I have my first therapy session on June 11th ever since corona started, so I'm sure I can talk about my experience there, but I hoped by asking people who might be familiar with this, could tell me their experience and maybe give me a bit more clarity about what's going on.

I have had these 'symptoms' for as long as I can remember, but slowly over time, I have started to realise these thoughts and behaviours aren't exactly normal. I'm currently 16, btw, if that helps. Also, I have been diagnosed with depression, general anxiety and social anxiety and I'm probably gonna be diagnosed with ptsd, but I haven't done any tests or whatever for that.

It's gonna sound pretty stupid but these are what I'm struggling with:
- everytime I watch a show or movie or read a book, I get instantly attached to the characters and that universe that I can't stop thinking about it. It's as if I live in that world and I have to remind myself that this is the real world. I can't tell the fantasy world apart from the real world.
- speaking of the fantasy thing, I have to fantasize about something like a story before going to sleep or else I'll stay awake the whole night. But sometimes (this actually happened last night) sometimes I get too into the fantasy and cannot stop thinking about it, so much so that I also can't sleep either.
- I feel as if people can read my mind and that I'm constantly being manipulated. I feel as if everyone's action has a deeper meaning to it. I believe that I'm being controlled by someone or something and everything, even objects, are watching me. I believe that everything is made up by my head and nothing is real. Other people don't exist, I just made them up.
- I always talk to myself in my head, but I've started to realise how I suddenly start a conversation in my head. Like, I just randomly think of a sentence and start a conversation. It feels as if that conversation is put in my head without me wanting to. I can zone out and talk non stop in my head before I realise what I'm doing.

I don't know what this means and these are pretty specific so google hasn't been helpful. I'm very ashamed of these things, because I feel stupid for feeling as if I'm being controlled. I have never talked to my therapist about these things and I think it's gonna sound so weird when I suddenly mention these thoughts. Hope to get some clarity about this.",05Jun2020,1
138,"So long and short of it is my wife has Bipolar 2 depression which causes her to have hypomanic episodes (inflated self worth, thrill seeking, risky behaviour etc) from time to time. 

She has been medicated for it for a while and seems to be doing pretty well, but occasionally she shows signs of slipping into a manic state and when she does, she does things that concern me. 

She gets hyper sexual, which I dont mind, what red blooded man would. She sends me photos that I enjoy, of a very explicit nature. She also spends a lot of time on social media platforms like snapchat and Instagram talking to people.

Normally I wouldn't think much of it, after all, we live in a largely social media driven world, but then she sends me photos that have snapchat filters, and are obvious screenshots taken from snapchat. She sends them to my messaging app, not through snapchat. She jokes about having an exhibitionist streak a mile wide. Correct me if om wrong, but 2+2 sounds an awful lot like she is sharing nudes and other highly sexual photos with other people. Am I reading this wrong?

I'm fjuckthisshit, cleverly named after my verbal tics.

I'm not here to vent, but for actual advice, so if you have any to spare, or links to online resources, I'm all ears. 

I don't have tourettes, but I struggle with insecurity and self-loathing. Some days, like today, stuff bubbles to the surface, and I constantly have to catch myself from yelling out loud ""Fuck I hate myself!"". I mean, it can get pretty weird if I suddenly blurt that out around my colleagues. My tics are always triggered by a flashback an embarrassing memory, or something that I just realized I should probably feel embarrassed about. 

Sometimes my these tics are accompanied with hand gestures, like blowing my brains out with finger pistols, or cutting my wrists. I sometimes feel like cutting or choking myself would be a relief, but I know it won't. I don't physically self-harm. 

I've never met anyone else that have the same tics  related issues. However, I find it very unlikely that out of 7 billion people on this planet, I'm the only who struggle with this.

The last couple of days i havent had my birth control. It kind of keeps my hormones in check and i can feel a huge difference in how i react to scenarios when im on and off of it.

I have been in a lot of distress lately and i am an avid self harmer. Its not every day anymore like it used to be, but it happens often when i feel im coming to my breaking point. Like when life feels like its fallin down around me and i cant repair anything, i turn to self harm. Usually its in some sort of panic attack, and something i feel hard to describe happens.

Most of the time i dont remember what happens when i self harm. I always do the same thing:

1. i begin to have a panic attack about whatever is going on
2. i start to frantically search for something to use (breaking open razors are my favorite but i also use box cutters and scissors)
3. i look in the mirror and i black out.

after this i end up somehow end up back and im okay again. just shaken up by the whole situation. the last time this happened i remember staring into my eyes in the mirror and telling myself “what are you waiting for you stupid bitch” and thats the last thing i recall. bits and pieces of the blood dripping come back to me but most of its a blur. like my body feels its in autopilot and im no longer in control.

its been getting worse and worse. i have had recurrent dreams of me going to a particular spot and killing myself. my last failed attempt to cut myself (this is after i threw away EVERYTHING i used or was tempting, besides my moms razor in her shower because i thought shed be mad. i ended up trying to break it open and i couldnt) i remember nothing after telling myself to “grab your fucking keys and start driving”. I ended up at the spot, a quarry with very tall cliffs. Not truly remembering how i got there. 

Does anyone else go through this in complete distress and panic? I often find myself talking to myself in the mirror just to talk to her and throw insults, but once i begin to self harm its like ive lost all control.",05Jun2020,2

147,"I am bipolar and OCD. I also have PTSD after being sexually and physically abused by an ex who threatened me with guns. My ex became a military man (supposedly a sniper in the army). I can't imagine him roaming the streets on one of these protests. I usually have something I'm obsessing about at any given time, but usually it's something I'm enjoying (like Animal Crossing or Stardew Valley). I can't stop thinking about these protests, the rubber bullets, the shots fired, police brutality, all that. I live very close to downtown. It's not a huge downtown or anything, but we have had some protests here. I haven't heard of anything crazy happening though. Last night my husband and I heard what we both thought were gunshots. He usually assures me that sounds aren't gunshots, but this time he even looked out the window which really freaked me out.

I don't really know if they were gunshots, but it certainly didn't help. I'm shaking, I'm not eating. I threw up a couple days ago and I can't do any of my work (I'm working from home). My auditory hallucinations are slowly creeping back. I can't clean or do anything. I feel paralyzed by this, and I can't see my therapist until next week.

151,"Hi. Let me start off by saying that I'm not a native speaker of the English language, and I do not live in the USA. I am sorry, nevertheless, I hope some of you might read my chaotic introduction.

I am writing this post because I feel a bit lost in my life, even considering all the options to be honest, like never before.

I am a 21 years old male. Everyone calls me lazy. My teachers used to call me lazy, my mother thinks I am extremely lazy. I generally do not clean my room, because the mess does not disturb me. My mother eventually cleans it up. 

I had a period where I dropped out of school and practically did not leave the house for half a year. Nowadays I am, like many young people, supposed to study online(I came back to school and now am enrolled in an academy of sorts).  But I have done at best 5% of studying that was expected of me. I almost never study at home, from a book, which is considered lazy I think. I don't do groceries, I don't do house chores. I feel bad for my mother who I am a burden to. I must admit I am having troubles with myself, especially recently. My mother apparently lost all her faith in me and tells me to get even the worst job so we can split the bills, or else I should pack myself up. Around a year ago a doctor diagnosed me with schizophrenia. Around a week ago I decided that I am not sick, and stopped taking the meds. But boy, if I really am healthy, some strange coincidences have been happening. I have had a few rows with my mother. My disregard for academic commitments has caused me to potentially face many correctional examinations due September. The thing is, I am not stupid. I do stupid things, but I am not stupid. I did relatively well at school considering I did not study. I had been doing well in the academy, up until the quarantine hit. 

You must also know a few things about me. First, I weight 240 pounds at 5'10. I had been very fit all my life, doing all kinds of sports until I started taking meds. 

Secondly, the thing I have been doing for the last few of years in my free time(which I have had a lot of) is computer gaming. I even dream about making a living out of playing, although after some years I am still not good enough. It is safe to say that I am addicted to it, and every single time I tried to ditch games, I failed. The last time was a couple of days ago. 

I am just wondering if the fact that I am clearly not a functional human is out of my control, or is it because I am just lazy. I want to achieve something in life, I have always been ambitious. But right now I am feeling really down. I enjoy participating in the classes a lot, but when it comes to any homework, or  mundane tasks, such as groceries, chores, money transfers, turning in some papers to the academy. I just do not seem to care. For example, i still have not paid for nor received the student's ID, even though almost a year has passed, simply because it would require me to go the bank. I don't even know if I can pass the year without paying for it. And if I don't pass the year, I will have to find a job, which for a lazy person like me who has never seriously worked would be the last thing I'd like to do. In fact I used to have a job after I dropped out of school, at McDonald's. I was doing 6 hour shifts, doing fine making fries. Then they wanted me to learn how to prepare the chicken, I got overwhelmed and did not show up the next day. I guess a week of working is too much for a lazy piece of shit like me.

I also have very poor hygiene whenever I am not leaving the house, which is all the time nowadays.

I think that is all you need to know. I hope you have read it, even though I am not a good writer. What do you think about me? Is there hope for me to achieve something in life? What should I do?",05Jun2020,2
152,"Stop seeking diagnosis in general for that matter. Sure, I understand that labels help some people come to terms with their illness and if that's the case, go ahead and ignore what I'm about to say. Having a diagnosis is not always helpful. It is just as easy for a mental health professional to treat you based on your symptoms. Symptomatic relief is the way forward. You do not need a label for this. 

I'm saying this for a couple of reasons. One being; Once you have a diagnosis, it's there for life, it will follow you around, service to service, professional to professional, most people will not question it. They will attribute all of your behaviours to a condition or disorder, it takes away from your personality, from your natural quirks. It prevents people from getting to know the 'real' you and it often means the root cause of your symptoms is overlooked. You will no longer be a person but a tick box. 

Another reason is the huge stigma that is attached to so many mental health disorders. You may think you want to be diagnosed because you feel it will validate your condition. Sure, it may make you feel validated for a time, like you really are ill and you can accept that, but trust me, in the months and years to follow, you will notice that you are treated differently to everyone else. The doctors you visit will speak to you in a different way, they may be patronising, they may label you attention seeking, they may even put you down as a lost cause. And THAT is extremely invalidating. 

So please, please stop. By all means look for help, you deserve to feel better whatever your problem may be, but don't believe that a label is always going to help, because in the end, it can become a massive hindrance.",05Jun2020,2
153,"I personify my thoughts. Ive talked in my head to myself since i can remember. I dont believe im developing any psychosi, ive always done this, theyre not audible, theyre not telling me to harm anyone, theyre just how i sort out my day to day life. They usually feel as though they originated in my head, and not some outside force. The problem i face today, is, they dont feel like theyre mine anymore. Theyre still thoughts, silent, not hallucinations, ""voices"" or malevolent. But they feel like theyve become personified like that scene in at worlds end. Like a conscience, but instead of me thinking, i should get back to work, they now say, isaac, get back to work. Or isaac, you want to play video games. Should i seek help?",05Jun2020,1
154,"I have tried to convince my mom for years to see a therapist but she refuses. 

Some background: My dad died when I was young, about 17 years ago so I was solely raised by mom for all of my life. My mom was alone for about 7 years until she finally started dating again. 

First boyfriend: Once she met this main her personality drastically changed. She began only liking things he liked and even started speaking like him. It was almost like she was a chameleon. She would send me and my siblings to my grandparents every weekend and would never spend time with us. If I complained about this she would go into hysterics and say that I just want her to be alone. This would happen all the time. She would make me feel guilty for wanting to spend time with her. The person she dated was emotionally abusive toward me and my siblings but my mom never noticed, or she pretended to notice. One day he physically tried to hurt my brother and I completely lost my cool and forced him to leave. After that day she broke up with him and suddenly she would trash him all the time for not treating us right. 

Second boyfriend: Again with the personality change. She would only do things that he liked. She would pretend that she liked things for years even though my siblings and I knew it was a sudden interest. For example she claimed to love hockey, because he liked hockey, even though she had never liked hockey before. He eventually broke it off and she went into hysterics and blamed us for not making an effort to get to know him. 

Third boyfriend: The third man she dated was shortly after the second but they have been in a relationship for 7 years. I actually do like him because he is pretty laid back and easy to get along with. I prefer hanging out alone with him and my siblings than when my mom is there. If my mom is there she likes to put on a whole show. It’s like she suddenly acts like my family is so close even though that is not the case. At home we are not a very emotional family. There is no hugging, but suddenly around him she’s a hugger. 

Lately my mom has been beginning to almost steal my personality. Bands I listen to, she is beginning to listen to. The thing is she claims to have listened to them for years. I buy a new top, she will go out and buy an identical one. It’s just weird things I notice, and don’t think to much of. 

She also has been a pretty compulsive liar my entire life. Anytime she comes home she has a new story to tell, but most of the time they feel so made up. It’s happening more lately and is very concerning.

I have also caught her pretending to talk to people on the phone. When the conversation doesn’t feel normal I check her call log and figure out that there was no one on the other line. 

All of these things have been really concerning over the years and I have begged and pleaded for my mom to see a therapist. It’s hard to have an emotional bond with her because she causes me such bad anxiety anytime I’m around her. 

I’m at my wits end and have been distancing myself from her lately because I can’t be around her without her triggering and anxiety or panic attack. 

How can I convince her to seek mental health assistance?",05Jun2020,1
155,"Hello, this is my first post here

I'm now 17 years old, and when I was 13 so approximately four years ago I started having daily stomach ache. Just a quick background info, i have always been shy and kinda coward, and wanting to behave well, both in social situations and gradewise in school. I didn't eat lost a lot of weight and stayed home a lot from school. Then we ran a lot of tests and whatever to find out that it was nothing physically wrong. Then I started therapy when I was 14/15 and I'm still regularly see him. There was a clear connection between anxiety and a nervous situation resulting in stomach ache. I have had my ups and downs, but generally I have had stomach ache from time to time everyday, but nothing that bothered me so much, around the time of 14-16. I started go to school more and met friends and felt mostly fine when I came home from school.

But this last year in highschool I have had not severe but a lot stronger stomach pain, almost everyday. And it's kind of the only thing I can think of, trying to feel if I'm having any stomach pain. This year I stayed at home a lot in the beginning but then was just about to come back to school, when the pandemic began and we started having distanced school. Going to school and socializing was for me an essential part to have the courage to meet people outside of school.
But now I'm always home doing absolutely nothing, don't tolk to people at all and don't meet anyone even though I sometimes get invited to things. And I have a lot of stomach ache every day, and it's the only thing I can think about. Even though there is no proof of it being a disease and it is mental, I don't meet friends only in fear of having stomach ache when I meet them.

My writing might've been a little messy, but I hope someone understands my situation. I feel like therapy doesn't really help me, and I wonder if anyone has been in a similar situation and maybe have some advice.

166,"Apologies for long post, but I have to unpack. 

So I've smoked on an off for a decade, I have a fairly checkered past with mental health, but it's a fun combo of depression, anxiety, ptsd, and adhd. Mainly adhd though, the rest is fairly situational and comes in waves. Anyway this past month or so I've been making massive strides through meditation and exercise, and from laying off the weed; meditation has been the big one though. After 4 days of not smoking I smoked a few bongs with my housemate and became paranoid and retreated to my room, not totally unusual but normally I'll just play guitar and vibe out pretty quick, not this time. 

I couldn't stop pacing and thinking so I tried exercise, and then I tried to meditate, but that seemed to open the door completely, and my thoughts became completely overbearing. I became obsessive over the idea of ""solving the problem of consciousness"" and was simultaneously in total control over my actions and also not at all. I was in control, but it was a different ""me"". My conscience/subconscious addressed itself to me as ""the haver"", and claimed it was here to stay (The way I explained ""the haver"" to my friend the next day was like, when I tell my arm to move, it moves, when I address a question to myself ""the haver"" responds). 

The next three hours was typing and scribbling, all trying to figure out the nature of how thoughts/actions/internal monologue interact. I've studied both philosophy and psychology at university so this is stuff I think about anyway, but this was different, I was obsessed and could not stop. I felt powerful and in total control. As the high wore off, I sort of came back to myself, but 2 days later my brain still feels stretched out, and last night I had nightmares all night about going insane.

I gave my weed to my housemate and will not be smoking again. I'm afraid to meditate as I don't feel like that door is closed yet, as the questions I had in that state are still nagging at me, and a part of me wants to reach back into that feeling of power and control even though I know that it was pure delusion.

Any insight would be really appreciated as it's left me very very shaken. It's 3 in the morning, and I worry I'm in for another night of nightmares...",05Jun2020,1

170,"Hi, a good friend of mine had a nervous breakdown last month. He basically had crippling anxiety to the point of starving himself/being bed ridden for days, combined with irregular manic episodes and intense mood swings..etc.. Fortunately, we convinced him to reach out to a psychiatrist who diagnosed him with OCD which was exacerbated by the COVID 19 outbreak.

He was prescribed Fluvoxamine and has been taking them for about two weeks now. Things were getting better until he suddenly had an allergic reaction to the meds, with rash breaking out all over his back and arms. The GP recommended him to stop taking Fluvoxamine immediately but his psychiatrist isn't available to prescribe new meds until next Monday, so now his anxiety is back with a vengeance. Due to several external factors combined with the withdrawals, he's now going through an intense manic episode which has gotten very dark and I have reasons to believe he's suicidal.

None of us (his family/support system) are able to be there physically for him right now and we're very worried. We have contacted his one friend in the area to reach out/check in on him but I'm wondering if there are any additional emergancy support/mental health services we could reach out to get him at least through this weekend?

It makes my chest heavy when they tell me that they're going out or are out already, cause I never experienced it in a way most of people in my age did. When I get a chance to go out with more than 1 person I'm very awkward, quiet and people just don't talk to me after one group meeting. I'm very stressed when I have to talk in a group of people, even say a joke or just join a conversation, so I'd rather not talk cause my stress takes up and I mess everything, I don't say exactly what I wanted to say and I'm stuttering. For now I mostly have internet friends that I play games with, recently I've been going out with one girl I meet couple weeks ago, we haven't go out yet with her friends but I think It'll be another relation that'll go down because of how I act - or more like how I don't act at all. I don't think I'm looking for any advice here, just wanted to share this as I'm sitting with a cigarette right now and try to not to cry.

180,"I used to be a pretty hard worker while I was in school. I would have the energy to keep myself working no matter how tough or boring something was. I managed to keep this up all the way until senior year, where, eventually, it felt like something that was there, just suddenly wasn't. It was as if something snapped and changed me as a person completely. 

Where before, I was outgoing and willing to try new things, now i'm cowering in my room, just a few clicks away from applying for college but never bringing myself to finish. About to begin trying to livestream but making new excuses every minute. Trying to learn how to draw and paint better, but always allowing myself to get distracted. Looking at job listings that I KNOW I'm qualified for but never applying.

I can say with certainty that this isn't because of COVID-19; I've been like this for two years now.

I can't bring myself to try anymore. If anyone maybe has some advice, or maybe some resources, it would 100% be appreciated. If you know a good therapist in South-Central PA, USA, I would also appreciate info on them.",05Jun2020,1
181,"I just really needed somewhere to vent to because i’m so tired of bottling everything in, my family doesn’t believe me and I don’t want to talk to my friends about this anymore because i feel as if i’m bothering them.

Before I start, i’d just like to say that i’m 16 years old, and I don’t really know what I feel, since i’ve always been told that it’s nothing, but this doesn’t feel like nothing. 

My parents, they’re immigrants from Mexico, so for them, it was always in a sense, survival of the fittest. My dad grew up in East Los Angeles, Boyle Heights, a community made up of many other latinx members and chicanos, so since he was 18, he began working, trying to make something for himself. 

Meanwhile, my mom was in Mexico, she never made it past elementary school education because she had to provide for her family, and that’s all she ever really knew, provide. 

When my parents met, they got married and moved to the United States, it was a struggle at first, they had 4 kids, and lived in a one bedroom house in California, all they would do is work. Eventually, we all moved to Texas, and we are now living a middle class life and our family is no longer struggling. 

Because of the way they were brought up, and their situations, mental health was never brought up, I think the Latino/Hispanic community has a really bad stigma when it comes to mental health, they think of it as a weakness and something that can be looked past, or something that can go away, due to the fact that all they really knew growing up was to “survive”

Because of this, I never really got to express the way i felt, don’t get me wrong, my childhood was amazing, and so was my pre-teen years.

I started feeling this way my sophomore year of highschool, my freshman year, I was in a really bad place when it came to my friend group and relationships, He would hit and push me sometimes, and he even broke my phone, putting things in my head. That made me change how i felt towards myself, I would wear baggy clothes and hate to look in the mirror. 

Sophomore year, I got out of that situation, i started dressing nice and I made a better friend group, but i still felt this way, i felt hopeless and sad all the time, i was just tired of everything, but i would cover it up by dressing nice and being social, for a while, it worked. 

I am now going to be a junior, and i’m just so tired of everything. I feel so apathetic i suppose, and it’s like my old careless self is gone, I don’t eat, i stay up all night, and i just don’t care for anything, i lost all motivation. I just don’t want to be here anymore. 

My family, they don’t understand, they think I am just being irresponsible and lazy, and I mean, maybe I am, i mean, my parents had a rough life, and my older siblings grew up in a lower class home, meanwhile i’m living my teenage years in a nice middle class home, so why should i be complaining? 

I don’t know how to bring this us to them, whenever i do, they brush it off by saying i just need to clean or eat right. 

I’m so tired of acting like everything is okay, I just want to give up, i don’t know how to bring up this situation anymore, and maybe this isn’t mental illness, i’m not sure, i’m just so tired of keeping things bottled in.",05Jun2020,1

my family say just as horrible stuff and get be so worked up to the point i am punching slapping biting myself and scream till my throat is sore i go for them they go for me and i just dont know what to do i cant live with them anymore but im not in the right state of mind to move and i say i hate them but i dont i really couldn't live without them but i think they hate me now is it my fault is it theres?

186,"Hi, I hope me posting this here isn't inappropriate, but I'm kind of at my wits' end about this.

I have a friend who is in serious denial about her mental state. It's none of my business, maybe, but she could pose a threat to others around her. She's an alcoholic, and has been abusing cannabis and possibly other substances, and is engaged in a lot of scaremongering through her social media presence, and saying a lot of perjurious things about a lot of people, especially if she has any hint that they might disagree with the things she says. She's lashing out and being hurtful now, and if it gets any worse she could make real trouble for people.

Six, seven months ago, she was someone I could be really proud of. She'd quit the drink and been dry for eighteen months or so, had a really great partner who was good for her and encouraged her in all the right ways, and was making good progress with her career (as a secondary school teacher). That ended almost literally overnight.

We never had particularly regular contact, but we were fairly close at one point, and I know that she's capable of a lot. I've been here on the sidelines since new year, and seen her make seriously bad judgments of things like COVID-19 situation and other political events since she started drinking again. Her depression is back, her moods are unstable, and she is simply not a nice person at the moment - and not someone I'd be happy allowing to teach my children.

Again, I've been mostly on the sidelines, engaging only very infrequently.

I'm asking about this here, by the way, because I know she needs help. I know I'm not the person that can give it, but some things have become obvious today that I could do something about - I just don't know if I should.

Basically, most of her friends on Facebook have taken note of how her behaviour has been degrading in recent months, and she's been denying these things most vehemently, saying her mental health is fine and perfect, and attempting to prove otherwise.

Now, earlier on this afternoon, she tagged me in a live broadcast she'd put out on Facebook. I had been going to ignore it, but the frame the picture was frozen at showed a letter, which I was curious to read. So I did - I transcribed it from the image and read it. Essentially, it said that she had been discharged because she hadn't been cooperating or attending meetings or telephone conferences. So then I listened to her reading it - but what she was saying wasn't what the letter said: she was redacting the letter as she read, to make it seem as though she had been discharged because her mental state is fine.

Evidently her mental state is so off-kilter that she can present an obvious lie as though it was the truth and expect to be believed, and yet because she presents as being functional, the authorities can't intervene without her consent and cooperation.

So here's my question - two questions:

* If I contacted her social worker, whose name and phone number were on the letter, and offered the recording of her telling everyone the exact opposite of what the letter says, would it hold any water as proof that she really *needs* help?
* If yes, should I? Or should I edge away quietly and let whatever happens unfold without my intervention?",05Jun2020,1

189,"Hello everyone. First of all, I realise there are much worse things going on than this but I've been struggling with mental health for a few months and would welcome any help.

I am quite an overachiever, always anxious and stressed out about everything I do and say. It is becoming worse and worse, especially when it comes to my uni assignments. It's my first year of uni and I am studying abroad, and due to current situation been living alone for 5 months.

I always get way too in my head when it comes to assignments. During the entire process I become an anxious mess, having multiple mental breakdowns, not getting any rest. I always overthink every single word and information I write down and think of everything I do as not good enough. 

I try to divide my work into smaller parts to make it seem more manageable, however, I lose my mind with every single assignment. I usually get pretty good grades but I drag the process every single time (even if it's a topic I am interested in) knowing it will have such negative effects on my mental health.

Does anyone have any tips on how to make stay calmer during the process or any techniques? Thank you very much!",05Jun2020,1

191,"Hey, I'm a 17 years old male, or rather, a boy. I have few personal problems that bother me. I suffer quietly so I figured that I would at least share my experience with you, Reddit.

First of all, I am anorectic, it is not visible though, I maintain my weight at a healthy level, but as soon as I get over some threshold I adjust my calorie intake accordingly. This mostly happens after I overeat because of the diet before. And so the cycle repeats. This mainly fuels my other problems, because when some friends invite me to hang out, I mostly reject, not because I don't want to go, but because I was in the “overeat part of the cycle” and my weight went up and I think I'm really fat and I don't want my friends to see that.

I'm quite friendly guy, I am not shy. I talk to most of my classmates and even to few people from different classes or schools. It might seem that I know a lot of people, but from my perspective I feel quite lonely. I think that all those friendships are shallow and I don't like that. I don't have a best friend. I feel that mostly I have to make an effort to move the conversations. Is it me? Am I a bad friend?Whats wrong with me?

I am a science and computers guy as well. I have set for myself a goal I want to achieve. After high school I want to go to a certain uni, but I have to pass some exams in order to get enrolled. I feel that I am not that smart. The exams test specific areas of intelligence and I know that I am not good at the spacial intelligence part. I am scared that I wont pass the exams and I will have to live knowing that I am a failure and cant get to a uni. That's the exact reason why I don't want to take an IQ test. What will I do when I find out that I'm dumb?

This is where suicidal thoughts come in. If I am dumb or cant get to a uni, where will be my place in the world. I really want a higher education and I cant imagine myself in a world without one. You see, I don't believe in a god or afterlife. If I don't have a place in the world, I can just kill myself in a snap of fingers. Everyone will die someday. Why bother living a life as a failure if I can “fast forward” to the end of the time and get rid of my feelings as a failure? Why?

PS: Of course this is a throw-away account. I don't even have the courage of a man to post it on my main account. I am a coward and a selfish prick.

TL;DR: I am a lonely, anorectic and possibly dumb mess with suicidal thoughts.",05Jun2020,1

For the past few months i’ve been feeling really really dysmorphic, and now,I just feel so apathetic.

once my mental capacity fucking crashes all i can think about doing, instead of taking a break from places and trying to do something that would help me, i. make multiple accounts, and start making fake realitys in servers. and while i'm doing it, all i can think of is myself and not what i could be doing to other people. people have called me a manipulator, a dirtbag, a ""pity party creator"", and i probably gave some people trust issues while doing it. 

i can't trust my own mind when it comes to making an online account, because for some reason every time i do i end up making more and making fake realities.

i finally realized that this was completely fucked up after a group of people added me to a dm and just started going off at me; asking me if i felt any remorce at all. which, i do. but while i was doing it i didn't which is what really concerns me.

is this some sort of - coping mechanism? or is it a sign of something else? i need some kind of help, i don't want to do this again.

When I am around people, sometimes even a cashier at the grocery store, I obsess over all the dumb things I've said and done (for example, why did it take so long for me to get my debit card out of my wallet, or, do they think I'm giving them a weird look, or was I not friendly enough).   I know that for most of those things,  the person I'm interacting with probably never gave a second thought to.  

Then all my embarrassing memories start flooding my consciousness, dating back to elementary school.  I experience a sort of physical, full body cringe feeling, often accompanied by dizziness and nausea.  If I don't actively distract myself I start to have sort of mild , passive suicidal ideation (FYI I am not suicidal at this time).

213,"This is my first personal post to a forum like this in a really long time. I've always been made fun of and attacked for not having the textbook, loving relationship with my mom. This has made it really difficult to ask for help from anyone, as I'm used to my feelings being rejected. I'm in college now, but I've had this issue for my entire life. I live with my mom--my dad passed when I was young so its been the two of us for a really long time. She works a high-stress job and has always expected me to take school as seriously as she does her work. This means never hanging out with my friends after school if I don't want her calling and texting me a million times. If it were up to her, I'd be chained to a desk doing work 24/7 with a gag in my mouth. In middle school I was bullied to the point of self harm but she never even made an attempt to address the problem, saying that I was only 'being a baby' because I didn't want to do more work. When I told her what I was doing to myself she fully didn't believe me, calling me a pussy. I was 13. This attitude has persisted. Whenever other people are around us, she pretends as if we have this caring relationship when the reality is we really don't. She's good at acting as if it's true, so when we're at dinner with her friends and she says all these things about how hard I work all it does is make my blood boil. She calls me nicknames that she makes up on the spot and sends me looks as if she actually expects me to do the same. I'm not sure how sick in the head she is: i don't know if she actually believes that I love her or if this is all manipulation of me and her friends. The one person who's believed me is our neighbor,  but even she only believed me when I was old enough for her to and when I had been telling her about the abuse for years on end. Whenever people leave the two of us alone, she goes on tirades about how I've failed her. I admit it's not just her that is nasty towards me, now that I'm older I know what she's doing is wrong and I call hr out on it. Probably not in the best ways, but I promise you I would never reciprocate the same energy she's sent my way. I've shown up to school with bruises more times than I can count and no one has ever thought twice about it or said anything to me. She's threatened me with her boyfriends and co-workers, saying that if I don't comply she's gonna get her boyfriend to beat me. People tell me I'm outgoing and confident,  so I'm sure it's easy for people to laugh about the problems I have with my mom, believing that I'm exaggerating to be funny. A couple years ago I posted on socials that I got kicked out of the house on a school night in the middle of winter, and all the responses were ""haha epic"".  I've convinced myself that the only reaction people will have to me talking about my mom issues is either laughter or disgust because that's been 99% of the responses. Whenever I bring up how she's treated me to her face, she denies everything. She even denies me hurting myself, she denies ever hitting me. This has driven me to the point of insanity. I know that she's never going to change so I need to find better ways of handling her. I've never had a conversation with someone who's had a similar experience but I'm hoping posting this will help me with that. I know there're people like me out there, I wish I had an easier time talking about it so that I could find them. I don't want my horrible relationship and experiences with her to carry over into other aspects of my life as I become an adult and move away. I know that my anger towards her won't just go away if I move away and never respond to her, I have to process and heal. If anyone has advice on how to lessen her affect on me and how to process traumatizing childhood events I would appreciate it. Also, if there are more specific forums surrounding familial abuse I'm really looking to find support for this. Thank you",05Jun2020,1
214,"My friend and I, two neuroscience PhD students, found ourselves overwhelmed with all sorts of unfamiliar emotions during this pandemic, stress, loneliness, anger...and we decided to go on a journey to understand what’s going on in our head. We recorded what we learnt in this podcast. [Your Brain in the Time of COVID-19](https://anchor.fm/neuro-junkies)
In the first episode, we talked about stress, why we are so stressed out by uncertainty, the history and physiology of stress, how stress influence our decision making, and how we coped with it.
In the second episode, we talked about loneliness, how we evolved to be this way, social media and pets.
There is a lot going on right now, and we want to tell people that they’re not alone in this, and maybe hopefully offer some relief by chatting and sharing about what’s going on in our mind in a genuine way.
We’d love to hear what you thought about this podcast, and perhaps what you’d like to learn more about. Thank you! :)",05Jun2020,1

My girlfriend went to work and she notices that I was not feeling good. I have been basically home alone in silence with no motivation to try and help myself. My virtual escapes such as social media and video games aren't keeping me at bay. I can't take that one step to help myself because I simply don't want to. I would rather just sit here and be sad. I fear that it will make my roomates and my girlfriend sad to see me so it makes me even more sad just thinking about it.

224,"Hello,

I have been depressed for 3 years now, and was finally feeling better, thinking I was seeing life again like something worth fighting for, but now I have this feeling again;

It is like I have too much tears to contain in my heart, in my head and in my eyes, and that it can flow over at any moment. I feel like crying all the time, and I don't really know why.. 
That feeling just comes for a period of time and then goes away.. but It is like I have no control over my sadness.. I cannot really explain it better, but I was wondering if it was something that was linked to depression, or if someone knows what I am experiencing.. I also cannot find satisfaction in all the things I usually love, even my boyfriend sometimes, even when I try my hardest.
(I have been seeing my boyfriend again, that I hadn't seen since the beginning of quarantine, and my parents don't know about him - it has been 2,5 years - for religious reasons - a major factor in my depression. )

I stopped smoking and drinking about 6 months ago, because i started to get anxiety attacks when i was high and wanted to kill myself when i was drunk.

About 4 months ago the anxiety attacks started to come back. I spoke to my doctor but he just said it was the hash and it would go away soon, but it didn't.

233,"I’ll make it clear now that I used to struggle with depression. I’m going to be a sophomore in college. I struggled with depression throughout high school. When I went to college, I feel as though my depression had significantly decreased or even fully went away. I was happy and such at school. But I would still have episodes. Not really sadness, but I’ve always struggled with concentration and focus. I never really seem to be hungry. I feel as though I get angry and agitated fairly easily. I feel bored very often but I also have very little interest in actually going out and doing something. I sleep A LOT, like almost 12 hours a night. The thing that bothers me the most is my anxiety about the future. I honestly cannot see myself in the future. I can’t picture myself doing anything really. I think about suicide sometimes but I trust myself and know that I wouldn’t do that or want to inflict that pain onto my loved ones. That’s my biggest issue, I have absolutely no idea where my life is going and I just don’t know how much longer I can take that. I’m a psychology major at school so I know most of these are symptoms of depression. And I know that you don’t have to be sad in order to be depressed but I used to struggle with it and I like to think that I overcame it. I still feel the things i listed previously though.

I know there are still restrictions and social distancing rules, etc. but it was just so nice to see PEOPLE (and remember, I HATE being around crowds and people because of a touch of social anxiety). I seriously felt like chatting with total strangers (that is WEIRD x 100 for me) and it was wonderful to have human contact, so to speak, other than my family.

237,"WARNING: VERY LONG


Im in a really scary place right now and this is essentially a final attempt to figure out what to do before I do something terrible. Im a 21 year old male. I wont go into too much detail about my life, but just know that while it wasn't too bad, it was very far from perfect and Ive been emotionally isolated from most people in my life for what feels like forever. In terms of what Im already diagnosed with, I have OCD, depression, ADHD, and probably severe agoraphobia. My self esteem is also catastrophically low. But right now, I can only wonder if theres something much darker at play right now. Basically, for the past year and a half my life has been dominated by an excruciating obsession. This obsession revolved around being a good person. My therapist calls it ""moral scrupulosity"". Its a type of OCD. It means Im absolutely obsessed with having the right morals/beliefs and I constantly ruminate and self analyze and perform internet research to find out if I am or not. But it was through this obsession that I started to wonder if there was something wrong with me. As I peeled back layers of my psyche and dug deeper into my own head, I felt as though I kept stumbling upon more and more red flags. I kept remembering bad things I'd done in the past, and aspects of my personality and worldview that seemed downright awful. Prior to this obsession, I had always envisioned myself as a good person. Someone who was not only kind, but empathetic. However as my obsession continued, a new image began to form. An image of a selfish, pathetic mess of a human being. A borderline delusional individual. I realized my obsession to be a good person had its roots not in a desire to be kind to others, but a desire to feel good about myself and to gain the approval of others. When I obsessed about whether or not I was a sadist, it wasnt out of empathy of those I may hurt, but because a sadist isnt very likeable. I also realized that I wanted to be more than just a ""good"" person. I wanted to be perfect. Perfect looks, perfect personality, perfect interests, perfect beliefs. I wanted people's approval and I wanted it more than anything else. It was the only concrete thing about me. This insatiable appetite for attention and to know that I was one of the good ones. The good people the world, someone above everyone else. In addition, I realized that I really didnt love or feel connected to anyone in my life. Not my friends or my family or my pets. I started to panic. The image of the person I used to be crumbled before my eyes, and from it's remains rose a monstrosity. There were so many things about me that were downright shameful and I couldnt cope with it. I couldnt cope with the idea I was a bad person. It turned me inside out and sent my emotions spiraling. Everything I thought I knew about myself was a lie. I was reduced to nothing but a pile of pitiful flaws loosely taped together into the shape of a person. I had no real personality, no real beliefs. It had all been picked up from those around me in a shallow attempt to become more appealing. I couldn't THINK for myself. I depended on others to tell me literally EVERYTHING about myself. My self hatred skyrocketed. I felt unstable. I couldnt stop thinking, my mind was constantly racing. I needed to prove to myself that I wasnt bad, that I could be redeemed and still be loved. I desperately needed to be loved. My emotions began to constantly pingpong back and forth between intensely hopeful and euphoric highs to catastrophically painful lows. There was no in between. I was stuck between deluding myself into thinking Im capable of becoming better and realizing that I might just be rotten to the core. Everything about me fell into this constant state of flux. I got more self destructive. More judgmental and spiteful towards others. But the worst part was my empathy. At first I thought it had vanished, but I realized that it may not have ever really been there in the first place. I still had empathy, but it felt so... inhibited. Perhaps by own selfishness, or maybe my self hatred. I dont know. All I did know is that I was so... numb towards the suffering of others. Not only that, but where empathy shouldve been I only felt selfishness and hatred. I was truly. beginning to devolve into a miserable little creature. When I asked myself whether or not I was capable of committing despicable acts, time and time again I couldn't truly answer. It began to feel like I didnt care about hurting other people. To me, it felt like the only thing standing between me and committing a felony was my own laziness and self preservation. Thats how it felt, at least. Its like my mind had been split in two. One side was evil. Hateful. A monster. While the other was desperate to go back to the way I was before. To feel loveable again. In order to do that I felt as though I had to become an real, genuine empathetic person. But the more I tried, the more impossible it felt. I felt too selfish, too fixated on feeling good about myself rather than showing genuine love towards anyone. To show love towards other was to sacrifice myself, and to sacrifice myself... something about it was so terrifying. But I couldnt give up. I kept trying to find the good human in me, to pull it out. But nothing seemed to work, and I only got worse. There were plenty of times where I felt so drawn towards accepting my darker self. To cry out: ""Im not the problem, youre all the problem!"" I just wanted to feel whole again. I wanted it so bad. I was starting to get drawn towards darker communities. I never interacted with them, but they lingered in the back of my mind. My mind was always eager to remind me that there was no point in fighting. That it was it was impossible. Heres the thing... I think it's right.

As I am now, Im detatched, depersonalized, horribly insecure, self destructive, depressed, anxious, borderline delusional, and emotionally unstable. Whats worse is I dont even really think I have an identity. Im trying to build a person but it feels like Im missing half the pieces. I hate who I am. I hate how cynical and judgemental I am. I hate being stuck between two emotional extremes. I hate how it feels next to impossible to do anything out of the goodness of my heart. If I dont feel like a good person, a likeable person.. then I dont even see the point of living. I want to be someone else, but people like me... I dont know, man. I truly do feel rotten to my core. I don't think I can change. To me it seems like my only option is to just be awful, or be delusional. I cant cope with the shame of who I am. I just CANT. I have so much to be ashamed of and every day the list only gets longer. The worst part is I know deep down I dont wanna be kind and loving for the sake of it. I just want my precious approval back. To feel good about myself again. I remember when my dad was terribly sick, I wouldnt even let myself feel bad about it because I felt as though I didnt deserve. I could hear a cacophony of laughter in my head. All the people I admired laughing at my suffering.

I'll say this, i definitely do have OCD. I do have intrusive thoughts. I do self analyze myself to hell and back and blow everything out of proportion. But Ive never seen an OCD case where someone is THIS bad. It just makes me think theres something else going on, that OCD isnt the main issue here. It feels like theres genuinely something dark and twisted inside me. Nowadays if Im not bouncing back and forth between depression and euphoria, Im just empty. Numb. Every day Im battling myself and every day I get closer to giving up.",05Jun2020,1

240,"I've had this happen my entire life - from a young age, if I was a good student in a class, my teachers would just intentionally pair me with problematic kids for projects. This isn't just an assumption - I asked a teacher once why she kept pairing me with students that didn't like to do their work, and wanted to spend the whole time in class that we were assigned to work on our projects on goofing off. She told me, ""You just do so well with the work, and other students like you, so I put you in a group with them because I just know you'd be so good with helping!"" Except these students didn't want help, but for me to do the entire project for them. This happened over and over again, and even continued into my adult life. 

I also spent a few years of my life homeless. I worked really hard, with the help of some organizations and very kind strangers (no one ever does this on their own!) and made a life for myself. I had a physically, mentally, and emotionally abusive narcissistic parent (the cause of my homelessness) and have had some pretty rough things happen. Whenever people are going through similar things, and they ask me for my advice, they end up dismissing my help. ""u/CaliBounded, you could do this sort of thing because you're *strong*. Your brain works differently from other people.""

That's the part that throws me into a rage. When people just volunteer me for shit because I seem like I have my life together, or think that I'm well-rounded, they just write off the fact that I got this way through sheer effort. I was not ""born with"" a different brain from others. It makes it seem like I got here from some secret genetic superpower or something when I just tried really hard, and struggled the entire time that I tried. None of what I've accomplished came easy to me, and people just put me on a pedestal and let me assume more responsibility and pressure because ""I'm stronger than I look"" or some stupid bullshit like that. I had a 4.0 in my programming bootcamp (our courses counted for college credit) and I've had teachers go, ""I know the student in your group project is being an asshole, but you're more mature than that - you can get through this."" without offering reprimand or to stop them. Just letting me handle it and piling more onto me because I'm ""so good at"" handling other things.

I've had people cheat on me, lie to me, steal from me, etc. and then have people tell me, ""Listen, you've been through so much - this really is something you'll get past. You've been through so much worse than some man breaking up with you. You're stronger than this."" It's super shitty because no one knows how much anything affects me. No one knows how much (or why) certain things affect me more than others. Just because I escaped an abusive parent doesn't mean that infidelity doesn't hurt. I've even had the very people that have hurt me (the people that have cheated) go, ""Look, I'm sorry, what I did was terrible, but you'll get through this. You've been through worse."" It's like everyone goes, ""This person has had tons of things thrown on their plate in the past and hasn't committed suicide yet - I'm sure I can just add my bullshit too and they'll also be fine.""

It's painful. It's terrible for people to keep doing this. One thing that's helping is me realizing that it's not that I NEED to have tons of people around me - this has made me vulnerable to meeting these types of people that can sense that I feel alone and codependent. It's literally been better to interact with less people and have the few people that I interact with be good people than dealing with several terrible people. Even if I have to be alone, it'd be scary, but I'm not trying to have more bad people enter my life. It's still painful though. I feel like the concept of me having mental health that needs to be maintained is a joke to people.",05Jun2020,1

242,"My life feels stalled. And I suppose it is with COVID. All this time at home has me thinking too much. I haven't known what I've been doing with my life for a while actually. I spend all my time focusing on school because I can't deal with real life. I wasted time at community college. I graduated my with my BA and entered a MA program because I didn't know what to do with my BA. With COVID my research hasn't been able to move forward. I haven't responded to an email from my advisor from a few weeks ago where he asked me what I wanted to do. I failed a class this past semester which is bad for a grad student. I don't think it's going to be offered for another 2 years now and I'm supposed to graduate next Spring. When I'm not doing school stuff, I'm usually trying to fill my time with volunteering and keeping myself busy but that's not happening right now. 


I have no social life, before COVID either. I never really make friends with anyone in my classes. Last year I actually did but since COVID started I haven't really kept in contact with her. I just don't have anything to say. I have a girlfriend too. We've been together for 7 years but most of the time it feels like we're only together because we're used to each other and can't bother to find other people. Her social life is just as bad as mine and we've only had each other for the past 7 years. 


I'm worried it's going to end soon because she hurt me twice in the past few years and I haven't been able to let go of it. I forgave her but I still think about it. She said she was a horrible person for it but idk if I can trust her like I used to. We don't really talk much either. It's been a while since I've had a meaningful conversation with her. Our texts to each other during the day are short. When we spend time together we talk about nothing important or we hang out on our separate devices. I try to tell her about things happening in my life and I think I depress her. She's got her own mental issues and recently became physically ill and says that she's jealous of my life sometimes because I'm doing something with it by going to school. I know she's not happy with her life and I wish I could fix it but I can't and I feel like she's not happy with me either because if she was she wouldn't have hurt me those times. 


I don't have a real relationship with my family either. I barely talk to my older sister and I know I should. I feel like I only matter to my parents when I'm doing things for them. They hate it when I talk back and point out things they do wrong and my mom calls me stupid a lot over little things. My dad says I'm too lazy and I don't show ambition even though he ignores any of my academic achievements. It's only ambition if I'm doing something for him - managing his small company business or managing his real estate. 

I feel so alone most of the time and I wish I had someone who cared for me but I can't bother to put the effort into it. I don't like the life I'm living and I feel like most of the time I'm just going through the motions to get through the day. I'm getting closer and closer to 30 and I don't know what to do. I never expected to live to see 25 to be honest and now I'm past that. I'm wasting my youth in a dead end relationship and I'm too scared to live life so I'm stuck in academia. I just don't know what to do with myself and I'm just so depressed all the time to do anything.",05Jun2020,1
243,"For the last month and a half since my boyfriend had to go back to the country he is from for the duration of this pandemic I've been living with my parents and sleep has become so much more difficult.

It was okay to begin with but now I'm at the point where I dont feel tired because my brain is constantly stressed. I hate it here, I always have, I feel like I have zero autonomy and every day feels like some kind of groundhog torture. I try everything to try to get to sleep but my thoughts wont stop.

It just feels like I'm constantly fighting a battle I cant win.

I feel so alone and miss my boyfriend. We are so good for each others mental health and wellbeing and without him I've lost who I am. I've lost my home, my love and everything I used to do to help my mental health. I have no idea what to do. Iy feels like there's nothing I can.",05Jun2020,1
244,"Basically I have this thing where I put on an extremely extravagant act. Everything I do is geared to make people see me in a certain way. It’s really weird and really hard to describe but I’ve created this new persona I guess you could say. I am unable to stop “acting” and be myself no matter how hard I try. I can’t talk or even type in my “real” voice anymore. 

Anyways I really hope there is someone who can relate and has advice for me.

I find that i am happiest when I make myself as distant as possible with other people and the real world. Things like playing video games, being on the internet, and getting high are when I feel like I don’t have this persona on and I’m a real person.

It’s become really painful for me to be in the real world because I’m not a person there. If I were able to wander the world completely alone then maybe things would be different and less painful for me.

On top of this I feel really distant all the time. I think this is my brains way of saying “I don’t like that stuff get me away”. So I’m never really 100% there because being even 50% there causes me pain.

I digress. I know these symptoms and this line of thinking is very weird and I know few people can relate. Sadly it’s my reality, if there is anyone who can relate you couldn’t possibly imagine how much it would mean if you were to send any advice, personal experiences, or get in touch.",05Jun2020,1
245,"Hi guys,

just as a quick disclaimer, this happened years ago and I‘m in a really good place right now, so this is really just for understanding what happened and no call for help. TW explicit description of some type of breakdown. 

I was going through a lot of stuff that was really traumatic and I was struggling with depression at the time. That day, a very very minor incident happened (failed my driver‘s test due to anxiety, they were all very nice about it) and I just ...physically imploded? 
When I left that car I started crying, but not really, just that there were waterfall-like tears streaming out of my eyes with no sobbing and I couldn’t see anything. This lasted for the entire day. Walking was really really challenging and exhausting physically but I tried to keep it together because I was still in public. 
When I got home I literally fell on the floor and then had to rush to the bathroom and vomit my soul out. After that my entire body started cramping up very painfully. I got very very sensitive to light and my hearing grew worse with everything making a dull pulsing sound and me hearing my blood constantly.
After that I started coughing constantly and feeling like I couldn’t breathe but there was nothing in my throat and I was shaking a lot and got incredibly cold. So I tried to walk to my room but everything was spinning and it took me ages to get up the stairs. I put the heating up and laid down under three blankets (in the beginning of summer) but I was still freezing and shaking and my entire body was just one big blotch of pain, this really dull kind that you feel when you hit a bone on something. At this point I could finally breathe again but only when I laid very still. I couldn’t sleep and I also couldn’t think so I kind of just laid there the entire day but I lost all feeling of time/ hunger/ tiredness. 
When my mom got home she tried to talk to me and I really tried to answer but it took me ages to understand what she was saying because the words didn’t make sense in that moment and my tongue felt really heavy and I had a hard time speaking or remembering any type of words. I remember that at some point a lot of time had passed and I had zoned out entirely and wasn’t sure whether I had gone downstairs to eat or whether I had fallen asleep and I was feeling entirely numb at this point, so I just decided to close my eyes and drifted off eventually.
The next day however, I was obviously still in a bad mental space and felt kind of like what I now feel when I‘m hungover, but other than that I was completely fine and none of the physical symptoms were there anymore.

I was just wondering if someone experienced this or if there’s a name for this? It never happened to me again but it’s deeply ingrained into my memory because this is the trippiest thing I ever went through and I have NO explanation for what on earth was going on with my body.",05Jun2020,1
246,"Insomnia can have a hugely detrimental effect on your mental health, especially if you regularly miss sleep. When we lie awake at night, we can frequently have stressful thoughts that prevent us from relaxing enough to drop off - meditating before bedtime can help to accept and let go of these difficult thoughts and feelings. Reducing caffeine and screen time along with regular mindfulness practice can help you sleep peacefully and have happier days.

247,"Ok so I have always been very attracted to certain types of people, in school it was male teachers at least twice my age or any guy significantly older than me or someone that there would be a lot of scandal around me being with. Now I thought this was pretty normal until the dreams started, I constantly get dreams about these people or people that I trust Assaulting me. But now I get triggered into a panic attack when people stand over me or behind me. My friends have noticed that I jump at the slightest touch or noise and they found it strange that I can't remember anything from my childhood up till the age of about 9. It's just been getting worse over the last year until I had an episode that I can't remember, according to my friends I couldn't speak I was terrified and would only stand in the corner of the room or continually walk around looking over my shoulder and twitch and rub my hands and wrists. I don't know what to do, is this all in my head? Has this been caused by something? Why can't I remember it if it was something that happened? Any advice would be great.",05Jun2020,1

249,"Hear me out.

I'm a mixed race adult (white and black African) so I've dealt with a lot of the issues raised. In fact, I've dealt with more of these issues than I had realised.

I've gone my whole life thinking I had it easy, that racism isn't that prevalent, when in fact, I've just not noticed it because of how ingrained it is in our society. It's also brought up feelings of not belonging anywhere. White people have never seen me as one of them, while in Africa, I'm called white due to a paler complexion. Neither heritage wants me. I'm stuck in the middle, with no where to run, to feel safe. 

I'm not from the States, and I live in a small town so we haven't had any protests here. I'd have to travel to a city to take part, but because of covid and medical conditions (minor, but I have really weak lungs), I haven't been out and taken part.

I don't post on social media much but there's so much pressure to be heard that I share the occasional post. My sister text me saying that she feels she isn't doing enough for the cause, but she lives with our sick mum.

I try to escape through games, but it somehow finds a way to be made aware.

I'm numb. Not the same numb that my depression causes, its a new numb. I'm not numb to myself but to society.

It doesn't help that my boyfriend doesn't believe white privilege is a thing, he's foreign but white. He gets the racial slurs, and understands the racism and supports the movement, but doesn't think he has any privilege.

And don't get me started on colourism. That's a whole other issue that apparently doesn't form BLM. 

This probably didn't make sense, I guess I just needed to vent a little.

Does anyone else feel the same?",05Jun2020,1

The founder of this site resigned as a statement to his daughter. Yet I feel like it's a personal slight because he tells people like me we're less than.

I also get really angry after my friends do something that is really fucking annoying and even my sister. I want to know how to control my anger, so people can assume that I'm calm and a nice person.

256,"Hello people! I hope you’re all safe &amp; sound.
Long story short:
I started using cannabis regularly around summer 2016, I then went on to smoking daily alone &amp; the habit stuck even harder when I got diagnosed with a CML. It’s a cancer that will never truly go, and I guess I have been coping with the symptoms, the diagnose, &amp; my depressive tendencies pre-cml. I want to mention I have been bullied at school at the age of 13/4 by my two best friends and I guess it had affected me a lot since.

When I don’t smoke I’m cranky, I have mood swings and I can’t tolerate anything/one in this world. I tried quitting then I convince myself that there is no point?? I have chemo brain + weed brain, I can’t remember shit, I am slowly regaining my balance through roller skating but my memories, my words, my brain have all slowed down. I still assimilate a lot of things but I’m afraid to be coping with my sadness with weed. At the moment I feel well because I have money, but when I have no money and can’t buy weed I’m miserable.
I’ve been trying to instaure/invest in this that can actively keep me busy when I am broke. Whilst writing this, I definitely firmly believe I’m addicted. I tried to stop soooo many times I cannot 😭 I need help. I stopped smoking with tobacco so that’s already something, I just still see the joint as a reward for going through the day or to go through the day. I pity myself, it’s like I have no self control yet I’m in charge of what I inhale, smh. 
Guys if you have any solution pleaseeee share them, I’m desperate, the cancer is already so much energy, I need to stop losing some through cannabis. 
Love green but I love and miss my absorbing sponge of a brain. I want to lose the daily habit and make it rare / non existent.",05Jun2020,1
