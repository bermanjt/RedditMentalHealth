0,"Thank you to everyone who has sent me voice recordings with your stories so far. It means a lot to have you willing to open yourself up for this documentary aimed at erasing the stigma surrounding men’s mental health. 

My name is Jonny and I’m a filmmaker based in the UK and mental health is something very close to me personally. I have struggled with anxiety in particular for years, it’s something that has really debilitated my life in terms of opportunities and relationships I’ve screwed up, both personally and professionally. I think it’s important to me to use my art to create something to help continue raise awareness in the form of a documentary. 

I’m creating a documentary focusing on mental health in men. I’m looking for any men who have experienced mental health difficulties to share their stories with me over voice recordings.

You will remain anonymous in the film, but for your voice. Your voice recordings will accompany the visuals in the film.

The aim for this film is to try and highlight even further the ever-growing awareness being raised for men’s mental health. Additionally, it is also to try and create a short film that will resonate with men of all ages and backgrounds. I’m hoping that men watching and listening to other men opening up won’t feel alone. It’s also about helping to continue to try destigmatise the notion that men can’t be vulnerable. 

Some questions to consider: What do you feel physically? How has your mental health affected personal and professional relationships? Do you feel supported? Can you at all describe visually what you see/feel in your head? Have you ever felt suicidal - what triggered this?

The voice recordings don’t have to be professional quality, you can just use your phone if you would like.

If anyone has any further questions, please get in touch and thank you to anyone in advance who shares any of their experiences. I hope your words will resonate with other men that are struggling, whilst concurrently helping you by talking.

For those interested, please send your voice recordings to - jonnyvisuals@outlook.com

Thank you.",24May2020,1
1,"from pretty much 5yrs old ish to when i was 15 my father was really strict. We couldn't play at the dinner table. We could play video games in the living room with the volume up if he was sleeping. We couldn't talk when his radio show was on. I wasn't aloud to sing or most especially whistle. 

I (now 17) was just whistling while i was doing the dishes and my mom complimented me on how good my pitch was and how long i could whistle. this triggered a little bit of a whistling contest between me and my brother, which i won.

Common symptoms of autism in adults include:

* **Difficulty interpreting what others are thinking or feeling**: its more like, i understand what others are feeling, just not why they feel that way
* **Trouble interpreting facial expressions, body language, or social cues**: i think i do understand, i just dont know how im supposed to react to them. i dont know boundaries? i think?
* **Difficulty regulating emotion**: not sure what this means
* **Trouble keeping up a conversation**: i dont know how to talk to people, i really only answer their questions
* **Inflection that does not reflect feelings:** again, not sure what this means
* **Difficulty maintaining the natural give-and-take of a conversation; prone to monologues on a favorite subject**:       whenever i notice myself doing this i just stop talking because it seems like no one was listening anyway
* **Tendency to engage in repetitive or routine behaviors:**  i try to keep to the same schedule, but life doesnt always work that way
* **Only participates in a restricted range of activities**: i try to immerse myself in fantasies whenever i can, reading, playing games, and daydreaming when im working
* **Strict consistency to daily routines; outbursts when changes occur**: idk about outbursts, but i do get depressed whenever my routine changes outside of my control
* **Deep knowledge of one particular topic, such as a certain branch of science or industry:** cant i say i do?

4,"To preface this, I am an 18 year old male who has had no previous mental health issues. I have been dealing with this since I first turned 17. Essentially, I feel like I am mentally handicapped. That may seem like an odd choice of words, but that is the best way to describe it. I feel as if I am completely incapable of thinking. Whether that be critical thinking, or creative thinking, if I am being asked to do anything other than complete a mindless task, I just feel completely inept. If you were to ask me to recite information that I’ve memorized, no problem. I can regurgitate whatever bullshit I’ve read somewhere. But anything else, I really feel as if my hands have been tied behind my back. This is coupled with another issue I have been dealing with, and that is memory loss. I often find it hard to think back to a specific moment, and it’s incredibly frustrating because often times the moment in question is at my finger tips, but I just can’t remember for the life of me what it is. This happens constantly. Often times, I experience both of these issues at the same time. For example, if I am having an argument with someone, I find it incredibly difficult to come up with specific examples to support my already weak argument (as a result of my poor critical thinking skills). This is all especially frustrating because I used to be really smart, I had a great memory, and I was pretty creative. I just feel like I have completely forgotten who I am. Granted, there are days where I feel better, but also days where I feel much worse. But now I feel like I’m living in a bubble, as if I am disconnected from everyone else because I just can’t communicate with them the way I used to. Now, I feel self conscious about talking people, arguing, or even writing a fucking essay. I just feel like I can’t do it. I have looked up the symptoms that I have, and I’ve heard what I am experiencing is most akin to brain fog, coupled with social anxiety. TL;DR I feel like I have mentally regressed because I can’t think critically, I’m having memory issues, and as a result of all of that, my social skills have suffered. Please, if any of you guys have any remedies/have experienced something similar to me, please let me know. Will this ever subside?",24May2020,1

6,"Growing up in an Asian family in Europe was tough for me. Being exposed to not only Asian but also western concepts is something that I wished I would never have to go through. 

My parents are immigrants and had it very hard when they were younger. I partially blame them for how I've become. It all began when I was born (sounds cliché I know). In the year I was born my parents had their first restaurant. Good for them, but not so for me. I turned 7 and the restaurant was doing good, but stressful for my parents. This meant that I had to play alone with my Legos or some other toy. My brother didn't really hang out with me and this lead to me not opening up to him and vice versa. The only place that sparks joy, is my nanny's place. Her family treated me as if I was their third child. Her children were like siblings to me. Who'd help me with homework or play with me. It was OK for me to be alone, but now that I'm grown up, I can't. I need people around me. 

But then puberty hits. This is the time I made friends, but also the time I realised I'm not like the others. I found out that I don't like girls the way I ""should"" from society. 
Around the year 2015-16(?) they decided to open their third restaurant. I was old enough to work. I was struggling with being alone and no one to talk to, and to make things worse, my parents (mostly my mum) won't let me hang out with friends. I was angry at her and told her I just wanted a normal life. I wanted to have some quality time with my family. I wanted to feel loved... This lead to me thinking about why I am born, why I am on earth, why I should die because it'll benefit everyone I know. But also being shy and insecure about myself.     When I ask my parents if they let me go and hang out with friends they always come up with the same excuse ""you need to work."", ""So you will go out and have fun while we are working our ass off?"", ""How will we earn money then?"" (I am always there helping, and because I'm their son they don't need to pay me). 

Here is the thing, having that skeleton in the closet means that I can't be who I want to be. I am wearing a mask everyday. Smiling and acting like my life is fine. But deep down inside me I am anxious about every situation that might occur when I'm somewhere. And when those anxious thoughts rise up, I'm thinking about those exact same questions again ""why am I born"", ""why am I on earth"", ... 

And on top of all that, I don't know my family. They live in Asia or in Europe, but my parents won't tell me about their family or visit my family in Europe. 

Will I ever have to guts to come out to my friends? 
Will I be kicked out of the house when I am ""out"" to my parents? If so, will some of my friends give me shelter in their homes until I figure my situation out? 
Will I stop comparing myself to others and accept who I am?
Will I ever be happy?

I am diagnosed with clinical depression, an anxiety disorder, BPD, PTSD, ADD, and have had anorexia on an off and is usually triggered by depressive episodes. 

Currently having an episode of some sort and don’t know how to define it and would like help doing so. I am currently switching between hating on myself, ie, saying I’m worthless, useless, i deserve it, etc. and hyping myself up, ie, saying i deserve the world, I’m going to get whatever the fuck i want, i deserve everything i want, I’m a bad bitch, etc within a matter of seconds going back and forth. I’m doing this out loud to myself as if I’m not really there and I’m two different people, one the real me, the other what i feel is my inner self beating up/hyping up the real me. So I’m talking to myself as if I’m not me in a way? I’m also engaging in self destructive behavior as well as self wellness behavior, ie, self harming, beaming about it, then congratulating myself with a nice bath with candles and incense and bath salts, spoiling myself essentially. Then I’m telling myself I’ll workout and lose that weight I’ve been wanting to lose, while also refusing to eat and planning not to for a while. I’m also changing between fits of laughter and sobbing, sometimes both at the same time. I’m also very obviously super self aware about everything I’m currently doing. It’s confusing me and helping take me out of said episode which is probably due to now instinctual coping mechanisms that I’ve ingrained into myself after years of therapy. I don’t know if I’m currently experiencing a manic episode, a depressive episode, BPD splitting, psychotic episode, or what. Anyone have a clue what’s happening to me rn? What kind of episode am i having? I’m just really confused.",24May2020,1
11,"Hi, 27yo male NEET here.

I haven't properly functioned socially or professionally for roughly 7 years. I am constantly miserable, ashamed of myself, and with how this is going, I'll very likely end up homeless/dead later on in my life because I'm completely unable to take care of myself long term.

I've made little bursts of progress here and there over the years but always seem to fall back into this state, to square one. I even have decent prospects and a solid base to start off of (got a loving family, I'm decently capable whenever I manage to put myself to something, still relatively young, etc.).

And despite being completely conscious of that, and despite suffering intensely from how I am, I am completely unable to bring myself to seek professional help, or even help from the very few people close to me. I get the sentiment that I don't really *want* to get better, despite how much I need it, which obviously adds greatly to the self-loathing.

How do I bring myself to actually want to be happy, instead of indulging in my own misery?",24May2020,1
12,"Lobsters are a very soft animal trapped inside a hard shell. And this shell doesn't expand. So how does the lobster grow? Well when they start to develop and get bigger, the soft body press itself against the shell. The lobster feels uncomfortable and in pain. So they go under a rock, get rid of the shell and make a new one. And they repeat this process Everytime they feel the discomfort. If the lobsters had some kind of doctor or solution for the pain. They wouldn't get out of the shell and grow. And what do i mean with that. It's in this moments of stress, when all hope is gone, that we can grow as humans. So stay strong. You will get out of this situation just like the lobster as a better person. So don't give up.

I have been struggling with depression almost my hole life and i hate it. One day i found out about this sub and started to read many posts. And i don't know why but an impulse started to grow in me. An impulse to help. It's been my way to deal with my problems for the past month. No one should feel like we do. That's why I'm offering emotional support for anyone that don't have someone to talk about it. I'll gladly listen and try to help. I'm not a mental health professional but I'll try my best. Message me if you feel sad, lonely, anxious or anything, please do it no matter who you are. I'll answer as soon as i can. Some people that I've spoken said that there problem wasn't enough for the effort to help. If you have this kind of thoughts please know that this isn't right. Every person is worthy of help and every problem is worthy of a solution. I'm offering with a focus on teens, that's because I'm only 18 and don't have the experience to help with the adult life, but I'll talk to anyone who needs. Always remember, you're worthy, you're important, you matter. Stay strong and don't give up.

13,"Right now I just kinda need to vent, eventhough no one might see this at all.
I’m just tired of always being overlooked by my friends and family. For an example, when I talk no one even hesitates to interrupt or talk over me (I’m not much of a talker anyways so it’s not bc I talk too much)...
I just came home from a nightshift and Sunday (it’s 2.30 am sunday here) is my only free day of the week where I don’t work. All the other days I have 2 jobs, one full time (in a pre school) and one where I take evening shifts after working in the preschool during the day (a cafe/bar).
I still live at home (I’m 20) with my parents and brother. I’m exhausted after a busy night shift, and now that I came home, my brother is throwing a party with lots of drunk friends and music with such a loud bass I can feel and hear it in my room.
I asked him nicely to turn it down but he just scoffed and said no.
I’m so tired but it’s so loud I can’t sleep and now I’m just sitting in my bed crying from exhaustion. And now I’ll probably waste my free day sleeping, because I won’t fall asleep anytime soon...

21,"Confession: I tried to intervene in a fight between mom and dad, but I only ended up escalating it because I couldn't keep my anger in check. 

This lockdown's been going on for over 2 months now, and every day that passes by has led me to become more and more uncomfortable being stuck in the house with my parents. Obviously, being confined to one place with the same people makes everyone a bit stir crazy, and there are some days where people are driven up the walls. However, I feel like recently, that's been amplified in my household.

My mom stays home all day and my dad gets home from work very early, so they're around each other quite often. Now, FYI, their relationship has never been healthy. Ever since I was a kid, I'd always see the two of them fighting, and I can recall more than my fair share of times seeing them swearing at each other like sailors, having hour long shouting matches, and even getting physical with one another. I can still vividly remember my mom, my brother, and I leaving our house to go stay at her friend's place for the weekend, because the fights were just that bad. I remember the looks of sadness and confusion, as my younger brother (who's about 5 years younger than me; he was just 5 at the time) and I sniffled away our tears, wondering why our parents hated each other's guts, and why dad would ever dare to lay a hand on mom in the first place.

Seeing that this was a recurring problem, the seeds of anger were planted in me, since I was at a young age. It started with resentment towards my parents; I was resentful because they would always have to resort to personal attacks and shouting matches all the time, and I absolutely HATED seeing it. I couldn't do anything but yell at them to stop, because young me couldn't understand the underlying reasons for fighting. But alas, my efforts were futile.

Anyway, I'd let my anger fester and bubble inside me for almost 10 years (for reference, I turned 20 this year). My parents were never the type of people to openly talk about mental health, or their emotions in general. My attempts to question my parents about their arguments were simply met with, ""You will understand when you get married"", or, ""It's not in your place to ask, so don't even worry about it."" If I couldn't trust them to at least have an open discussion about this, then I surely couldn't trust them to talk about my other mental struggles. Growing up, I really felt like I had no outlet to vent my feelings. Instead, I would spend hours gaming or watching TV as an escape, but this only masked the problems; it didn't erase them. And so, these feelings were always there; they carried over for so long until today, when they manifested from resentment to unfettered rage.

Earlier this afternoon, my mom and dad were fiercely arguing once again. It was about the same bullshit that they've always been arguing about for the last decade or so. Basically, my mom didn't like the idea of my dad going out and drinking EVERY. SINGLE. FUCKING. WEEKEND, and coming home at 2 or 3 am piss drunk. Every time this gets brought up, dad gets incredibly defensive, and instead of acknowledging this behavior was wrong and fixing it, he resorts to his personal attacks. My mom, of course, would not have this, and she starts yelling back at him. Keep in mind, she is incredibly hot headed and short fused, a trait that I would also come to inherit (after all, we do become the products of our environment). I was simply minding my own business in the living room and I hear the shouting match get louder and more intense. At this point, something inside me snaps. I throw a chair across the living room and yell at them, telling them that I've had enough of their constant fighting. 

Suddenly, my dad turns towards me, and starts cursing me out in Korean, then accuses me of disrespecting him because I'd tried to intervene. He basically says something along the lines of ""you fucker, are you trying to start shit with me?"". At this point, I am livid. My emotions were uncontrolled and unchecked. It's like I somehow reverted back to my teenage years, when I was perpetually angry and angsty. 6 years of growth and maturing, all gone down the drain. My dad makes a fist at me and threatens to punch me. I, trying to defend myself, grab his wrist and look him in the eye with an ice cold glare. He breaks free and continues to egg me on, daring me to fight him. So I throw off my glasses and walk up to him to give him a piece of my mind. Then, my mom and my brother get involved, and the four of us get into this interlocked strangling match, as mom and bro try to prevent an all out brawl from escalating. 

After 20 minutes of struggling and shouting at the top of my lungs, I give up. I don't want to fight. I also realize that what i'm doing is extremely unproductive and dangerous and immature. Feeling horrible for what I've done, I run upstairs to my room like an edgy teenager (I know I'm such a loser right) to isolate and cool off. Later, my dad accuses me of wanting to self harm, and I don't deny this, as I genuinely believed that because of my actions, I have failed as a son, a brother, and a person. Therefore, I thought that by not being in the family anymore, that they would be better off, as there would be nothing else to create another situation like this ever again. My actions caused a bad situation to become worse. Despite my good intentions, I'd made a mountain out of a molehill, and I was so wracked with guilt.

Hiya! My name's CJ. I'm an aspiring writer and have a huge interest in mental health. I've been working on an informational book (yet to be named)  that more or less encapsulates dozens of known and some unknown mental  health/behavioral or otherwise relevant disorders and disabilities that  affect how the mind perceives things. 

I need people who are willing to have interviews about  disorders/conditions that they may be experiencing. It's a simple  10-question text interview. The purpose of the interview is to provide a  first-person perspective on whatever topic the consumer/reader may be  looking at. Elect anyone you want for it, just shoot me a DM if you're  interested! Topics available for interview are here. Some topics are  taken but I'm always open to more interviewees : [https://pastebin.com/MGMMkeDh](https://pastebin.com/MGMMkeDh)

I  hope to hear from some of you! Stay strong and remember to take care of  yourself. You're not alone and deserve to have people around you who  care. 🖤",24May2020,1
30,"I normally don't remember my dreams, but once in a while I will have an absolutely horrifying nightmare right before I wake up. They usually involve me either being badly hurt or being in a situationwhere I'm panicking. In one of them, my boyfriend I were in the back of a car and were both shot. In another, I was being chased through my house by a man who was trying to kill me. Last night, I think I had the worst one so far, which I think is too graphic to describe here but it was enough to freak me out for an entire day.

I think these dreams might be the result of anxiety or panic disorder because right before I wake up during a nightmare, it feels like I'm having a panic attack. It doesn't help that I have a tendency to google dream interpretations, and sometimes these can be really scary. I've been on the verge of a panic attack all day. I just really want to stop having these horrible violent dreams. Is this likely to be related to anxiety? And what can I do to stop having such intense nightmares?",24May2020,1
31,"When there were times that I remembered to take my sleep pills, I had times \[only when I could finally start to and end my sleep\] where it's.

I always had to take the pills. I can't sleep and would stay up for days and days, but I feel like I'm in a perfect condition. Actually though, I've always felt my best staying up. When I stay up, I could even feel like my best (when I had sleep).

I've become such a night owl that being a morning person was never in book (not that I always sleep longer but it happens half-half). I'd always preferred to just stay up, but I had to be responsible so I wouldn't be paranoid about my parents parenting me all over again because of it. I don't even want them to see this post, though it's only to ask what the hell is going on.  


But now, the main point: every time right I would wake up or sleep, I'd feel like my body is taking complete control, that I'll fly and shake, shutting my eyes \[only right when I sleep\] (always have been good combating the eye shutting), can't breathe, noises that aren't familiar, sounds all distorted and are heard, I would see some red \[for when I start to sleep: happens if I was ever to go close to closing my eyes), feel new things are felt like really hot heat and someone touching and grasping me hard, smell is odd, and I couldn't move my body because I'll always have this super, ""relaxing"" exhaustion (like being relaxed from trying to struggle and get out of bed, but I enjoyed the exhaustion throughout).  


Now I wanted to give in to whatever was closing my eyes. When I did at bedtime, I was greeted with disgusting, foul smell that smelled like dead animals lying in a pile, having the whole place all red and what I assumed to be bloody and some sort of 2D circle with lines in it (also has felt that there was fire everywhere), I couldn't move, nor could I speak, felt as someone was killing me by opening my left leg, eating my both toes, and eating my left arm (also felt fire burning on me), I couldn't scream, I couldn't breath at all, it felt so hot, I heard growls, distorted noises, chewing noises, and some other people screams, felt more aware and threatened than I usually am. I woke up.  


Everything I felt was real and I had no idea where I was or what happened. I remembered though that this has been happening to me since I was 3, but I always most of the time resist my eyes closing before I was probably trapped, maybe?  


My only logical explanation is that I was fully awake (how I was able to see my room, kind of) but in a sleeping body (since I couldn't move) by sleeping first then waking up after on accident, dreaming my usual dreams, like that one, though idk if it's actually a dream or not. That experience, however, was so realistic + I felt I could've died.  


Who has this similar experience? (Explanation is wanted, thanks!) The weird thing is, I'm pretty sure one of the person in that realistic dream or whatever said, or kind of predicted, that I was going to pass the job (buying and reselling) all done by approval and said that exact money I was going to start out with doing it: 101.85$. Ooo, scary, not really. I don't know why he said the specific number, but, damn, it got me thinking. I had initially also though that if the specific number told was just a fake memory from that situation or something?? I'd rather like to think it's bullshit too!

&amp;#x200B;

I suffered a TBI when I was 17, 14, almost 15 years ago at this point and as a result of that I've been having to fight with short term memory loss ever since. To say that it's been a point of frustration damn near everyday for the last 14/15 years would be an understatement. I think that I've done pretty well in spite of it in that I've been able to hold down jobs (although I've managed to get more that haven't worked out because of this problem) and am relatively ""normal"" otherwise. I've been told by multiple employers and new people that I've managed to meet (honestly not very many in the last 15 years) that from just talking to me that they would have never thought that anything like that had happened. I'm a reasonably intelligent and articulate person ins spite of my crappy short term memory which I am proud of but that just does more to hide my struggles. My memory has improved **a lot** over the years and I don't mean to downplay that at all but it's still something that I have to fight with every goddamn day. The girl that I'm dating right now and that I really love and hope that I get to be with for a longtime happens to work in the mental health field in a peer support capacity (sorry I *think* that her official title is ""Peer Support Leader"" but I'm not 100% sure :\\ ) is very supportive and understanding if/when I forget things and I am eternally grateful to her for it but I still feel like shit every time that I notice it. For example, she has a young teenage daughter whom I get along with just fine but I feel like absolute shit whenever she (my girlfriend) tells me something about her, something that I feel like anyone else would have no problem remembering, and I forget it within 15-20 minutes of her telling me, She knows that I feel this way because I've told her and apologized for it many times and she says that she understands but I honestly don't feel like there is anyway that she really could even with her background in mental health. I **hate** that she has to repeat things sometimes and that no matter how hard I try I'm just not able to remember somethings. I've been told to just write things down or put it in my phone as a reminder (I do this sometimes if it's something for work for example)  if I *really* need to remember them for years which is an obvious solution but my issue with that has always been that it's so unnatural and makes me feel like I am giving in to/ being defeated by this ""disability"" (I **VERY** adamantly refuse to use that term to describe myself) that I have. At the end of the day I just want my goddamn memory to just function like a more normal memory without this impairment weighing me down constantly! I know that no one's memory is perfect and inevitably we all forget things sometimes but I constantly feel like I am forgetting a sizable amount more than other people. I know that there aren't any magic fixes and yes years ago I even tried a low dosage medication for Alzheimer's disease patients which I think might have helped a little in the more immediate aftermath of the accident but even my doctors agreed that it had probably done all it could do after a while and that it wasn't good for me to be on it longterm. I am at such a loss as far as any possible future treatment options and have basically resigned myself to the fact that the shitty memory that I have now is as good as it will ever be. If anyone has **any** possible ideas for more treatment options I would appreciate any ideas. I am just so burnt out and tired of dealing with this problem day in and day out.

50,"Hi everyone. I’m posting here to get some feedback about my current situation and maybe some validation that I am not alone with my current feelings surrounding therapy. 

I (21 F) have previously attended one on one therapy sessions for about two years to help me cope with my anxiety disorder and depression. About a year ago I stopped going to therapy because I felt like I had these issues under control, and I still feel that way. 

Over the past few months, a lot of bad things have happened to and within my family. These events have caused both my mother and my sister to begin going to therapy sessions to help them cope with everything that has happened and is still happening to us. I feel like out of all of us, I have handled our situation the best due to my prior experiences in therapy. But I still feel as though I would benefit from seeking therapy again for this new issue. 

The only problem is, I dread having to talk about what’s happening to our family and having to explain the whole situation to anyone, including a therapist. We have had to tell our story so many times and in so many different connotations that even thinking about recounting anything that has happened to me and my family fills me with dread. 
When I was going to therapy before, I used to love telling my therapist about my week and the problems I was facing and hearing her feedback and advice. Now I feel that telling a therapist all about my current issues will feel more like a chore. I do believe that I could benefit from therapy because of our intense situation, but just knowing that I would have to tell the long story yet again makes me want to crawl into bed and stay there all day. 

Has anyone had a similar feeling regarding therapy? Do you think I should go back to therapy?",24May2020,1

53,"Currently I'm a junior in high school and because of the virus school has moved online. It's been a serious struggle for me but school always has been. It caused me massive anxiety in elementary school and middle school because of a lot of different things. I always did well but it was at the expense of my mental health. When I got to high school I stopped caring. My depression was getting bad and I would go through periods of being suicidal for the next three years. School made my issues so much worse and I'm pretty sure I've never been suicidal during summer break. My mental health made focusing on school feel impossible and having the pressure of it made me feel like a failure. I've been told I'm lazy and a piece of shit by many people, including my own family.

I don't do well in school but I excel in any job I have. I'm known as hardworking and reliable. But that doesn't matter because homework and grades are what determine my worth apparently. 

Anyway, since quarantine started I've been working a lot on myself. I'm still depressed but my anxiety is so much better and I feel like a new person. I realized my worth and have been discovering who I truly am. Unfortunately I lost my school friends during this process but I know it's for the best. I've changed so much that I know I'm going to be harassed and alone for my senior year. Mainly though I'm just so afraid of losing the progress I've made on myself. I'm still in a fragile state and sometimes feel like I'm slipping back. I finally feel like I'm on the right path in life and I don't want to go back.

I really want to drop out and live the way I want to. The job I want requires no prior education and the training required is $3000 at most. It has a good outlook and I know at first it won't be easy but I'll do everything I need to. I still want to get my GED first though just in case I change my mind about careers.

I'm not a victim and I know that there are things I could've done differently in high school but I don't think going back is the right choice for me. I haven't decided officially yet though and haven't told my parents. 

I know high school dropouts are viewed pretty negatively and sometimes for good reason. I just really wanted to get this off my chest though",24May2020,1
54,"I feel like I did at 20, doing nothing in particular with life except now I have a desire to change, better myself. The main way society pushes me to do so is to get back into education, get a diploma or better yet a degree and look for a career. But I rent my flat privately and couldn't possibly afford to lose my job or go part time for college or uni so that plan is out of the window.

So 7 years later with this newfound desire to change I'm trying to work out what that is. I'm drawn to lyrics from the song 46+2 by Tool. The theme of this song is change through understanding and acceptance of your ""shadow"" or ""Id"", a theory in Jungian psychology representing the aspects of yourself that are unrecognised by your ego or conscious self. Perhaps because they're unpalatable.

The song describes the search for a complete understanding of yourself to reach the next stage of your evolution and enlightenment. Iterating that in order to truly change you have to fully understand and accept yourself as you are.

This has deeply affected my own understanding of what it means to change. Much like planning a journey you have to know where you are and where you want to be in order to get there.

The difficulty I see in this is perception. My understanding of anything is entirely at the mercy of my ability to perceive the subject matter. The ""me"" I know and the ""me"" you know could be two completely different people occupying the same space simply due to my in-built biases or safety mechanisms. Maybe it would hurt too much to understand some of my own negative character traits and as such I just don't see them? 

So is the real ""me"" some amalgamation somewhere between the various points of my own and others understanding of me? How do I pinpoint that and get to it to truly understand?

Maybe this has been exacerbated by the current situation of lockdown amidst Covid-19, maybe it's been building up for years in the background. I don't know.

I want to change, or maybe I just want to feel like I've changed, to be better than I am now. But I don't know how to get there because I'm still trying to work out where I am.",24May2020,1

58,"I should preface this with the statement that throughout my life, there are very few people I've connected with. I guess I'm just not a person who finds themselves emotionally compatible with many people to form a close friendship. I should also mention that in early-mid 2015, I was in my third year of college and basically had a falling out with everyone I was friends with at the university. For the next four or so years I was pretty much completely socially isolated IRL, only having a close friendship with a couple of people online (which is nice but doesn't feel fully ""real"" I guess) and my immediate family. 

In July of last year, I made a close friend. I met her through a dating app but neither of us were interested in dating each other, but we still wanted to be close friends because she wanted to help me with some shit I was going through and we turned out to have a lot in common. We spent the next month or two becoming closer and closer, and then after that for like the next two months we hung out close to almost every weekend, and texted each other every day, throughout the day most of the time. Never before in my life had I ever been that close with someone. 

Then, in mid-November last year, something happened to my friend. She met someone on the dating app who she fell in love with. Quickly this consumed all of her time and energy. My friend is someone who has a hard time maintaining multiple close relationships because of how much energy she puts into one. The person she entered a relationship with has even MORE in common with her than her and I do, they share all of their hobbies and are extremely compatible in every way. Which is incredibly sweet and I'm so happy for her. 

Ever since then, we slowly started texting less and less. We've only hung out twice since she met her, once was because of plans we had already made, and once in February we went out for lunch together. I think there were vague plans to hang out again after that which never happened, and then of course quarantine hit. Within their first month or two of dating I inquired about hanging out a few times and they were busy basically every weekend, so eventually I stopped and figured she'd just let me know when she's free.

Once my friend got into a relationship with this person, I was initially worried it would negatively impact our ability to hang out, but within a week or two I got over it because I realized how good they were for each other. But last night and this morning we were texting each other and all of a sudden I got sad, because I realized how little we've texted since quarantine started. And then suddenly all of those feelings about being sad when my friend started her relationship came rushing back. 

Since we hadn't been able to hang out much, I started meeting other people and making other friends. I even started a romantic relationship myself (which has been on kind of a break for a few months, so most of the time since it started, due to some pretty severe mental health issues my partner is working through). But I realized that I don't have a connection with any of those people like the one I had with my friend, which is part of why most of those friendships also kind of fell by the wayside. I'll never make a friend like her again because there's no one else in the world like her, she's a one of a kind person. 

Those two months where we hung out almost every weekend were, in retrospect, a kind of magical time in my life. It was the only time since high school where I had something I was consistently looking forward to every day, and it was the only time since my childhood I felt like I knew someone I could say anything to and be on the same page with. I retroactively feel worse about it too because in retrospect the reason my friend wanted to hang out every weekend was clearly because she was lonely and had a void in her life she needed to fill, and well, I filled that void before she met her girlfriend. Which I'm okay with. But it was clear during that time she was working through a lot of emotional pain and I don't know if I helped her as much as she helped me. It also didn't sink in until just now that I just haven't been anywhere near as happy these past few months. 

So, I dunno. We'll probably hang out again after covid is over. One thing that helped me get over the fact that I we won't be as close was that we can still be friends, and her girlfriend sounds like someone I could be good friends with as well (and what little time I've spent with her seems to corroborate that). But we just don't seem close anymore, and at this point the amount of time it's been since we regularly hung out with each other is much longer than the actual duration of time we hung out with each other for.",24May2020,1

61,"Over the past year and a half, I (22f) have noticed that my memory has gotten absolutely awful. My family used to say I had the memory of an elephant, but now I have a noticeable difference in my ability to recall info. 

I have also noticed that lately I have a very short attention span. When people talk to me I immediately start thinking of other things or get distracted, instead of intently listening to them. My bf has called me out on it recently.

I have also struggled with saying the right words recently. Mid conversation I will go to say a certain word and end up saying something that has nothing to do with the topic. Sometimes it will take me 2-3 tries to get the word right. Like today for example, I went to say “cow” but instead I said “dog I mean cat, I mean cow”. 

All of this is super terrifying. I have never had these problems or at least noticed them until recently. What could be the problem or what should I do?",24May2020,1

64,"Few trigger warnings to start with. **TW: MENTIONS OF CSA, GROOMING, UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS, SUICIDAL IDEATION, PAST SELF HARM/CURRENT URGES, CHRONIC ILLNESS, NARCISSISM** 

Hey, so. I’m fairly young— I’m an 18 year old guy— but I can’t help but feel like my life is going nowhere but down. I have too many issues to begin to list, but. I’ll try, I guess. 

I have chronic health issues. Had to leave school 2 1/2 years ago bc of it, tho I didn’t stop trying to go back until recently. Working on getting my GED. Doctors don’t know what’s wrong, but it’s getting worse. Currently sick and miserable. 

Might’ve been molested as a kid. I was older than six, younger than nine. Cousin of mine came forward about the guy, months after I started having nightmares about him. This happened a few years ago. What I do remember means I was absolutely groomed for it, even if nothing else happened. Told my mom. She... it didn’t go over well. 

Bad relationship with my parents. I’m trans, chronically ill, and overall apparently a pain. My mom has a bad relationship with her mom, and the falling out they had when I was 12 has shaped most of my adolescence. Also, think my mom *might* be a covert narcissist. Not set on it. Just. Some of the signs (too many, if you ask me) fit her to a T. 

Bad relationship with friends. Joined an online server a few months before turning 17. Ended up getting groomed. Had to cut a few people out of my life, people dropped me bc I was sick and they didn’t wanna make an effort (and didn’t respond to me making an effort), and that leads me to today’s breaking point. 

Friend of mine said some nasty things when I came to them with a concern regarding our dynamics and stuff. Followed all my therapist’s advice for non confrontational language, but I guess it didn’t work. Another friend told me that she had a point. It wasn’t about what she said. Just how she said it. But hey, I’m a guy, so clearly I’m in the wrong, right? Her blasting at me and being sarcastic and overall disrespectful as hell is “just how she is”, but me blocking her after de-escalation didn’t work and I started to break down is apparently too far. Idk. Maybe it is.

I tried to post something here yesterday, something in a more lighthearted tone, but it felt like talking to the void. I’m just... I’m tired. I’m so tired. I have so much going on, all the time, and no place to rest. My meds aren’t helping. Therapy isn’t helping. 

I’m falling apart.",24May2020,1

68,"Recently, I’ve had a flare up of an intrusive thought that bothered me in the past. I will not disclose what it is, but I will say that it nearly wrecked me. I thought I was over it, but maybe quarantine is getting to me. I can’t tell if it is just an intrusive thought doing what intrusive thoughts do best, or if it is a real thought that I am just too ashamed too accept. 

It feels like there’s constantly a weight on my chest. I try to distract myself from the thought but it’s always there in the back of my mind. I hate the fact that I can’t be alone with my thoughts, because if I am alone with them, I think I’ll puke. It’s gotten to the point where I’ve started self harming again, after being clean for months. 

I’m new to this subreddit, so I’m not really sure if it’s appropriate to ask for advice here, but does anyone know how to deal with severe intrusive thoughts? How do I tell if they are real thoughts, or if my mind is playing tricks on me?",24May2020,1
69,"Therapists are helpful, I know. My mom is a therapist and I’ve seen it do wonders for people. 
My issue is that I understand everything about myself - my insecurities, my faults, my trauma and all of my issues and relationships are resolved in my book, nothing bothers me and my life seems to be going good. When bad things happen, I know exactly why they happened and how to solve the issue. 

But 

I’m still depressed. I still have anxiety, I am still in a lot of pain. No matter how well I understand what I’m going through, it doesn’t make it easier and I can’t stop how I feel. My mental and emotional state is completely disconnected from my rational mind. Talking it out doesn’t help either, I have people to talk to, but I end up just feeling worse afterwards.

Recently my boyfriend and I had a bad argument that started due to my declining mental health. He then said that I need to talk to somebody and I should consider a therapist. I agreed with him, but as I thought about it, I didn’t really see the benefits, unless they’ll give me some kind of medication. Like I said, I understand why my mental health is at it’s lowest, talking things out doesn’t help and nothing I do seems to work.

71,"Hello everybody, I have been feeling some things for quite a while now and I have some questions that I'm hoping somebody will be able to answer. I have been having feelings of disconnection from people (everybody I interact with, even my family and that part makes me really sad because I want to be present with them) and from life at random points for the last few years. I think I feel emotions but they are either weak or they are not there at all and I'm just making them up because I think that's what I'm supposed to feel. I feel like I'm just going through the motions of life on autopilot. So I guess my questions are: as the title states, is something wrong with me? Are these things normal? How can I learn how to be happy?

73,"Because there is a 50/50 chance I delete this post any way, I'll get right to it.

I'm in my late 20s. I have mental health issues, I think that much is obvious. I am on SRIs, I have visited the psych ward in the hospital once, I have done incredibly rash things at times, mostly during a hangover. 

I currently got fired from my job. I burned out. I woke up Thursday morning, hungover, and could not answer the phone. I no called no showed at work. I fucked up.  
Before this hungover regret, while sober, I expressed a couple of times to Mom that work was getting to me. I wanted to quit. I just couldn't get anything lined up in time. 

I worked full-time and I attended college full-time. To graduate in the spring, I took 18 credit hours in the fall and the spring semester. I was able to graduate. My grades was great, 3.5 gpa. I thought it would be easier once school stopped, but I still couldn't catch up in work. I would stay awake sometimes at night, thinking about the workload ahead of me the next day or week. 

Ive had many mentally exhausting conversations the past few days, mostly while inebriated. I finally spoke to a therapist, I have another appointment Tuesday. 

I never talked about my past trauma to my friends. My dad left my life when I was 10. My mom gave him a ultimatum about drug dealing in front of his kids. Basically, he chose to sell drugs. He very rarely saw his kids, despite being a stone toss away. My Step-dad was arrested on drug charges while I was in middle school. I remember coming home from school while two detectives, I presume, took him away with a Black cloth over his wrists. 

I have had many conversations with my close friends revealing my past for the first time. Talking about the various flashpoints of my life. Overall, I think there were more positive than negative. But I had never disclosed my past to my friends.

I feel like a fraud. I feel like a fuck-up. I feel like a drunk. I'm struggling to believe that I have  legitimate reason for concern. I know my workload was alot, but I don't know how much it affected me
 I think my past was traumatic, but I have so much self-doubt about it. I really don't know how much it really affected me and would appreciate any input

76,"A little back story before going into detail. I've had a hard time keeping a since 2018. Every job I would get I would quit after about two or three weeks. 
After my last one I started noticing a pattern that the constant noise and the constant go go go  nature of the jobs was what kept making get back into my bad mental state. 

Cut to now, I've had a job for a little over a month. It's night shift at a gas station. It's really simple, easy, and I'm by myself most of the time. It started out great. Best of all I only work three days then I get 4-5 days off. 
I worked a few hours during day shift just for training and even that was totally fine, nothing triggered that part in my brain to make me go back into a bad mental state. 

Well a few nights ago just randomly I started having bad thoughts, suicidal thoughts, won't really go into detail because I don't really feel it's necessary. 
I decided instead of going in the third night of my week I would call out and take a mental health day. Since it would have been my last day for that week I didn't have to go back in for four days. The week prior I also had a four day weekend. 
Well after calling out and getting those days off to myself I'm feeling better, the thoughts are gone. The problem now is that I know they'll eventually come back wether that be in a few days, another two week or whatever and I can't keep calling out. 

I need a job, would it be smart to try to get my schedule shortened? 

I'm seeing my therapist on Tuesday and I'm definitely going to be talking to her about this.",24May2020,1
77,"Dear all,

I am twenty-three years old and have pretty much left the family coop so to say. So has my 25-year-old sister. This post isn't about our mental health, as instable as I am lol, but rather my little brother (18) and mothers. (also my first post ever). 

About four years ago my little brother was diagnosed with POL G, a severe mitochondrial disease turning to muscle degeneration. He has spent the past four years with my highly affected parents as my sister and I tried to become adults. We have been great to them but as my mother's nights are consumed with caring for him and my father still works a lot they have quite a lonely codependency. My brother is very emotionally intelligent but stunted at about a 14-year-olds mental age in some regards but not others. He is the strongest person I know and has been an absolute trooper. Although as he grows and hasn't attended school in years he feels very uncomfortable around his age group. My mother due to her insane pressure of learning how to nurse and constantly deal with excrement and such is mentally exhausted. I don't want to make this too long but I've tried coming up with countless ideas on activities that can help them find some light in their life. This quarantine actually hasn't been all bad for our family as I have been back with them for months and am kind of the jester of the family. Nonetheless there are only so many jokes I can make before it goes from funny to annoying. 

So basically my brother is very much confined to our home anyway in his life as his muscles degenerate and he loses his balance and ability to enjoy any kind of freedom without support. He has been stuck doing lego and playing video games for years now and my mother only finds peace in occasional naps and Russian literature. I am making life decisions on how to navigate returning home and living in proximity with them and learning how to nurse but I was just wondering if anyone had ANY ideas of activities in the house which can help my mother and especially my little brother (re)find purposefulness as he views himself as a burden and useless weight the more his disease progresses. 

I don't really know what I'm asking and as I said this is my first Reddit post so maybe someone can give me some advice?

Much love

81,"In my first session, I discussed what I've been through and what I'm still currently putting up with. I talked about my trauma and how it led into having PTSD symptoms. Discussed about my past suicide ideations and hospitalizations. We discussed about how I was seeing a therapist during my time in the military for depression and after I left the military service, that depression flared up and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. I've been on meds before and never really liked it but would try it if I could see the positives in it. Anyways after my first session, I was given prazosin for my nightmares and my sleep problems. I don't have nightmares or dreams anymore but I still have issues with my PTSD symptoms like irritability/anger/hyper-vigilance, and my depression and anxiety was still present.

 In my second session, it seemed like everything wasn't as great. I told my therapist I was angry and depressed still and I don't think he liked the answer. He asked me how I am, and I was just like ""okay"". He started to say I was doing good but I discussed I was dealing with worthlessness and still have issues with passive suicidal ideations. He also told me that I was ""young to be depressed or sad or to be even dealing with mental issues"". I was in disbelief because I told him my trauma story of what happened during my military service and how that incident changed me. I lost everything during the last 5 years and have spent all my holidays alone by myself. When I got out the military, it was scary and depressing. I never felt so overwhelmed how difficult it was dealing with mental health issues. I didn't know my depression would cause me to be absent from work 6 times a month. I had no clue what I was going through. I thought I was just a young adult. I was using avoidance and isolation to deal with my problems. I only started to seek help because I needed it but now I feel like I want to ditch therapy again. It seems like age is a factor when dealing with mental health because I have seen high school kids deal with depression and anxiety. What makes them different from me? I asked for help but now i'm being told i'm young and shouldn't even feel like this? My mental health has been on a decline for 5 years and what I've done was to suck it up and deal with it.

My pen charging flashed and I got terrified and I looked at it and genuinely thought it was a creature hiding as this tool spying on me. But I came back to my seconds after a few seconds.

So being quarantined i started to ask myself why do i feel bad and why i don’t want to start university, and i think i got the conclusion that I can’t enjoy anything.

I used to really really hate school, and I thought it was normal because yeah we all do, but even then I didn’t like my friends liking some activities or stuff like that, because i never enjoyed them and i was jealous they did.

However when i finished it and started to get into courses of things i “enjoy” (im gonna study arts so that’s my only hobby and i have no other interests) and the same thing happened. I hated it, and i hated that my friends were able to enjoy it.

So basically I have no idea if this is even related to anything but when I was a kid I would literally seek out any way I could to feel pain without it looking like I did it on purpose. I had a cat when I was 5/6 who was very mean and would leave some of the deepest scratches I’ve ever seen a cat make when she was mad. I used to go up to her and stick my hand out to pet her because I knew she would scratch me and I’d do it over and over until the top of my hand was covered in scratches and dripping blood. I still have scars from it. I also used to smash my hand with a hammer to break it, I once broke my foot on purpose, made my older cousin run over me with a 4-wheeler, bang my head off of trees, ride my bike down large hills and purposely jump off. Absolutely anything I could do to feel pain I would do it and then I’d try my best to hide it because I wanted to get as much pain from it as I could before going to the hospital or having my mom wrap it up. As I got older I started to sh by cutting and tbh still do even now. I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar disorder but sometimes I wonder if it’s right or not because of things in my childhood. Could all of this be linked to a certain mental illness or is this unrelated? I do see a therapist and have brought it up but she’s never really told me what she thought about it all.",24May2020,1

90,"I will give some background before starting. And apologies for my English and english is not my primary language. 

I have recently taken a divorce as my wife was emotionally and physically unavailable as she had continued her affair after our marriage. 

I stay in a country where parents decide the bride for their son and stay in a joint family. 

My parents forced me to get married before i completed my education (i am a graduate but i could not complete my masters because of the marriage and issues after the marriage. Only one group is left of the final stage of my masters.) 

After the divorce i decided to leave my job for six months with the consent of my family and complete my education. And currently i am trying to study for my exams.

Now, some background about my family.

My dad is retired and is suffering from schizophrenia, depression and has trust issues, he always feels that his sons ( me and my brother) are his enemy. He doesn't show it to us but i have heard her talking to my mom. However my mother treats her as if he has non of these issues. And takes his Judgement as normal and about her sons decision. 

My mother is totally into denial always and will not acknowledge any problems. she feels that she is protected by our gods and god will take care of every problem. 

My brother has rage issues since childhood and he feels that fighting is the only recourse when it comes to any issues. And he had physical fights with me and my father in the past. He has recently beaten his wife very badly for some petty issues. Now his wife and his kid is staying away from him. Because of this he is staying with us (i.e with me and my parents). He is greedy and always run behind money. And he hates me and i hate him too.

So you will get it how hard it will be to stay under one roof for all these people. And we are a family which is always fighting and having no love, care and empathy for one another. Always finding a way to degrade other and not caring about others emotions and feelings.

My father always degrades me whenever he gets a chance and my brother is searching for chances to fight me and my mother is always into denial. 

I am not perfect, i also have trust issues and quiet often go into depression.

I want to get out of this family and want to complete my education and move to another country. Want a loving partner and few kids. But because of these issues i am not able to complete my studies as after every fight i kind of go into depression. And there is no support from anyone.

I am really feeling alone and cant see an end to this issue. whatever i have written is just the tip of the iceberg. 

When i got divorce there was no empathy from my family.

Sometime i get thoughts of ending my life but i dont want to waste my life. I want to be a productive member of the society.  Even if i die, no one will care in my family and my brother will be happy as he will get the property.

Anyone had such an experience ? and if yes how you came out of it?? 

Staying away from my family is something which i will not be able to afford and not practically possible because the city in which i live is really expensive to stay on rent. And food is also expensive.",24May2020,1

And it's so unfair. While some people are in their mansions making tik toks and banana breads. We're here. Seeing people die everyday. 

I feel so helpless that I can't do anything. I have been working 9-10 hour shifts from home. Work suddenly thinks they can wake me up and demand my attention at any hour because I'm at home. But people are losing their jobs so I can't complain.

I have not been able to get all the medicines I need to keep me stable. But can't complain because there are people dying of hunger.

95,"I’ve previously talked about how it feels like I’m not meant to do better beccause things just keep getting worse. I had tried to, I guess, “get up” again and things felt the tiniest bit better.

But a few hours after, she just acts like nothing happened.

99,"I’ve been friends with this girl I met online for four years now.  Recently, we both confessed that we had feelings for each other for a long time.  I never took my shot because when we first met I was severely damaged, still “fresh” out of a very abusive relationship that left me depressed and suicidal.  We decided to take a chance and started dating, long distance, back in February.  And it was great, talking about visiting each other, our passions, our fears, everything.  I’m in love.  I honestly didn’t think it could happen again. I was at the point where I’m hoping everything works out between us when we meet in person, because I can see a potential future with this woman.  

Well, tonight/this morning, I screwed up.  I made a joke about myself being a stripper, I’m an overweight male knocking on 40, over text.  I followed it up with “I wasn’t a stripper”, but my phone autocorrected wasn’t into want.  She made a comment about going and getting one, which from the way she wrote it, I knew she was a bit upset.  I responded with “Only if it’s you.”  She fired back with a comment asking if I thought she was selling her body to guys.  Apparently, she was joking at that point but I didn’t realize.  I try to apologize and she doesn’t respond for an extended period of time.  When she does, she says that she was busy chatting with guys about selling pictures of her body.  

I should have known she was joking, we’ve joked like that in the past, but in a moment of weakness and fear I thought she might be telling the truth.  I asked her to please tell me she was kidding.  The fact that I, even for a split second, doubted her hurt me.  But it hurt her even more.  She has called me every name on the book, said she hates me and she disappointed.  That part right there, she hates me and is disappointed, hurts me more than anything.  To know that I caused her pain in general, but enough to make her disappointed and hate me, is killing me inside.  

While the depression have never left completely, the suicidal thoughts are starting to rear their head again.  I hate having to write this.  I normally don’t express my feelings except to a very select few, and even then they don’t get everything.  I keep parts of me bottled up.  But I’m scared.  I’ve attempted suicide three times before, none of them successful obviously, none of them causing any actual harm by some strange coincidences.  

But I’m scared with corona, I might try again.  I’m unemployed currently and, because of my pre-existing conditions, have been told by a doctor that if I caught it I didn’t have a high chance to survive.  So I shouldn’t work until this is over with.  If this ever ends.  If I try again, I wouldn’t do it in such a way that I would burden others too much, no messy clean up, no shock of finding me dead accidentally.  

It’s taken me over an hour to write this.  I’m not looking for attention.  I needed to get this out.  I don’t have another medium to do it in.  So I’m letting you faceless individuals read it.  It’s been somewhat therapeutic.  I don’t expect comment or advice.  I just needed to get this out of my head.  I won’t commit suicide, but the thoughts are there.  I just wish I could actually speak to her, one last time.  I’m not sure if it would harm or help.",24May2020,1

102,"I have had a tough upbrining. My first relationship i ever had ended because my parents said one day you will never see this boy ever again, and that was that. My mother is aggressive, angry and when I was younger would verbally, mentally and physically abuse me. Since growing up, the physical abusr has stopped but the mental and verbal stuff is still on going.
As a child I used to lie all the time, compulsively. It got my parents in troubke when one of my lies soundrd bad and a parent intervened and called social services. They found nothing was wrong and it was all fine.
I have had anxiety and depression because if that incident from year 2 (in the UK). Since then i know i have been craving affection and love from partners and went from relationship to relationship which always ended badly. Some of them were also abusive and those that weren't i seemed to find boring.
I went to university and it seemed to get better for myself after a bad breakup left me sinhle for my final year which was the longest i had been single since i was 16. Anyway long story short, had a great boyfriend recently but i found ways to make myself unhappy by thinking i wasn't happy with him etc, when i ended things i realised i was manifesting my own insecurities and disgusts of myself onto him. He did nothing wrong, he supported me through everything bad that had happened and yet it still wasn't good enough for me... Or so i thought.
This time when this relationship ended i realised he did not do anything wrong, he was great and yeah sadly i did love him. Instead i just feel more comfortable being a sad and when i am happy i change it.
I have had therapists before but obviously things have not worked, we would talk a lot about my mother. I am looking to move out soon, when coronavirus moves on in the UK and i can earn money to get a place.
So what i am asking is, what is wrong with me? Why do i find it so hard to be happy and what can i do to stop this damaging behaviour?",24May2020,1
103,"On the 15th, I lost my dog. I took him to be put down, I’m quite a young adult so this was my first proper loss. I haven’t really lost a relative that’s been that close to me yet. The first day of two I cried my eyes out, then it just stopped and now I feel nothing. At first I felt sad, guilty, a bit of regret (they left the decision down to me sort of) and now I don’t feel. The closest to anything I get is this deep sinking feeling in my heart when I think of him, he was my best friend. Like I spoke about his death before he died to people and said how it would destroy me, I loved him more than any Human I know, anyone who’s close to their pet will understand he was literally a brother and a best friend to me. 

I’ve looked at the stages of grief and I assume I’m in denial which could be why I don’t feel yet, especially because I’m not living at that home at the minute so Im used to him not being around me here. Does anyone know how long it will take for me to process this, or if I ever will?

104,"Hii okay so the counselors and therapist where I’m at our absolutely horrible. They just wanna put you on pills or send you off to a place. I’ve grown out of this a little bit (I was forced to) but I would like to still have answers on this. Okay so starting from age I would say 10-14 (I’m 15 almost 16 now) I had problem with authority (or what I would consider authority)i couldn’t do simple things like order or go into the store by myself I would get shaky and I would sweat a lot and I would feel just horrible. Like I was being judged. Also I had this thing where if I were talking to an adult and we were discussing something and they weren’t on my side I would just burst out in tears (for example like I had a problem at school and talking to the principal I would start crying) I was just so embarrassed. Was this just bad anxiety? I’m Not sure if this plays a part in this too but last year I started developing a speech problem. I would mess up words a lot,my mind would go blank and I would forget words,I would have words on the tip of my tongue but I wouldn’t be able to say it,and I stuttered. Or I would think of one word and say something else. The worst thing though (which still happens kinda) is when I would think my mom
Is mad at me (she’s a whole other story.) but she’s probably the worst at expressing herself so I wouldn’t know if she was mad or not. And I’m always on the verge of a panic attack. 
I’m sorry if this is confusing. If you have any questions just ask and I can answer them. To explain things better. Also if anyone knows about narcissistic moms please tell me so I can talk to you about it (if you’re up for it because it’s a longggg story). Thanks!",24May2020,1

110,"Hello, my name is Johan, this is the first time i'm going to talk about all of this, it is very scary from me but I feel like its about time, I'm from Morocco where mental health isn't only a taboo subject but also very expensive. I'm not sure where to start but here goes nothing, I lost my mother and my sister at a very young age (3 months old), the three of us were in an accident and I'm the only one who survived, my father is an addict (or at least he was). My dad was extremely strict not just to me but also towards my siblings but for some reason I always felt as if I was a special case, I was never allowed to leave the house and if I wanted to I had to give him a detailed list of reasons as to why I have to go out and when i'm coming back, and if somehow I was late by even 5 or 10 minutes I would get physically punished and depending on his mood it could be a simple slap or a beating till I start bleeding. This made me decide to never leave the house and spent most of my time either reading or watching cartoons. Fast forward a few years I got a chance to leave the house and go live with my sister, we stayed together for about 2 years before he joined us and I had to go back to my old life style (I can still imagine if any of my friends came to visit me I would get yelled at or beaten up). This went on until I graduated high-school, at this point my mental health was in a very bad state; I was anti-social, always sad( I don't want to call it depression since I was not diagnosed), and I had suicide thoughts all the time, almost went through with it once or twice when I was 17/18. Now we're at university, at this point I became more anti-social because I'm in a new city and I don't know anyone, the first year of university I had no friends I only got out of my shell in the second year where I made a couple of friends and gotten into a relationship which was pretty good until the breakup. After that I gotten into two other relationships where I got cheated on in both. At the start of this year I had some problems and because of that I lost my chance for a job, which is really bad especially in a country like Morocco where the job market is really unforgiving, once you lose a shot you usually don't get it again, this pushed me over the edge even more. Recently I lost two of my closest friends that I was able to talk to about anything now there is nobody left. I have never been to a therapist before I don't know what is wrong and my financial situation does not allow me to go to therapy. So this is my way of seeking some kind of help. I feel hopeless and nothing brings me joy anymore, everything I do feels like i'm only doing it to fill my spare time and stop my mind from thinking, I usually tend to exhaust myself as much as possible so that I fall asleep as soon as possible and I don't have to think about anything anymore.

111,"So I was in a 2 year relationship. This comes 2 years after my mum died and I was dealing with grief and then severe depression. I was a horrible person to be around and I basically broke up with my boyfriend everyday so one day when I broke up with him he ended up cheating on me with his ex. Well technically I guess it wasn’t cheating since I broke up with him a few hours before he did it. Also we were long distance the entire time so he was in my city for 4 months for work. He went home in between which is when he slept with her and then he came back to my city a few days later and a week after that we got back together. That’s when I found out about her. I decided to stay with him because I know a lot of my behaviour had to do with what happened and I went to therapy and started meds for for the year after that I had a pretty bad reaction to all the ones I’d tried and they just made me feel worse. The last day of our visits were alway horrible and we’d argue because I was scared of losing him and that I’d never see him again and I just wanted to close that gap but I wasn’t financially stable to do so because well all I could fucking do is sleep. Anyway the last time I saw him we got into a massive argument and I basically was like a child throwing a temper tantrum. He’s in the army and this was the day he had to leave for course so not only was he stressed out about that but also about me. fast a month and a bit and I found out I was pregnant. When I told him he asked me for some time to process it but I panicked and suffocated him with calls, etc. And that’s when everything went to shit. He told me he couldn’t handle my behaviour anymore and that it was too stressful. I ended up having a miscarriage which messed with me a lot at first and he still talked to me while this was all happening but our relationship was over. It hasn’t even been 2 months since all of that and he’s already been seeing another girl for a month now at least. She’s 18 and he’s 25. But she lives only a few minutes away from him, she likes cars and works at a mechanic shop with his dad, she does everything he loves doing. I’m pretty sad right now because I feel like he just replaced me and our long term relationship was nothing to him. He said I need to work on myself which I fully agree with and then maybe he’ll give me another chance but not anytime soon. One of our biggest issues was that I didn’t want to do anything he did.  All I did was lay in bed and cry. I started on Wellbutrin 6 weeks ago and it’s improved my mood and motivation so much, I’ve never had this energy before. I honestly couldn’t even stay awake for an entire day so with him when he asked me to do things it wasn’t that I didn’t want to. It was that I couldn’t. I was constantly exhausted, couldn’t comprehend things, etc. I was horrible when I was with him but since being on Wellbutrin it’s completely changed my life and I know that if he saw me again in person he’d notice the changes and I’d be the happy girl I was when we first met. He doesn’t reallly understand mental health and I can’t blame him for that because I couldn’t until it all started happening to me but now I’m really messed up and sad because he was all I had. He was my best friend, the only person I’ve ever had my entire life that’s loved me, he believed in me and I was an absolute jerk to him the entire time. How do I fix this? How do I show him that I’m better when I live 12 hours from him? I understand what I did wrong and how I hurt him and I just want another chance with him so I can fix it. I know for a fact that if he just calmed down and saw me again he’d change his mind. Well if she wasn’t in the picture. I just found out about her today because she posted photos of them and I spent the past 8 hours bawling my eyes out. She’s 18, he’s 24. I wish I wasn’t so damn sad all the time because then I wouldn’t have screwed up so much with the love of my life.",24May2020,1

117,"I'm(F) curious as to how this new identified trauma could potentially manifest itself in my life. Do share you thoughts on this event.

2yrs ago, there was a house party that was a bit rambunctious (putting it lightly), where many questionable and strange events occured. This one being, after a series of recorded ""pranks"" were done to people in their sleep all around the house for the main enjoyment of three guys. When the initial three would ""prank"" one, they'd join and the mob grew larger and would ""prank"" the next sleeping individual. And I say prank as I don't consider them pranks but, you can be the judge of that.

The first one started in the room I was in and I was woken up by the sound of the first prank which happened to someone sleeping in the closet of the room, however I didn't move so the guys didn't know I was awake. From that, the guys moved elsewhere in the house and pranked several other people - I know as I was told by the victim of the first prank and there were also video. Eventually, after learning that someone was almost drowned in a bathtub by their ""friends"", I tried to get out of the house with the victim (who knew I was awake at this point)  with my very blacked out friend who was sleeping next to me in the same bed. But we heard the group of guys (now about 6 or 7) coming to the room where I was, as well as the VERY blacked out and passed out girl beside me.

I told the first victim (my friend) to hide in the bathroom but to make it look like he was using it and I pretended to be asleep again. The group of guys opened the door and circled the bed and started making jokes about ""what's for dinner?"", ""you guys hungry?"", calling her name etc like ""ohhhhhhh Sallllyyyy"" (not her name obv). I got the overwhelming feeling of danger during hearing the comments, but the moment I felt one touch her leg on the bed, I jolted up on the bed so they knew I was awake. After that, they all filed out of the room. I know, if I hadn't have been there, that more would of happened 100% as my friend in the bathroom, froze up when they found him and didn't say anything or speak up when the other guys started their commentary or movements towards her.

When I was lying down pretending to be asleep, I peeked one eye open and saw l of the guys circled around the bed with smiles and smirks looking like they were around a thanksgiving dinner. That image is very much in my head today. The things they said and the whole night, has stayed in my mind. It felt as if I was the potential, since I heard everything they said and saw them staring down at the bed I was on. Even though it was all directed towards my female friend next to me, it felt as if I was her in a sense or just disturbing as I was laying in a room with a group of guys planning to do whatever to her.

Of course, it was all down played by the guys involved. When approcahed, one of them tried to tell me that the plan was to come in a mess with me (I'm a pretty masculine gay woman) and tried to really convince me that that was the cause until I told him I was awake the entire time and heard what they were saying.

118,"I am financially stable and in good health. The same cannot be said of the millions of people who are suffering and the 100,000 who have died because of COVID-19, a dread disease that has wrecked our economy and our relationships. Please do not let my kvetching give you the impression that I do not realize how fortunate I am.

Recently, after a decade of denying the extent of my post-military problems, I contacted the VA. They gave me the help that I needed. Thanks to a variety of circumstances — including but not limited to the VA's decision to declare me 100% disabled and incapable of working — I am financially and emotionally healthy. I really do have nothing to complain about.

And yet, I am utterly miserable. I am frightened of having a hobby. I am frightened of watching a movie during the day. I am frightened of wasting a single moment of the workday. I treat every day as if I were still working. I get up early (6 a.m. or so), walk the dog, exercise, and get down to business. I am working on software and hardware projects. I am learning a foreign language. Although I am not permitted to work, I refuse to be idle. The trouble is that I'm afraid of being called idle, or being laughed at, or being told I'm merely twiddling my thumbs until I die.

The same psychiatric problems that made the VA call me 'disabled' are the ones that make it hard for me to produce the same quality of work that I used to. The flashbacks, hallucinations, and feelings of guilt tend to overwhelm me at the most inopportune moments. It's hard to stay focused on a project when someone or something keeps slapping you in the face.

The last time I produced a prototype worthy of public attention, I published it and was promptly torn to shreds. Granted, trolls are trolls, and I need a thicker skin, but I do remember *having* a thicker skin. I don't remember when I became so sensitive. Anyway, it set me back. Now, I'm reluctant to publish.

So, here I am. I don't want to produce mediocrity. I am reluctant to publish my more impressive projects. I don't like working on projects that can't contribute to the Greater Good. I don't want to be idle.

If I do something as a mere hobby, the output won't be for the Greater Good.

If I do something with the intention of serving the Greater Good, I'll probably get mocked when I publish, and then my thin-skinned widdle self will retreat into its shell again.

If I do something for the Great Good but never publish, I'll feel like a narcissistic John Galt.

If I do nothing, I'll feel idle.

I yearn to be creative. I refuse to spend the next dour decades farting into the same sofa cushion. I'm not permitted to earn a living, but I *am* permitted to build something of value and then let other people have it for free. I'm already paid by Uncle Sam, so in a sense, by developing something useful and giving it away, I'm merely giving good value for money. This isn't charity on my part. This is an act of gratitude for the charity that Uncle Sam has shown me.

**I just want to do something useful.**

119,"My dad have been randomly calling “mom” and our names repeatedly for years now and when we answer he has nothing to say, or just says “oh what? Nothing”. And he keeps doing it, randomly calling “mom... mom... mom... mom...” without any reason, sometimes even with us being in the same room. He also sometimes go to the bathroom, opens the water and start randomly speaking to himself, clapping or slapping his face or again, calling our names randomly.

Since the quarantine started, I’ve heard him scream and mumble in his sleep. 

We have tried to talk to him several times, nearly everyday, but he’s refusing to open up about what’s keeping his mind busy or what’s pushing him to do this. At some points, it seems like he’s doing it on purpose just to annoy us, but what would push him to do this on purpose? 

Sometimes I just start crying from hearing him do this and we’re all scared he’s going to end up hurting himself. 

I don’t know if this is relevant but he can be very violent sometimes towards my mom when they argue. But we try to stand for her. 

We’re getting really annoyed because he refuses to seek help from a professional. What should we do please?",24May2020,1

121,"I find people very difficult to deal with and I think it’s getting worse. This is probably to do with my character/past so is a long story. I’m sorry.

Moved primary school 3 times, parents divorced during this time was very messy.

Mum re-married; step-Dad

Was bullied very badly in high-school, bullies were very two-faced, pretended to be friends, but would never invite me to stuff, snide comments etc

Moved to a completely different college just to get away from high school bullies 

Didn’t make any friends in college, probably because I didn’t have any social skills from before. Was quite happy in college nevertheless just because I wasn’t being bullied. Had brief relationship with bf, ended after 6 months and became friends.

Started uni, had a large group of friends for a while partially because of making friend with an extrovert, Beth who introduced me to people. Got in another relationship, bf was rude and inconsiderate, broke up with him after he turned into a complete stoner. Unfortunately already in a house with him and Beth for  second year.

Second year ex-bf becomes depressed, nasty towards me and tries to commit suicide in-front of me saying it’s my fault. Bad few months finally manage to get him to move out the house. This is probably the first time I start to get properly irritated by people around me, the fourth housemate invites ex-bf back to house shorty after kicking him out. When I bring it up she gets angry with me says he is her friend and she should be able to do what she wants. Lose contact with her during third year.

Onto third year, year in industry. Was a spoof placement, claiming we were to be doing scientific work but I spent most my time mopping the floor of the tractor shed. From day 1 I don’t get on with other placement student, Aleana. Aleana was extremely bossy, downright rude and always got on my nerves. I was unfortunately stuck working with her for the year as well as living in a house with her. I never really clicked with anyone else in the wider work-team, the work became ridiculous picking weeds from a field with our bare hands at -10c during winter. I complained to the university, who pulled me out of the field work and placed me into the Chem-store, still not  ‘scientific work’, but I didn’t feel like I was getting taken advantage of, and worked hard in there for the remaining 6 months. Me getting placed in the chemstore only made my relationship with my colleagues worse, Aleana became unbearable and I would dread seeing her. I became viewed as “the girl who complained because she couldn’t cut the hard-work in the fields, lazy etc”. My mental health really began to suffer but I was stuck in the placement. What’s worse is my parents had a similar mindset and kept telling me to “just get on with it and viewed me lazy and unable to cope for complaining.” There was maybe 1 or 2 positive relationships in my life right then. I became depressed, angry and defensive at all the people around me.

Come back to fourth year of uni, moving in with friends I thought it would be a relief. But I found things I could usually put up with I couldn’t anymore. Everything irritated me from the pile of dirty dishes, to people overstating their welcome, to my flatmates signing. During this time I became quite close with an introverted guy in my group, Josh, I felt we had a lot in common and would share our writing etc. Flatmate Chloe announces before Xmas that she likes Josh, I was horrified, I knew they’d been doing cooking etc together but didn’t think anything of it. I confess to her that I also like him, she breaks down into tears, making for an awkward situation but we eventually agree to wait for after Xmas and see how we both feel. 

I have a bad time at family home over Xmas, with my parents increasing battering at my self-esteem. Comments such as “I’m only letting you stay in your brothers room because I feel sorry for you because you have no friends.” This was from my Mum, who commonly flies into such outrages, assuming stuff about me without ever asking about my life. She will then claim that it never happened, and got extremely angry at me one time when I bought the issue of stuff like this up. Step-Dad was also becoming increasingly distant and saying similar absurd assumptions. Overall giving me the impression that I was a piece of shite, I knew most of these things to but not true but when someone tells you them over and over again you start believing them. Anyway Chloe has a Xmas party, Josh turns up with her which I’m surprised about (he supposedly wasn’t coming). I get a text a few days later telling me that they were now going out. No apology. in spite of our promise. Hurt but accepting I couldn’t do anything I return to uni house with the assumption that considering the circumstances she’d be respectful. 

She was not.

Everything from loud sex, having him over 6 out of 7 days a week, sitting on him, snogging him in-front of me regularly. Two months in, I just can’t deal, get extremely depressed and decide to bring it up with Chloe after being urged to by friends. Chloe replies saying she is being respectful, briefly apologises that “I feel this way” (not an apology for her actions) and says “she is not sacrificing her happiness for me”. So things continue like this for a few months. I get together with another friend, Rory, someone who I’ve like since first year but have stayed away from because he likes to sleep around a lot... anyway he’d really improved as a person recently, so we gave it a ago. Our time as Gf and bf lasted seven days. Somewhere along the line I had developed extreme relationship anxiety that, quashed all my feelings as soon as we were going out. I couldn’t deal and broke up, something I still regret and think about now as, as soon as I broke up the feelings for him returned again. He got back together with his previous gf the same day and we haven’t talked about it since. 

Unfortunately for me I made the same mistake twice and the fifth year of uni I was living with both Chloe and Rory who regularly had their partners over several times a week. I was a mess and stressed out of mind, surrounded by both Josh and Rory in their happy relationships, that I wasn’t capable of. I felt like shite. Come christmas this year, Chloe tells me she’s moving out the house because of my stress. Completely out of the blue. This felt like such a kick in the teeth. I was angry and upset because my friend was basically saying she couldn’t deal with me. My family criticised and condoned the way I was dealing with things, telling me it must by my fault because like all the other things that happened in my past “I must be the common denominator.” This was the first time in my life I felt suicidal, the only thing that kicked me out of it was anger. I felt angry at Chloe for all of her actions, and in extension all the other people that had hurt my mental health and subsequently my uni grades and life. I lashed out sent a few angry text messages, and it’s safe to say we don’t talk anymore. 


When I returned to uni in January, I found the entire group dead to me (or at least it felt like that). My two closest friends, were playing devils advocate, only telling me the negative stuff I had done and the positive stuff Chloe had done. That might have worked in a smaller scenario to close the rift but I was far past that. I cried every night reeling between anger at Chloe and self-loathing for myself for causing this mess. Somehow I managed to claw myself tooth and nail out of this pit. My anger and sadness balanced with extreme optimism like a yo yo. In these optimistic moments I’d think I could somehow fix everything, I proposed group meet ups etc. My two friends kept advising me against it, “saying people weren’t ready”. Again I’m hurt confused and angry, yes I had sent a few angry messages to Chloe but what had I done to everyone else in the group? Nothing, I’m still confused to it by this day. I felt like I was clawing myself out a hole whilst everyone sat around relaxed saying they weren’t ready for me to come out the hole yet. It’s been a few months now since then and I’m talking again with Rory and some other group friends. But anyways super long story, sorry but here are the problems I have now.

1) my irritation level for everyone is extremely low, I just can’t deal with people, I’m trying to manage it but it’s extremely difficult. I actively see it getting worse, I struggle to be around close friends, even on calls for long periods of time. I feel sour, like I don’t have the energy to put up with BS anymore. E.g. someone pees on the seat, I’m angry. Friend tells me of her plan of moving into a house that will expose her more to the coronavirus, doesn’t listen to my advice. I’m angry. I have such a low tolerance, I don’t want to be like this, I know it’s damaging my friendships, I don’t want to be this person but I don’t feel like I have the energy to do anything else.

2) Yes, I’ve been to see a university therapist, we’ve talked things through, I’ve been to resilience workshops but they’ve not really helped (seem to general, count to 10 etc...)

3) met another guy, friend from Camp America, as were in lockdown just been flirting over calls etc. Find out last week he’s moving to Poland to live with another girl, (who he’s confessed he likes), this girl has told him multiple she doesn’t like him and only wants him to move as a friend. He has other ideas. When I tell him, if he moves to Poland any chance of us having a relationship is over, he back-lashes originally but otherwise doesn’t seem to care. I feel so fed up of relationships right now, I’m 22 (still a virgin) and every time I’ve tried a relationship it’s ended in disaster. Anyone could tell me what’s going on here that’d be great.",24May2020,1
122,"Hi everyone. I hope you're all well. 
I know everyone is struggling more so than usual at the moment but I think it is important for everyone to understand that their own individual issues are important and worth talking about. 
With this in mind, and my lack of people to talk to, I decided to put a post on here. 
I'm in recovery from therapy, with bimonthly appointments to learn how I can deal with a relapse. Well currently I an relapsing, hard. 
I have one friend to speak of, and a few acquaintances. None of these people want to speak to me when I'm struggling, I have tried and get ignored, or the conversation is immediately changed. 
Just recently I started speaking to an ex again, and that's all fine and well, but I am finding it's making me struggle a bit more. Despite our awful past (that's a whole other long and horrible story) we have both grown and moved on from it but I cant let anything go. And currently I believe I'm only continuing to speak to him, despite how weird it's making me feel, because I am so incredibly lonely. I have noone to talk to. I live with my parents and they just dont want to know, when I've tried just talking to my mum I get told ""well everybody is feeling the same."" 
I think really, all I want is some friends to talk to. I find that often I get like this when I have noone to talk to and recently, no matter how much I message people I'm getting one word messages back, or ignored outright. Its giving me too much time in my own head. Loneliness has always been a big problem for me as I just do not have any friends (a lot of people think I'm dramatic for saying that, but its genuinely true. I have acquaintances not friends)

123,"I find music which is equal parts calming and ""background"", like this chillhop lofi stuff https://youtu.be/A9sOb_r6Hy0 (this is not my channel I only consume it) 
And I play this music in the shower. A cozy, long, hot shower. This doesn't quiet the thoughts but I think the music subconsciously influences me to think more positive or calm thoughts, and look for silver linings in negative thoughts. I'm still thinking all the thoughts, but I feel better about them.

But I don't stop the music when the shower ends. Bringing around the speaker/phone with me is almost synonymous to bringing over the calm and relaxed mood. I have a ritual where I come out of the shower, moisturize, comb my hair, get dressed in fresh clothes, and then do whatever else. And drink lots of water because after a hot shower I feel parched. At the same time, I end my shower with at least a minute of cold water for that extra fresh boost, and to close my pores. Maybe this isn't the best for the moisturizer. Idk, I used to blow dry my hair before my dryer broke. 

Anyway, if I've already eaten breakfast before the shower, I get dressed and move straight to my workstation. The calm mood helps me focus on one task. It's still a struggle to not get distracted by social media/random things I might wanna look up, but I have found that I am significantly more focused than normal. Also make it a habit to wash your dishes right after eating so they don't pile up!

Habits are absolutely amazing and worth the struggle it takes to build them! We just need to be patient and take baby steps, taking our own side when beating ourselves up. 

Of course this may not work the same for everybody but thought I'd share.",24May2020,1
124,"I don't know how to start, hello I guess :)?  so amidst the quarantine and being part of the ""graduating"" class I still have my last set of subjects to accomplish. I'm trying to tell myself that this is the last stretch and reaching the finish line would then allow me to go to college, but now-- it's just that I've lost the will to do any school tasks (online).  I don't know if it's burnout worsening, or I'm just lazy.     


  
Most of my school life I was told to do my 100%. It was that span of time that I thought that failure was not an option one would like to experience so since 1st grade I would study my arse off and try to become part of the top of the class. This continued until 10th grade. My elder sibling was well known by the school and it's teachers for becoming the head of the school newspaper that time and had feats nationally. The teachers also knew me since I'm the sibling's brother and if I could be just as good as my sibling. This made me challenge myself on how far I could go, though eventually I never even went near.  At that time I still wasn't aware of the effect that I had for pushing myself constantly too far.  10th grade was also my peak of pushing myself to the limit eventually getting top of the class. It was when I was in 11th grade that I started experiencing burnout. I immediately just tried to get a passing score if lessening my diligence would help me take a rest for a while. This was the time where I have to start thinking of what course I would have to take for college since next year I would start taking entrance exams.    


  
 To be honest, I never truly knew what course I would like to pursue. I was driven by the expectation of achieving high grades but I never realized what I want to enjoy doing. Then 12th grade arrives and I was attending a cram school so I could be ready for entrance exams. While applying for colleges my parents asked which course(s) would I like to pursue. At that time and to this day I said that I like to take Computer Science since it would be the ""middle ground"". My parents expect me to take an engineering course mostly supported by the fact that it gives more opportunity for a good salary. I was still yet to pick a course that I would like to pursue so I said to my parents that I would like to take BS Physics or BS Mathematics and I would just shift to a course that I would like to pursue. Eventually, I settled on Computer Science or Computer Engineering whichever the colleges could offer me this is because they would give me the best chance of what course I would enjoy (based on my past experience) and it's an Engineering program, well for the latter that is.    
 My mother was skeptical of this. She said to me that she had a workmate back in the day who had a Computer Science degree but was working minimum wage and only sits on the office as well as spouses who are both BS Computer Science but didn't get a job related to that degree. I was kind of triggered by that statement replying that it's of their own fault that they were in that spot and not the degree's fault. My father was supportive... well I think he is. Now eventually I had to take my college entrance exams, four entrance exams to be exact. This is to ensure that I would get into any of them. They were within less than 3 weeks of each other and I was still studying until the day before the first entrance exam day, thinking that just this last time I would push myself to my limits and do my 100% throughout all of my entrance exams. At that time I was still managing school but it was ok I still get passing grades. Each test that I took reached almost a quarter of a day to accomplish. especially the first one which took me exactly that span of time.     
After each entrance exam, I started to feel more and more burned out (4 entrance exams within the months of October and November). In my second to the last term of this school year (after taking my entrance exams)I almost failed a subject. I barely made it out alive getting a 60.4% grade (passing was 60%) and I was so stressed at that time. The term ended weeks before the pandemic occurred and quarantine had taken effect so my third and final term had to be taken online. I am now currently on the final lap to the finish line. I was almost there graduating, but my body and mind felt exhausted to the extent that I couldn't bear it anymore. Good thing online classes were temporarily suspended but even during that I now feel the worst degree of my burnout so far.    
 Recently I had an argument with my parents while I was having lunch with the whole family. I tried to address to them that I was feeling pressured by the ""advice"" they've said to me. My father likes to say someone immediately that he/she's wrong on something even before he/she tries to explain his/her side. I was never given a chance to properly stand my own ground. It was that time that I had broken down crying in front of them that I was frustrated with all of this, but I barely answered back. It's just so toxic of a habit when even trying to explain your stand is seen as disrespectful to your parents. The lunch ended in a sour note and they moved on after a couple of days but I was so affected by that situation that I suddenly lost almost all my motivation to finish my remaining tasks.   
    
Now a few days ago, I've given myself a wake-up call to finally finish what's left so I can ""graduate"" and go to college, with the fact that I got offered one now which is relieving. My parents are more into my results instead of my hardships anyway. I've lost the enjoyment of my hobbies. I stopped watching anime, stopped playing most of my video games, even watching youtube vids feel like a total waste of time. Now I just try to relax by listening to music though it doesn't always help( I don't even know if that's considered a hobby) Despite the poor studying environment of my home I still try to do my 100% one last time to cram and finish my tasks before the deadline comes.     


  
I just can't bear the stigma of getting good results anymore. But I can't help fulfilling them to not look like a failure, though I feel like I inevitably will be one. I don't even know what hobby I can do anymore other than photography which is new to me. At least no one knows my situation since I'm very good at suppressing my emotions for the past half-decade. It would just be seen as a nuisance to others. Saying ""it be like that"" as if it's normal and not self problematic. I hope quarantine ends as soon as possible. I would be in a condo in my own devices so I can be productive in my own terms and learn how to accept the fact that I should just try and find some way to enjoy my course. Maybe that way I can start to enjoy doing new things that I could love once more.    


  
I want to ask, how do you find ways to enjoy things once more when you completely exhaust yourself to the point of losing the joy of what you do? How should I cope if the expectation of good results far outweigh the hardships I have given out?

125,"Hello, i need help and tips on avoiding someone with possible schizophrenia. 

This post might be all over the place, I didn’t know how to put things together. I’m sorry 

I just recently befriended someone who seemed like he was okay at first. 
Throughout the 2 weeks I have known this person he started showing signs like bipolar moods, dreams, superpowers, and so on. 
I thought he was just a narcissist or something but he gets really skiddish. 
It started normally I thought he was just only having depression or something so I tried to be there. I started to get to know this person and he tells me he has sorts of superpowers or his dreams are true and so on. 
He would visit me at work before I would get off and he would wait about maybe 2 hours or so. Not sure if this is sorta a stalking trait or something but he was accused of stalking before. 

We got boba drinks together. He said he liked it, another moment he said he hated it and as I left to go home. I believe I saw him throwing the drink onto the parking lot ground. And as I left the parking lot I saw him crutching down around a corner staring into no where. 

I’m not sure what I should do. 

And another big problem was that it seemed that he had to be right about everything. I tried arguing that relationships are based on both parties being in an agreement on everything NOT FAITH AND DESTINY. He got super agitated. 

A couple time during a conversation he grabbed my wrist which made me confused. So I’m not sure what I should’ve done. 

I told him that I wanted to go home (home home not school home) and he kept asking “why” and that I should stay here and continue to go to school here longer. I told him I missed my mom and that I was gonna transfer schools and he got really angsty. 
— 
I’m very scared of going to work though I don’t work a lot. I don’t know how to tell my boss about this situation. I don’t want to get the police involved. 

I know being there for someone who has a mental illness is the right thing to do but this is my safety. If he was able to grab my wrist, I don’t think I’m safe. Especially for someone I don’t know that well. 

I know I might said argued but it was more as a counter argument towards some topics I’ve talked about with him. He probably took it the wrong way.

126,"I met a pedophile when I was 15/16 and he lied about his age, he was around 19 at the time but now he’s 24, his girlfriend is 27, and his child is about 6 years old and I’m in my 20’s. I’m not in therapy yet but mentally I feel I’m trying to let this go.

I met a man last year I’ve been involved with who’s an attorney, and I don’t know other than being myself to keep this to myself until the time is right.  I have a selective memory for some reason on top of what it’s already going on, and I blame myself what happened. We’re in the stages of getting to know each other.

Why do I have a selective memory over what happening now? What would a therapist say to me about what happened? Why does it all seem to tie in with the fact I’m with them now? I know I can’t tell him him now, I think I’d scare him away as it’s a lot to swallow so it’ll be later on down the line.

129,"I have been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder for over 10 years. It runs in my family; My mother and sister have also been diagnosed. After years of suffering through the huge credit card bills and crippling depression, I have learned to manage the phases and still be a functioning mother. 

I know my triggers. When I feel a manic phase coming on, I avoid shopping, vehicle purchases, and just focus on something like doing yard work or sewing. I know my triggers for the depression phases are lack of sleep, and not getting enough time to myself.

I am a single mom of 3 kids. I compromised with the fathers of my children to have joint custody so that two of the kids spend 50% of the time with their fathers. They both have good stable dads. I trust the dads to care for my children. Sometimes the kids spend more time with me but at the very least, they go to their dad's every second weekend. I use this time to unwind. It is absolutely necessary. Sometimes the only thing that keeps me from having a nervous a breakdown is knowing that by Friday at 7pm, I'll be alone and I can sit in the bathtub and cry for hours.

It's been like this for years. Fast forward to now. My oldest is nearly 15 years old. They normally live at their dad's for 1 week, and then live with me for 1 week. They have been in counselling for 2 years now. They are looking at a diagnosis of gender dysphoria and definitely some form of depression. Their psychiatrist won't prescribe medication for it at this time because she wants them to have proper access to counselling services in case the medication makes them suicidal or manic. 

During this time, they don't go to school. There are no after school activities, no social activities, no visiting friends, and due to their depression, and now they refuse to go to their dad's. They are with me 100% of the time. They cry when I go outside for a smoke. They cry if anyone (including my boyfriend) comes to visit me. They try to sleep in my bed. They get upset if I want to sit and sew something instead of sitting beside them to watch TV. 

This started happening in March of this year. At first, I said ""OK you can stay here this weekend, but you have to help me clean the whole house."" But this has been going on ever since. I have asked what their reasons are for not wanting to go to dad's and the counsellor and psychiatrist asked them if anything bad happened there. They said ""No, I just want to stay with my mom."" 

It has been very rough for me. I'm doing my best to be supportive to my child, but at the same time, I feel like I am on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I have sat down with my child and explained that I have bipolar depression (They found out last year actually) and that certain things can push me into a dark place and that includes me not getting time to myself. I need a day or two to recharge my batteries so I can take care of everyone for the rest of the time. This conversation happens every two week, right before my scheduled weekend to myself. It never goes well. They get angry with me and start yelling at me, or they just sit there and cry. ""But I need you."" 

I have mentioned all of this to their counsellor and psychiatrist, who are both well aware of my bipolar disorder and they act like I am being selfish. I have talked about this to my own counsellor and she thinks I am not taking care of myself and fears that my feelings of hopelessness will turn into suicidal thoughts. She got me an emergency meeting with my psychiatrist this coming week to discuss the issues.

I have approached the dad about this and asked that he do multiple things to make our child feel more welcome; which he has been working on, be more sensitive to our child's depression, and use they/them/their pronouns as much as possible, and tidy up his house and make sure our children each have their own room to go to to unwind. He has been working on all this.

I could get her mom's number, but I personally have a problem being involved with my roommates' parents, generally. It's better for me because I don't want to potentially be in a situation like the one my grandmother has placed on my dad and I--checking in all the time (in this case, to hear about her daughter, when I'm not sure if it's what my roommate wants).

My friend is our mutual friend. I've asked him to be an intermediary. But idk if it's enough. 

I don't know what to do. Help!

Also, i suffer from mental illness, very similar to hers, so Im not scared of her or anything, like some people I know were scared of me.  Never been to the hospital. I always wiggled my way out of it. Im going to ask her when she gets out how I can best support her.",24May2020,1
132,"I have now fixed myself into believing I have a mental illness... 

I never went to therapy because growing up fucken sucks and its hard.. mind you im slow in my thought processing it just takes me longer.... 

And being neurotic which I believe I am, means that my senses can get hyped up more than it normally should have..  

Here is the issue.. I thought I was dreaming.. or felt like I was.. for years... Yes I did manage to find some type of work, not labor intensive but It got me up every morning... it was a security job... and yes I did held it in those dreaming thoughts..... But thinking about it if I was distracted then It wouldnt come to mind ... 

But there has always been those moments... but what broke me was people and their comments... their face gestures.. I was completely wrong when I tried interpreting what they ment but now I clearly know... 

I stopped working, kept myself in my room, stopped going to my familys buisness on the weekends to escape some false reality that isnt even real....

Now my commection to my family is gone, I missed weddings, events, conmection with old friends, my best friend, my mother, my cousins, my brother, everyone... just because I dont want ti get up and work and because I didnt want them to see me.. they searched for me .. now they just know its not him anymore...

This isnt me.. I know its not... My mind is getting worst.. i do these psychosomatic bullshit that in the end isnt neccessary.. well some are.. my head is a mess i just wish I could return back to 2016 and take a step forward from that point in life. Maybe I would have gotten better social skills.. maybe this chick I currently like would have a better interest in me... 

I failed. I let my mother down.. but karma got me.. this is to repay my sober past mistakes which I wont tell you..  

Pre 2016... I was fine.. Just never kept a job.. but never really sat down at a table and talked to family...so there is that.. I was always going out every weekend and getting drunk... then something happened and... things started changing... maybe its my sobriety that is fucking with me now... I just never grew up...",24May2020,1

Everyone of us don't have a great group of friends or supporting family to hear us out

For all the people suffering with unspeakable problems let me tell you this truth that we never seem to believe
""THIS IS NOT THE END, THIS FEELING WILL GO AWAY, IT MIGHT TAKE TIME, BUT TRUST ME, THESE BAD TIMES AREN'T PERMANENT."" 
whatever is going on inside us, we should not give in to it, when you feel that depressed or anxious just try not to get consumed in this feeling, this isn't going to last forever
Be strong for yourself
Don't go hard on yourself guys
Do whatever makes even a little better.
For those of us refraining from doing what we love due to peer pressure, those peers who don't support your vision, ideas or the person you are, are not your friends, they will not help you with your inner turmoil, please stop loving for them
Stop punishing, criticizing yourself for all those negative lies your brain tells you. 
These negative voices are the demons dragging you down
We all have the capacity to fight them, to show them that we can come out unaffected.

I (17F) very often end up in a vicious circle.

I feel very anxious being active in groups chats or even just groups, because I feel like whatever I will say will just be awkward or embarrassing or just weird. So I often don't talk or just briefly. (I am very active in ""private"" conversations or even just IRL, though)

Meaning the people in those big groups (irl) don't really care about me (not celebrating my birthday while they celebrate everyone else's, never telling me about hangs out etc...) which then makes me feel like they don't like me anyways so I get self conscious, don't talk in groups, don't feel like I'm cared for etc...

I feel happy, at peace, fulfilled but get these obsessive thoughts that I can’t control, specifically regarding my husband dying. He’s young, in great health and great mental condition so there is no logical reasons for me to worry I guess. I think it stems from several things that happened over the last two years that left me in a very “anything can happen at anytime” state of mind. Some days I only get one or two of these thoughts but other days I end up obsessing for hours and it’s driving me crazy. I almost feel like I’m somehow gonna “ manifest it into reality” because of how much power I’m giving these thoughts.

After that he usually tells me that I can't tell him anything he needs to, when that is what he is doing with me literally all the time. If he tells me I need to do some tasks, and I'm not interested, I just tend to shut up and do the job bc it's better for everyone. Then he always says, that I have to even act like I'm interested and not be that lazy etc.

Also, I'm not very good in some normal tasks, and I'm avoiding them as much as I can, because when I try to to them, he yells at me bc I suck.

I loved her. I love her.

It's been more than a year now. She's happy. She says she forgave me. That she wants me to be happy too. And it makes me feel even worse. She wasn't perfect, but she is still so much better than me.

I don't know what to do. I want to kill myself. I hate myself. I want the world to hate me. I feel like everything that I have, I shouldn't. I want to snap and hurt myself and others, so that they would hate me. 

I want her to know how sorry I am. I apologized so many times to her, and she said she's forgiven me everytime. She said I should forgive myself. I can't. I hurt her. I wish she'd forget us. Even the good.

I'm either sad, angry, both or nothing at all everyday. I feel no happyness anymore. I don't think I deserve it, but I still want it. I'm barely 18 and I can't see any future ahead of me. I feel like my life ended. I've tried killing myself a couple times. Didn't do it.

159,"So i [23f] posted earlier about my problems and noticed a lot of replies regarding my mother.
She has always been different to other mothers i have noticed. She shouts a lot more and argues a hell of a lot more too.
So in a typical day she would also drink what i would regard as a lot, everyday without fail she will consume a gin and tonic at 4pm, a wine with dinner at 5, another glass at the end of dinner, a sherry and possibly a port. When she does drink she gets a little roudy but who doesn't? I am also aware she is from a generation which she uses as an excuse for drinking so much. She does claim she drinks when she is sad and that it is okay and doesn't see a problem. When i want a fag cause i am having a tough time, it is completely different though. 
Since being small she would be fairly erratic. One of my early memories was of her one christmas packing a bag and leaving my dad, unsure why, and we got in the car drove and found her. Picked her up and then went to a family dinner. I found that odd.
She doesn't have friends but that is my fault. So not sure it is too relevant. She has a hard time trusting people. Again partly my fault.
She is a good mother, don't get me wrong she is kind but it always seems to be for herself. When she is with other people she is almost unrecognisable. I find it uncomfortable sometimes. She will often lie about things she is doing or what my sister and i are up to, i think in an attempt to make her life seem better than she thinks it is. 
My father had told me about when she was younger she had anorexia. She claims she used to eat one bowl of cereal a day at one point for years and thinks it is normal. It kind of makes sense as i am 5 ft 5 and weight about 10stone 6 pounds which is a little large but i am working on that. I have been bullied by her for years, for as long as i can remember about my weight and constantly forcing me to eat less, even now at age 23.
She often doesn't believe me and yes i did used to lie a lot, but she also has to know things which aren't her business. I have stopped lying as much to her because it always turns out awful. She will sometimes snoop through my room and try and find things to bring up dirt on me. She makes out like she was in my room putting something away and found it on the floor or something. She and i both know that just wasn't the case. It was hidden. One other thing is she will always call me a slut because i have had mkre boyfriends than my sister. 
She has beaten me as a child for years and now we just don't talk about it. It was so bad i tried to kill myself a few times. She's made me sleep outside in the cold garden on a bench a few times. 
She gets so angry and screams and shouts and slams doors. She is scary sometimes, she jumps to conclusions and never seems to have a justified reason why she flies off the handle. Its bad. It is really bad. 
I know that her mum wasn't always the nicest and was quite cold. Unsure if she learnt that from her. When i visited her she was warm to me but i guess that could have been in her old age making up for the mistakes she made with her own child.
She won't let anyone do anything, i came home from uni and she won't let me do my own washing, clean my own room or bathroom or anything. She knows how she wants it done and she is the only one who can do it.
I love her and no matter how many times she puts me down or hurts me or whatever else, i will never abandon her. I know if i did she would hurt herself.
I would just like to know what others think and if anyone has a mother [43] like this? Would be nice to just get a clue if she is kinda normal. Any further questions just ask.",24May2020,1
160,"I am a 20F, I’ve struggled with depression for a year until the beginning of this year where I decided to change things and work on myself. It’s been a major up and down period and it honestly seems never-ending. 

These past few months I have been doing therapy which helped me discover how my childhood trauma impacts me to this day. Just for some background, basically, my coping mechanism for my absent father is to please him with every action I do - acting like the “obedient nice girl”, this is probably why I went to study abroad - he really values good academic work and intellectual skills. As for my mother, since I was a child I’ve supported her and aimed to fulfill her emotional needs first. Therapist said I am a ‘parentified’ child. Parents are divorced and I lived with my mum until college (just graduated and moved back in with her in my home country). She frames my therapy sessions as me “rummaging in my past” and being selfish for focusing only on my needs. On the other hand, my dad’s advice was for me was to “stop thinking so much about myself” and think of other things in the world like the news. Yesterday I was crying because I felt that I don’t belong anywhere, neither in my university country or in my home country or in my own home, I was sad because I can’t find the home in my self. In the meantime, my dad being in the same room was typing on his phone. This hurt me a lot and I had to go to the toiler to cry even more to get the courage to tell him that this was hurting me. His first response was : I’m working. I have no days off. To which then after he sort of stopped typing. He said he couldnt understand me and so his way of cheering me up was to show me his new socks and shoes: “Have you seen my new socks? And my yellow shoes?”. I felt like the parent at this point. 

This has led to me being entirely focused on how others perceive me, which is why I am very observant and analytical. Every action that I take and thing that I say is focused on making sure the other person’s needs are satisfied, so that they don’t leave me. It’s so tiring to view myself through the eyes of others constantly, feels like I am constantly judged for my every step. 

This is not the authentic me. I feel like I can’t access it - like it’s there but I keep pushing it away. It is as if it’s hidden underneath the fear of not pleasing someone, of being left. How do I access it ? How do I fully deeply love myself? 

Every time I put in effort for self love what I achieve crumbles down. Where is the way out? I feel like I have a deep seated feeling that I am not worthy, and loving myself is so hard. How do I transform this? Has anyone felt this way? 

I’m so tired. I feel like I can’t be the best version of myself because I’m just not myself. 

I’m not sure what I expect by posting this. Just felt like letting it out.

A lot of love for everyone out here.",24May2020,1

I’m not sure what to do and I was hoping if anyone could tell me what are things you wished someone would tell you while you’re distancing yourself from everyone and experiencing derealization 24/7.

I already recorded a guided meditation for him that helps with grounding since he also said my voice relaxes him and I saw grounding is good when you’re experiencing derealization so I hope that helps at least a tiny bit. He doesn’t really reply to my messages anymore so I’m sending him kind things every day in the hope he at least sees them, I don’t need him to reply (but maybe I should just let him take his space). It’s just that I can’t relate the struggles of derealization so I have been doing lots and lots of research to be most helpful

But in the end people who actually experience it can tell me best what helps and what doesn’t. Maybe you know encouraging caring things to say, things NOT to do or say, or things we could do (over the phone). Basically any advice would be greatly appreciated :)",24May2020,1
164,"Hi im an 18 year old guy, about to turn 19 pretty soon. About 4 months ago I was feeling perfectly fine, but all of a sudden i started getting headaches. At first I ignored them but eventually my anxiety kicked (I thought I was dying) in because the headaches got worse and lasted all day. Then I started getting these weird feelings or episodes where I felt a strong feeling of deja vu and physically felt sick like I was going to throw up. They started happening multiple times every day and it seems like that's what made my anxiety and mental state decline. The headaches were annoying and I couldn't enjoy anything because I was always in pain. Anyways over time too I was being irrational and I started  to feel like the headaches were making  me dumb and slow. So I started overthinking and nitpicking everything I did. Other things like when gas comes up my throat and makes my breathing feel weird started happening more often along with my constant nitpicking and overthinking everything caused me to have panic attacks. By this point it had been three months of all this crap and I was a nervous wreck. During the whole day I couldn't relax at all and was obsessively thinking about the negative things that were going to happen to me, like I was going to go crazy. Recently the panic attacks got worse and I really started to believe I was going crazy just because of my way of thinking. It feels like my last panic attack made things worse. To summarize my way of thinking I feel like im not acting like myself, I feel like im not in control of myself or my thoughts sometimes (like I don't exist or I am nothing), I feel like im not real, and I am scared because I feel like I am going crazy; I don't want to go completely crazy but I feel like im pretty close to it and it worries me. I obsess and overthink everything and it sucks. I feel horrible every day and its like I cant relax or get better. Thanks for reading, but what do you think is going on/causing all of this?

I starved myself for two years before that and I was reluctant to ever let him see me in a swimsuit because each time he saw every bone in my rib cage, hip bones, and the bones in my back, he got scared and begged me to eat instead of chugging down water all day. For me, the starvation wasn’t just about being skinny after my family bullied me for being chubby as a child, but I enjoyed the feeling of euphoria that came with it and how light I suddenly felt. It only ended when my boyfriend started making me eat and taking me to therapy-something my mother didn’t do because she was proud of me for losing 40 lbs in 2 months. As soon as I started eating again, I gained all the weight back and even more, only to find out I had an intestinal condition that would cause weight gain on its own. Anyway, I’ve recently lost my will to eat anything after my mother started making comments on my obvious shortcomings in my appearance and the hunger is easy for me to ignore. I feel light again and I’m scared because I know how addictive the starvation is-the euphoria. I haven’t eaten in two days and I like this feeling too much. Last night, I had a dream that I was eating sugary foods and that only happens when my eating disorder is active. I’ve mentioned it to my psychiatrist and she’s been trying to help me but I don’t know how to cope. And why would she be concerned about my serotonin levels when mentioning this subject?

168,"Got in a big fight with parents and now home alone for the weekend. Not sure how to resolve this issue...

On Thursday evening, me and my parents got into a pretty heated argument. The argument itself was very trivial, but it got out of hands very fast and shit hit the fan. It got to the point where I decided to stay back for the weekend and not go up to our lake house because I needed some space. 


These arguments usually result in a follow up conversation prompted by my parents, where it always results in them heavily criticizing my behaviors for being the crux of the argument, and then punishing me. They indirectly give a very insincere apology as there both too stubborn to even acknowledge the slightest bit that how they behaved was uncalled for. It’s always very one sided, as they get very defensive when I explain to them how they hurt me. They completely mute out everything I say and act like my feelings and emotions mean nothing at all. These conversations are very ineffective because as I’m left to reflect on how I can change actions and behaviors, my parents never actually make an effort to improve on there behaviors because they’re heads are both up each other’s assholes. So ultimately, nothings actually resolved or fixed. 

I’m thinking about writing a letter to them apologizing for my wrongdoings, although I still feel very hurt and betrayed by them, as when this argument occurred, i tried to implement one of the techniques they said we would use in order to de-escalate the situation, but that only caused them to act more belligerent. This happens almost EVERY time, but this time I’m done with them choosing to not make any effort. I’ve tried multiple times expressing to them how they make me feel and they don’t even validate anything I’m saying. Family therapy doesn’t do shit either as they use it as a way to abuse there authority and basically use it as a tool to just rebuke me even more. Does anyone have any advice as what I should do?",24May2020,1
169,"Hello Reddit, I don't know how to start this. I just spent a good hour balling my eyes out like a baby, it was ugly that's for sure. I'm 20 years old and I'm currently living in Canada and I'm in a relationship with a girl who lives all the way in Australia, it's only been a few months but I've known her for years, we where good friends, and I met her on PS4 (unusual, I know) she's amazing, like honestly she's the perfect, she's understanding of my mental health and super supportive, shes just my sunshine, always clearing up cloudy or rainy days. This September we're gonna plan her coming here for a few weeks, we've both been working and saving money to make it possible but here's what's wrong. During this whole pandemic we've had the chance to spend alot of time together, phone calls, movies, games etc. But as the pandemic becomes more contained restrictions are starting to loosen up, she's gonna be going back to uni again plus her job and spending time with her friends, it's beautiful and I'm so proud of how far she's come but I'm worried, worried we might not talk as much, that she might find someone else or just flat out lose feelings, I'll never try and control her and who she hangs out with but holy hell did I ever have a breakdown, it makes me sick the thought of losing her, plus reading stuff online about being too attached can drive your partner away but I've always been this way, I have a hard time when it comes to feeling a connection with people but when I fall, I fall hard. I can't help but feel like I'm overbearing, she says she doesn't mind reassuring me but I don't want to be a burden to her, I just want to be there and watch her accomplish all of the amazing things she's going to do in life, I know it's odd to say that you want to spend the rest of your life with someone, especially at my age and with someone you met online but god dammit I do. I'm just scared my mental health will impact our relationship, I can't be having full on meltdowns everytime I get some sort of cue that she might leave, it's not good for me nor is it good for her. I really want this to work, I've been in relationships in the past and have made mistakes but I've learned from them, this is just one mountain I can't conquer and I need help, I struggle with anxiety and depression and (for the most part) I have it under control, I am medicated for it.

176,"I've been told by a few different professionals and family members that they think I have PTSD. I'd agree there is something wrong with me, but I can't say for certain that one incident has caused me to have PTSD. I've been through a few traumatic things in my life, but it's not like I relive the memories or have flashbacks. I also have complete aphantasia, so I can't really get flashbacks, and I'm starting to think I might have SDAM as well, as I'm not sure I relive memories, good or bad, like other people do. I can't actually ""relive"" a memory, I just know that stuff has happened or I've done stuff, and I tend to only remember well things I've told people about.

Is that what therapy is for, in my case; to find the cause of the PTSD, or is it something I would know about.

Which is how I now realized that I had experienced trauma because it is true that I experienced an event that I could not make sense of and that I did not do anything about, I just ignored it and I flat helpless to do anything about it. Because I ignored the original trauma it’s residual effects built up (which I also did not cope with I just ignored) and I developed social anxiety and depression and PTSD symptoms which my therapist considers to the clinical level.

Now that I’ve gone to therapy and I’ve mentally made sense of my traumatic incident. What normally happens to the effects the trauma caused?

178,"I'm a 19 year old guy from Finland who's been struggling with depression and social anxiety for the past five years. Lately it's been getting a lot better and I feel like I'm starting to finally be free of this shit. 

I don't have that many people outside my family that I consider friends. I would say I have about three close(er) friends. This is not a problem for me. I enjoy being alone and if I feel the need to socialize I can just talk to my parents or someone else in the family. This has led to me not hanging out with my friends unless we're doing something else at the same time. I work out with one of my friends, and that's about it. It's usually feels like enough for me.

A couple of days ago I got an invitation from one of the three friends to attend a small gathering with some of his friends (don't worry, we made sure to meet regulations in our country). I was pretty skeptical about it at first but decided to accept. I didn't have any high expectations, in the past I've learnt that it's a bad idea.

It went pretty well I'd say. I knew them all from before at least a little and I have no trouble actually talking to people (only initializing). We played some card games and they drank alcohol. I did not because of my medication. Fine by me. All in all, it was a pretty fun night.

When I got home I was so tired I just went to sleep. The next day I just felt empty, like there was something missing. I haven't felt like that in a long time but I know the feeling all too well. It just felt so pointless. As in, ""Why do I bother hanging out with people if it doesn't bring me any happiness lasting more than an hour?"" I know that it's supposedly good for you to be social, but to me it felt like I could've just stayed home and everything would be the same, if not better. 

If I get invited again I'll definitely go, but I want to make something more of it for myself. I just don't know why I feel worse after doing this. It was fun, but it didn't make me happy. It made me feel inferior and like an outsider, in a way. I guess it was sort of underwhelming. I thought that since people do this regularly it must be pretty good. It was just meh.

I realise how contradictory this seems. ""It was fun,"" vs ""It was meh."" I really don't know. Any ideas?",24May2020,1

Imagine home: it is a wondrous place,

A land of warmth where a fire flames

With comfort that wraps you like a 

Blanket. Then imagine, reader, after 

These feelings reach their peak, that 

Your world changes and it becomes

That home never existed. You long for 

A memory that you had but which does

Not exist. Imagine wanting to go home

But then realising you have no home 

To go to. This pit of experience is 

The brightest a day can get. The brain 

Works against you, becomes the whisk

In a whirlpool of desolation: hopeful 

Emptiness smothers you.

This is what it feels like, those days 

When your head feels heavy, when the 

Book or game you love is of no interest.

When you long for and loathe the 

Company of others. You want to invite 

People in to then push them away

To punish yourself. Pain is the only thing

That feels real, that can break through

The numbness. Broken glass, shattered

China, fragments of things once whole;

These can provide relief. A sharp edge 

Can draw feeling with blood, a mark

To remind yourself you are nothing.

You will not look back, you will not 

Regret, because there is nothing,

Nothing more for you, no more smiles, 

No more laughter, no more love.

The pain prepares you for the 

Acceptance that you are truly 

Abandoned. No one cares.

And then it goes, and now you have no

Sympathy for that other person. 

They won’t come back you say.

184,"TLDR: The online therapist my parents forced me to see basically pressured me into letting him regularly tell my parents everything we talked about and now I can’t even think of going to a therapist without getting extremely anxious and don’t think I’ll ever trust one again.

Although I’m pretty sure I’m overreacting about it, my first experience with therapy was absolutely awful. I came home one day to find my parents had read through my journal and found that I was suicidal. From here my parents immediately forced me into online therapy (understandable I guess). This absolutely sucked because who reads someone’s journal like that??? But then the therapist... Although I felt a tiny bit better during our talks because he was genuinely someone I could’ve gotten along with outside of therapy (I’ve always been that kid that sits with the adults enjoying those conversations more than with kids my age at parties), overal he made me feel even more depressed than I already was. He gave me normal school amounts of homework. Honestly it was the worst thing ever for me because I’m someone with anxiety around disappointing others (such as by not completing homework) while also being too depressed to do work. He also pretty much listened to what my parents said I had, and made no effort to actually figure out what was wrong (besides making sure I wasn’t hearing voices because of some of my fears). He made no effort to actually diagnose me (besides saying I had “depressive traits” whatever that means). The worst part is that every fourth call my parents would join and he’d basically pressure me into letting him tell my parents everything I had talked to him about. Technically he wasn’t violating anything but I didn’t feel like I really had a choice in the matter. This made it so I didn’t feel I could trust him at all and basically faked my way into making him think I was fine way faster than I logically would be. Years later my boyfriend made me try talking to the therapist at school and I had such bad anxiety attacks about it that he had to come with my and basically talk for me whenever possible because I’m still so traumatised by it. I stopped that too and now 2 years after that I still haven’t had any proper help and I don’t know how I’ll be able to get it. I know my boyfriend is willing to come with me again if I manage to get the courage next year because he knows how terrible the first guy was, but I don’t know how I’m supposed to even get proper help if I’m terrified of telling a therapist anything.",24May2020,1

187,"I struggle to trust anyone, so I don’t open up at all. Keep everything in my head, to myself, and just hide what I’m thinking as to not burden anyone else, or just because I can’t trust them. I know that people don’t lie often to me, but there’s times where it seems like whatever they say is just either lies or prancing around the truth, even I do that. And with that, it adds to the fact that I can’t trust people. 

I don’t have much motivation to do anything. Whether it be as bad as to get out of bed that day, or to do daily tasks around the house, or to work for university. I tend to get bored with trying to work for uni early and then just let it build it until I have 5 assignments due in two days’ time and then rush and struggle to get it all done, and no matter what, if I’m trying to concentrate on doing something for uni, the slightest of things distract me, any noise what so ever, so I listen to music to cut the noise out, but with that I just start zoning out. I can be reading a book and eventually end up in the middle of four different ones that I just leave for a couple of weeks. I smoke because of no other reason thboredom, just to be doing. 

I need to be helpful to others, but with that is the main need of wanting some sort of validation. But even when I do get validation from them for being there or doing something, it doesn’t mean anything to me, its like they are lying to me because I don’t see the good in what I actually did. I don’t see the reasoning behind doing it to begin with. Other than the validation that I don’t believe is genuine. 

I do not care about things.

I get angry over nothing, and then go looking for fights and arguments, and sometimes these arguments lead to me changing into a different person, fuelled by anger and disgust in myself and a lack of empathy and sympathy so I say things that I cant even think of normally and when its all over and done with, I feel vile and nasty because I know that what I did was not right and unnecessary, but there’s nothing that can change that. Its like I become somone else.

Building on that, yes everyone has their moods, so do I, moods of either anger for no reason, or completely ecstatic or just happy, either way, then moods of just “depression”(don’t know other words to really use), and there are also times of not feeling anything at all, not like neutrality, but like nothing at all.

I don’t feel like the world is really and the only time I feel like a human is on the internet. I couldn’t keep up with school work and I’ve spent the past year and a half between withdraw and trying to cold turkey my addiction. I can’t fucking do it. In the last month I couldn’t keep up with school work. Recently my attempts to bear my addiction have ended in some very scary suicidal thoughts. I realized if I keep doing this I will end up dead so I stopped. I asked for help told my parents and am now seeing a therapist. I am going to see a doctor in two days and hopefully medicine will help me. I’ve done a very good job of hiding my problems for a long period of time. My parents haven’t suspected anything so they think this is just a recent problem. 

I’ve been ramming my head into this barrier that is keeping me from living a real life for almost two fucking years. The only reason I live is so that I might see the other side. I’ve kind of given up at this point. I’m sort of relying on an external force to fix this for me. Either medicine therapy or something else but I’ve given up on my own. I pretty much play video games all day go to sleep wake up and do the same thing. My parents are getting angry at me because they don’t think I’m fighting. They don’t think I’ve put in an effort to fix my problems but they can’t see the picture. I tell them every time they suggest something for me to do that they don’t fucking get it. I love my parents but they are really really fucking ignorant. I don’t think they really know me at this point. They were unable to see me suffering for a full year and now no matter how hard I try to communicate to them that they don’t understand they continue to try and fix my problems for me. I don’t know what to do. I tell them I’ve tried but they don’t believe me. I’ve lied to them a lot so I guess I’ve lost their trust. The only reason I live is because I think that there is hope for me but they don’t think I want to get better. My mom told me to turn my life around or she will shut my phone off. They have no faith in me and don’t seem to understand that I can’t just do that. It’s not that simple. It’s the only thing I’ve been working for for the past year and a half of my life. I’ve missed out on half of my high school because of this fucking bullshit. I want this more than anyone could imagine. I think I would genuinely kill to feel normal again. They can’t see it. They think I’m lazy. I don’t know what to do. They don’t know me anymore and for some reason I’ve lost capability to communicate with them. They never believe me. I’m fucked. I have too much to worry about. It’s like all they care about is me achieving. They don’t care about me feeling good again. They fucking yell at me when I’m sitting alone in my room thinking about how it would be easier to kill myself than to fight my demons. My parents have been the most loving people since the day I was born and I’ve been so blessed. I guess they’ve lost sight of the fact that I’m still the same person. I just have a problem.

But I think I have bpd (borderline personality disorder) and I once told my therapist at the time that I thought I had this but she dismissed it. And I thought she was right so I left it. But after reviewing some things, like symptoms and signs, causes and watching videos from ppl who have it, I released it seems a heck of a lot like I have it. I also found out there's a ""quiet"" version which is essentially the same thing except you show the symptoms more internally or it's not shown as outwardly as another person with bpd might. So yeah I think I have the quiet version which might be why it might not have been obvious.

I told my mom about it recently and she was dismissive of it and was like ""don't claim it"" but she's okay with me having depression and anxiety?? Anyway, I think because the signs that might give it away are on the quiet side and aren't shown so much on the outside, it's harder to believe.

I am aware and sad of the pandemic and how it is affecting so many people's lives negatively and even taking lives, but 2020 has by far been of the best years for me.  We're 6 months in and I'm trying to sulk in this happiness and content-ness I feel with myself and with my life but as days go by, I am starting to feel more anxious because I'm anticipating a negative wave. It sort of feels surreal that I've been feeling like myself again for so long... which starts to make me think that the negative wave can hit any minute.

-I sleep for hours and can’t wake up unless someone forces me up

-I disappoint my sisters because my mood changes from all happy and energetic to sad and not wanting to do anything except hide and this makes them think I’m lazy 

-I randomly get into this bad mind states when I was just happy and I feel gross and I don’t wanna anyone to come near me or talk to me but it makes me feel reallly bad. For example I’ll be wearing a tank top and a skirt and I’ll feel great and that I look great. A lot of the time I’ll still feel this way but sometimes in a split second I get this dark feeling (feels like it’s in my stomach) and my mood changes from 100 to 0 so quick and all I wanna do is go home and change into as much clothing as possible. 

- I randomly wanna talk to people again that I despised yesterday and I wanna become their friends again but about an hour or less later I hate them again 

- I’m all excited and wanna do so many things but then later I suddenly sink really low and I don’t wanna do anything or get up and I get really sad that I almost start sobbing. 

- Sometimes I’ll get very hyper but also irritable which causes me to annoy the people around me. Then this “hyperness” turns into me almost getting violent because something so little annoyed me in that moment.

I'm really tall, and it makes me feel like a disgustingly filthy giant. The worst thing is when my parents' friends come over and i get told for the 113th time that ""You're so tall"" and ""You seem to be gettin taller every time i see you!"". I always want to cry when i hear it, but i have to put on a smile and just pretend that haha, yeah, that's so nice of you to say.

201,"To summarize my situation to the attention span of the internet:

* I am a 19yo oldest kid in a family that relies more on me than I can rely on them
* I have little to no social contact, and the contact I have is at school
* I am graduating in a week and my family plans on moving out to the middle of nowhere (away from everyone I know)
* The second time we've moved away from all social support I had in the last 2 years

I had a mental breakdown today realizing that in a couple months, I'll be wishing I were as isolated as I am now, since where I am going, I might as well be dead to the very few people I talk to at school. For all I know, I am freaking out about something completely normal in life that people just deal with. I don't have violent trauma, or an abusive family, or a life of poverty or want. I just feel like I might as well live on Mars with no oxygen, since that's about the equivalent of how disconnected I will be from people. To make things worse, I know some pretty amazing people and they tell me - believably - that they've got my back. I know better. Their efforts are wasted on me, and in a half a year, it will be like they never knew me. So why the hell am I alive? The most reasonable answer is because I have already been through a suicidal phase and that's the path of weakness and greed. I made a vow to myself to never even consider that path again, and it's held, despite all efforts of my sick brain. I have the capabilities to live a ""normal life"" - I even already have a cashier job at a local drug store - but it doesn't matter. No one needs one extra cashier, especially if I end up without any kind of social contact. I'm no good to anyone except my family, since they need help around the house and watching little siblings.

I'm going to rot away like this. I might even go to college and rot faster in an empty dorm room. But everyone's lonely, right? I should just man up, take it and progress through life like everyone else. No one's going to mourn me, so there's no point in dying. Might as well make whatever contribution I can to society, marginally increase some company's revenue and make my parents's lives a little easier. The plus side is that lonely people age faster.

Forgive the unstructured format of this post, I'm just a little ticked about how pointless everything is at the moment. Might end up coming back to this and removing it since I usually spew nonsense when I'm this depressed. Soon, I'll be back to pretending I'm not constantly dying inside because I know I'm not just going to die alone, I will be living alone the entire time. But that's just how life is, I guess. I wish it wouldn't make it hard to get out of bed, though.

Congrats, you've reached the end of the post! Thanks for reading. I have no one to talk to irl, so this is my way of venting. By the way, don't pull the punches in the comments. I don't think anyone could actually hurt my feelings at this point.

I've got at least a dozen issues with eating properly. Mostly rooted in depression, PTSD, dissociation, and having a small budget. It's not because of my self-image, has never been. That's why I'm here, I want to gain weight. My life-long underweight and barely-normal-weight are starting to take a toll on me and I can't have that any longer.

Without going into all the details, **here's what I need**:

* Easily **accessible** *(grocery stores, no long preparation)*
* **Cheap** *(total food budget is 125€ a month)*
* Excessively **high calorie density** *(got a small stomach)*
* **Vegetarian**+ *(no meat, no fish, no raw animal milk, no raw eggs)*
* **Balanced** components *(no raw sugar, some is fine but not too much)*
* **Soft texture** *(the drier and harder it is the less I get down)*

203,"I‘m 20 years old and suffer from depression and social anxiety. I‘m studying psychology (bachelor, 4th semster) but I don‘t really like it. Otherwise I don‘t know what else to do. I don‘t know what to do after university or what I like. 

Studying is very hard and difficult for me at the moment, I‘m not interested or motivated. Additionally my brain doesn‘t function at all right now: I can‘t focus or remember things. In online classes I‘m present the whole time but I can‘t follow the topics, tasks, what the docent or other students say. After classes I can‘t remember anything from it. I start to skip classes more often because of my disability to concentrate or function and because of my social anxiety which messes me even more up when having to answer a question or doing group work. 

My brain turned completely empty, unable to function and dumb in the last month. I can‘t think at all and in conversations I don‘t know what to talk about. I can‘t follow conversations or the uni classes, it‘s just so incredibly hard focussing and understanding. I can‘t remember books and texts I read, movies I watched, conversations I had with people, days or holidays I experienced like some days ago or maybe weeks, months ago. 

It seems like I can‘t access my head, thoughts or memories. I have no concentration and memory anymore. I have nothing to talk about. I‘m socially anxious. I can‘t handle university anymore. I can‘t handle social situations. I can‘t learn anything or new things anymore. I read things and forget them. How can a person that is almost unable to think, concentrate and learn things develop or be useful in any job? How can a person with depression and social anxiety ever be able to be happy in life, to socialize and also like it, find friends, love and so on. According social life how could a person like this even good father, friend, boyfriend, husband when he can‘t even think clearly, be intelligent, be confident in front of others, be happy, doesn‘t know what to talk about, can‘t get access to his own thoughts and memories and so on.

I feel so so so dumb, shy, anxious, depressive and worthless. And this extremely bad cognition I now have is something that adds up much to my depression. The social anxiety always did but the very strange and strong cognition issues and blocks I have right now are adding up to my low self worth and confidence and future anxiety.

So what I‘m struggling with right now really are these cognition issues and blocks I have because now everything seems impossible and unattainable for me. Before it only was being happy abd having a normal life with socializing because of depression and social anxiety. Now without some cognition or able to follow, understand and learn things my life falls apart even more.",24May2020,1

206,"Before anyone gets too worried. I have recently revisited a psychiatrist. I’ve been diagnosed wit BPD, am on meds and will be getting therapy soon, so on with my point. 

I (22f) always was a more chunky person. Heavily overweight but nothing serious that people would share concern. When I turned 18 and went to university I decided to go vegan for a bit because of the healthy benefits of it, and because I wanted to finally lose weight. I wasn’t overly obsessed, just ready to make a change. I started going to the gym and lifted weights, did cardio, the works. 

As the weight dropped and I became fitter, my body turning to chunky to a curvy woman, I became more self conscious. I became so critical of myself, thinking I was just as fat, if not more so than before despite knowing I lost weight and am thinner. My self hatred began to manifest over the years. 

Cut to graduation of university, July 2020, life began unwinding and going from messy to hell. I became severely depressed from losing everything I cared about. I gained weight, more than I had in years. I wasn’t fat anymore, but I wasn’t who I constantly wanted myself to be. The previous summer I resulted in starving myself to 1000 calories a day to lose weight, sitting in ice baths and doing cardio before heading to my internship with coffee as my breakfast. 

I developed body dysmorphia, finding myself being critical of people with great bodies, and catching myself doing this regularly, and I’d wonder... why do I think they’re fat? They’re not. 

Now, whenever I return to social media, which is filled with fitness influencers and people in crazy amazing shape and I just cry instantly. I feel so horrible and gross. 

I feel so damn worthless. I want to enjoy social media but it nothing but a trigger for me now. I know with time I can get help, but somehow, I just want to end up being as good as them. I just want to finally be like them, even though I know deep down, it’s not realistic for my type of body. At least not for someone who does anything fitness related professionally.",24May2020,1
207,"Ok so I am 20 years old, male. I haven't had a serious relationship for a while and it's killing me.

A bit about me:
I believe I'm pretty good looking, I don't want to go into too much detail on that. I'm pretty healthy (although lockdown has increased my alcohol consumption, but this issue existed well prior to covid), I teach sports for a job, and I go the gym when I have time.

Without giving specifics, my future prospects are really good, professionally. I already own two businesses, graduating university soon, and I have talent in my field. Literally, on paper I have nothing to be depressed about. 

Analysing myself on the OCEAN personality traits:
I am quite open to new opportunities.
I am very conscientious.
I am quite introverted. I have a small group of close friends, but that's it.
I'm neither agreeable or disagreeable.
I have very high neuroticism.

I'm not sure how much this matters, but hopefully it gives perspective to who I am. Anyway, onto the issue:

I really want to see a doctor, I have been struggling with depression for about 7 years, on and off. And I still haven't seen a doctor. It's stupid of me but I can't build up the courage. All my friends know, but my family don't. I'm not in a position where I'd feel comfortable telling them.

When I was 17, I went through a terrible breakup. I was cheated on and the circumstances were not good. I dealt with this pretty poorly, but only as good as a confused 17 year old could.

Although I acknowledge the girl was bad, cheating is unacceptable  I've yet to find anyone who reaches her league. I've had a lot of on and offs with girls but always ended pretty badly. And the one night stands I've had (which really aren't my thing) have been with girls I'm not even attracted to.

I'm at a point now which it's driving me crazy. I crave an intimate relationship with a girl, but I am unable to establish one, and my introversion doesn't exactly provide me with any ideas. However, don't get confused between introversion and shyness - I'm a confident person, going up to a girl doesn't bother me too much, I'm just not eccentric and tend to keep to myself. Eccentricity is something I'm looking to build, I am working on adapting my personality, if possible.

I'd like some advice please. Perhaps this may be the wrong sub, but then again, this is really affecting my mental health and making be so depressed. I can't be bothered with the usual ""just focus on yourself and put your effort into other things"" because I've done that. I'm ready for a relationship. It seems to be the only thing missing from my life. Has anyone got any ideas? Apologies if this is the wrong sub, if it is, where should I repost?",24May2020,1

211,"My boyfriend has diagnosed GAD and I’m pretty sure undiagnosed depression. He’s been seeing a counselor now for about 2 months, after putting it off for the few years we’ve been together. Sometimes it’s difficult to deal with his moods, especially when we’re always together during quarantine. 

The other day, he just shut himself away in our guest bedroom all day. I went to check on him, but he was just out of it. Most days, though, he will have episodes of what I can only describe as malaise - he will lay around on the floor for an hour or more, just checked out on his phone. I ask him what I can do to help, but his answer is always that he doesn’t know. 

Especially when he plays video games, he is very hard on himself. He blames himself for losing, even hitting himself as “punishment”. He’s always spouting off self-deprecating phrases like “I’m the worst” or “Why am I so stupid?” It is difficult to sit there and watch him do this to himself. 

Most of the time, I’m at a loss for what to do. Do I ignore it?

213,"Since being in quarantine, I have noticed an interesting phenomenon happen to me. Usually it happens after I’ve been in the same spot for too long, like watching television. Something will innately remind me of a dream I recently had (I have vivid dreams and often have good enough memory of them to associate something in my waking life with them) and then... well it’s hard to explain. I’ll start having sort of a panic attack where my reality seems unfamiliar. My heart rate speeds up and it’s as if I cannot place myself in reality. Usually what I do is breathe deeply and ground myself, thinking about extremely basic things (“that’s a chair I sit in sometimes. That’s a tablecloth. That’s the cranberry juice I just poured,” and stuff like that) and that has always helped and then I feel normal. It’s very strange and alarming to have random panic attacks like these.

I am 21 years old, so I doubt it’s a memory loss type of disease, especially because these episodes have been few and momentary in nature. I’ve also never done any sort of psychedelic drug so it isn’t a side effect from one of those. The closest thing I have considered it to be is dissociation? I’m not even sure it qualifies as that.

214,"There is a relative of mine who lives together at home since i was born, and i get really disturbed by him as i became a teenager. Things like 'tell a trusted adult' or 'move out' and all are NOT options in your typical Asian family, so i hope i don't see those. 

He is basically someone who believes what he wants to believe - always thinks he is right - criticises everyone else other than himself - never happy/satisfied with what we do - pinpoints every single problem if one doesnt exist - makes up what he wants to hear - tells others to do things that even he may not do himself.

I think you get the idea, and i acknowledge the fact that i can't be hoping that he will change at his age. So i'm looking for a solution within myself. Although, there is no real solution, just management of the situations. To contrast that character above, i tend to be sensitive - hate being framed/accused - get angry a lot - absorb issues and let them really get, get INTO my mind - take everything to heart. If he finds a problem and scenario to scold me as discipling, he also brings up other hurtful, irrelevant issues about my personal self. An example is how i was deemed as ungrateful to my family, when only i know how much i care about all of them. It sounds minor but try expanding it 10x more, i don't know how to put it in more words.

When i was younger, i used to talk back and he scolded my a lot for disrespecting. It's well-known that in Asian families if you respond or correct something, it's automatically talking back haha! He's even thrown a french fry at my face before (it is debatable whether he has the same rights as my parents but we shall not go into that). So that has created a lot of trauma for me, when bad, similar incidents repeat, my mind flashes all of the previous together and overfills itself. Just, i really suffer mentally when that happens.

After that, as years went by, i learnt to shut up and vent my anger through ranting. But from time to time, i do speak up, and of course, get really raged at by him. I would take about 3 days to get over it and then move on. During that 'recovery period', every single moment of the day, my mind will refresh vividly what happened and kill me. Covid's making him make his own rules as well, so he is acting up even more.

This week, twice in a row i had problems with him and i feel really suffocated. At this point, i wonder if i need help. I don't even know if what i'm going through is serious enough. Whenever i get scolded/survive from talking back and go back to my room, i feel like my breathing rate increases and my chest feels constricted. I won't be able to move much and i will just sit in the corner, stare and cry, or WAIL helplessly, feeling a surge of emotions. It is really not like those scenes from those tv series, but there is pain. It's confusing for me because i really don't know anyone who goes through a similar situation at all. Sometimes honestly, it's frustrating because there is no one to relate to. I'm hating on life so bad!

At this point, i don't know what i'm trying to put across through this rant. It can just remain as a rant to acknowledge or sympathise to. I don't think it will be fun to hear things like, maybe you can try talking to him; basically anything that involves trying to change the situation bcs nothing will work with a person who makes up their own answers 😂 Am i just being a sensitive, complaining teen? How do i even refer this kind of situation to as? Uh i have anxiety? Perhaps techniques i can try to make myself stronger or something? Or what would you do if it were you?

I get overwhelmed so easily when I think about a) my future, or b) throwing up. I have a SEVERE fear or throwing up; it dictates a lot of my day and all of my routines and regimes are based around it. I only recently realized how big of a deal it is, and how exhausting it is. I've been talking about it in therapy but it hasn't gotten any better.

With guidance form my doc, I have been tapering off Sertraline since April. It has been going great! Until I took the last pill.. 

So to state some facts: 
I have been on Sertraline since around 2011, so it has been quite a few years. I started on 50 mg, then years later 100mg, and years later 150mg. Till I decided that I wanted to go off. I have been tapering off with my doctors advice. I went from 150 to 100 mg, and gave it three Weeks. Then I went from 100 to 50mg and gave it 3 Weeks, and now from 50 to 25 the last week (this was a decision on my part). 
I took the last pill, 25 mg, last tuesday. It went well until thursday were I experienced horrible brain zaps. They come every few seconds, last for about a second, and then I go without having one for several minutes, then it comes again.

It doesn't Hurt, but it does make me Dizzy, disoriented and feels like Short Black outs. They're very uncomfortable, but very normal from what I have read from several sources from the internet. They're worst when I'm up and walk around. 

Anyway, friday went fine and I could be up and a out, but the zaps took a turn for the worse and had me bedridden again saturday. Also All Sunday today has had me bedridden and tired. From what I could read the drug should be completely out of my system around monday.

My question is: has anyone experienced this? And how Long did it go before stuff was sorta normal?",24May2020,1

 When it comes to my personality I would say I'm pretty ignorant. I stopped caring about others opinions on me and about them as a person(mostly people from my school). I think their lifestyle is self-destructive and useless they just go smoking, drinking cofee and talking about random bullshit all the time. I think my problem is that I focus on myself too much if thats a thing. I want to make something of myself and in my spare time rather than being social and stuff I would rather play guitar(I'm a metalhead), draw, workout, study or learn some stuff. Maybe it's weird,  but next year is the final year of high school and I'm going to university so I will split up with those friends and I have this gut feeling that I will remain alone. My carrer choice is also not helping cause I want to enroll as a marine cadet. 
 In conclusion, I'm sorry if it's all over the place and random. Just some thoughts about life so far.",24May2020,1

221,"I’m 20 and suffer from depression and social anxiety. I can’t study, think critically or focus and I start losing all motivation to even try to. I have very strong issues with my concentration and memory at the moment.

I’m inarticulate when I used to be well spoken.

I don’t have opinions on certain topics. I can‘t find anything to talk about in conversations. I can‘t follow conversations because I just can‘t focus. 

For the same reason I just can‘t focus in uni online classes. I‘m present all time but I don‘t remember what the docent said two seconds ago and so after classes I leave without remembering anything from it. You can imagine how this makes university and life even harder for a person that already suffers from depression and social anxiety.

Often I don‘t remember what I read in books or texts, what happened in a movie I watched, what I talked about with someone, what I experienced last day/week/month and so on. 

I feel like I can’t even think anymore... like my mind is empty. I feel like I don’t know ANYTHING. It’s like I forgot everything I’ve ever learned or experienced.

I start to skip classes more often because of this adding up to my depression and social anxiety. It‘s just so incredibly hard focussing and understanding. 

My brain turned completely empty, unable to function and dumb in the last time. It seems like I can‘t access my head, thoughts or memories. I have no concentration and memory, I can‘t learn new things anymore. I read things I’m interested in and and then I forget them. And seriously how could someone develop not being able to learn?

I think having depression and anxiety for many years is the cause of my cognitive deficiency. Does/did anyone here experience similar? How can I demolish those problems? They really took the last ability I had in life as depression and social anxiety took the others...",24May2020,1
222,"•Keep away from Toxic People. They’ll infect you in ways you cannot imagine.
•Stay Grateful. No matter where you are in life, or what is happening, be aware there are always people struggling more than you are. It keeps perspective.
•Make Time for Things You Love. Hard to do, but so very important. Do you love playing guitar or have a hobby you never get time for? Need to spend more time with your significant other? Make it a priority.
•Stay as Physically Healthy as Possible. Go to your yearly checkups even if you don’t feel like it, do physical therapy if you need to, take the medication you are supposed to be taking. If you have an addiction - address it.
•Sleep! If you’ve ever had bad nights of sleep, you know how they can just cripple your mood and functioning. Sleeping well helps you stay well mentally.
•Examine How You Think. What’s your automatic response to events, people, or situations - is it positive or negative? Try to examine how you approach the world and challenge yourself to see the potential even in tough situations, rather than the detriments. Over time, it gets more natural to see the positive.
•Get Active. You don’t have to be a Crossfit warrior, but you should move every day - take a walk, hike, stroll the city, bike or hit the gym if you want….and don’t bring your phone.
•Make Time for Friends. Laughing and getting out of your own headspace is really important. Make time to socialize with friends, get out of the house, and make it a priority.
•Do things for Others. Helping others helps you, and it makes you feel really good. It might be helping out at a soup kitchen once a month, walking dogs at your local humane society, or just assisting an elderly neighbor mow their lawn or get groceries, but it’s absolutely a game-changer to do things for others.
•See Food as Fuel. If you power your body with terrible things, it’s going to feel a lot more terrible than it needs to. Try to limit processed foods, sugar, and fried foods and stick with healthier options when you can. It helps your brain, your mood, and your attention span.",24May2020,1
223,"Since Quarantine started, I haven't been the same as normally. I have a hard time eating and I'm never hungry. I'm always tired. I find myself arguing with my family over insignificant things to extremes. I've been serial cussing, sleeping in, I can't seem to find the desire to shower or bathe. I've lost the desire to do anything. My friends can't go out, neither can I. Around the start of May I found myself crying without warning, just a sudden rush of emotion, and occurs subsequently every couple days. I've stopped doing my schoolwork, It just seems pointless. Everything seems so insignificant. I need advice on what to do. I cannot make contact with a therapist or any other medical professional since I live in a very rural area, so I need a way to cope on my own. Please comment your two cents.

224,I have went though periods of hearing voices for extended periods of time since around February this year. I blame my meds for it.

225," So I've been ""Seeing"" my online therapist for over 3 years. We do texts and audio messages. IT's usually me doing audio messages and she responds with texts. Over the past few months her responses are just shorter and shorter. It didn't bug me too much until now when I 'm really fucking doing shitty, i've told her over and over that I've been super dperessed and anxious (quarantine really making my preexisting shit worse) and I feel like I need a lot more help than she's giving.

Does anyone have advice for how to bring this up with her / possibly break up with her? and then the next part is finding a new therapist.... i would want one who could do full video sessions and more than texting and audio since that's what i need right now. i know how to find ones who accept my insurance but like..... how did you guys find one that you liked?",24May2020,1
226,"Throw away account because we all know ""asking for a friend"" is a give away. 


 A little backstory here, I grew up in a abusive home where I was severely isolated growing up. Very isolated. I got out as an adult by running away, getting in a abuse shelter where I got counselling and managed to piece some of my life back together.


I was in therapy for about a year (ish) and my therapist told me I was doing really well, but I was hitting a point where I wasn't really dealing with trauma, but if I ever had a point where I needed come back I could. 


Well, flash forward I started having some issues at work and family was telling me my anxiety was out of control and I needed to go back, but for some reason I don't want to. But they haven't said anything for a while, so hopefully they aren't worried anymore.


A few months ago I started having nightmares about living with my abuser again, so bad I went for a whole week with only a few hours of sleep every night. My boyfriend made me promise that I would go back to counseling within the next month, but then everything got shut down because of COVID. Heck, I even saw my therapist at the store a while back and she suggested I set an appointment.


Now I'm at a place I flat out don't want to be around friends and hang out. I care for them, and I feel like I'm hurting them everytime I make an excuse on why I can't hang out. I don't know why, but everytime I make plans with someone I dread them. I'm actually relived that a concert got cancelled that I was supposed to go to with a friend this summer. 


Then recently I saw a ask Reddit post asking when someone should think about going for therapy, and some of the things mental health professionals were listing kinda made me feel convicted.


But despite this, I just really DON'T want to go back to therapy and I have no clue why. I wouldn't have  to pay for it, and setting a appointment only requires texting the therapist I use to see- but I just don't want to go. 


How do I convinced myself that I need to go, or how do I make myself feel comfortable going back? Or maybe I'm just being paranoid and I really don't need to go? (If you feel like that, please feel free to tell me so, I won't be offended.)

Sorry for the long post everyone.",24May2020,1
227,the smell of the air conditioning in my house triggers bad memories from when I had panic attacks last summer and I was wondering if any of you have techniques or strategies so I don't get flashbacks when I smell it?

229,"As a teenager. I thought I suffered with social anxiety but looking back. It wasn't me being scared of having a conversation with a person. I legitimately thought every stranger was against me, hated me and wanted to physically or emotinally harm and I didn't trust anyone apart from my close friends ( which were only 3) and my family.

I remember when I was 8 years old. There were group of teenagers who would always wait for me outside to hurt me and somedays would actually harm me. I remember one day they came in my house, stole my football (soccer ball if you're American. I'm from the uk) and when I went out to get it back. I remember all 4 of them beating me up. (There were 4 of them and they were twice my age at the time). I remember them chasing me with a ladder another day and I also remember being cornered by them and they all had bamboo sticks and I was only saved from a beating because a woman heard my cry for help and she stopped them from hurting me. They also got a lot of people to join in with them. This happened for 2 years. The bullies then moved away one day and I thought ""it was over"" but then I went to high school with the paranoia and bullies there preyed on me and I then started thinking everyone in the world hated me and wanted to hurt me. I never talked to anyone because I thought they were out to get me. I'd have other kids ask me in school ""Why do you never talk"", ""Why are you always so quiet""  which the answer was because I thought everyone in my school hated me and ""Why do you always go the library at recess"" because the library was the only place I felt a little bit safe (the playground frightened me as I was convinced people would hurt me), Those small group of bullies in the school who would bully me, made me think everyone was on the bullies side and were against me. Everyday I saw my teen years as me vs the world. I started becoming a huge misanthrope because of this. When I use to walk my dog and I would bring a wrench, screwdriver and hammer with me just in case someone would randomly jump me. I would also have my headphones on full blast so I wouldn't hear any insults that I was convinced people would throw at me as soon as they saw me. When someone would laugh in public; I thought they were mocking and laughing at me and just being out in public had me to the point where I was gonna faint from the fear of humans. I'd overanyalisis everything. My teen years was filled with paranoia, hate, anger, fear and depression. I remember when I was about 17, one of my sisters friends told me I was ""cute"" and asked me out on a date but I remember giving her the cold shoulder because I legitimately thought she was joking and it was all a set up to a cruel prank. I did this with a lot potential friends as well who asked me to hang out with me. I did have friends but I still didn't trust them 100% either. I always thought they just ""put up with me"" and would say stuff behind my back. I attempted suicide once because of my feelings. I would have anger outbursts at home and end up breaking objects in my house.

I got better, I got therapy and got a job in retail where now. I have friends, I can talk to strangers and i can trust people. But I remember how I use to feel from the ages of 14-20 and I really thought everyone hated me and was out to physically harm me or harrass me. Those bullies really traumatised me. I turned all that hate and anger onto human beings instead of the people who abused me. I thought everyone was on the bullies side and was after me.

I get depressed about how my teen years were. I do still have paranoid thoughts but not to the extent what I use to have? I think that little bit of paranoia will always be with me though. I just wish I could go back and restart my teen years",24May2020,1
230,"Sometimes I have this thing where for a few hours I lose all ability to want. I can't even move because I literally just no longer see any reason to.It feels like I get trapped inside my brain and I just freeze.  It's kind of like my emotions just turn off entirely. Well besides despair, there's still a little bit of that.  I can usually coax myself out of this state after an hour or so.It doesn't happen super often, maybe once every few months and it doesn't last long but it's definitely unsettling. What is this?

232,"A part of OCD that people don’t talk about is that part where the brain tricks you into thinking if you don’t perform a task, something awful will happen.  Since January 2018 I’ve kept strawberries in the house.  That January I was sure my one year old was going to die.  She was on breathing machines and her heart was failing in the PICU.  I made a bargain with God that if my baby survived I would be the best mom.  Part of my bargain was I’d make sure she had strawberries whenever she wanted, just so she lived.  

She survived and has even thrived.  

Strawberries are always in the fridge.  

Most of my OCD is well under control these days.  I’ve made incredible progress.  But the strawberries - a constant reminder that I’m still bound to this promise- are there every day.  They’re a reminder that despite my wellness (and hers) there is always a risk.  It’s my last major compulsion and I can’t figure out if I even want to fight it or not.  The cost is just so high.  

Anyway- I needed a place to put this.  A place to feel hopeful and sad.  A place to let someone know there’s no such thing as a simple strawberry.",24May2020,1
