0,"I've been into a fandom for 14 years. At first it was under control liked a post here and there at that's it. But then it slowly consumed my entire life. It's all I liked and thought about. I bought movies,books,stickers ect. And then my emotions started getting sucked into it. 

I had to make sure on every website I signed up for nothing negative was said about it so I could go on with my day happy. It made me feel better when I was sad.

It was super hard. I cried a few times,I got really bored, I had urges to go back but I didn't. I'm slowly putting all my self emotions back into me and moving on.",13Sep2020,4
1,"Hi everyone üëãüèΩ this is probably going to be a super long post so I want to thank y'all in advance for reading this üôèüèΩ

I'm seeking help/support in finding ways to help my partner of 6.5 years, who in the last year or so has become highly depressed and anxious (and quite honestly is destroying our relationship - I would've posted this in a relationship community but I am more interested in helping him be happy again...)

Long story short, we started dating our senior year of high school. I was planning on going off to college and he was enlisting into the military and shipping off as soon as we graduated. We spent a lot of time getting used to the idea that soon we would hardly see each other. But due to an unfortunate set of events he was discharged from the military before he he shipped off... he fell into a really bad depression and lost interest in pretty much everything... including his life. Luckily, I was able to help him and by the spring he had decided to attend college (about 20 minutes from my college).

Fast forward to 4 years later, I graduated from college and decided to pursue an opportunity in another city (about 4 hours away). He was pursuing a masters degree and would be starting in our home city... it was an adjustment at first but we made it work. A year later, after he finished his degree, he decided to move up with me. 

But now looking back, I realize that in that year we had gotten really used to doing our own thing. We honestly moved in too soon... we were happy for a while and so excited to be together. Our first apartment was great... until a mistake from the past [so small we had never given it a second thought] caught up to him and unfortunately we are still waiting to hear if he will face any consequences üòï It has been almost 9 months with no news in the case, which is a huge weight on his shoulders. Plus during quarantine (and over the last few years) we have both gotten really out of shape...

All of these issues have led to him getting very depressed and anxious... plus when he moved to this new city with me he left his old friends and honestly hasn't really made an effort to make friends here (plus quarantine hasn't really help)... a few days ago he told me that he honestly hasn't been happy on over a year. That he no longer knows who he is... he also said that he really doesn't look forward to anything... he doesn't find joy in things he used to (video games, our relationship, etc). And he is very unhappy with his weight/appearance... 

I'm just really unsure of what to do to support him... and its really upsetting üòû any tips/advice would be greatly appreciated üôèüèΩüôèüèΩ


***EDIT - I guess its important to mention that we bought a house at the beginning of this year... so its not like he could move back to our old city... I just really want our new house to feel like home to him and right now it doesn't due to everything else he's feeling...",13Sep2020,2
2,"Freelancing and being my own boss and the DIY (do it yourself) work ethic has become less and less unappealing to me because typically, you have to book your own work, pay your own travel costs and you have to juggle MULTIPLE different roles--entrepreneur, producer, creator, employer and employee. You have to do EVERYTHING yourself.

In jobs like modeling, aside from taking care of yourself, remaining in shape and improving your runway walk and posing, models don't have to do much else. Everything is done for them--photoshoots, make-up, runway set-ups, campaigns, international traveling expenses, international travel being mandatory or part of the job, potential lucrative opportunities, modeling pretty much has ALL of the perks that MOST people would want out of a job or life in general.",13Sep2020,1
5,"Hey, it's Saturday morning, what do you feel like doing today?

Nothing...

That's fine. We can do the same thing we did last Saturday üôÇ. Let's just stay in bed, spend a couple hours on your phone. I'll keep you company. Oh, and don't worry about eating.

Yeah, ok...

You know, you could easily get up and start the day. Go take a shower or something. You know what's going to happen if you just stay here. It's like you want it to happen, right? It's like you're nothing without me. 
Are you just expecting T to come up and check up on you? It's been a few hours and you're wondering why he hasn't come up to check up on you because usually when you stay in bed for so long it's because you feel like shit. But you know this too, so why do you insist on doing this? Why do you feed me so? You just want the attention, right? You're an attention whore. 
But you don't want to move because you're tired. You're always tired. Tired of doing nothing. Too tired to do anything. Too tired to want to do anything with your life. But the thought of doing nothing also weighs on you. 
Maybe you're just making it all up. Am I even real? After all, it's all just in your head. Yeah, you just want the attention, but also you don't? Which is it?
Hey! I have an idea! Let's listen to some Intrusive Thoughts. 
Suicide, we seem to be liking that topic lately. You think about it a lot, but you don't really want to do it. You wouldn't want to hurt those around you like that. It would be really selfish, though you don't like to call those who commit suicide selfish. That doesn't apply to you, though. You've always thought about a few options, if you were ever to do it. Pills, but you already have a hard time swallowong those. Gun, maybe? Where would you even get one? And that's really messy and loud. We could find a high place, high enough to make sure you actually die. But you don't want to kill yourself. Do you? 
I did see you eyeing that pencil sharpener the other day. I know you know how to take out the little blades.
Here's another Intrusive Thought. This one's kind of new. If you were even able to find a gun, just go down and kill them both, and then kill yourself. Or maybe don't kill yourself just yet and spend some part of your miserable existence in prison, until you eventually decide you can't take it anymore.
Maybe if not Intrusive Thoughts, we could just revisit some of those memories you don't like. Yeah, go ahead and get completely under the covers so you don't have to fake-sleep. But make sure you wipe those tears so that when he actually comes up to check on you, if he does, you can lie and say you're fine.
You're such a burden, you know.

Yeah, I know...

He doesn't deserve to have to deal with your bullshit every weekend. Give everybody a break. Other people have issues too, and you don't even have any real trauma. You're just an ungrateful piece of shit. You're fine, honestly, so stop doing this. You might as well stop acting like you're so miserable, if you're just going to say you're fine when they ask you either way. 
Sometimes you are really good at masking it. Will today be one of those days? Well I for sure will be here to find out. 
He's here now, and you have to be strong for him, because he needs you, too. If you keep smiling like that, you might just convince all three of us that everything is okay. 
Let's get out of bed now. It's been enough. Let's get dressed. Go to the bathroom and look at yourself in the mirror. See how miserable you look? Make sure you hide it before you go downstairs. 
Why did you even get out of bed, though? It's not like it's any different down here. I'm still here, after all. 
Let's go sit out on the front porch and play some very loud music; I'm sure you're a bit tired of hearing me babble since you woke up.
But, before I tune myself down, I want to leave you with a last thought.
Don't you like to think about how easy it would be for you to just get up and start walking? Just start walking in whatever direction and disappear. Leave everything and everyone behind. Doesn't it fascinate you how simple that is? You could do it right this instant, so why don't you?",13Sep2020,2
6,Do they have outpatient services like ER‚Äôs do? Like where you walk in tell them what‚Äôs going on they assess if it‚Äôs mental or physical and don‚Äôt need to stay more than a few hours to get help and then they send you home? Or are all mental hospitals in patient and you have to stay for at least a few days unless your doing sessions with a therapist?,13Sep2020,1
7,"Um hi idk if anyone will see this and I'm really new to Reddit but basically I made amazing progress with my depression, and I have dealt with self harm, but not in a very long time, the last time would be maybe January? Since then I've been completely clean, and I've not really had any urges, but tonight I had urges and I don't really know how to deal with it. This time it's not really depression, it's because I'm really stressed and anxious at the moment, I've very recently been diagnosed with a chronic illness which I'm struggling with, and I'm back at school but on a reduced timetable because of my health, and I've got exams soon, and it's all really stressful. Also having problems with a couple of people. It's all just too much.
But I don't wanna talk to my mum because I don't want her to make a big fuss even though she's always really really supportive , and she makes everything better, it's just that she's been so proud of me for the progress I've made, and I don't want her to know this has happened because she's got enough on her plate. 

I just don't really know how to deal with this.
I haven't acted on the urges but having them is really uncomfortable and they won't go away, and if I still had the means to act on it in my bedroom, I think I might've done it. I'm just really frightened by feeling like this again.",13Sep2020,3

10,"I have a real difficult time with approval, I don't get satisfaction from comments I always question them. Unless they are negative I always believe the negatives and never really question them.

I cannot focus on a task for more than thirty minutes and manage to fuck up everything I try my hands on that could lead to a productive lifestyle.

Had a chance of redemption and failed a course in the summer. I keep lying to myself and my family telling them everything's fine but I just keep fucking up and I gladly just waste my time watching youtube videos about the dumbest shit all day long. I keep waiting for a moment where things can change and I can feel motivated to workout and get my schoolwork done but shit never changes because I feel scared for some reason. I keep fantasizing about what I want to do but I never have the courage or the drive to do so. I used to be so driven and put effort into everything but now I'm just a shell of myself. If anyone's gone through this please give me words of advice because I've tried talking to family, friends and one therapist but shit hasn't changed for a year and a half.

the start of this year to june was the toughest time of my life. i started to intentional injure in january, and i now have hundreds of scars on my arms and legs from doing it multiple times a day for months. i attempted around may. in feburary my school sent me to a mental hospital to be evaluated. 

in june, it became immensely better. i still feel it. i havent done sh in about 2 weeks. however, everything in my life is falling apart. my uncle attempted and succeeded. my parents are getting worse- and i know my parents may be suicidal- specifically my mom. im scared, but somehow i‚Äôm happy. and it feels so fake and i feel so guilty. 

please help me. i know i was probably mentally ill before but i need to know what‚Äôs wrong with me. i can feel myself slowly going back to a bad place again, and im just so confused. it‚Äôs always been a few months of major and intense feelings, and then i was fine for about a month or two. is something wrong with me? am i just overthinking?",13Sep2020,1

How do you know if you aren‚Äôt just being genuinely dramatic or simulating a response to something?

Or when you cry at something you aren‚Äôt just crying for show/as a way or showing the reaction you‚Äôd think a depressed person would have?

This makes virtually no sense but im not quite sure how to convey what I‚Äôm talking about. How do I know when my mental health is an actual problem or if it‚Äôs just my mind making me react to something the way it thinks a person with say, depression, would react?

This sounds SO bad but I‚Äôm not sure how else to phrase it. 

Also if things happen that constantly evoke anxiety or stress so much so that it‚Äôs almost every day in itself, how would I know if there‚Äôs any mental health struggle at all?

Guess I wouldn‚Äôt know until I leave. EDIT: like move out not leave the earth lol felt that clarification was necessary.

When I was very young (maybe 5-8) I had 3 major concussions that were very traumatic. All of these cause me to lose my memory (but I eventually got them back). 


I am now 17, but I am now experiencing the effects. I can‚Äôt remember anything from my past. The longest I can keep my memory is maybe a day or two. 


The major problem is that I‚Äôm starting to go into auto pilot mode. I am doing something like walking or driving, then I snap out of it and realize that I don‚Äôt remember how I got to a certain place.

19,"So I was in the mental health system on and off since I was 7 and never once said my dad was abusive.
Until after I moved out and I knew my mom was safe, I never said much about the stuff he did or the way he acted. 

They were tossing around bipolar and autism as possible diagnoses my whole life and then after diagnosing me with different stuff over the years and changing it whenever it seemed to suit them or the situation I was just fed up, I spent the last year in talk therapy and aired out things my dad did and the therapist didn‚Äôt help and even made me feel worse in some ways.
The medication I was taking made me gain weight and I used to have an eating disorder and they don‚Äôt listen when I try to say that the weight gain cancels out any positive effect the med could have on my mental health because of it.
After gaining weight I basically replaced my eating disorder with binge drinking.

I went in to see the psych after my therapist basically made me cry and he goes ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre bipolar, I think you have ADD and PTSD and those things together look like bipolar... but I‚Äôve been wrong before.‚Äù

I thought it was byllshit, and that they were just giving me a ptsd diagnosis because I was talking about, and mad about how abusive my dad was... I never had any panic attacks, nightmares or flashbacks to any specific events so I thought they were lying to me.

I have been out of their system and my file has been closed for a few months now... and once again I am trying to quit drinking.
At some point 2 weeks ago after I think a week sober I thought ‚Äúwhat if my parents didn‚Äôt divorce?‚Äù and then I had an anxiety attack.

I used my birthday as an excuse to drink, then used stress as an excuse to drink... and now I want to get drunk again. I live in a town with a lot of drug and alcohol use and the fights in the building I live in give me anxiety attacks and the harrassment at work from people who are drunk or high is getting to me. I‚Äôm angry almost all of the time, but the panic attack was new... I can‚Äôt stop thinking about my childhood at this point and how shitty things were and occassionally my mom mentions things she feels or thinks after getting out of the 20 years of domestic abuse. 

My mom has been with her boyfriend for about 3 years and still isn‚Äôt used to being treated with respect or being with someone who‚Äôs emotionally stable, she feels guilty because he doesn‚Äôt treat her like crap if she forgets something and she forgets a lot of stuff.

Like now I wish I was drunk because I‚Äôm just constantly on edge and they didn‚Äôt help me much in talk therapy and the psychiatrist keeps trying to give me medications that cause weight gain and I barely sleep.
I wanted to be a musician and artist basically my whole childhood and now I cant do anything and struggle to get anything started or finished. 

My dad physically abused me from 2-10 and emotionally abused me from 11-15. From ages 16-19 I still lived with them and had severe anxiety and manic episodes. We helped my mom with divorcing him when I was 18 and 19 and I moved with my dad to my aunts until my dad and I found our own homes.
I told him a few months after that to not speak to me anymore but since moving to the same town as my mom and dad he occasionally sees me when I‚Äôm at work and tries to ask me how things are going there.

He was an awful person, my sister has no memory of the earlier abuse and spent most of her teen years out with friends so she still talks to him my brother and I don‚Äôt. He carried me by the neck when I was a toddler, when I was 7. Both times for getting out of bed with nightmares. Called me worthless more than my own name and said I don‚Äôt deserve to be fed. He broke my mother‚Äôs nose and threatened to leave my brother in the wilderness to die.
Made my mom run around doing things for him fresh from major organ surgery and treated her like her awful health problems were annoying and regularly told people around him that it was her fault because she drank Pepsi.
I keep getting mad at things I remember at random times because it just comes up a lot.

My siblings have social lives and are doing better than me and I‚Äôm an asocial person, I feel like a broken person and I look up to this one artist that got me through the later part of my teen years, through helping my mother divorce my father, and I try to support them currently through twitch and patreon.

But aside from that artist‚Äôs content, alcohol or my eating disorder I don‚Äôt seem to care much for anything. I never work on music or art anymore, I drew two things today and tried to do my make up that‚Äôs the extent of what I did to try and be a functional, creative person today.

I feel like since I‚Äôm 23 now I‚Äôll never be the musician or artist I wanted to be.
That was what got me through childhood and now it seems impossible working 9 hr days and having daily tasks I need to do as someone who lives alone.. then there‚Äôs the time I waste on alcohol.
I end up eating way too much and drinking pedialyte at work because I couldn‚Äôt not drink the night before.

I‚Äôm just so tired of my childhood being on my mind all the time and tired of having no motivation to work on my goals unless I‚Äôm at work, because work sucks and I‚Äôd rather be working on art and music than working there and I‚Äôm irritated and bitchy the whole time or at least it‚Äôs gotten worse in the last week and I don‚Äôt want my coworkers to hate me or customers to complain about me but I‚Äôm so tired all the time and I get a lot of headaches, stomach aches, chest pain, and I had to isolate and get tested for covid 4 times because the chest pains from anxiety made me think it was covid and then I also just get colds a lot.",13Sep2020,1

23,"VENTING/ADVICE NEEDED

My girlfriend (21F) and I (24M) have been together for about three years. In the beginning of August, we moved in together and she started a new job. She started her last semester of college towards the middle of August and started an internship. Since she started classes, her father checked himself into rehab for his alcoholism, her great uncle passed away, a small pregnancy scare, her mother has been gone a lot for work which leaves her 13 y/o is often left alone overnight so he often ends up calling my gf and asking about how to do simple things like using the oven and stove or because he's nervous to be alone at night. Last Friday, he called my gf in the middle of the night because he was sick with strep and she drove the three hours back home (at 2 am) to take care of him. So needless to say, she's been stretched a little thin right now. I feel genuinely terrible for her and have tried to help in anyway that I can.

She's had several panic attacks over the past few weeks. One was when her uncle died. She wasn't all that close with him, but she was still upset. She was telling me that she was more upset with the fact that she would have to go back home for the funeral and the hassle of it all. Another happened, while she was on the phone with her little brother about two weeks ago. She had just gotten back from her internship and her brother called for help with his homework. She was trying to explain it to him and he didn't understand. She got frustrated and ended up just handing the phone to me and leaving the apartment. I found her in her car sobbing. I tried talking to her, but she said she just wanted to be left alone. The worst and most recent one was last Monday. She was in a mood, but initiated sex which felt really good because she hadn't done that since we originally moved in together. I was excited and I maybe moved a little fast than she originally planned. At one point, her back was towards me and she started shaking. I took that as her enjoying it and kept going for a couple more minutes. She said something quietly and I couldn't understand her and thought she was just moaning. She did this a couple more times and I still couldn't understand her. At one point I did stop and ask her what she said and she just shook her head. I took that as never mind and kept going for a few minutes longer before asking to change positions and rolled over and I found out she was crying and shaking. She didn't want me to touch her again. I found out after the fact that she was trying to tell me to stop when I had thought she was moaning. This time she wouldn't settle down. The other two lasted around 15 mins, but this one lasted around 30 mins. When she was finally starting to calm down, I made the mistake of putting my hand on her shoulder without asking and she started to panic again. The whole thing ended up lasting about 45 mins. I felt awful after I found out that she was telling me to stop.

Around Wednesday of this week, she came home in an ok mood. She seemed more relaxed and like her old self again. I figured that it would be the best opportunity to talk to her about possibly taking advantage of her school's counseling center. She got upset again and we were arguing. I went to put something in the cabinet and without realizing she was behind me, I turned around too fast and hit her in the forehead with my elbow. She ended up falling backwards and hitting her head just behind her left ear. It was bleeding pretty bad, but, thinking I had done it on purpose, she wanted to be left alone. She was completely hysterical and wouldn't let me touch her or come near her so I went over to a friends for a few hours to cool down and collect my thoughts. When I got back, she was asleep. The next day, she was dazed, seemed kind of confused, she had vomited several times, had a headache, was running a fever, etc. At first, I thought she had just caught strep from her younger brother, but after doing some research, I took her to the emergency room. She ended up needing a lot of stitches and having a pretty bad concussion.

Obviously she's been home with me the past couple of days recovering. She doesn't really talk much to me unless I speak to her first and seems a little out-of-it and even depressed most of the time.

TL;DR I still want to talk to my gf about going to see someone, but I don't know how to bring it up after what happened. I was thinking that it might be better if we were to go and see someone together that way it doesn't seem like I'm saying she needs to be fixed and doesn't seem as intimidating. Her mother and brother are coming down tomorrow so I was thinking about talking to her mom about bringing it up with her, but I don't want to share anything with her mom that my gf doesn't want her to know.

I just really want to help, but I don't really know how. I don't know if it's just the stress of the month or if there might be something more to it. I just really don't know what to do.",13Sep2020,1

My health is failing and I am in need of having tests done but my anxiety and panic are just too bad to even go to my doctor. I‚Äôve had people tell me that the hospital will sedate me somehow to have the blood drawn but in the past I haven‚Äôt found any medication that helps and most doctors just tell me to suck it up and get the needle. They act as if I‚Äôm just being a child and I should grow up. 

I‚Äôm in Canada if that helps. 

Thank you in advance for any help.",13Sep2020,1
25,I've seen many people (Americans) say how they never tell their therapists if they are suicidal because they will most definitely send them to a mental health facility almost immediately. I live in a country with horrible mental health hospitals that only allow elderly people with Alzheimer's stay in them. My neighboring country is Guatemala and I do have a therapist there but it's a hassle do get there because I'm only 16 and my parents don't care about mental health (my mom threw away my zoloft) how i even got to have a therapist is a long story which involved me doing something to get their attention so that they would take me. What I'm asking is what are the rules in Guatemala. Do the therapist have to send you to a mental health hospital if you tell them you are suicidal (I have been for years and I feel like I'm on the edge and if I don't do something about it I feel like I will die) maybe that will help me. Maybe that is what I need because I don't know what to do anymore.,13Sep2020,1

29,"Looking for advice, regarding a situation I am in.  My Wife and I are currently separated, and she is in a romantic relationship with another man with children.  My wife and I have 2 children of our own, 5yo Daughter and 3yo Son.

My Wife entered into an emotional affair that turned physical very quickly, and basically in a hidden relationship with the AP (Affair Partner).  At first it was private between them, and after my Wife left me and took our 2 kids with her when she relocated, she began to introduce him and his children too mine.  First it was babysitting his kids, then dinner with him and his kids, then spending whole weekends together at both her apartment and his/his parents house.

I know the separation is affecting my daughter, she has broken down and asked me why I can't live with her and mommy.  But I'm wondering how the interaction with AP and his kids is going to affect her.  She has made comments that the APs oldest daughter is ""her sister"", and my Wife has admitted to ""loving on"" his children, which my daughter has clearly seen.  I also noticed some behavior changes and some withdrawal from my daughter.

It's harder to judge in my son as he's 3, and has a speech delay.  But he's become more violent, hitting and kicking his sister.  Could be normal or could be signs of change.

I'm looking for advice, or anything that might help me do what's best for MY CHILDREN, my Wife has no intention of working on our marriage at this time, even though I stated I still love her and want to reconcile with her.  Shes pretty hard into thinking that I'm the bad guy, and she hasn't done anything wrong, so I have a difficult time communicating with her, and I'm also at her mercy until I relocate closer after my house sells.",13Sep2020,1

For the past few years now I've felt so lonely, I'm truly not happy with who i am, but i also don't want to say its depression as i don't really feel sad a lot, i kinda just feel nothing. I don't cry really ever because of how i feel about myself, i cried recently because i really f\*cked stuff up with a  girl, and along those lines i catch feelings for people in literally a day and i don't know if its because i want to feel loved or because i really want to love someone. Im not great about talking about my feelings in person which is why i really don't feel i can talk to anyone about it its always felt easier online. So i don't know whether to call it depression or if I'm just making it up, sometimes i think I'm just attention seeking and doubt myself and wonder if I'm just telling myself in my head if its worse than it is.

I constantly have deadlines to meet, which I realize is something you have to get used to when you're becoming an adult, but holy shit. I constantly have work to do every. single. day. There is never a moment where I can sit and just fucking relax, which is why I feel like I'm losing control of my life.

The only time I have to myself is an hour or so everyday when I work out, but even that is starting to feel more like an obligation than me-time since I go straight to work on my deadlines after. 

And I feel so selfish even wanting time to myself, but sometimes I don't have the energy for anyone else once I do have free time. Like, I'll sometimes spend time with my family or SO but I feel I'm wasting their time because I'm too drained to hold a real conversation or socialize. 

I just want a break but maybe I'm just being lazy. I mostly feel stressed right now though, because I have a fairly large paper due on Monday at noon (who the fuck makes a paper due like that) and can't work on it tomorrow since I have day-long plans with my SO and family so now I just feel terribly pressured as I try to finish it tonight and its all my fault.

40,"I've been struggling with pretty severe mental illness since I was about 13. I'm 27 now and in many ways things have improved since then. For the past 5 years I've been functional enough to go to college, get my bachelor's degree, and hold down various part time jobs. After graduating over the summer I got my first full time ""professional"" job. I have always doubted myself and believed myself to be capable of very little. I was feeling somewhat optimistic about the job because I get to work from home, everyone I work with is pretty cool, and I actually thought I'd be pretty decent at it because I have done some similar work in the past and in general it seems like something I can do. I started 3 weeks ago so I am only just starting to get into the actual work instead of primarily training. I started struggling on Thursday and have been an absolute mess since then. My boss basically expressed that I messed up on few things but she hasn't made it terribly clear how she feels I'm doing. So I can't help but fear constantly that I've shown her I'm not capable of doing the work and that getting fired is imminent. If I lose this job I will absolutely want to end my life. I am so sick of trying and failing. The past few days have been full of sobbing and debilitating panic attacks. On some level I can recognize that I may not be doing anywhere nearly as bad as I think and that focusing on being fired is only making me miserable and won't help anything. But I can't stop. The possibility feels extremely real and the consequences seem unbearable. I would be so ashamed and embarrassed and it would really solidify my worries about being just ""broken"" and unable to function in society. I want so badly to have a fulfilling life.

44,"In my head, I had always painted this picture that my parents were incredibly loving people and that there was no pain. I think that was me being in denial. While in many ways they did give me a lot, abuse is still not okay and the good things don't wipe away the bad. I didn't even realize that my parents were being abusive until 2-3 years ago when I was 20 years old and talking to my therapist. The whole time during our session, I raved about how supportive my parents were. One sentence I said made him pause and he asked me to reflect and approach things differently. As I looked into things further, it started to add up that most of my insecurities and my perfectionism/people pleasing was the result of the abuse my parents put me through. My dad has severe anger issues (he would like to disagree and say that he does not like it when people call him angry). He yells at me for every little thing. I literally don't do shit...I'm like the perfect daughter in every possible way (I'm not trying to brag, but just trying to emphasize how much effort I put in to be a responsible and loving daughter). I do everything to make sure my parents are comfortable and don't have to deal with any burdens. I'm a fully grown adult and there have been times where I've literally had to run out of the room because he got so angry. One time as I was running, I fell on my nose on concrete and almost broke it. Another time, he literally slapped me. Although there are times when my mom defends me, my mom usually stays on my dad's side to avoid further conflict or maybe she has other fucked up reasons for doing so. I think I feel guilt even complaining about this because they've done so many good things for me. It's just constant emotional abuse and sensitivity around any little thing I say. I'm not even comfortable with praise because my parents never gave me much of it growing up. The things they get mad over are absolutely ridiculous: ""Why didn't you get this deal? Why didn't you put your stuff here instead? etc"" Literally the most menial stuff. If I give absolute obedience, I won't hear complaints from them. I'm hoping to move out soon once I get into medical school. There used to be a time when I felt like I would be happy living with my parents and taking care of them, but it's literally like they are testing my patience and trying to push me away.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I was almost taken away by child services when I was a child because my mom burned my finger. The school found out because I brought it up in conversation when I was talking to an aide. My parents blamed me for that shit instead of having a realization that they need to be better parents. They stopped hitting me less because they were scared of child services coming back and taking me away. It was not because they thought it was wrong. I am going to be real; I am glad I wasn't taken away by CPS because the system sucks, but damn when will a child ever be safe? People need to get thorough training before they become parents. Children don't deserve to go through this bullshit.

P.P.S. However, after talking to my mom and having a heart-to-heart for several months. My dad was away during this couple of months, so my mom and I were able to have a lot of these tough conversations. She has been super supportive of me and has been encouraging me to move out to find myself and not have to deal with this bullshit.",13Sep2020,1

I have two kids (2 &amp; 8), and while I‚Äôve always been an empathetic person, I am way more since becoming a mom. Like most parents, hearing about a child being mistreated is very upsetting to me. But in my case, it *really* affects me. And I‚Äôm not just talking about the really horrific news stories we all hear about...it happens with ‚Äúmuch less horrific‚Äù things, too. 

Just now I came across one of those awful videos of a mom filming herself berating and screaming at her son, as ‚Äúdiscipline‚Äù, to post on Facebook for attention. üôÑ The kid was clearly very upset but it‚Äôs not like he was being tortured or anything. But I couldn‚Äôt handle it. I got nauseous, my eyes filled with tears. I could feel a sinking feeling in my chest. And now, I‚Äôll be thinking about that video and that little boy very often for the next couple weeks, and then occasionally for probably years to come. 

Sometimes when I‚Äôm looking at houses while driving, a thought will randomly pop into my head like, ‚ÄúThere could be children being beaten in that house right now.‚Äù And then it all happens again - I become absolutely overwhelmed with sadness and it consumes me.

I often think, at any given moment, all over the world, there are kids being beaten, starved, hurt, etc. and it hurts me so, so badly. My brain always goes there, for seemingly no reason. The amount of pain it makes me feel is indescribable.

57,"(gonna add some background here, feel free to skip to the questions which I'll put at the end). 

I've been struggling with my mental health for years, but it's gotten a LOT worse over the past year. (I'm 16). Tried a lot of different meds. Have been consistently suicidal for months. I finally convinced my parents to look into alternatives to just talk therapy (tried DBT, never had the energy to do it). 

I had a consultation on Friday morning with an intensive outpatient program. (It's mainly for managing anxiety and depression a nd learning skills to cope with them). And it went really well, until the end. They wanted me to start that day, and I didn't have any time to mentally prepare for that. I had to push SO hard let them let me start on Monday, instead. It was really discouraging. 

They also want me to stop seeing my therapist (which I HATE, because she knows me so well) and my psychiatrist (honestly that's fine, all she did was manage my meds). As well as a bunch of other stuff like having my parents lock up all alcohol, manage my meds, etc. I'm really only ever passively suicidal, so this made me feel, I don't know... Like a child.

A lot of the stuff they wanted me to do just made me really angry. I wasn't expecting it to happen so fast and for it to impact so much or my life. I really hate being angry, it makes me resistant and feel so out of control. 

I'm really worried that it'll take time for them to get to know me. I'm scared that it won't be personalized enough to treat my own problems, not just the stuff that most people come there with. I'm also really (like, REALLY) high functioning, so I've never been able to get an accurate diagnosis besides GAD. 

Overall, I'm just pretty scared, and I don't want to lose control of my treatment. I just don't know what to expect. 

Some questions I have... 
- how will they personalize my treatment plan?
- will I get any input into the treatment plan or my medication? 
- how will they get to know me? From the schedule they gave, it seems like ALL the time is group stuff, so when is the one-on-one therapy?
- how long will it take until they can make a diagnosis? 
- what if I don't like them, or they consistently make me angry?
- how do they accomodate for my anxiety routines that are already in place?
- how to I integrate back into reality life afterwards, and how do I not relapse?
- what if I can't do it? 
- how do I advocate for what I need without coming across as a bitch?

And for anyone (my age) who's gone through this... 
- how the heck do I stay caught up in school? 
- how likely is it that my teachers will let me drop the smaller assignments and just do the big ones?...
- how will that affect my grades?

Yeah, soo... That's it. If anyone has any advice, positive stories, or answers to my questions, though would be great!",13Sep2020,1
59,"I can't exactly explain what's happening to me. I'm getting professional help but nothing seems to be enough. I'm on antidepressants, ADHD medication, and I even go to a school for kids who can't function properly at normal school, but even that's hard... As you can probably guess from my previous statements I have been diagnosed with ADHD and depression. The depression mostly neutralizes the hyperactivity part of the ADHD but I still feel restless sometimes. My biggest problem right now is that I can't get myself to do anything. It feels like something in my head is keeping me from doing everything I want to/ need to do. I have no clue how to describe it but I can't find the willpower to do anything. Before it was just me being reluctant to do things and needing a few minutes to a few hours to find the strength to get out of bed but now I can't do any of that. I think my worse experience recently was two days ago on my birthday. Not much was happening because of the pandemic but that didn't bother me at all because I have online friends. Despite this, out of nowhere I just felt so lifeless. Everything felt like it wasn't worth it and it took too much effort... It got bad enough that I couldn't find the willpower to sit up so I just got on the floor and laid down for a bit. I was in a call with my girlfriend at the time and she tried to get me to get back in my chair because she didn't know what to do. I was on the floor by my desk for around an hour. Eventually she got me to get in my chair but I fell asleep on my desk soon after and I was asleep for around another half hour... I woke up and decided to take a nap in my bed which lasted two hours. When I woke up I felt good enough to get back in my chair and play some games with my friends. That helped a bit but I slept a normal amount the day before and the night after. This sort of thing keeps happening in smaller magnitudes but I still hate it. I can't force myself to do anything I need to do, only the things I need to keep myself alive unless I'm in a really good mood. I play a lot of games but sometimes I can't even do that and I just go to bed. I haven't gotten anything done in school in a week or two and my parents are really mad at me but I can't force myself to do it no matter how hard I try. My parents just think I'm not trying hard enough and I'm not putting in enough effort but staying alive is the best I can do. I don't want to die or anything, that's behind me, but I don't want to live either. Both feel like they take too much effort. Medication isn't working. I'm on 2/3 of the maximum safe dose for my antidepressants and nothing is helping. I'm getting support from my girlfriend but she rarely knows what to do and my parents don't either. Even I don't know what to do. I'm dreading existence and I wish I was never born in the first place... I keep trying to tell myself to enjoy the nice things in life but sometimes that isn't enough for me. To make things worse, my actual physical life is perfect. I feel horrible about it because so many people have it worse than I do yet I'm the one who doesn't want to live... All my parents do is tell me that I need to try harder but I keep trying to tell them that it's not that simple... I hate existing... I want it to end but death seems too painful and annoying to do.

61,"Obviously not looking for a diagnosis here - I'm already working with a therapist too- but has anyone ever experienced having strong emotional reactions to kids' toys that make noise, or stuffed animals? Etc.

Whenever I hear a melody or song from a toy that makes noise, or see a stuffed animal, or even see talking/singing Christmas decorations, I burst into tears. It's definitely a distinct ""sad"" feeling. 

My thoughts are along the lines that because I'm in my twenties now and have no need for objects like that, that I'm somehow abandoning them or purposefully neglecting them. I can't get rid of anything I own that sings or talks or plays music, even baby toys. And stuffed animals too. The thought of doing that even now makes me burst into tears.

I thought it might be related to past trauma, but after asking my family, they told me I started doing this around age 2. I don't remember anything ever happening at this age.

I even attempted to hurt the cat multiple times (I've always managed to stop myself but it's still scary).  Are these still just intrusive thoughts if they're getting this strong?  I don't want to actually hurt anyone and I like the cat a lot but I keep getting into these moments where I feel like I have to hurt him.

72,"COVID-19 has really taken its toll on my mental health. The extra alone time I have for myself made me extra aware of my body, Like I always check if I'm breathing normally or something. A slight ache on my body gets me really anxious. I try to calm myself down by doing tasks around the house, or just simply laying down, or watching youtube videos. I ignored it the first few days, but my anxiousness has been going on for almost two weeks now. I can't sit still. Tight settings make me claustrophobic. Noise irritates me.

So I decided to tell my parents about how I feel. I also told my dad about how he's so careless about this pandemic. He will enter the house with his work shoes still on and he wouldn't  change his clothes nor was his hands. And also, he went biking with his friends knowing that it'll rain hard. He got sick a few days after that, and since we all live in the same house, and sleep in one room (we have a small house), it was pretty easy for him to infect all of us in the family. We all got the flu for almost two weeks. After all that happened, he never seemed to learn his lesson. It almost seems like he doesn't care.

After telling them all of my concerns (about my mental health and the carelessness of my dad), my mom responded with anger, telling me to stop it, and said ""you don't pray enough"" and started yelling at me and gave me a crucifix (my parents are devoted catholics and I know it's kinda hilarious that my mom gave me that, like it's going to immediately help my anxiousness). By this time, I was crying . My dad entered the room and asked about  what was happening, my mom told him about what I was going through and he just... laughed. He said I was just overthinking these things, and that this was the result of me not participating in online masses of the catholic church. I thought that the way that they responded was fucked up. I got so upset about how they responded so i went out of the room, crying.

I live in the Philippines and there's still no mass testing, cases are rising, and the government is more concerned about the beautification of a beach, than providing solutions to beat this pandemic. I'm currently in college taking online classes. I'm concerned that I might not perform well academically because of my anxiousness. I really want to finish college on time.

Please provide suggestions on how I could deal with my anxiousness, because obviously telling my parents didn't work. I felt much worse after I told them.

I know this is kind of silly but I sometimes feel envious of my professors, particularly the tenured, middle aged ones, who went to college in the 80s and who have children and partners with equally interesting lives, who eat lunch with their colleagues in the department common room laughing and bonding over their passion for their literature (it‚Äôs an English department). I realize hard they worked to get there, and also acknowledge that they have their own struggles that I do not see. 

At the end of the day I always just end up feeling vastly inferior to them, and also somehow jealous of them, so much so that it is almost embarrassing to be around them or look up to them. It‚Äôs like showing your poem to your favorite poet, or playing a song on the guitar in front of Van Halen. I know I should use it as an opportunity for growth but my stupid ego gets in the way. 

For instance, my favorite professor, whom I admire so much, whose job and life I‚Äôd love to emulate is just so much better than me, spent his college years working hard, winning prestigious awards and also having fun, dating, experimenting with drugs, rebelling against authority, making funny movies with his friends, going to nightclubs and drag shows, playing in a punk rock band and befriending more than a couple now-famous authors, artists, filmmakers. 

In contrast to him, I have spent most of my college years so far in my dorm room sleeping, crying, pacing or daydreaming; or in the library, into the late hours of the night, lost in some fantasy or delusion, studying and obsessing. But I‚Äôm not smart enough to make up for the fact that I‚Äôm awkward, friendless, insecure, overly impressionable, overly earnest, that I care too much, turn everything in late, have no social life and soak up every scrap of attention or praise I get from my professors like some kind of stray dog following them around. It‚Äôs really quite pathetic, from their point of view, my behavior. I can see it clearly now.

I should really stop feeling sorry for myself. I know I‚Äôm not that bad. I‚Äôm just not that great either. I‚Äôm ordinary. He‚Äôs extraordinary. They‚Äôre (my professors) all pretty extraordinary. It‚Äôs ok. I wanted to be extraordinary but I didn‚Äôt put in the work and it‚Äôs just not in the stars now. It‚Äôs ok.

I know I‚Äôm taking myself too seriously again. How boring and unfunny and tedious it is to takes oneself seriously? How awful to have to listen to me! thanks anyways.

Part of this post and this pain is really just me skirting around the other real issue that I‚Äôm embarrassed to admit: I‚Äôm bitterly disappointed that my dream of being a professor isn‚Äôt going to happen and I feel completely lost and useless now, like a neurotic person with an artists temperament and none of the talent. All I‚Äôm good at is reading and writing about books and I‚Äôm not even good enough at that. I suck as a waitress but I don‚Äôt think I will be able to succeed anywhere else. I‚Äôm not joking.

82,"Hey everyone.

I might be posting this in several subreddits because i am really scared and really need some advice because i don't know what to think anymore.

I am undergoing cancer treatment for the second time in 2 years and it has been a rollercoaster. I had some scary complications. The tumors in my spine pressed my back nerves so hard that i could not walk anymore. I got a cocktail of different meds which help me to walk a little bit again. The numbness is gone but i am in so much pain that if this is the new normal, i might have to euthanise because i can't live with this pain for much longer. I honestly don't want to die but the pain is becoming unbearable. I can't do the things i love anymore, and i can't sleep.

I take a lot of meds and my mental health is going down. The meds have a lot of side effects. I keep forgetting things, i have big mood swings and my self esteem went down. I am becoming fat and puffy while i used to be very fit and beautiful. I feel people don't want me anymore. I am just a wreck, putting up my happy face with friends and feel like shit when i am alone.

Besides that i am really really scared for what is about to come. It's all very much for me and i am in constant pain. The relationship with my partner has not been going very well lately, due to his work and study related stress combined with he is concerned about me, which really eats at him. I can see his mental health is not good because he worries a lot about me. He admitted he needs help but he doesm't know how. Talking with a therapists does not benefit him (yet?).

I live together with my partner pf almost 7 years and he struggles with my illness. He tries to support me but it's a lot for him. I spend time with friends daily to relieve the pressure from my partner. It is not going well with him, he can't deal with the stress very well. He even cried for the first time in 10 years because he cannot bear the stress anymore.

This morning i woke up in an empty bed. I heard my partner coming from the guest room. He came in, and was clearly upset. I asked him what was going on. He told me that the night before, i wanted to have a discussion with him in bed while he wanted to sleep. When i didn't stop talking he went to the guest room. I asked him a few times to come back to bed, which he did but then i started talking again and he left to the guest room again. I have literally zero memory of this. I can't remember it AT ALL. Last thing i remember is us sitting on the coach downstairs before going to bed, having a small drink before going to bed.

So when he told his story this morning, this was pretty difficult for me, even scary. I said sorry a few times. I also told him very honestly that it was hard for me to believe that he was telling 100% the truth because firstly i can't remember it and secondly he has lied to me before. Sometimes about small things, sometimes over bigger things. The biggest thing is that his friend assaulted/raped him and he told me after a year, when he was drunk and misspoke. Also he lied about his contact with a mutual female friend. He told me it was friendly but she admitted it was flirty. When i confronted him he sincerely apologised and has been working to regain my trust since.

He regained a lot of my trust but still not 100% because i know he is capable of lying pretty well. I know it might be bad to remind him of these things because i forgave him and it's a long time ago, but sometimes it still bothers me.

But the whole situation of me being on meds, very very anxious and scared, losing my memory, thinking that everyone is against me, past break of trust, made me doubt him. I told hij i just was not sure if He was telling the full truth. He got very very upset, packed his stuff and left. He is coming back in a few days i guess, but i feel abandoned because i counted on his support during this scary time. He left because he just could not do it anymore and he needed space.

Well now i have no idea what to think and what to do. I am really confused and i am afraid that my mind is too blurry to make a good decision. I am sure he left because it was all too much for him but i don't know if i want to be with someone who cannot deal with me in his life. I need someone i can rely on. Mostly i can rely on him but apparently not, because he just walks away at moments i want to be able to count on his support.

I think about telling him that he should not come back for the rest of the week, and after that i am going to the rehab clinic anyway so we would barely have to see each other. He is causing me a lot of stress so maybe he should just go away from my life, for now or maybe forever. I want him to be here for me, but not like this.

I know my situation is complicated. But i am hoping to find some support on here. Whenever i talk with a therapist they don't give their opinion off course, they just listen. But i really need advice.

TLDR: I am undergoing camcer treatment and the meds make my mind foggy and my mental health unstable. Besides feeling unstable i am scared. I got into an argument with my partner because i forgot our fight from the night before and i didn't immediately believe his side of the story. I have trust issues and being on all these meds amplifies my mental issues. My partner was so mad, he packed his bags and left. I feel abandoned and it's causing me a lot of stress. I really need some advice because i don't know if i should try to work this out or to just break up.",13Sep2020,2

85,"For the past year Ive realized I have become incredibly paranoid and started aggressively overthinking everything. In september 2019 I started my last year of university and was super scared of completing it because it took me 6 years to graduate instead of the regular 4. So mentally I struggled a lot as I kept fearing that I wouldn't graduate and would possible have to retake one or more classes. This stress and constant fear of failure lead me to suffer from my first 2 panic attacks within the span of 3 days. I am not diagnosed with any mental illness and when I told my doctor he said that it was the build up of fear over the past few years which might have finally caused me to explode as I haven't ever had such a breakdown before. But now I have graduated from University received my degree but I always still feel like something could go wrong. I don't currently have a job due to COVID but I am constantly finding myself paranoid about daily issues now. Something as simple as me joking to a friend saying ""I hope you die"" makes me think that something like that could actually happen and I start going praying it doesn't happen (also I dont believe in god so the fact that i pray is super random and shows how scared I get). Even joking about myself saying something like ""Im never gonna find a job"" ""i'm never gonna achieve anything"" makes be worry that I never will. I know right now I'm struggling as ppl aren't hiring cause of covid right now but I start to worry about it. Other times I star to worry about something bad happening after experiencing a really good day. I would go out with friends and have an amazing fun time but then the next day I start worrying that something bad will happen because its not fair for me to be this happy and because me being happy isn't normal. How can I feel happy without feeling guilty about it and without fearing that things are gonna go downhill after something positive happens. I never used to be this way I used to be a very positive person but after all the stress I faced this past year I find myself being more and more doubtful of life, enjoyment, and happiness. Is it because I finally achieved what I wanted so Im actively looking for other things to be afraid of now? How can I stop being afraid and be more positive and optimistic. I always just assume that the worst is going to happen and I dont like that about myself. I want to be happy and not worry about the next bad thing that might happen.

I don‚Äôt like my dad because he was tough on me and my sister growing up beating or demeaning us if we did things wrong, last week my sister was caught sneaking out to see her boyfriend (which no one knew about) by the police and my dad chocked and punched her leaving bruises and she told her counselor (we just started going back to school)
I found out about everything in school, my sister stayed at her friends house and it was me and my dad, he lied and said Chezney lied, I didn‚Äôt call his bluff but avoided him. defects came and is making my dad take therapy and me and my sister free counseling but we probably won‚Äôt get because my mom who was on vacation while this all was happening doesn‚Äôt believe in therapy even though she needs it more than us because her dad was a monster and she has low self esteem and likes crappy men. She provides us shelter, food and electricity. I feel like she doesn‚Äôt love me and my sister but I don‚Äôt know if I can say I love her. My dad is trying to reprimand his past actions for a while now with slip ups sending him back from the start, he was addicted to drugs and I don‚Äôt think he ever really considered the abuse he was causing until it was over. But I can‚Äôt forgive him, I feel anxious and scared being alone with him. The only thing we can do together is watch movies. And finally school is back and with hybrid. It sucks, most the time I‚Äôm frustrated with not finishing my work on time and being completely stressed with algebra 2 because I suck at it, culinary is hard but the teacher has a good system of notes so I‚Äôm ok there. Us history and Sociology Is the only classes I look forward to. I felt like ripping things or destroying my house or Just feel numb for the past few months. Today I felt happy so that‚Äôs something, I Just don‚Äôt want it to end.",13Sep2020,1

I was a young carer under the age of 18 and it was not the usual tails you hear. I'm a grown adult now but these are just some of my thoughts that rerun in my mind

I feel like I had no support or acknowledgement. 

Now don't get me wrong, I know young carers are appreciated but I literally didn't feel any of that. 

When I was living in the house of me and other person I was caring for it was tough, I would go to school with so much on my mind trying to focus and excel to obviously make a life for myself but then I would think about after school when I need to come back home. Also of course the sadness of worrying you might lose the person you love

I had a history of living in domestic violence situations between two adults but as a British citizen of an ethnic minority I don't think it's relevant. My background means domestic violence is taboo, don't talk about it, therefore no authorities or friends will ever know this. But it's stuff I have to deal with in my mind

My story relates to when it's just me and the person I was caring for, the accused is not in this situation. 

Anyway me and my family member lived on their money which made part of their savings, then eventually they were entitled to benefits. They would go to professionals and professionals would come over to help them out. 

At that time maybe because I was under age, I didn't receive carers allowance? But point being is yes I was not living on a council estate, I didn't drink, or smoke, and I was not using drugs, is that why I was overlooked? 

Do we only prioritise kids who are/ and or have parents abusing recreationals. What about kids that found it mentally draining that they go to school and everyone else is talking about their parents and what presents they were given, what holidays they will go on. 

Just because we lived on savings from my relatives old job in no way means I was rich. Even if you have how many ever thousands, divide that by the years and expenses you will accrue, that being, rent, lights, water, council tax, gas, food, transport, medication, it's expensive!, also cost of having a kid. 

I just based my whole life on feeling like the kid who went unnoticed, you hear stories all the time of kids who receive so much support from the council/welfare/government whether that be emotional or financial. I guess I never had that emotional support",13Sep2020,1
101,"I have an urge to kill, and torture people. Just random people. I just want to hurt, to see the blood, to smell it, and feel that rush. It‚Äôs not out of anger or sadness or any emotion. I‚Äôve never been through anything traumatic and on an emotional level, I‚Äôm okay. It‚Äôs weird because other than this I am normal. But I watch gore especially the ones where people slowly suffer the most. It just makes me feel good (not sexually) like a rush of adrenaline. I want to hurt. And this urge had been here for years, I think about it everyday. I wouldnt act on it, but the thought alone drives me insane.",13Sep2020,1
102,"The near constant depression and anxiety. I live alone. I can count the number of times I've seen loved ones in the past 6 months on my right hand. I'm by myself most of the day, stuck in my apartment. It's still too hot and humid and stormy to go outside, and it won't start to cool until mid October. I have little motivation to do anything requiring a lot of effort. When I do get energy, it goes toward being angry and agitated at everything. I used to clean the dishes every day. Now they pile up in the sink for 2 or 3 days.

I've been having trouble picturing loved ones faces and voices into my mind, like I try, and it's like a file on a computer that I don't have the program to run. All my life I've had vivid and exciting dreams. Now they're cold and grey and I can barely remember them. The dreams seem more like reality than reality. Some days I can't tell if what I'm feeling is real, if I'm real, if this virus or any of this is real.

I miss people. I want a hug so bad, like a real hug where the other person doesn't let go for a few seconds. I'd gouge my own eyes out to be touched like that, to be touched at all. At this point I'd go for someone slapping me across the face, because at least they'd be touching me. I want to hug my dad but he's 65 and don't know if that's safe. I have a weighted blanket that I sometimes fold up and place on my chest and pretend it's another human but it doesn't work. The last time I cuddled another living being was my mom's dogs back in March. Social distancing is either going to kill me or send me to the loony bin.

I went back to a therapist I saw a year ago and did two sessions with him, but he basically just parroted my problems back to me and told me I just need to not think like I do. I won't go back again, and I don't have the money to go therapist shopping. I don't want to bother people with my problems because these days all I have is problems, and they're all probably fed up with me angrily spouting off about current events and societal failings, and people are probably too busy to talk to me. Some days are ok, but it's like, the more ok and normal a day feels, the worse the inevitable crash will be after a few days of being stuck in my apartment.

I'm so sick of being around myself all the time. If quarantine has taught me one thing, it's that I suck. I hate myself. All of my stupid thoughts in my brain that never shuts up. My inability to make new friends. I just want my brain to not exist anymore.

106,"For all of my teenage and early adult life I've been depressed and have had general anxiety. I can't remember exactly when, but sometime in late middle school or early high school I've had an unhealthy obsession with death/ getting old. At first it was small things - finding my mind wander to that grim concept in the middle of trying to focus in class every once in a while. It also started to affect my nights - it was hard to fall asleep peacefully and I would often sleep talk and move around. I would gasp, sit up, look to my sister tell her I love her and lay back down. Of course not remembering the next day.

It got worse senior year of high school. Last year of childhood, no plans set for the future, and no idea how I wanted to live my life. My last year of high school my anxiety SPIKED significantly - I Started getting panics whenever it was quiet, usually during a test I would suddenly become conscious of my breathing and I'd just think about how someday I'll never take a breath again and the inevitability of that fact. My night terrors became a thing too. There is a history of sleep talking/walking in my family. I do it, my sister does, my grandmother, my aunt and her kids. I seem to be the only that bolts upright in the middle of the night, screams at the top of my lungs and repeatedly yell/tell my sister ""I'M DYING!"" My sister would talk me down, I'd lay down and go to sleep instantly.

Oh, if only I knew.

Now, I quit my job - where I would spend a significant amount of time alone in my own grin thoughts. I'm in an even deeper depression now because I still don't know what to do with my life and I feel like I'm wasting it and will die having done nothing. And my anxiety is now penetrating every aspect of my life.

1.) I can't be alone for a single second or I will go into a panic (seriously - I can't even go to the bathroom for too long or take a bath like I used to love to do because I can't control my thoughts)

2.) My eating has never been more erratic. (I'll skip a day of eating and then over eat the next day to make up for it.)

3.) The only way I can get any sleep is by making myself so exhausted I'd probably sleep through a hurricane.

And finally.

4.) My night terrors have escalated to me standing up on my bed screaming ""I'M GONNA DIE!"", begging my older sister to ""Please kill me cuz I can't do this anymore,""  hyperventilating until I run to the bathroom and puking up my dinner while I sob in a toilet bowl.

Even now I'm writing this after coming down from a panic.

I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm actually going crazy bc I should be able to control my mind and think map my way out of this but I can't. I try to stop the ""scary thoughts"" before the can become panics but I can't. And the thought of having to deal with this for the rest of my life makes me feel like there's no point in waking up anymore. I have almost daily panics now. Mild to insane ones. And I just want to go to sleep. I can't handle my own mind and that is where I am gonna be for the rest of my life.

So, yeah.",13Sep2020,3

I want to come back in a month as it will mark the day of his suicide and I want to write a definitive note to give closure to myself, my best friend and show other people a part of myself that they have never seen before as well as help and inspire anyone thats suffering through any battles.
I am writing this note in advance as I want it to be of great quality, not corny/cringy, and helpful to others. 

TL;DR: Deleted social media a lot, got lots of love and support from friends over the years thus giving me confidence, my old best friends death from three years ago is coming up and I want to write a good quality note in the span of a month that isn‚Äôt cliche or cringy as closure to my old best friend, myself, and to help others fighting mental struggles as well as showing a part of myself to my following.

I‚Äôll make other posts related to this if I get enough support and help. I just need help on the how and what to write. The introduction of the note reads:

If you are extremely uncomfortable with the subject matter/topic then exit out and continue on your day/night as usual.

111,"Hey dear reddit users, 

Today I wanted to share my experience with my panic attack and hope that either I can help someone of you understanding yourself better or get some helpful advice from you guys. 

About 10 days ago, I experienced my first panic attack. It all started in the night, when I suddenly woke up and I felt like my heart was skipping beats and was beating way too fast. All the way to next day, it only got worse until I had the feeling that I actually might die in the next 24 hours. I was then going to the doctor who quickly understood that I was experiencing a panic attack. I got medicated once, then it got much better over the next day. 

Right now I‚Äòm not really feeling anxious anymore at all, but I kinda got a new problem. Sometimes I feel very detatched from the outside world and myself. I would describe as a feeling of me and my body existing seperately. Most of the time, I feel emotionally numb and sometimes I‚Äòm not even able to show feelings to my beloved family. 

I already realized that meeting with friends, doing things etc. pretty much helped me forget my problems for a couple of hours but everytime I have to listen to my own head when I‚Äòm alone, the feeling of emotional numbness comes back. Is it possible that maybe that is a security mechanism of my body not wanting to experiencing such extreme emotionality as I felt it during my panic attack? Has anyone of you ever experienced such feelings and can you tell me for how long it lasted in your case or what you did to get rid of this feeling? I just hope that I can find the way to my old self. 

I appreciate all of your answers, guys. I hope you have a nice day.",13Sep2020,1

115,"I don‚Äôt expect anyone to read or respond to this; I‚Äôm just really desperate to release my thoughts somewhere.

I think I‚Äôve been depressed for about a year and a half now‚Äî emphasis on ‚Äúthink.‚Äù I have not been diagnosed by a professional, so this could all just very well be in my head, but I‚Äôve had multiple people who I‚Äôve talked to encourage seeking a therapist. It‚Äôs been a year and I haven‚Äôt found someone to talk to consistently yet. However, I was recently able to get a referral from the university I attend to start seeing someone, but that was a week ago. I didn‚Äôt have the motivation nor energy to make that call and schedule an appointment previously, but I think I really should (and will) soon.

[TW: self-harm] I remember years ago‚Äî back when I first heard of self harm‚Äî I was completely shocked that people would deliberately hurt themselves and inflict pain. I promise I didn‚Äôt judge, but being a very sensitive person myself (both emotionally and physically), I just couldn‚Äôt wrap my head around the concept. Well, here I am now, both of my thighs are covered in sore bruises and scratches. I get it now. With that being said, I started with simply scratching myself somewhat recently only in response to extreme frustration or anger. It just left red marks that lasted for a day or two and didn‚Äôt hurt after. For me, scratching myself in those moments helped release tension and bottled-up anger that I couldn‚Äôt get rid of otherwise. Taking it out on myself hit so many metaphorical birds with one stone: I was manifesting the hatred for myself, I was relieving myself of pent-up stress, the adrenaline from said stress made it so I didn‚Äôt feel much pain so it was easy to do, and more. I don‚Äôt have a strong support system in terms of friends and family, and I definitely don‚Äôt want to break anything or hurt anyone, so my options are quite limited in terms of healthier coping mechanisms. Trying to divert my attention to other things is hard because I usually just end up tuning them out and continue focusing on the bad. Yesterday, I made a small dent in the wall; in the moment, I didn‚Äôt care, but I feel terrible now. I scratched my thighs more than ever and beat them; in the moment, I didn‚Äôt feel it. Now, it hurts to walk or even apply any kind of pressure. Never in my life have I gotten a bruise that swelled like this‚Äî a purple and blue tender lump the size of my fist. In a twisted positive light, I‚Äôm much more motivated to call that referred therapist. 

I feel like my fuse has been growing shorter and shorter. Yesterday, in response to an argument, I really lost it when my mom said ‚Äúyou just want to kill me don‚Äôt you.‚Äù My mom has called me insults and names before, and while I understand this largely stems from anger getting to her in the moment, I still let it get to me‚Äî I let it get to me then and I still do to this day. I don‚Äôt have much self-esteem to begin with. I would usually break down crying and retreat to my room; that‚Äôs how our fights usually ended. Yesterday, when she accused me of wanting to kill her (she didn‚Äôt mean it literally I‚Äôm sure), instead of crying and retreating like I usually did, I got angry. Never in my life have I felt so wronged and misunderstood. Frustration took over any sense of sadness. Out of anger, I told her I wanted to kill myself because of her and I was sick of her always making me out to be a psycho/demented/evil child when she has acted similarly (if not worse) out of intense feelings/stress before. (I‚Äôm 19 now, but these are some of the names she‚Äôs called me for years that really stuck with me.) I said a bunch of other hurtful things that basically blamed her for the way I think about myself. I feel terrible about it now; I feel terrible that I used a suicide threat as a form of manipulation. At the same time though, I don‚Äôt want to feel sorry either. I know I‚Äôm a really shitty person for that, which is another reason I‚Äôm more motivated to talk to someone.

I didn‚Äôt eat or drink anything for 24 hours after that, and when I did eat, I felt like throwing up. I still feel like throwing up, along with just feeling physically shitty in general. I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy just laying in bed cycling through youtube and reddit trying to distract myself. I miss the old me from high school, who had passion and genuinely had things to look forward to in life. I don‚Äôt enjoy pokemon or animal crossing or drawing or playing the trumpet anymore. I don‚Äôt have the energy to go the extra step in academics either.
Now, I genuinely can‚Äôt find any reason to wake up. I usually go to bed at 6 in the morning and sleep for 10 hours despite having done nothing the entire day; my sleep schedule is completely wack and school will be starting really soon. I heard my mom talking on the phone for like half the day today with no breaks and I heard her talking to my dad in a tone I‚Äôm not familiar with; I‚Äôm absolutely scared to death that I‚Äôm causing a divorce. 

I just don‚Äôt feel good right now. I‚Äôm physically aching in more ways than one, and I have no way of releasing the stress because my thighs hurt too much for me to self harm there again; I don‚Äôt even want to self harm to begin with. I‚Äôm worried and just ruminating over the same thoughts; it‚Äôs exhausting. It feels like I have no energy to do anything that can make my situation better, so I end up being stuck in a vicious cycle. I‚Äôm sure countless people can relate though, right?

If you made it this far, thank you so much for reading. I‚Äôm so sorry for making such a long post, and if you actually read the whole thing you have admirable patience (please teach me your ways!) Hopefully, contacting the therapist will be a step in the right direction. I hope that whatever you yourself are going through, things look up for you. I believe in you! If a weakling like me can still keep kicking then you can put up a way better fight haha. If things are good for you, I‚Äôm super happy for you and proud as well :)",13Sep2020,3
116,"I was previously a well respected person in all my circles. I had a lot of great friends .. both at and outside work. I made friends very very easily.

And, since I used the SSRI, I lost friends at an exponential rate. Now, I barely have a couple of friends, and I‚Äôve observed.. these friends including a lot of new people I meet, tend to speak with me in a sarcastic tone or in a very disrespective way.

123,"What is it called
 when your mind starts to think and reminisce about the mentally and physically abuse that you went through coming up 
I think someone would called it a disluisional thing 
but to me these events really happen to me
 but in my head I'm having this vision of me having this conversation on the phone with another person who's questioning me about topics
Like what my family did to me and had other people do to me 
And setting me up in all kinds of ways in the streets and with the government system
from woman beater to elderly beater a lot of things we are talking about on the phone
And I'm giving answers to every question
 and I'm  telling the different stories to him 
of what happen to me in the neighborhood and with the system 
basically we having like an interview over the phone
Then after we done talking he hangs up 
And All I see in the picture of my head
it's like a phone conversation turnt into this  live event 
So the second part
I walk into this building 
where I'm seeing my family and different celebrities 
Smiling and more other faces you can see walking into a room full of people
From male and female rappers to actors and actresses
In there 
And I don't know 
all I can remember seeing before I snapped out of it was a rapper asking me 
how did I survive all of that abuse and all the other stuff  I did to get out of it alive 
With me Being light skinned at that
 in a black community and fighting against the system dealing with all that
While everyone else is clapping and applauding to his question
My response when I answered him 
by keeping my sanity 
Then I told him that I remember watching a show called rhythm + Flow with T.I, Cardi B, chance the rapper in it
And I remember Cardi B saying you know it's always hard coming out being that first one
On top me saying after 
I thank God he allowed me to be that first one in this life to make it out and survive to become someone at least I hope this is an opportunity 
because the way I was raised to be different and be myself so much it's in steel in me forever to the point 
that I don't think I'll ever be able to live a normal average life like someone else in this Life
Then the rapper added to the question
that I was lucky to survive all that 
and normally black people wouldn't have allowed me to be myself in the way i did 
I responded to him
basically because I was able to get away with being full black instead of just being light skinned half 
But that was how I was always been 
Due to the fact I m estranged on my mother side
However  I never thought different till now
 basis off how I'm treated now 
See once I got older they changed it around on me now I'm not accepted
 but I realized later that I was never accepted
 they just got me comfortable in a role of pretending like I'm full black as one 
to steady me and learn certain things about like aspects of fears being one
 trying to figure me out and whatever else goes in that
 because now I'm half black that's another story
Now
 I'm neglected 
People abandoned me 
I'm still abused mentally and physically 
Other family play this game called
Mind control and other games
every name you could think of in the book under mentally and physically abuse I'm going through now 
Family are still manipulating using the past to build up new history on me  
Plus I'm aloner  
always home with my grandmother and father being the ones I'm close to 
Talk to
Joke with 
Everything else people do  
But people always doing stuff to me 
I been trying to protect my energy and my gift my talent 
My determined my drive my confidence my dedication my work ethic energy safe and protect

He denied it cos he didnt want to be in a category of disabled at such a young age (on disabilty)

He had a colostomy bag for a year n at that time was told it would always be there.
He denied ssi and worked very hard to get his body in check n now doesnt need the colostomy bag. Actually only needed when he was recovering that 1 year. 
Bu the said that took a long time to get back to normal for him.
And after the surgery he had to learn to walk again, 10th grade. A boy, a young man..

And this all could have happened because of the stress from his fucked up family. 
Doctors said that could havevery well caused it.

He said all he did was read and talk to imaginary people who weren't there leading up to this.
He was ultimately making up a new.world for himself as a child so he would not have to hear/deal with the constant abuse and he could escape inside his imagination.

At 13 his mom dropped him off at a psych ward with no warning, so at 14 when his colon went bad he choose not to tell her in fear of hospitalization against his will... 

Now, due to his intense surgeries he had at a young age, they had to put him into a coma with pain meds. 
You know what happens when a 15 years old kid gets put on a morphine drip for a year?

So, fast forward to his time to leave.
He now has been in the hospital recovering from something he didnt ask for, couldnt be prevented,¬† and almost killed him.
N was mostly likely caused from the stress he endured from his own family for 15 years.
So now 
He is a full blown morphine addict (thanks big pharma) and has pain no 15 year old should ever encounter. 
Opiates were fed to him at such a young age the doctors have since told him they're a part of his genetic makeup.
In his genes, his body craves it since then.

So---

This unfortunally leads him down a very long and dark path to alleviate his physical pain and escape his mental abuse, he turns to heroin.
Now, this led him down a path of crime and addiction that took him 22 years to pull away from. 

He has been sober for 5 years now
And now more than ever he needs help.
Government help, he cant work yet is forced to in order to keep his insurance. 
So he can treat his illnesses tbat aren't preventable nor his choosing. 

&amp;Without his insurance he wouldn't be able to afford his meds for his ulcers. 
He is sick everynight and every bite of food he takes reacts like poison in his gut. N if he is stressed or anxious its even more intense.

He cant walk, talk or.move. sits there n moans for up to 12+ hours. N work is been taking it out.of him latley..

Idk what to do anymore, in thr town we live in hes gotten denied social sec 2 times. 
The lawyers and doctors all reassure him its ""cut n dry"" and he does need it.
Until he sees the judge, who has the finalsay n ALWAYS says he ""just want to sponge off the government, or get drugs.""

WHAT 

His illnesses are chronic anqd it breaks my heart what the judges do n say to him based on his criminal past with drug use.
*which was all caused by both of his illnesses in effort to help pain/cope/escape, and again induced by DOCTORS IN THE FUCKING LATE 80S-90S

We're only fucking human and we all fuck up but fuck it if i havent seen someone try till their blue in the face just to be knocked back down.
Someone who truly deserves a rest, deserves a break and needs relief for once in his stressful life.

&amp;Again -- He was told by the judge he only wants this monthly as a means to buy drugs n get off on the government. 
Fuck that.
REALLY? $600 A MONTH? 
FUCK THEM
600 a mo barely a livable wage, n the judge (who knows the least n didnt read his file beyond previous drug addict) is the one who makes the final decision?

Oh yeah, and he's been sober now for 5 YEARS.  
5 fucking years.. he is 44. 

So i say WTF. 
So just wondered if anyone out there has had similar expierences and how they handled it.

130,"Warning, swearing.

NOTE, THIS IS NOT *THAT* IMPORTANT, I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THIS IS PINNED AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO NEED MORE HELP THAN ME. 

You‚Äôre going to see the worst of me as you read this and I‚Äôm really really sorry for this but I feel like I need to let this out. I also just kind of need help. 

Here are the problems, 

- My dad has diagnosed anxiety and it‚Äôs ran in his family for a fucking long time (and for some shitty reason decided to children for fucks sake now I have to lie in bed every night crying because I‚Äôm going to die eventually and the whole universe is going to collapse forever and shit god fucking dammit just adopt next time.)

- Regularly at minor inconveniences, I get homicidal thoughts that I‚Äôm pretty sure aren‚Äôt intrusive because I enjoy them. I believe this is some sort of way of venting but I have no idea. 

- I find frequently find it hard to sleep 

- I have a lack of empathy and this one I am 100% sure of.

- I have self harmed multiple times out of boredom (and for other reasons).

- I have a weird fear of getting things wrong and can have a breakdown if proven incorrect.

- Generally people who take their time and do things slowly trigger a deep anger in me for some reason.

- I hate socialising and I can‚Äôt stand spending time with my family.

- Rarely but notably, I have to restrain myself from harming random things or destroying things for no particular reason.

- I have been manipulative in the past and am deeply hypocritical.

- I manifest personalities in my head to talk to internally, I currently have 6. I‚Äôm aware that they‚Äôre figments of my imagination and I do not hallucinate. This is probably out of boredom.

- I have had people (who really know me) tell me that I have a god complex. I‚Äôm not sure about this one because I‚Äôm not narcissistic to that extent. 

- I have an obsession with my early childhood. 

- I get regularly sick of people I know one day and the next day I‚Äôm all over them.

- I get paranoid at random times and think that people I‚Äôm attracted to or admire can read my actual unwanted thoughts.

- I have a very high sex drive. 

- I‚Äôm prone to addiction. 

- I have memory issues and have a debilitating (that‚Äôs probably an exaggeration lol) issue with procrastination.

- I frequently want to kill myself but I won‚Äôt go through with it.

- I‚Äôm prone to addiction 

- I find it hard to put effort into things.

- Iam EXTREMELY insecure about my appearance and have a tendency to cover or edit something over my face if I send photos to friends or online.

- I have a monotonous voice.

- I get embarrassed and overwhelmed extremely easily.

I trust myself that I won‚Äôt harm or do anything to anyone because even with all this shit I know deep down that 100% I can‚Äôt do anything bad because I‚Äôm as human as all of you and even with not a lot of empathy I still feel the same things and I will absolutely step out if I‚Äôm going to hurt anyone or anything. I can promise everyone reading this on my life that I won‚Äôt.

I have seen a therapist and was told I have characteristics of Aspergers but this doesn‚Äôt make sense since I don‚Äôt react to loud noises and the only part of it I sort of get is the sudden interests, the liking of routines, and the disliking of textures or wet sounds. I guess that‚Äôs why she said characteristics lol. I had to drop her because she got upset at me for not wanting to purchase a bunch of shit that wouldn‚Äôt even help me. (Not exaggerating here, it literally fixed a problem that I didn‚Äôt even have) 

I‚Äôve been told by many people I‚Äôm nice person and I‚Äôm charismatic or whatever but my personality changes a lot based on fictional characters I admire or just random influences so I‚Äôm never sure.

I‚Äôm not trying to self diagnose but holy shit I have no idea what the fuck happens up there. It could be normal or not but I have no expertise or knowledge. I‚Äôm extremely sorry for bothering anyone with this and I feel like listing off my symptoms in a subreddit where people are suffering worse than I am is very inappropriate. 

If it matters: 

The last time I self harmed was three days ago. 
The last time I had a breakdown was four days ago. 
The two things I love unconditionally on this planet are my cats

142,"Hello all, 

I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while and finally decided to post. This post is partly to solicit advice and portly to just vent online.

Like the title says, I want to learn how to care less about how other people feel. I'm an early career researcher at a large hospital on the east coast and as such, my job tends to be fairly demanding. I just started at my new job, however, and it has been virtual right from the start. I have found myself constantly worrying about how the other PIs on my team feel about me and how the other research associates on the team feel about me. No one has given me any indication to make me feel I'm not doing an adequate job, and yet I'm constantly reading into every word, email, and interaction. 

This tendency of mine to read into what people feel about me has extended to my friends circle as well. Over the last couple of months, we've been trying to hang out in a socially distant manner at a park and I am beginning to not enjoy it as much anymore. I'm constantly worrying if I'm bothering anyone when I speak or whether what I'm saying is appropriate within the circumstances of the conversations we're having. Mind you, these are people I went to graduate school with and we shared a tight bond for nearly 5 years. 

The one saving grace in my life is my wife who is incredibly supportive and I don't feel like I have to read into anything she says. And so, despite the fact that home feels like a safe space, with everything else being so fraught with anxiety in life I feel like my time at home in the evenings/weekends is also being filled with anxiety.

I just started seeing a new therapist. I'm not sure how I feel about them yet, but I'm sticking with the sessions for now. I really just want to learn to shut out these (for lack of a better word) paranoid thoughts anytime I'm interacting with someone. I'm aware of the toll the pandemic has taken on peoples' lives and I recognize that good mental health is at a premium in these times. Some of my research is tangentially tied to this. I'm hesitant to vent to my friends (or even my therapist) about how I feel because my brain tells me that what I'm feeling is not unique and that there are likely no real answers until we can all come out of the pandemic. Whether or not that is the right attitude is probably up for debate. But I'm honestly getting tired. 

I really really want to learn how to be more zen and to read into what people say a little less.",13Sep2020,7

145,"**(WARNING THIS POST MIGHT BE TRIGGERING FOR SOME PEOPLE!)**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As an 11 year old child I was sexually abused on a daily basis by my former best friend until I was 13 years old. Mostly for 1-2 hours, but in between there were also assaulting activities and the forced consumption of pornographic material. I was bullied at that time and he used my weakened psyche to abuse it as well. Before I was 11 years old I was made to imitate and simulate sexual acts. One of the earliest incidents dates back to kindergarten, at that time I was not even friends with him. 

At some point I couldn't stand it anymore and gradually told my other bestfriend and my mother about it. The contact to him was cut off. I was then diagnosed with extremely low blood pressure and had to stay at home for almost two weeks. A few months later I was very depressed and suffered from self-destructive behavior for a long time. 

Nowadays I have short phases, in which I'm not sad anymore, but scared. I have anxiety to interact alone with men or boys and also in groups I find it difficult to communicate relaxed with men and boys. (Here at I would like to make it clear that I have nothing against men and I am working hard to restore my confidence)  Apart from men, I am not able to live without stress or fear for more than three days. I am very afraid of persecution, often things I am not aware of. I was one time scarred to be to be monitored by state authorities from the Internet and cell phones. Otherwise I have difficulties to take a shower, because there is a mirror in front of the shower and I see myself.

It is important to note again that these are phases. Phases that are usually two weeks or less long. And apart from that, I am living a relatively normal and happy life now. 

So I ask myself if I really need help or if I should just wait until it goes away.

149," 

I'm writing this because I'm overwhelmed with guilt and anxiety and have even considered suicide.

I am a 15 year old boy, and I did something awful that has triggered mental issues within. I remember one night a while ago, I was feeling horny and for some reason I decided to wank whilst looking at a picture of my cousin. I have no clue why I did it because I don't even find her attractive or anything. Since then I have been absolutely mortified and wouldn't dream of doing anything like that again.

The guilt is really dragging me down and it's hurting me so much. I feel at my lowest and I don't know what to do. I feel like I can't live with this guilt anymore. What is wrong with me? Why am I so sick in the head to do something like that?",13Sep2020,1
150,"So I decided to try being a youtuber lately. I wanted to make a video, but I get very sick of my own voice. At some point I even consider suicide because of it (I'm mentally weak so sorry) I need help please. (I wanted my videos to be in English, but my English is bad and I can't survive hearing myself jn English)",13Sep2020,1
151,"So I have a history of self harm and one suicide attempt that thankfully didn‚Äôt go as planned. This all started after a terrible motorcycle accident where I was ran off the road and not much later I was sexually assaulted by a coworker. I am male and the coworker was female and I feel it‚Äôs been very hard to get help that takes me seriously. Not to mention I‚Äôm married and even my own wife didn‚Äôt take me seriously for a long time about the sexual assault.

I made a promise to myself that I wouldn‚Äôt kill myself about two years ago. However, lately my mind keeps obsessing over the thought. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs a person inside me who is hell bent on ending everything, and I literally have to scream and plead for that person to stop.

I have PTSD with TBI. Everyone says I have changed, but they never seem to think that maybe it‚Äôs just a natural response to trauma and the treatment of trauma, or even the traumatic brain injury I suffer from. In fact they tell me I don‚Äôt need my medications I simply need Jesus. While I am religious in some sense, I‚Äôm not the Southern Baptist they want me to be. So in response they have disowned me and tried to break up my marriage, citing that my wife has turned me into some kind of heathen.

My mother even went as far as sending in a false report to CPS saying that we neglect our child and all we do is smoke weed every day. Which is not true, I don‚Äôt even smoke weed and my child is my entire world and the biggest reason I am able to talk myself out of all my bullshit SI feelings. CPS found the report to be unfounded after a welfare check and drug test that came up with only my prescribed medications. In response I changed my phone number and have not given my mother or other family members my number as I don‚Äôt feel they have my best interest at heart.

I have 3-5 nightmares every night always related to multiple traumatic events. And there are so many, not only from 2 years ago but from when I was a child as well. I have been sexually assaulted by 5 females and 2 males in my lifetime and find trusting people incredibly difficult. I‚Äôve been having a hard time even leaving my bed lately let alone my home.

I feel worthless, weak, stupid, ugly, bad, broken. It‚Äôs like I know all the things that happened aren‚Äôt my fault but I can‚Äôt help but blame myself, I mean how do these things happen time and time again without me questioning if perhaps I‚Äôm inviting people to manipulate and hurt me. 

I‚Äôm sorry this post is too long and I‚Äôm forgetting what I wanted to say or ask. I suppose I just want a friend again. Someone who I don‚Äôt have to worry about having ulterior motives. Someone who I can talk to about hobbies and other things that keep me wanting to live. Maybe even someone to talk to on a regular basis so I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm the reason no one wants to stay with me or talk with me.

I guess I just want to change all these negative beliefs about myself by proving to myself I can have a friend again. An actual friend, someone that just wants to talk to me. If anyone has any experiences like mine and is willing to share a bit of how you cope please share.

153,"So tonight my nephew (15m) told me (25f) that he is struggling with what sounds like severe depression. We spoke for about 2 hours. It's now 2am.

Long story short, he is struggling with the usual symptoms: low self esteem, constant suicidal thoughts, previous self-harm (once), anxiety, inability to focus on schoolwork, inability to fall asleep, inability to get a decent sleep, and on top of all that, frightening memory gaps. He comes home from school and literally has no answer to the question: *""How was school?""* He doesn't know. He doesn't REMEMBER.

He told me that these issues only cover around 5% of the bullshit he has to deal with. We are barely scratching the surface with that list. And that scares me. My nephew is SO good at seeming normal that I had no idea until now that anything was amiss. Nobody does.

So when he started talking, I had to ask a lot of questions. I found the following:

My nephew's coping mechanisms include: playing playstation to distract himself when he is upset, and forcing those emotions deep, deep down inside where he doesn't have to deal with them. He understands that sometimes this results in bottling things up and it causes him to 'explode' occasionally, but he doesn't currently have any better coping mechanisms.

So far his circle of support people 'in the know' include: Me (as of tonight), his close friends, his uncle (my brother), who is about the same age. Unfortunately my nephew's friends and my brother are all teenagers who are dealing with their own issues, and they can't provide adequate support. I tried to urge my nephew to tell his parents but he is adamant that they remain in the dark. He believes wholeheartedly that they will dismiss his feelings or tell him to 'man up' (a phrase we both expressed revulsion towards). 

I know my sister and her partner are sympathetic to mental illness (there's so much evidence in their general behaviour and parenting style that I can't even list it or I'd hit my character limit). I struggle with depression and they have gone above and beyond to support me. My sister even struggles with depression herself. But I guess the last time my nephew brought up how he felt to them, they dismissed his feelings entirely (chalking it up to being tired) because he is terrified to take his concerns back to them. I don't think they did this intentionally. I think it was simply a case of miscommunication between them. But it was enough to scare my nephew off going to his parents for support.

I don't know what is causing my nephew's depression. He isn't a bullied kid. He's popular. He's smart. He's funny. He's got hobbies. He's got a great family. His mental health issues seem to be coming from 'nowhere', which makes them even more difficult to cope with. The only 'trigger' he was able to name was his little sister (f10). He's awesome with his little sisters, but this particular girl has a very loud, boisterous personality which turns FOUL when she is upset. She is very much the door-slamming, screaming, tantruming kind of angry, which upsets him a lot and can trigger his depression. (We are all trying to curb her behaviour, but it's slow going. I plan to keep an eye on this, and make sure she doesn't bother him when she is upset in the future).

I think my nephew needs to tell his parents about his mental health issues, develop some healthy coping mechanisms, and start getting treatment for what is clearly becoming a very severe mental health issue. But I have no idea how to encourage any of this. I am willing to pay for and accompany him to doctor's appointments and therapy. I will keep an eye out for him and make sure he's doing ok each day. I will try to quietly prevent him from getting in trouble with his parents for things that might be related to his depression (forgetfulness/sleeping in absurdly late/etc...).

Can someone please offer advice?

Specifically, I would really love some advice about convincing him to speak to his parents. I don't want to betray my nephew's trust by spilling the beans to his parents. I don't want to force him to have this conversation with his parents before he's ready. But every day that they are kept in the dark is another day that they can't offer him support. And they are the BEST, most POWERFUL support people available in his life. He needs them. But he's scared to talk to them. How can I help with this? If I can't push him towards talking, what subtle things can I do to encourage them to support him without saying outright ""I know something you don't know"".

His boy deserves the fucking world. He deserves better than what he's going through.

161,"So to give context: 
I‚Äôm a 19 year old male, I‚Äôm a pessimist (‚Äúloser‚Äù mentality,) I‚Äôve been bullied most of my life in grade school, my dad has very high standards and has no qualms with visibly expressing his disappointment, and I‚Äôve started taking medication for depression starting about two months ago. 

I‚Äôve been put down most of my life. I‚Äôm not trying to write a sob story or something, but I am just stating the facts here to give better insight. I think I was average-ish in school and coupled with the facts I chose not to apply myself and I‚Äôm unattractive this didn‚Äôt help my self image in the eyes of my fellow students. I was the dumb, dopey fat kid. I was relentlessly bullied. I remember one day a friends‚Äô dad saw me getting beaten up by a group of kids outside of my middle school and he asked later if I was being bullied and I just said no because I didn‚Äôt want to admit the truth. I felt myself absolutely collapsing under this mental image of myself that was thrusted upon me. 

My dad didn‚Äôt help matters either. He had high standards for me and had no qualms with verbally abusing me for my failings, even on topics not related to my grades. I distinctly remember in sixth grade slinking down in my car seat looking out the window as he repeatedly called me fat and mocked me for being lazy. I brought this specific occurrence up years later hoping he might apologize, but he said that he did it for my benefit and I was the one who should apologize for letting him down back then. 

So fast forward to now. I‚Äôm in my second year of my undergrad and I should hypothetically have the ideal life. While I suck at pretty much everything else, there are two things I‚Äôm good at: yodeling (using yodeling as a substitute for the real act to protect my identity due to what I‚Äôm majoring in being a relatively small field) and certain video games, specifically Nintendo. I take pride in both of these activities because they‚Äôre all I really CAN take pride in. I have no other skills or talents except being ok-ish at drawing. So without giving too much away, I‚Äôm majoring in professional yodeling and have been given a free ride by the university I‚Äôm attending due to my abilities. Realistically me having an inferiority complex just sounds silly since I have an ideal college undergrad situation on paper. But I‚Äôm just not happy with my life. 

My years from grade school have taken a heavy toll on my life. I can‚Äôt see any form of success at all without feeling intense jealousy or even loathing for the person who obtained that success. Even the smallest talent or boon that somebody else has makes me feel lesser and I can‚Äôt do anything about it. On top of some philosophical quandaries I‚Äôve had for the past year, it honestly makes me want to end my life. I‚Äôm never happy anymore. I‚Äôm just so insecure and empty. I hate being wrong. Last night, my parents corrected something I said and I just shut down and quit talking to them. I‚Äôm just an average white boy and I hate it. I hate it so fucking much. There‚Äôs no reason to love me or want to respect me. I‚Äôm mean and cruel. I‚Äôm useless. Like I said, it feels like my only escape is death. So what can I do to fix this? Is there anything I CAN do? I‚Äôve seen no responses to inferiority complexes other than ‚Äúuhhh try therapy I guess‚Äù on threads like this. I just can‚Äôt live like this. I can‚Äôt.",13Sep2020,1

Listen, I know it sounds stupid. No one in their right mind ever thinks having a mental illness is the best option for them. I don‚Äôt actually wish I have depression. 

But, with that being said, depression is a mental disorder that people understand. Medicine and therapy can help. So an idiotic part of me thinks if I have depression then it can be ‚Äòfixed‚Äô. Because I know there is something 100% wrong with me but I can‚Äôt place my finger on what it is. I‚Äôve self harmed for a while now (mostly cutting and hitting my face with my fists/objects) so I‚Äôm not completely ok. But I‚Äôm not poor or unhealthy or alone (although I often feel lonely) so I feel stupid for hating myself. Im a very privileged person, there‚Äôs people all over the world in situations way worse than mine, I don‚Äôt deserve to feel unhappy. I‚Äôm just a normal dude, there‚Äôs nothing about me to warrant the intense feeling I have of self hatred and suicidal thoughts.

I feel selfish for feeling sad so maybe if it‚Äôs a illness it would explain a few questions I have about myself. 

If anyone feels the same way or thinks I‚Äôm just acting plain dumb please let me know. I‚Äôm quite lost in life at the moment and could use some advice.

174,"Hey. I just turned 15 so my dad has been teaching me how to drive.

My parents are divorced and my mom is really hard to talk to and manipulative. I live with my mom and my brothers. My parents still talk and they‚Äôre fine with each other. Driving has been fine, but I do struggle with people raising their voice at me and high pressure situations. It‚Äôs also hard for me to make decisions. When I‚Äôm having really high anxiety I can really speak anymore and the only way I can deal with it is to hyper focus on one thing until I can calm down. So I was coming off the gas too late and my dad would raise his voice and tell me to slow down repeatedly when I would. I get anxiety attacks my whole life when an adult raises their voice at me. I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs because of my mom and how she treated me. My dad had good intentions, but he can be bad sometimes. He was questioning me and I couldn‚Äôt speak and he got mad at me.

175,"Hey, 

I'm M25.

My childhood was horrible( as far as I could remember).

This was partly down to my parent's own unresolved childhood issues. 

My mum was married off at 18, and wasn't much educated, neither had individuality as was brought up in a strong patriarchal setup.

On the other hand, my father had abandonment issues wherein he felt his parents failed to give him a good upbringing and life.

This ended up being a lethal combination of two individuals coming together and raising a child at a time when they were neither psychological nor financially ready to have a kid.

And thus I was born. 


I was beaten on multiple occasions be ages 7 to 14 by both of my parents, never at the same time though.

Publicly humiliated in front of my grandparents, uncles &amp; aunt as well as cousins alike.

I was sent to bad schools and was made to feel as if it was a big favour on me that we were ""doing all they can"" to give me a good life.

I grew up to be nerdy, with low self esteem, social anxiety and what not.


But since last couple years, my parents' approach has changed. 

It seems as if they have started to realise the mistakes they have committed, simultaneously doting more on me and looking after me financially in these times of turmoil.

So a part of me wants to forgive them and start off with a clean slate. 

While the other believes that institutional deprivation at an early age cannot be compensated for with an equal or more amount of investment on their part, may it be emotionally, financially or otherwise.

I live in a nation where accessing therapy is not entirely possible.

I feel inadequate, underconfident and at times suicidal.
But I know I'm strong enough to fight through this.


What should be the way forward fro me in life now!?",13Sep2020,1

Most therapists in my area charge at least $100 for a meeting and recommend weekly meetings. There is no way I can currently afford that. Is there a way to get financial help for such things as a student? Would love to know if there are any ressources than can help!

178,"I know I am not the only one who has issues but I just want to know how to find the motivation to live? Right now, I still have a reason to. My parents are still both alive and while our relationship is now what I would call stellar, I still dont want them to find out that I committed suicide. I also want to live but I find it too hard to find a reason to. To make it all worth it.

My parents are old. One is already a senior and another is soon to be (i think if he isnt yet) and lately, the past few months or maybe year idk, really, when it started. I have always thought of suicide, how, what kind, how to make it look like an accident, the usual. I had for years now but recently, its gotten worse. I have already picked a building on the campus, know how to access it, from which spot to jump from if it were to happen while Im in campus. I have also thought of a place by the port, with less security, to jump in, in case I decide I want to drown or sometimes just hold a machete for awhile thinking if it would hurt that much or think of how to tie a noose.

I really dont know when I stopped thinking that suicide is a way of avoiding things and started thinking of how brave people who do it are. I am afraid of pain and I want to live but its just that I am finding it so hard to find a reason for it, other than my parents being alive.

180,"

My story is a very very complicated one so I will try to keep it short and focus on the relevant parts. To say from the start that I am not at certain whether I have suffered from CSA but some events form the last few years have made me wonder about this again. I have thought about it before. I am aware of the controversies around repressed memories.

So I had a traumatic childhood. My father used to beat my mother and I saw this. My sister has claimed once that my father abused her, however, when I ask her about that now she said that she didn‚Äôt say that. My parents got divorced when we were children. I don‚Äôt remember any sexual or physical abuse but I do recall being in a strange environment sexually. I remember being exposed to print pornography at a young age. I also remember behaviours that I know now are strange. When we stayed with my father we would sleep in his bed with him, up until the age of 10 or even later. We would also sleep in my mother‚Äôs bed too, not always but often, and this continued right up until our teenage years. I remember that my younger sister would have a habit of masturbating by rubbing herself on the floor carpet with her legs tucked either side of her, I recall this because she would do it often and openly, even when others were present. I was a very small child and I also remember some experiences of doctors checking out my development that I know were normal but I felt invaded by. When I was a teenager I was way behind my peers in my sexual development and didn‚Äôt experiment with boys the way they did. I remember when I was around 17 one of my high school teacher telling me that I was sexually repressed. I had always had a problem with eating for comfort and I also wore mostly black or very dark and baggy clothing. My family were not particularly religious but during my teenage years I began to explore the Christian faith more seriously and attended church. 

I had one serious boyfriend who I broke up with and then was friends for a long time with an amazing man who became my husband. We were both virgins when we married for religious reasons and when we tried to have PIV intercourse it wasn‚Äôt possible and I suspected I had something wrong but didn‚Äôt know what at the time. I know think that I had vaginismus which I was never treated for. Despite this our marriage was a real joy and our emotional intimacy was extremely high, we are real soul mates and life was so good.

Eventually I studied for a PHD in sociology which I found emotionally taxing and my anxiety levels were extremely raised. However, I was doing extremely well and nobody picked up that there was any problems with me or my work. In the context I was in in my field, I was coming across lots of ideas about sexuality and religion and areas of conflict which made me feel a sense of unease. At the time, I didn‚Äôt realise how anxious I was getting but when I look back I see I was caught in a spiral of avoidance tactics, like shopping, eating, procrastinating on my work, just avoiding it. But at the same time I also seemed super happy and on top of the world with how well things were going. At times I felt detached from reality. But again because I was doing well nobody noticed. At the same time I was trying to come to terms with the fact that we wouldn‚Äôt have children because of my vaginismus. 

I submitted my thesis and had a horrific psychotic break which made me question absolutely everything about myself. The break centred around my work and things I believed that I had done wrong in it. It was very extreme and the doctors said it was a reaction to extreme anxiety. It was horrifically bad and I harmed myself but don‚Äôt want to say too much detail here. I had never had a history of any mental health problems before and people around said I was extremely stable. But lots of issues sort of came out in that time. I became fixated that I had not been true to myself and that o had done terrible things wrong in the research. I had horrific religious delusions. Lots of things explicitly around identity came out that I felt I had been pretending to be someone totally different. But also in a way totally and utterly uncharacteristic of me I began to say and do things that were overly sexual in ways I had not only never done but had honestly never ever felt an urge or desire to. To say I have lost all sense of myself as a person is not putting it too strongly. I can‚Äôt even listen to music I used to like because it reminds me of a person who is dead or gone. I don‚Äôt read books at all now and used to read many most weeks. 

I am still trying to make sense of it all. The therapy I have just seems to focus on getting me to believe that I have not done anything wrong and that this is a delusion. But I remain convinced that I have done things wrong and I was ill for a long time but in a way no one seems to recognise. My life honestly has gone from a fairytale to a nightmare. I used to feel so safe and happy with my husband but now all I feel is terror.

The trust issue thing had increased along with my anxiety. 
I recently started a new course and online lectures have started I get mini anxiety before class I guess just conversing new people really scare. I have also been trying to make new friends which is pretty difficult for me as I am an introvert. These things made me doubt myself as a person for example: I texted one of the girls to know about the accommodation once we go to state of the college. She didn't reply to for almost a day and I broke down thinking that she is ignoring. She did message me back after 24hours. The second thing was in one of lectures I couldnt answer a question and I started to think that everyone is better than probably they are and I might not excel in this course which has been my dream all along. I am so scared that I won't make any friends. Won't have anyone to talk to. I am scare of being alone. I already feel lonely but I don't want to feel the same once I move to another state.

I‚Äôve been feeling so incredibly isolated already as a result of COVID and quarantine, but I think social media has made this even worse. At first it was really helpful because i felt a sense of community with everyone, knowing we were all in this together and that a lot of us were struggling with productivity, staying sane, and just adjusting to being home all the time. 

Now, since I don‚Äôt get to see my friends as frequently as I would have pre-COVID and social media is one of the ways I keep in touch with a lot of people, I‚Äôve felt more compelled than ever to try to make my life seem more interesting and keep up a persona almost of sorts.

I think probably the best solution is to change the way i‚Äôm using and consuming social media. 

I‚Äôm trying to invest more time into things that make me happy and confide in friends about how I‚Äôve been feeling.

I was very much ‚Äúenjoy life, treat yourself,‚Äù but that‚Äôs just not me at all. 
I‚Äôm a bit worried I was experiencing mania or hypomania, but the issue is that one of the decisions I made was to visit family, which calmed me down somewhat as I couldn‚Äôt be quite as carefree, as well as becoming ill so I wasn‚Äôt up to doing much.

Mentions of r*pe,drug abuse, violence, mental health issues and self harm

Hey,just wanted a little help and advice if that's ok please? Or if you have had any similar experiences and got through it?

So,I'm currently being treated for anxiety and depression by my GP. But I have a feeling there could be something deeper going on,possibly PTSD? 
How do you go about getting assessed and diagnosed privately? Does it have to be a psychiatrist instead of psychotherapist? 

I don't really understand it all but the way I feel and behave can't be ignored anymore and I don't want to go to my GP with it because I'm afraid they won't take me seriously because of past events. ie There's been times when I've been taken to my local A and E because of self harm wounds and I've being 'having an episode' and regrettably a few times I caused a bit of a scene which I'm deeply ashamed off,and after treating me for the wounds there wasn't any follow up really.


When I self harm,I don't do it to cope or as a coping mechanism,I really want to hurt myself,one time I went for my jugular.
I've been steady for a few months now and haven't self harmed but lots of events and issue's have come to the surface and it's getting overwhelming.
Sometimes everything's fine,I'm bubbly and outgoing and can have a positive attitude and some days I lay in bed with intrusive thought's about jumping out my window or starting a fight with a stranger in a bid to get them to harm me physically. Or I'll just go over and over things that I blame myself for,my friend being stabbed, the person who did it got a 12 month suspended sentence,not reporting a sexual assault years ago( I recently found out that the guy who did it went on to r*pe at least 14 other women and is currently in prison for it, finally) I think I could of been one of the early ones and saved these women so much pain. (Because of the timeline)


I used to binge drink heavily and use drugs as way to feel normal. My anxiety started after I stopped,because I could hear myself think and these instrusive thought's began to rule my mind. I think of myself as ""good me"" and ""bad me"" and it's really weighing me down. 

I just want to live to my full potential and not be drowning in these feelings. 

I want to understand myself and manage my thoughts and feelings but it all seems like a pipedream.

224,"(Male, 17y/o, the Netherlands)

So I've been addicted to heroin and amphetamine for the past 5 years and I'm clean for a little more than 200 days. And I've a past (between my 10th and 13th) with selfharm.

I've been diagnosed with a social anxiety disorder, a panicdisorder, ADHD and an unspecified depression disorder. I've also been diagnosed with severe psychopathological issues (that means I score very high on borderline, schizophrenia, bipolair disorder, sociopathy but don't score high enough to actually be diagnosed with it) 

I've been prescribed sertraline (a ssri-antidepressant) against my symptoms of severe anxiety and depression.

But since I returned from rehab and started reintegrating I had to get a higher dose of sertraline (now 100mg/day) but since then I've had a very rough time and I noticed that the Voices inside of my head returned in an extreme way, as soon as I start to think about something I'm afraid of it triples my fear and makes me disabled to do what I want. Since these voices I've ruined my relationship with the love of my life (she broke up with me) and I'm on the edge of a relapse. I do not know what to do about these voices. My psychiatrist says I have to wait a while to see how it evolves and I still have my therapy but that isn't focused on these voices because this problem was gone for several months.

I want to start by saying that i've been in therapy for 5 years ( since i was 14 ) but only this year i found a therapist that really helped  me and led me to make some progress ( he really is the best, i really trust him with all my heart ) and, in these years, i've been diagnosed with a really bad depression, anxiety disorder, bad anger issues and an ed.

237,"I'm not really sure why I'm even writing this. Because in reality I don't feel like I care. It just seems like something to do right now, and thoughts are flowing too fast for me to write them down. 

COVID has sucked the ever loving life out of me and my relationship with my SO. Both my parents are in health care, so this entire experience has been draining. I live out of state, so the distance has made my anxiety worse. While I consider both of them smart, both are Trump supporters and really toe the line between caring about COVID and total disregard. It's been exhausting caring about their well-being while also listening to them bitch about how unfair the media portray's trump.

Then there's my SO. We've been spending a lot of time together since this started and at first it brought us closer together. We were each others rocks, shoulders to cry on, and he really helped me through a lot of my anxiety during this time. Now, we're both starting up school again and things are shit. He's basically succumbed to this routine of league of legends, minor school work and watching TV. We're in lock down again, there's not really anything we can do I guess. He smokes a lot of weed mixed with cigs and I've been complaining about how it makes his breath smell, especially given he hates mint (and therefore toothpaste). Clearly I've been worried about his dental health, his lung health, and it puts a damper on the sexual things in our relationship. Whenever I bring it up, he just takes it all very personal, like I'm attacking his fucking character. We also live somewhere hot, so our BO gets pretty out of control. Not just armpits, but feet tend to smell after a day in the heat. Again, something I mention, and he takes it all so personally. I mention it's both of us, he still thinks I'm attacking his entire being. 

Now he's told me that ""all you ever do is say mean, hurtful things to me, you're just a mean person."" I say I don't understand how I'm supposed to bring up personal hygiene issues, which I don't think are fundamentally part of someone's character, without offending him. He takes offense to it like smelling is something he'd put on his resume. Like it's something he works hard for. He has a lot of acne on his ass, I recommend showering more, he insists that sitting and picking at it will make it better. It doesn't, and in the 3 and a half years we've been together, it never has. 

I don't understand what I'm supposed to be doing. Do I just enable it? Say fine, live your life your way, and I'll put up with it? If we get married, which I hoped we would, do I look forward of dealing with your lung cancer in our future? How the fuck am I supposed to bring up being concerned without crushing your fragile masculinity? Now he says he just doesn't want to talk to me. I asked if he really felt that I'm just a mean, malicious person, and all I do is make him miserable, why he hasn't voiced that. He just responded with ""don't know."" At this point I'm so over it. I just don't care. Part of me wants to get so gross and grimy that he finally sees how horrible it is to try and be with someone like that, but part of me really gives no shits.

Honestly, I give no shits about anything. At this point, the only thing I care about is my degree. I used to call my parents every few days, now I call them maybe twice a month. I just don't have the energy to try and listen to their bullshit. I used to try and mend things with my boyfriend, but just don't have the energy anymore. My research is in climate change, which is ironic because it's intrinsically driven by my care for people. Yet the people closest in my life I just can't seem to care about. Idk, maybe I've lost faith in them, and that exists with the rest of them. Maybe I just find them disappointing. Honestly, writing this makes me feel kind of sad, but around the beginning of August something just changed in me. I just find that people are inherently disappointing, which I'm sure isn't a new revelation by any means, but it's new to me. Feels like that curtain of ignorance has finally been pulled back, and now I'm sitting with the disappointment of the people in my life. I'm just tired, I'm so tired.",13Sep2020,1
239,"I feel like after being locked away for so long during Covid, my conversational and social skills rapidly declined. I was very good at talking to people and meeting new people before Covid. Now I always feel somewhat ‚Äúawkward‚Äù and out of place when having any sort of conversation. I‚Äôm not as good at articulating myself, and stutter frequently. Has anyone else felt something similar to this, and does anyone have any ways to fix it?

241,"I just can't function like this. This causes me so much pain in my life. But i'm just to focused on being the good guy. In a really unhealthy way. I obsess over rules, codes of conduct, even just good manners. In me and others. When i feel like somebody slighted me, disrespected me, did something mean i focus on it. I think about it. I feel like a crime has been commited. And i plan revenge. I plan bringing them to justice. I plan the most petty and cruel punishemnts for simple slights. But this works both ways. Because when i do soemthing bad, not even really bad, just for example being rude to someone, i do the same to myself. I feel like i commited a crime. I cry. I call myself a bad person. I pray for forgivness despite not even being a christian. I used to cut and even whip myself as punishment. And i stopped only because i have tattoos now. Both of those things cause a pretty huge mental turmoil in my head. One day i obssess over what others did to me. I will not rest until they answer for it. But when in pursuit of my ""justice"" i cross the line (which in my case means yelling at someone or saying one insult) i break down and instantly apologise. A few times.  Then once i'm alone i still punish myself for crossing the line. It's just a giant back and forth between hatred and guilt and it's driving me insane. I don't have the strenght to live like this

And here is the list of things i'm obsessing over:
- someone not wishing me a happy birthday
- me forgetting to wish someone a happy birthday
- not saying thank you
- unmatching a girl on tinder that already ghosted me
- once as a kid i cried because i ate chicken on friday
- missing an exam
- asking for a refund at the store
- texting too much/too little

249,"This is going to sound incredibly arrogant, self absorbed, egotistic, pity-party etc. I know I sound entitled. I'm just trying to put down what's actually going on in my head. My identity, for as long as I can remember, was centered around me being the smart kid in class. In 6th grade my identical twin bro got 1st in the district in mathematics. Granted it's a small district, only ~160 kids per grade. It's also just one test on one particular day, but it's still something. Through Middle School, we were both ""smart"" kids. You know the stereotype. High School, pretty much the same. All A's pretty much. I had more B's than my brother. Both of us took tons of AP classes (I took like 9, he took like 12), did well in them. Studying was something for right before the test. Our friend groups catchphrase was homework was meant for homeroom. Sorry for bragging. I always thought as us as pretty smart, and that if we worked hard enough we could achieve something great in life. 

Well, I'm not so sure. Out of the 9 of us, me and my brother were the only ones not part of our schools Gifted and Talented Program. (I know I sound like an asshole) Naturally, there was always this barrier between us and them. But there was always this question. IF you were smart, you would've been in the program. So therefore, you're not that smart. Tough. Move on. Count yourself lucky you did really in school in the first place.

Then there's the me and him issue. He's always been good at school. He did well on the SAT (1440, 790 Math) He's always gotten better grades. I got a 1090 (540 &amp; 550, can't remember which) granted I didn't study. But it just feels like my whole identity was a lie. I'm obviously not who I thought I was. I thought I was smart, the SAT and me/Sean not being with our friends obviously say no to that. We're just not capable of what we always wanted. (I know I'm arrogant) Being intelligent is a prerequisite to success for us, I'm not. Obviously I'm smart just judging by my grades and stuff, but that doesn't get you anywhere. I don't want to have just a college degree, and a job. I wanted to become an entrepreneur. Ever since my bro and I were little we would toss around business ideas and talk about them for hours. We wanted to start SnowMo, which would have been a platform that connected people who wanted to plow driveways and and those who wanted their driveways clear. (Snows alot where we live) I just feel like my entire identity has been submerged by the tide of reality. I'm not who I thought I was. I'm still pretty young, so I guess I have time to carve out a new identity. But that's what adolescents do, not adults.

253,"All the bullies who beat me...the teachers who beat me...my abusive parents...my 'friends' who stabbed me in the back a thousand times...I dream so much about gathering them all in a room and screaming at them every single way in which they abused me...every single way in which they fucked with the mind and psyche of a little boy who never did anything wrong to them...leaving temporary physical scars and permanent mental ones.

I want to scream and ask them what possible fucking justification they can offer...what do they have to say for themselves...and then...well what happens next I can't type here or I'll be put on some sort of list but I want to do back to them what they did to me only a billion times worse. Is this normal?

What should I do? I also want to actually take revenge on them now in some ways...one of my bullies who fucked with me the most actually made it out of this third world shithole and is working at a really big firm in America... he's from a rich family and his dad paid his way through a top university and got him into this firm with his connections.

It's so fucking unfair that such an evil person...the absolute scum of the earth gets to have so much...and I get nothing. I just found his linkedin right now...I want to email his boss and every single one of his connections what a fucking piece of shit he was...I want to write every single thing he did to me in excruciating detail and I want to see everybody be disgusted by him and see who he really is...really the only thing that's stopping me is the fear that he might use his connections to somehow bring some retribution on me.

But I suppose I can get around that by maybe fudging the details a little bit...I'm sure he's gone on to bully other people in America just like he did here so if I pretend to be someone anonymous from his university or workplace that might work... he'll never know who ratted him out. 

What do you think? Should I do it? Really, give me one reason why I shouldn't. Just one. I just want him to realize maybe for once that his actions have consequences. As a rich kid skating through life with no consequences he needs that reminder. I want him to suffer. I want him to feel what I felt if just for a moment.

274,"Some background. Bipolar runs in my family. I have a grandmother on my father‚Äôs side with bipolar disorder, sister is diagnosed, mother is diagnosed, aunt with bipolar disorder, and my paternal grandfather might not have had bipolar but he did have his own struggles as he committed suicide at a young age. Not sure about my great grandmother, but I know she was institutionalized. So there does seem to be a running theme of mental illness in all lines of my family.

I started having serious issues with my mental health my last year of high school. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. I took an SSRI. I started having manic symptoms in University.m, possibly it was the medication and not bipolar. I was not eating or sleeping as I should. And I was experience massive weight loss. Told my doctor about my intentions to kill myself and was desperate for help. I was involuntarily sent to a hospital for three days. I really did not want to be there.

Being confused in a hospital bothered me. I got diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder and given my ssri alongside with ability and lithium. I lied so much to the doctors. I kept telling them that I am fine. I have no problem. This is a misunderstanding. I knew I was not in good shape, but I refused to stay there. One of the doctors at the hospital seemed so distant, like I was shuts a number to ask some questions and the. Move on to the next patient. I remember her stating in a rather cruel tone ‚Äú if you do not have a problem, then why are you here?‚Äù.

Got out after three days. Refused to take the prescribed medication, but I continued to take a new ssri. My primary physician understood I was afraid to discuss my symptoms out of fear of being hospitalized again. She told me to not be afraid of it and would not hospitalize me if I was not a threat to myself. She tried a new ssri on me since I refused to take the other medication I was being prescribed from the hospital. I tried to shortly later overdose on my ssri medication. Told my friend. Police came and what I assume was some kind of social worker. They asked me how much medication I took. I lied. Stated it was a misunderstanding and that I was stating I take a prescribed medication of 50 milligrams a day five times a week instead of stating 500 mg. Surprisingly the social worker believed me. I was not hospitalized and waited out my overdose symptoms in my room throwing up in a garbage can. 

Anyways, I ended up quitting all of my medication. And for whatever reason refused to accept I had bipolar disorder. Probably because I was afraid of the stigma. 

I want to speak with my doctor about getting on medication. He has no idea I have a history of mental illness. 

The more I think of it the more it seems like the diagnosis was probably right. I do seem to go through manic episodes. During those manic phases I would do unsafe activities. There have been times in my life I would sleep with as many as thee partners a day, which seems rather manic to me. Problems with sleeplessness during those times and being impulsive.

Perhaps I should get reevaluated on my diagnosis. 

Not much purpose with this rant. Just trying to finally come to terms with my problem after years of fighting it.

I want to add that I feel bad for not being upfront with my new doctor about my history of mental illness. And I worry how he will view that.",13Sep2020,2
276,"Hi Reddit, after a lot of internal psyching I think I‚Äôm finally ready to attempt to tell my story and voice my trauma. 

On July 10, 2019 I got into a horrible fight with my now ex-boyfriend. I don‚Äôt remember too much other than him pinning me down and dragging me kicking and screaming back into the apartment and me hitting him with the handle of a steak knife. 

The ambulances arrived and I remember being scared as Hell (who wouldn‚Äôt be) I was extremely agitated and I screamed at the female EMT and called her filthy names. She stomped out of my apartment saying how she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt need to take this‚Äù (in reality though it‚Äôs kinda her job to occasionally deal with people having a mental meltdown and she clearly didn‚Äôt have the patience or caring to adequately perform her job). 

After being put into the ambulance and headed for one of the best hospitals around I had calmed down enough that when I was taken out, I had honestly apologized to her. The hag gave me a sickly-sweet smile and told me it was ok. It turned out that she had ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù taken a wrong turn to a different hospital that wasn‚Äôt known for its psych ward. 

Now my father is an EMT and I am completely confident in saying that as an EMT she **knew** where she was bringing me. EMT‚Äôs go to enough places to know which are good and which aren‚Äôt and this was no accident. The ‚Äúwrong turn‚Äù excuse honestly didn‚Äôt even make sense given the layout of the area. 

My BF had come with me in the ambulance and I remember thanking this woman and her smiling and telling me he would be right in to be with me. 

8 hours. I calmly waited for 8 hours while my BF was in the waiting room with no way to get home and no way to contact anyone. 8 hours of me devolving into begging and sobbing for them to *let me talk to him because he needs to know I‚Äôm alright.* I was denied again and again and eventually I grew agitated and began yelling and demanding to get on a phone with a mental health advocate. 

Where I live it is **ILLEGAL** to refuse to give someone access to an advocate and it was literally on the wall of the room, I was in reminding me that I was allowed to contact one. 

I don‚Äôt remember exactly what happened next. I was screaming on the cot but not making any attempt to get up, harm myself or anyone else, etc. Then I remember a haze of security guards getting closer and closer. I told them to back up but they kept closing in on me like a predator does to a wounded animal. 

I must‚Äôve pushed one back because (this is where I start to go into PTSD remembering it) all of a sudden‚Ä¶. All of a sudden, angry hands were on every part of my body pressing too hard and restraining me so I couldn‚Äôt even turn my head. Thinking back, I can vaguely recall me screaming that they were hurting me and that I couldn‚Äôt breathe with the way they were grabbing me. 

Someone, I guess it was a man‚àí his arm came close enough to my mouth and I bit down as hard as I could. I was so panicked that I literally tried anything I could to get away from those angry blue gloved hands. 

I heard him scream and then ‚ÄúSHE‚ÄôS A BITER!!!!‚Äù rang around the room and efforts were redoubled to immobilize me. I was screaming something I clearly remember ‚ÄúI DON‚ÄôT WANT TO GO TO SLEEP!!! I‚ÄôLL BE A GOOD GIRL!!!‚Äù

Two needles, one in either thigh sunk in and delivered a dose of powerful anesthetic. I was strapped spread eagle to a wooden board in leather restraints and I screamed out to anyone passing by. ‚ÄúIF YOU TREAT ME LIKE AN ANIMAL, I‚ÄôLL ACT LIKE ONE!!!‚Äù

I called either a black man or a lesbian (can‚Äôt remember which) an awful slur that I would never normally call them and then I blacked out‚Ä¶.

A whole day later I awoke in a hospital bed with a woman who could ‚Äútalk to the dead‚Äù (schizophrenic) beside me. She was incredibly kind and made me feel more at ease but I still was scared. 

At one point in my visit she had thought that I had fallen asleep (I was only resting out of depression) and she carefully covered me with my blanket. That woman, I wonder how she‚Äôs doing‚Ä¶. Her kindness to me in that dark period will never be lost on me. 

I only recall bits and pieces incidents really, that occurred over the next week or so. I‚Äôll attempt to detail them here though:

I was fine for a while. I met two cool guys who had their own issues but were nice enough that we formed a little friend group. We sat together often, ate together and this helped keep me sane. I never really knew what Isaiah was there for, something mumbled about ‚Äúfamily issues‚Äù that I didn‚Äôt press on. Alex was there because he was in between group homes and he had been there at least a month (average stay is around a week). 

There was nothing to do. No group therapy, no exercise, no enrichment‚Ä¶. The more lucid of us wandered the halls in a daze as lost souls. Some idly colored and others just slept or sat there mutely. 

I paced the hall as an animal in a cage would. There was nothing else to do except write, eavesdrop on the nurses (I‚Äôll get to that after) or pace.

I called my boyfriend often and it annoyed the nurses. I would spend hours on the phone if no one else wanted it just talking about life. Eventually I was given a ‚Äúreminder‚Äù from a nurse who claimed a therapist told her that phone conversations aren‚Äôt allowed more than 15 minutes. 

One time I was talking and they got annoyed and flipped the off switch to the phone in the back and the line went dead without a word. 

Then came Gale‚Ä¶.

Gale was a night nurse who made her own rules and openly admitted to it. ‚ÄúThose were those nurses‚Äô rules, now I‚Äôm here and you‚Äôll follow mine.‚Äù I instantly hated her and she hated me. 

Gale would pick fights with me and vice versa. One time in particular I was refusing to go into my room and stood in the doorway remarking about how it isn‚Äôt a rule not to stand there. She looked at me and told me I had to be sedated and either take a pill or get an injection. My reply was that she was a c\*\*\* and I wasn‚Äôt taking anything. 

Security was called and I went back in my room. I was terrified of their blue gloves. Blue gloves meant one of two things; someone was coming to manhandle me or shoot me up with something. Today it was both.

I remember getting into a karate stance but instantly realizing my mistake sat compliantly on the bed. They literally carried me by my armpits to isolation and I saw Gale come in with a needle in hand and blue gloves. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll take the pill! I‚Äôll take the pill!‚Äù She smirked and said ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs too late for that now.‚Äù ‚ÄúHold still‚Äù said the security guard and I had no choice lest I provoke more punishment from my captors. 

The door to the room was left open and I could hear Gale complaining to another nurse about what a ‚Äúspoiled princess‚Äù I was and how she wasn‚Äôt going to let me boss her around. ‚ÄúYou might do that at home to your mother but not here. Not to me.‚Äù

All I could do was lie there and cry silently as she insulted me within earshot. Bringing it up to her later she denied it but also told me I shouldn‚Äôt be eavesdropping. This incident kept me there another night and day, something about ‚Äúmisbehaving‚Äù or something. 

The day finally came where I was to be discharged and my BF who had called me and visited everyday faithfully came on the bus to pick me up. 

Another 6+ hours later and I was repeatedly asking the therapist when I could go home. ‚ÄúStop asking, you aren‚Äôt going to boss me around. I won‚Äôt do it today if you don‚Äôt stop.‚Äù That shut me right up. 

The security guards had been eyeballing my emo BF and eventually came up to him and started asking him questions that would violate HIPPA.

‚ÄúWho are you seeing? What‚Äôs the last name?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere is she?‚Äù 

My BF rightfully didn‚Äôt answer those questions so they forced him to go wait off the property at the bus stop nearby. I was furious but couldn‚Äôt do anything. 

I spent my days waiting for visiting hours. Only a few people were allowed at a time and my mother and father came occasionally vs. my BF‚Äôs daily. 

I finally told mom ‚ÄúYou need to get me out of here or I‚Äôm going to commit either suicide or homicide‚Äù. For the first time in my life I was ready to flat out hurt someone other than myself. My mother looked me in the eyes and told me she‚Äôd fight to get me out. 

Like a f\*\*\*ing fool I believed her. 

My BF was bullied and harassed by my parents the entire time but told me anyway that they were trying to get me transferred somewhere different and they were re-homing my dog neither of which they told me. 

I felt like I couldn‚Äôt trust anyone but my aunt and BF. My aunt was extremely triggered going there because of her history in places like that and had started cutting. One time on a visit they locked us in with a guy refusing to leave the room and security came and manhandled and sedated him and dragged him off. The room was torn apart and my aunt was sobbing from the PTSD.

Another time they locked us in a room with a bunch of other mentally unstable patients and left us there. 

Upon discharge I was told they could pay for an Uber for me but my BF wasn‚Äôt allowed in the car and would need alternate transportation. Needless to say, we took the bus home. 

Once home I was noticeably different. I was angrier and more fearful. I had a phobia of blue medical gloves and hated being touched. I was incredibly touchy-feely but suddenly a second-long hug had me squirming to get away. 

To this day I am haunted by that week of horrors. They forced me to endure what would make a mentally stable person go insane and punished me for it. I am not me anymore. I am an unrecognizable version of me that‚Äôs even more broken that when I was admitted. 

I am mistrustful and hateful and began beating and abusing my BF even more once out. I became a twisted monster and there‚Äôs no taking it back. 

The scariest thing here is **ROGER WILLIAM‚ÄôS HOSPITAL** is still open and ‚Äútreating‚Äù (abusing) psych patients. Gale is still there and the nurses still hate their job and security is still on a hair trigger. I hate what happened and I‚Äôll never be the same. 

Below are links to the bruises on my body I had upon discharge and my broken toe which they said was a bruise (they blatantly lied to me there) that I sustained while unconscious. 

I also kept a journal of sorts and that will be on imgur too.",13Sep2020,6
277,"Was made redundant over 2 months ago, was with a company as a parts inspector in the aviation industry. Luckily I rent but my redundancy money will only get me so far, problem is in this area people are fighting for jobs as I live 10 minutes from Gatwick airport (near London) considering the amount of jobs lost connected to aviation. The money side of things isn‚Äôt my main concern as I‚Äôm being super careful! My main issue is my mental health, I‚Äôm worried even after 2 months I feel incredibly down because even though I cook every night clean the house while my partner is at work (for the NHS) i feel useless! I also found out my partner technically cheated during lockdown sending nudes and crappy dirty messages to some bloke that caused me to be angry for some time but we seem to be working at it but I still feel paranoid at times! I‚Äôm writing this on a Sunday late at night with no purpose/plans for the next week other than job hunting competing with thousands in my area, applied for well over 50 jobs (with 3 that look exciting) and other to tie me over but not even 1 call back! 

My partners daughter is now back at school who has bad asthma so I worry a lot with that and we try to avoid meeting people often plus my family are 60 miles away (ironically moved for work this way 7 years ago). It‚Äôs just not having that purpose anymore I struggle with, luckily our finances are ok we can cope for a good solid year without me in work but it‚Äôs the in between part I‚Äôm struggling with, stuck inside without seeing family much plus I don‚Äôt have many friends anyway it just feels tough just like for many others! I had a heart operation back in February and was so excited to get back to work for a bit of normality and then couple months later I‚Äôm made redundant. Not sure what advice I‚Äôm hoping for but seeing if anyone has some advice to cope? I know there is a lot out there in worse situations and I feel for them I do! 

I‚Äôm just struggling mentally and don‚Äôt know how to fix it, sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm a failure, I‚Äôve put on some extra weight this year and lost a lot of motivation. I‚Äôm just not sure what direction to go in.",13Sep2020,2
278,"Someone is like really dependent on me. We've both been really emotionally abused so that's why. I feel like a jerk and hypocrite for thinking like this because she's trapped with literally no one to talk to besides her sister and me but I can't help it.

I'm 22 and she's in her 60's so maybe that's also why. I just don't want to be depended on that much as I like my alone time to heal.

I really need someone to talk to and she does too so I don't know what to do.",13Sep2020,2
279,"In the past year I've lost my two most valued friendships, and in the past month something happened in the industry I was excited to try and carve a place for myself in that killed the last of the excitement I had after a 6+ month wait to get started. I'm currently just existing, unable to do much more than that.

At this point I have no friends or family, and no ambitions I'm passionate about. I'm really struggling to find the will to start work because of it. And with the pandemic still a problem and my small town having such poor relationship prospects, there's nothing I can seem to do to make friends or family here. And after the devastation of losing the only friendships that meant anything earlier this year, I'm not sure I can risk trying again when I need stability. Long-distance relationships aren't really going to work either.

I need intimacy to feel good about a relationship and even the people around here I used to talk to and do things with regularly couldn't provide anything worthwhile. They only ended up having value to me as tools, being the extra players necessary in a game, for example, because they were never interested in personal intimacy and interdependence.

I'm struggling to find entertainment to fill the void as well. It's hard to feel inspired and hopeful about the world and your life prospects from just anything, and I'm afraid hobbies and games don't really lend much to the personal sentiment that you're valuable or able to be loved.

Any advice on what to do from here would be appreciated. My depression's too crippling for me to push through without a proper solution, and I desperately need one as soon as possible. I've already lost the past two years struggling with it, but I still had passion for my intended career. Now that that passion's been quashed, just as I finally got everything I needed to start down that path in earnest no less, I've found myself completely at a loss for how to move forward or where to turn.",13Sep2020,2
