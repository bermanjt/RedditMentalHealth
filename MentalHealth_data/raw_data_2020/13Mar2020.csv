What they must have felt like, what their parents must feel like, why. We were discussing it in school in this grief session and one of my friends said that she is afraid of who’s next.

4,"I think I’m having a panic attack, help, now, please?

I know it’s stupid to think I’ve got Covid-19- but I’ve had a sore throat become more and more noticeable, and you know, I coughed a few times. But no shortness of breath. But my face feels numb, and I know it’s stupid to just say I’ve got it, but hear me out, I work in an old folks home-as a cook no less. (So you can imagine my problem here.) And I shake hands with all the people and breath in their face, and I’m so ducking scared right now. And I feel like my panicking isn’t going to make my little sore throat feel better. 

I want to ducking take work off- but I’m two days into training, and I don’t want to look like a slacker. I’m literally having the worst panic attack of my life. I don’t even know if I suffer from anxiety, but hey, the shoe fits, right? I’m going ducking crazy. I’m sorry. I just need to vent. Really, I don’t like to talk about my problems, you know? Like other people aren’t responsible for solving my problems, I am, right? 

so I’m sorry if it’s just another ducking coronavirus post. It feels like I’ve got insects crawling in my throat, and I hate it. I’m 19, and I’ve had bad strings of luck with jobs in the past, and I really need this one, you know? And I understand, that I’m probably going to survive, even if I do have it, but I’m worried about the senior citizens I work with. Guys. Guys please, please. I don’t want to talk to my parents about it, I just feel like I bug them with my germaphobia.

The people who I would have considered my friends have all stabbed me in the back at some point and we no longer speak. I get so jealous and lonely seeing people hanging out in their friend groups where they all have similar interests and care about each other. I've been alone for so long that I wonder if I'm just not meant to have any friends, if I'm just meant to live my life alone.

It made me really frazzled. Today I tried filming a video for one of my classes and I was trying to think of things to say while listening to everything around me and simultaneously thinking about other things and reading texts occasionally.

I try to calm down, but stuck in my room my anxiety just keeps building and building. What if i can’t see my boyfriend for months? What if he stops liking me? What if the chemistry goes away? (He’s a great guy and I love him, and realistically i know it wouldn’t happen, but anxiety plays crazy mind tricks).

11,"It has been a rough couple of months. My life, relationships, school, work, friends, acquaintances, all seen so shallow and empty all of the sudden. On my run by the river this morning I could not hear the birds like I normally do. I could not enjoy the sun, the weather, the trees. It has been months without joy. I am starting to run on fumes.

I have a great system around me and I feel bad for even feeling the way I do but I just want no part in anything anymore. Things are just so shallow, so void of depth. I feel so small and nothing seems to matter. I have people depending on me and have a chance to do some real good in the world, a chance most dont get, so I dont want to squader it. But if not for that privilege I would probably hurl myself off a bridge.

Nothing has worked for me, not counseling, exercise, sleep, pills, ect. It is like I am just broken, I know what kind of persom I am expected to be and I act like that. The superficiality of life, dressing nice, warning lots of money, and taking care of yourself has not brought me love or joy. People are so shallow, liking the aesthetically or materially pleasing. I am the same. No depth, no great intellect. Boring. Loved for what I do rather than what I am.

I really dont know how long I can keep this up. I say this here because if I say it anywhere else they will send me away. I am not looking for help I just want someone to underatand.

She'll go into explicit detail about stuff that happened to her as a child like being threatened with a knife by her mother and hit by a rolling pin. Now, you may be wondering why I'm writing this here. She laughs about it. She announces it to people out of nowhere, even people she barely knows and it makes people uncomfortable. I know it's just her (very unhealthy) way of coping, but she triggers me all the time without realising it. Every time she mentions it and laughs about it, and other stuff that happened to her as a kid, it gives me flashbacks of stuff that happened to me during my childhood that I have never ever spoken about and won't be doing so here for obvious reasons. I can't help but feel like she may be triggering others too with her comments. I genuinely want to help her, and I want to talk to her about going back to therapy but I think she's lost faith in the system. And sometimes, and I feel bad for saying this but I really think it's true, it's like she's trying to compete with who had a shittier childhood and I know it's probably an insecurity on her part, but it isn't a competition and I feel angry and anxious whenever she does it. I don't know how to confront her about it because I don't want to tell her that she's been triggering me all this time, bc she'll feel really bad and probably try to get me to tell her about it and I really don't want her to know.

I haven't been able to find someone that I can seem to push myself to want to continue. All of my attempts seem to boil down to half assed friendships. I've looked online and I know that each person is different and meanings to things change on the perspective of the person experiencing it, but all of the answers I find are cryptic or vague simply stating that you must love yourself. I know I can't get a director answer but I'm curious how others overcame their fear of the outcome of trying with others. I wouldn't say I've been depressed, a lack of ambition to help myself seems to be missing and  I'm curious to see what others have done in similar situations.

So, I have a question. Is it normal to remember trauma from your past, but not remember anything else before or after that? I'm asking because I have a *severe* memory gap. I remember my trauma in vivid detail, but I can't remember anything that occurred before the trauma or after it.   


It didn't become an issue until a friend of mine brought up the fact that we knew each other during the time period that the trauma occurred and I couldn't (and still can't) remember any of it. It's really weird.

- I have no where to go when this happens. I have no parents. All my friends are 20 and broke in tiny apartments. 

- this stress plus COVID-19 and my ocd means I haven't left my house in days 

- I keep missing my uni classes because of this and I have a paper due Monday that I can't get myself to do

- If I fail any more courses because of my health I won't qualify for student loans anymore and I will lose the only medical resources I have. 

- my birthday is in two weeks tomorrow and I feel like no one will give a shit. It's dumb but that's like my tipping point.

***
School closed—online classes only thru the rest of the semester—due to Coronavirus. As of today. (Plan as of yesterday was to come back Apr. 6. Then, shortly after that letter from the University President, the POTUS announced his travel ban and the WHO declared COVID-19 pandemic. Today, the plan to return was cancelled—commencement might still happen, but the semester is gonna be all online.)

This has hit the performing arts—theatre, dance, music—department(s) disproportionally hard. My head is spinning still. I’m nauseous—still. The dorms were going to remain open (I was going to come back by Apr. 6 for sure), but now, everyone has to return from Spring Break, effectively rushing the campus (which is also horrible for disease control) and clean out our lives. We have until March 23 to get out of the dorms. I’m tearing down my life and packing it into boxes tomorrow.

And... This year, I had finally overcome a huge trauma I dealt with years ago, where I had a falling out with some folks I was very close with for a long time. The last time I saw them, I had no idea it would be the last time. That trauma’s at the root of so many things I struggle with. Then, today, as I read that letter and started shaking, crying, screaming... I’m a junior, and that whole swath of seniors—I may never get to see them again. Friends, crushes, what have you... People I loved (love—fuck, it’s happening already), so, so much.

“No, no, no,” I said. “I can’t do it again, I can’t do this again.”

I’ll probably be working/writing thru this for a long time. A lot of other students—the seniors, and performing arts seniors, especially; those affected by COVID-19 personally; and those for whom it’ll be very hard to get home—are being hit harder than I am. 

But I finally found my theatre family this year. This semester started with a serious, serious injury for me, but this week has still been the craziest (sorry, I hate that word, but I can’t think of a better one right now) week of the semester. My heart is breaking.

Recently I have overcome said phobia after nine years. Yesterday I went to see the doctor for a medication evaluation. She had me take an updated questionnaire, and compared it with one I had filled out in December, and told me that I dropped from a nine to a one on the depression/anxiety scale. Granted, I knew that I had been feeling better lately—but seeing tangible evidence of that was honestly even more rad.

28,"Throwaway accounts for reasons. 

Hi. Just for some context, I live in Japan. I’m mixed, had issues adjusting to this country as a child while also being raised under narcissistic parents who woke me up at three with their arguing. I was the peacekeeper, at 15 sitting my parents down to sort through debt and bills, trying to just keep everyone happy. We had the police come to our house a few times as a child. I have my own family now and though I don’t fight often with my husband now, when things get bad, they get really bad. Over the past three years, the police came to our house around four times from one of us destroying the house. 

I’m depressed. I feel like I have suffered from depression and suicidal thoughts from a child. I self harm when it gets too bad and drinking when I’m close to the brink usually pushes me over the edge. Which again, isn’t often. This bomb happens once - twice a year for me. I have an autistic child and I have no friends, no family to help. I feel alone most of the time and often feel pathetic for feeling that way. I’m tired of the cops ‘knowing’ who I am, like they knew my parents. I’m tired of knowing I can’t do anything right. I’m tired that the only help I can afford is just medication, which has me doing better but doesn’t take away the stress the piles up over time. 

I’m a nice person. So I tell myself. But am I really? Am I perhaps narcissistic like my parents, playing the victim but really, maybe I am just a good for nothing mom, wife, who thinks she has anxiety but is maybe just lazy and selfish like her father and hides behind that ‘anxiety’. I’m so confused. I’m so tired of feeling confused. I love my husband and my kid but I wonder if that’s enough. It wasn’t enough to stop me from getting into a physical fight with my husband, my sister, and doing this all in front of my kid. Do I need help or is this just me thinking I do but in reality, just need to realize that I’m a pathetic piece of shit and that’s just who I am?

34,"I was never in the army, never really had a horrifying experience, or really anything I ever would have considered ""PTSD inducing"".

But, what my therapist helped me realize last night was that my childhood wasn't really all that great.

Although my father always made sure we had clothes on our backs, food in our bellies, and a roof over our heads, he wasn't much of a role model when it came to how he treated our mother. They would fight, and he'd get incredibly abusive, both verbally and physically. The fights could be triggered by something as simple as he didn't like the food our mother made for all of us. Or when I would knock a glass of water or something over. Or have any other kind of minor incidental accident that every kid ever has had.

When I was probably five years old is when I remember the first fights. I think I remember knowing that what he was doing was wrong and I never wanted to be like him.

And as the years rolled by it only got worse.

We had to move a lot because he would abandon jobs for silly reasons. At one point when I was around 10 or so, he was doing speed, owed the wrong people money, and we had to book it several states away. Of course, none of us knew that at the time - he did it under the guise of work and only told us several years after the fact.

Then in 2015 our mother was diagnosed with cancer, and passed away in 2018. We were in the room when it happened. She was unconscious for several hours before passing. Didn't really get a chance to say goodbye.

But the year before that, my wife and I got married, bought a house, and I changed jobs, all within the span of about four months. We also tried to have a kid before my mom passed so that she knew she was a grandmother. Well, we tried, and tried, but nothing was happening, so that was another stressor and we were about to go talk to some doctors in 2018 just before my mom died.

We had her memorial in mid-September. One week after the memorial, we discovered my wife was pregnant and I was flooded with such guilt, with feelings of failure, it was so intense.

The day our little girl was born I suffered a massive panic attack because the nurse that helped deliver her had my mother's name. My little girl also shares a striking resemblance to my mom. It was frightening and triggered so many emotions and overwhelmed me. I wouldn't have been surprised if they had hospitalized me. It was a bad, bad attack.

Over recent months I've been remembering things from my past that upset me and it's manifesting itself as anger, frustration, sadness, and the feeling like I'm not worth anything, nobody likes me, people think I'm stupid, stuff like that.

Anyway... Yeah. I guess I have emotional PTSD. I should have gone to therapy years ago.

36,"For the past year or two I haven't been feeling as well as I used to. There are times (especially lately) where I feel empty and have no real reason to be alive since I don't feel important in anyone else's life besides my family. I've always felt like an acquaintance to everyone I talk to and feel like I would never be mentioned in a conversation with anyone (besides obvious context). I've never been sociable at all, I had a best friend who I can't talk to anymore, I've never been in a relationship, etc. I try to be nice to everyone I meet and not become a burden or annoyance to them. I often get afraid of what people think of me, and anytime someone is nice to me, I think that it's either out of common courtesy or so I can just leave them alone. Sometimes it gets to the point where I feel completely lost, it feels so heavy and it all wells up inside of me and I try to hold it back because so I don't look even more pathetic than I already am. I don't have anything going for me and I don't feel like I have the right to feel like this because there are people who have it worse yet are doing better for a fact (or at least it feels like it). Another reason is that I have a better life than I had in the past where my family was poor (not borderline poverty though), so that further makes this feeling worse. It just takes the motivation out if everything I do, and it makes everything feel much more difficult than it actually is. I just hate feeling like this because sometimes it affects work which in turn affects the people that work with me. I try to hide this because it would cause problems for others and burden them. I feel hopeless at this point, and waste my life at home playing videogames living an unaccomplished life when I'm not working. I feel like I have no value or importance at all.

I peed in bottles because of it and always had my light on at night. 

I'm no longer that bad. I have working on this for awhile. I only get that bad once in awhile and I'm able to talk myself down. I try not pay attention to it and just try to tell my self I am not my thoughts .

40,"Lets go back to my Years in school, From the ages of 8 to 15 I Was bullied, always Got made Fun of and even Girls Would join in and Call me names like ""Freak"", ""Ugly"" ect. I was always That Quiet introverted kid Who never wanted any Trouble But For some reason i always attracted it. I did Fight back a Good few Times But considering that there was more of them i always Got my ass kicked. 

Anyway i left school at 16 and Started to Develop low Confidence Due to the way that i look Which made me Isolate myself From people Which eventually led To depression. I did have a Few friends But Lost contact with them And They usually dont have any time for me because they are Too busy with thier own lives or are in relationships

Then when i was around 19 I have had enough of Not getting any attention and It would piss me off seeing People Who use to give me a hard time in school Happy with friends or in relationships. I could also never keep a Job because i either Got bored quickly or Would lie to employers About my skills/Qualifacations and Eventually would be sacked due to Poor performance because i didnt have the skills for that job in the first place

My Low Confidence/Depression Eventually led To anger and Not Giving a Fuck anymore. I also started to develop Constant Thoughts of killing certain people Who didnt fit my ideal World and i also Started getting into hunting Because Killing animal's Like rabbits Wont land you into jail. 

btw I 100% Know the difference between Right and Wrong, I would NEVER harm anyone Innocent But i feel like i have to get This off my Chest by killing Someone. I wont be able to move on until i experience taking Another human's life 

There is this one Guy Who lives near me, Everyone knows That he is a pedophile But Nobody Doesnt want to do anything about it. This guy also went to prison at one Stage For Abusing a Kid 

He's still Walking around asking kids For Sex But He is under police protection and nobody doesnt want to do anything

I Think This is the perfect opportunity To fulfil my Needs and i will also be seen as a Hero by people For doing it. 

I deep Down wish That i could have a Normal life. all i Want Is To Fall in love with a Woman (Never have been in a Relationship btw) , Work and eventually Start a Family But i just dont feel Like it will never happen

Im Currently 21 years old and Im back at school Studying electrical engineering, I do Enjoy It And i have Grown In Confidence as well But these Thoughts of killing/Getting attention/Anger just wont go away

I think Im a Good person, I Know How to ""act"" Happy, charismatic and Funny around people. I Also Would be the first person to help someone in need And i also have done voluntary work with the disabled in the past and i really enjoyed it But these thoughts of Killing/Getting attention/Becoming the hero Wont go out of my head",13Mar2020,1

43,"   Long story short, I grew up never going to any kind of school, mom called it homeschool but really it was just me and the TV, lots of video games, playing outside with my dogs, watching cartoons, doing nothing productive and in generally being neglected. The freedom I had couldn't have been matched, my mom didn't care what happened, where I went, what I did. I was completely free. My dad was a truck driver and never home, but he pretty much didn't care either when he was there. I could tell from a young age that my mom didn't like me, and only forced herself to say she loves me. My dad is still the opposite, completely loving, caring and was a great dad otherwise.   
   As I got older I focused on my own studies and thanks to the internet I was able to pull myself out of what would've been an uneducated life. I went on to do martial arts and win an international title at a tournament, had a few jobs by want and not be need, worked out and made physical fitness my sole focus. I don't remember doing anything note worthy when i was 16-20, vague trips to a lake, I stopped martial arts, focused on work, had a crappy relationship, focused to much on the ladies and not enough on my own growth.  
   Joined the military at 21, got married, had a kid, went to afghanistan (no combat, no killing), then got out last year, and my entire time in I was depressed because I had to waste so much time on bullshit work, got out, still the same, there's no point in anything I'm doing, no point in my life. I work so I can buy dumb shit I don't need, but now I kind of have to buy it because any visitors would think I'm abusive if there wasn't any furniture or something. I literally don't even want a bed, I just want to sleep on the floor in an empty room and my wife would let me, but then I feel shitty for sleeping separately from her.

I feel like the immense freedoms I had for the first 20 years of my life really fucked with my head and now that I have to live a normal 9 to 5 life until I'm dead, it's really gonna drive me to kill myself. I was alive in the first part of my life, now it's just going through the motions using my time on this planet to do shit for companies that don't give a fuck.

I'm sure sure most will say I need to find my passion, I need to see a therapist/get help, or that you care. Frankly as long as I have bills, my passion doesn't mean shit. I need health insurance for my family, I need to provide for my daughter and wife since I'm the bread winner, passions don't bring food on the table. Therapists? I've seen three, and I keep hearing it's a numbers game, but if I'm told I need cognitive behavioral therapy I feel like their trash, CBT never helped me. Caring? You don't know who I am, if I never wrote this you wouldn't be here and thus I would just end up a statistic on someones page at some point, unidentifiable from the rest.

I know that everyone works, or everyone has to at least, they have to make their living, this isn't just a me problem and I shouldn't even feel this way, entitled to something that I haven't earned, but it doesn't stop me from feeling like this...",13Mar2020,1

48,"I'm a male, 25 years old. 

So within the past two years, I've been doing a lot of sleeping. And I mean A LOT. To an obvious abnormal level. But most of the time when I feel this way, I don't genuinely feel tired. But sometimes I get so stressed and depressed, that I feel like my body and mind literally shut down, and sleeping becomes my coping mechanism. Initially, I didn't see this as being a big deal. But now, it's definitely become a problem. There's no way I can be this tired all the time. In past, I used to suffer from insomnia. But now it seems like the complete opposite. 

I can literally sleep for 10 hours straight, and then hours later, I can feel tired again, and take like a 2 hour nap. And I know this all has to be mood related. Because when I'm in a good mood, my sleep pattern goes back to normal. So there must be a correlation between the two. 

And you'd think that sleeping for 10 hours straight would make me feel refreshed. But it doesn't. In fact, it makes me feel worse. I feel oversleeping provides with too much energy afterwards. Though this energy turns into anxiety. If that makes sense. My energy levels feel more balanced and natural when my sleep pattern returns to normal. If that makes sense.

All the time spent just sitting or being somewhere feeling miserable. I was put on Paxil in my 20s and it’s okay but made it hard to keep a GF due to side effects if you know what I mean and if you don’t then it’s okay bc now I have a healthy sex drive. It also didn’t improve my mood/energy levels either but it did balance me.

I’m hoping this med continues to work out bc it would be nice if my 30s didn’t suck. My father was also put on this med funnily enough but his was for anger problems but he has seemed to mellow out on it. Is there some genetic component to certain meds working better?",13Mar2020,1

55,"Hey all, thanks for taking the time to read this!

So a little back ground about me: I'm 27, m and live in western US. 

I have never been clinically diagnosed with depression and/or anxiety, and I also don't want to label myself either.I do however am well aware that I'm not alright. 

At some poing in my life, i went from outgoing extrovert to shutting everything off and just downward spiral or sadness, anxiety and loneliness. while everything was goint south, my relationship with the right girl at the wrong time just fell apart and that tore me down. Ever since then, I've been living day by day. I have thought about killing myself several times, and have attempted time or two, but can't even be strong enough to go through it. Theses days I have friends but I had sad realization that I am none of my best freinds' best friend.  And fear, I'll never know that feeling either.   


I thought getting a job and being successful would help me fill the void. But I found out that, once I got the job and got where I wanted to be, the void was still there. I recently intentionally worked 20+ days in a row, just to avoid being home. Right after work I go home and just gen play games, but even those don't seem to help these days like they used to. Therapists in my area , ones thate are experienced, charge 150 or so , so that takes away that option. I just feel stuck in life and know that I'm going to die alone. It' be awesome to have low self esteem but i have zero. My health his deteriorating and I'm losing my hair. This further adds to self loathing and sadness. Even when I'm forced to hang out with friends, I feel completely dead and empty as I see people socializing while I'm frozen in a corner on my phone. 

I've tried things from exercise , video games, music and meditation, some help someday and someday they don't. I intentionally sleep 10+ hrs on the weekends just to not have my brain be active.   


I don't want do die, really don't, but I just feel stuck like it's groundhog day. U just want the pain to stop or be manageable. This days no one really knows the extent of my battle.  I feel my control on things is getting worse by each day, and I hope my mother and father don't have to attend my funeral while they're alive.

Anyways, if you made it this far, thanks for taking the time out of your busy lives to read this and i hope you all live long, happy and prosperous life.",13Mar2020,1
56,"For the last few months I’ve been questioning the fact that I could be depressed. I googled some symptoms and found 3/4 I identify with, found an online test that said I could be depressed and recommended help. 


But I don’t know why I would be depressed. 

I don’t have any motivation to do anything. Sure, I get up and go to school, but I don’t do anything else. Nothing outside of school. 

I’m scared about the unknown of my future - where do I go to college? What job do I want? Where do I want to live? 

I have trouble sleeping. A lot. I either sleep very little or wayyy too much. My mom suggested this is because I don’t exert much energy (which I have no motivation to)

I hate my body. I’m super tall, slightly overweight (I have a slightly fat belly/chest) and I have stretch marks all over my upper legs, stomach and underarms. I’m hairy too. I can’t find any clothes for myself (I JUST got a 2nd pair of jeans after 3 years of wearing the same ones to school everyday) and the clothes I REALLY want to wear... my parents and friends wouldn’t find acceptable. Plus I don’t have the right body type. I hate it.

I want to be a feminine guy, but the above paragraph displays why I can’t/never will achieve that). 

I eat whenever I’m bored. This + no exercise contributes to my overweight. 

I DONT have any “end it now” thoughts. I’m too much of a coward to do that/think that.

I get randomly really sad. Is this just being a teenage guy? 

I can’t express my emotions. I was raised to subscribe to the notion that “men” aren’t supposed to show emotion. 

I constantly doubt my friendships &amp; I have little self worth. Due to the fact that nobody starts a conversation with ME without prompting/needing something/having no choice I don’t think I have any good friends. But I tolerate it because I don’t think I’m worth much/I think it’s normal. 

I am afraid of forming a lasting friendship. I’ve moved from place to place since I was 5, never staying in the same place for more than a year or so. I was homeschooled in the middle of nowhere until 6th grade, when I was enrolled in public school. Then I moved after making friends. Rinse and repeat until high school. But I can’t make any friends that are good for ME.

Absolutely nothing. I was throwing up last Saturday, 3-7-20, and it was only bile, pure bile until i had water and somehow that flushed out my system. The next day I had no problems keeping down water or crackers. I have gotten off my diet of water and crackers and I'm getting abdominal pains and heartburn now.

It started with mental breakdowns, self-doubt and a lot of stress. Now he’s very cold,distant and stoic. He’s aware that he is but whenever he gets like this it feels like I’m having a long distance relationship. It just feels like a lack of connection. It’s disheartening and my anxiety makes me think that if these issues continue that our relationship won’t last. He’s been like this all week. Not sure how long it will last. This all started because his classes that he’s taking are starting to get extremely challenging for him and they’re a main part of his major. He switched majors and that made him stress about the time for graduation, financial aide, drop limits etc. Nowadays it seems like anything will set him off. He’s frustrated with his parents because his mom wants him to drop everything for me. I make it clear that I don’t want that but his mom pushes him anyway. I can’t do much about it unfortunately. And last but not least he’s just a bit spooked by the Coronavirus but obviously it’s not the main issues he’s having. I have no power over anything he feels I just try my best to offer support, doesn’t seem like he wants it right now, but regardless I always offer support and wait around until he’s out of an episode. I’ve tried suggesting a counselor but I doubt he’ll visit one. He’s probably too busy since you have to make appointments for an individual session. Unless it’s an emergency. I feel like I could use a counselor as well but again it takes about two weeks to see them. Maybe when I feel less overwhelmed I’ll make an appointment but I’m just trying to cope with these feelings because I just can’t do much for him anymore.

61,"TDLR: So I’m a 28f. I’m suddenly remembering old memories from my childhood all the way through college and I’m left wondering, “why now?” and plain old just “why?”

I googled obsessively about it but pretty much every article I came across discussed this phenomenon for those people with a traumatic past. However, as far as I can remember, nothing traumatic happened during my formative years at all. 
Here’s a brief timeline of my life for context: 
I’ve had a relatively “interesting” life thus far - nothing majorly stand out though I guess. I grew up in a rural, wooded area not far from NYC, believe it or not. A lot of my childhood memories are of me and my sister and cousins running through the woods and making forts out of sticks. There are other memories of the occasional weekend I’d spend with my grandparents in their studio apartment in Manhattan. My childhood was of the “best of both worlds” variety where I got to experience country life and city life pretty much simultaneously. Also, another fun fact is that my dad was a big time produce farmer so I’ve always been the farmers daughter.
When I was 16 we all moved way upstate New York. I was the new kid in high school my junior year. It was a great couple of years. In college, I had a blast for the first year and then slowly sunk into a deep depression which ended in a half hearted attempt at hurting myself. It was a dark time that I haven’t thought about in years until recently. I transferred colleges and once again was the new kid. After graduation I moved to Manhattan to live out my dream. Life was great there for 6 years - I experienced lots of interesting things while living there. Then, I decided to move closer to family a year and a half ago. Life slowed down a bit, I got into a serious relationship, bought a house, ended that serious relationship and now here I am. 
The memories I’m reliving are mostly very pleasant. Tonight I suddenly remembered small details about my time at sleep away camp when I was 9 or 10 - learning archery, sliding down a slippery rock in the woods, tie-dying t-shirts, the layout of the cabins, the smell of sloppy joes. 
The other day I remembered my old front yard and poking the hot bubbles of tar on a black piece of wood near the driveway. 
The only negative memory I’m recalling is my dark time in college: the panic and loneliness I felt, the sweatshirt I was wearing when I ugly cried during my goodbye with my boyfriend, looking back at the college as I drove away after dropping out. 
I’m not sure if it’s that now that I’m single again in a much smaller city with some peace and quiet that these old memories are rushing back? Have I been repressing something bad and it’s about to re-introduce itself one day soon in one of these flashbacks? Is this overwhelming rush of nostalgia a symptom of depression? 
Anyone have any insight? Or have you experienced anything like this?",13Mar2020,1

While we were smoking weed, he tripped me out by saying there was a guy in the window taking pictures of me. I freaked out and then a minute later he said it was a joke. 

I was tripping out now. Definitely not in the mood for sex. 

We went to my room and I just kinda sat down cause I was kinda tripping. He started telling me to lie down with him and I just wasn’t comfortable with it but he wouldn’t take no for an answer. Then he told me in a really intimidating way that he brought me weed so I have to put out. So fine. I started sucking his dick. My mouth was pretty dry from the weed it was just awful. 

Then I hear the front door open, my brother got home. I freaked the f out and told him he had to be quiet, which he didn’t really. I told him he had to leave and he said he wasn’t leaving. I mentally blacked out this part but all I remember was me trying to push him off of me and him just looking me straight in the eye, looking like this is just a normal thing for him to do. 

I don’t remember how, but I was back to sucking his dick. He finished really quick in my mouth and I told him to get the f out. He did and I blocked him on everything, not wanting to ever have to read his name anywhere again. I just sat there in my room for hours pale as a ghost. Now I just feel lost and off balance.

I don’t *think* I’ve ever had a hallucination, because I only ever see these figures in the corner of my eye, and it always ends up being something else. Maybe I’m just really paranoid? I have pretty severe anxiety and my whole life i’ve struggled with various mental health issues. I’ve also been through some trauma. I smoke weed regularly so that could also be an explanation for the paranoia. i’ve never done any other drugs. I don’t ever watch scary movies so that’s not why.

But I'm feeling strange and I wanted to seek out some good advice or maybe I just want to share what I've been feeling or thinking. I don't really know. But anyway, I've been having some glaring issues with my mental health and well being. I have self-esteem issues now, I have audible and visual hallucinations, I have frequent mood swings, I have anxiety that has progressively gotten worse over the past couple years. I feel hopeless. No matter how much medicine I take or how many times I hear ""It's going to be okay"" I feel no hope. My psychiatrist says I have Bipolar disorder and I've taken many medications for it and nothing seems to help.

I hope that makes sense. As I've been typing this I've been very hesitant to go into detail. But as of right now I feel a sense of clarity. And I feel like sharing this with this site is a step forward. Due to my age I can't be prescribed certain anxiety medications. And that makes me feel worse. I just feel so disconnected from life and the people around me. Isolation makes me happy. I've been experiencing an extreme lack of motivation and lack of personal hygiene. I just get so scared of the possibilities of what could happen. All of this is just getting worse. Every hour feels like a day and nothing that anyone says makes me feel better. I don't understand what is happening to me and there are times I think and plan self harm. Just a couple weeks ago I wan in the hospital for hurting myself and it's only gotten worse since.

I generally feel the stress too, but manage to see things in perspective and not get overwhelmed. I thought with my help my girlfriend was the same. Yesterday I was out with my sister and she suddenly tried calling me a few times back to back, which she never does. I picked up and she's out of breath and speaking very loud. I ask her what is going on and she just says ""I don't know, I feel like I'm spinning out"". I tried to ask her what she was doing before she felt this way and she couldn't tell me. I asked her to breath with me and lower the volume of her voice in order to calm down. A few minutes later she could tell me that she felt like the was thinking of nothing before she started spinning out. She was holding the same few items and walked through the house not really understanding what to do with them. 

I tried telling her that everyone has moments where they walk into a room and forget what they were doing. She should give herself and break. She then tells me that she knows what I mean, but it was not like that. She then compared it to the time where she and I tried space cake together and she felt overwhelmed by edible. 

At this point I just kept talking to her and distracted her a little untill I could hear her normal calm voice again and she was even laughing, but as we disconnected I was concerned about what had happened. I tried googling it, but I couldn't really find an answer, which is why I turned here. What could it have been? What can I do? Should I convince her to talk to a professional or am I overreacting?",13Mar2020,1
68,"Alright so, I was just on another sub and it said if you have thoughts of suicide contact a mental health person. I’m 19 for the last 2-3 years it’s been one of my habits I find pleasure in to fantasize about my death and everything that leads up to it in a story like fashion over and over throughout the day every day, it feels so good. I’ve gotten so use to it, I stopped thinking there was anything wrong from it. I’ve been so close to ending it all but my ego just won’t let me it won’t let me fail in the mission I gave myself to become a famous musical artist and that solely is the thing that gives me a reason to be alive, but other then that I find barely any joy in life or any so called “fun activities” or developing meaningful relationships with other people, I’m so dead inside but yet I’m still here I have hope but I feel like most people just have a natural lust 4 life like oh I’m gonna go party this weekend get bitches ion know or just be like oh I’m doing so so thing, I’m content.

One of the things that’s also held me back from suicide is that I can’t stand the thought of cringey my funeral would be and the reaction of the people who knew, they probably wouldn’t care but that’s me being optimistic, death is usually an emotional thing.",13Mar2020,1
70,"Hi everyone. I'm new to r/mentalhealth. I'm not sure really how I should even start this but I've been struggling with motivating myself to do things since I graduated highschool 4 years ago.  I used to be a great student and had no issue completing things on time in addition to participating in theater and choir outside of school. Now I can rarely motivate myself to even do things I enjoy like painting and drawing. I procrastinate horribly to the point that it impacted my grades badly in my first year of college. I know I should get up and clean or work on homework for college but I just can't make myself until I ABSOLUTELY have to (ex: school projects due the next day, dishes becoming moldy).It's really embarrassing and I hate it.

72,"Ive been really struggling lately. I keep having these horrible repetitive thoughts that literally cause me to scream and jerk every couple of seconds. It’s been three days not of this essentially extended panic attack and it will not a stop.The only reprieve I get is sleep. 
I don’t know what to do
I haven’t been able to find a therapist, even after calling several and regardless they wouldn’t be able to help me for probably at least a couple weeks 
I tried going to a local psychiatric hospital out of desperation yesterday. They had me answer basic questions and took my blood pressure. All the while I’m jerking around and yelling every couple seconds, trying to maintain composure. I end up waiting for about three hours before they finally call me into a room and the intake nurse tells me that they suggest I go to therapy. I didn’t even get to see a doctor or anything.
I immediately started crying and having one of the worst panic attacks I’ve ever experienced when I realize that they won’t help me. The nurse was frightened by my panic attack and quickly left the room, locking me inside all alone. 
How the fuck does a person work in a mental hospital and run away when someone’s having a panic attack!!? Three hours of twitching and screaming in their waiting room only to have you suggest that I go to therapy?!?! OF COURSE I NEED TO GO TO THERAPY BUT I NEED HELP NOW!! They didn’t even try to set up an appointment they just gave me a phone number to call
If I can’t get help at a mental hospital, where else can I go?
I’m thinking about going to the emergency room, because I am out of ideas. I hear they can possibly give you some meds but it really depends upon who is working. Also I live in America so this is ridiculously expensive even with my health insurance (I’m really curious how much I’ll get charged for the mental hospital visit, my guess is at least $100-200)

73,"I have had this thought / feeling for as long as I can remember ...  
Frankly , I was never noticed anywhere , and I never accomplished something worthy of being noticed ...  
I spend my whole teenage life and early adulthood trying so hard to prove myself at anything but nothing seems to work ...  
Back at school , teachers told my parents that I won't amount to anything . I barely had any friends and I wish from time to time that the conversation would be initiated on their part as well ...  
Maybe a simple "" good morning "" or "" hey how are you "" even once a month will do .  


I am always the person making effort to keep friendships ,  to be something but I am always forgotten, or go unnoticed . I was even wrote down as absent in many classes where I was sitting in the front row right in front of the professor .  
And tbh , I am just tired . I spent my whole life like this , no one asks about my well-being or cares about what happens to me .  
Also from high school fast forward a little less than a decade and here I am still struggling ...Maybe my teachers were right back then .  
What really hurts me is that I am trying , no sleep , day and night just to not seem that less than everyone else around me , thinking that someday I'll get my moment to shine , but I waited 23 years for it ... I was always been either the nobody , or if I was mentioned , my inadequate self pops out first ...  
Also during all of that emotional turmoil , I picked up drawing .Because every time I tell the one close friend what is wrong with me , they all answer "" we don't need you in our lives "", and cut me off . I needed a medium to tell  through my art , what I was feeling , and maybe lessen my load ...  
Back in 2012-2013 when I was still 13 , I thought maybe I could make this my success story , and improve , and I really came to like what I was doing .I LOVE iit actually , i would always get new ideas , experiment and just have a blast ...  
But the reality reflects otherwise... My "" getting ignored"" in real life , transferred to my art account ...and I was reluctant about doing it full time because "" if i couldn't get my art seen by others after 10 years of constantly trying , practicing and improving  , i won't be able to sustain myself economically wise....  
please do not misunderstand my point , I don't want fame and a lot of money , I just want to feel validated somewhere , and that my work matters , and maybe not so lonely ... I want that when I interact with others , they's interact with me , I want feedback and maybe a nice comment every once in a while .  
I JUST WANT TO SEE MY HARD WORK PAYING OFF , BUT I ALWAYS GO UNNOTICED...

PLEASE HELP , I am having suicidal thoughts because of it .

I envy people who go and live to their fullest while I am in that room working all day but never reap the results because nothing works out , not in my major field ( my professors don't see good results so they think I am wasting time and having fun and ask me to work more while I often skip meals for work ) , and I don't even have an audience art wise to be able to assess my work...  
Maybe I was born to watch others be fulfilled and satisfied.",13Mar2020,1

78,"[TW: rape, incest, suicide]

I am... kinda fucked up, or at least my ideas and way of thinking are pretty far from what could be considered normal.

I used to think and feel that i was bisexual, before and after that, i was/am only heterosexual (had some relationships with guys, none of them lasted very long, relationships with girls didn't last long either).

There was also a period of time in which i thought and felt very seriously and strongly that i was transgender, but no longer feel like that (didn't transition but was about to after coming out to my mom).

Since some years ago i started thinking about incest, questioning if it was wrong and thinking that it could actually be enjoyable, but i guess it was kind of a fetish. Came to the conclusion that it would be mostly ok if the people involved are consenting adults and using contraception. (Would have fantasies of fucking my daughter if i ever had one.) (Currently interested in (real) half-first cousin.) (Never felt any sort of attraction for a sibling or mom, but cousins pretty frequently.)

I talked about most of this with my mom and a psychologist and quite a few times was asked if i was sexually abused or something when i was younger. I can't recall a single moment where i had gone through something like this. In fact, i did kind of rape someone but very heavily regretted it and apologised and confessed (we were both underage and about the same age) and guess i got traumatised thinking about the consequences of my actions; i guess i never really got over it, and maybe never will.

Anyway, i am very certain that i wasn't sexually abused so it is a little weird that my mind is like this so i started thinking ""what if i actually WAS sexually abused as a child but for some reason can't remember a single thing related to any sort of situation like that?""

To be fair, i barely remember anything from my childhood or early years, but i think something like that i would remember.

When i think about sex i almost never feel like the past is of relevance to it in any way at all.

Still got the trauma i mentioned earlier tho, so now that i think of it... yeah, i won't fuck my cousin, i don't deserve anyone.

I...

I just want to live some more years so that i can die after my dog is gone.

Oh, by the way i am very suicidal, seriously.

I have an almost constant feeling that i've given up, but want to keep living just a little longer so i can keep my dog company..

And also i promised mom i wouldn't kill myself after she cried when i explained to her in detail what i thought and felt and how i had planned to end my life.

I honestly hope i get cancer or something.

But not yet, my dog still has some years to live.

Eh... it's not like i would complain anyway, she will at least have the rest of my family and they will no longer have to put up with me.

I just don't want her to feel bad that i'm gone, same with mom and my sibling.

If only i could erase myself from existence without affecting anyone... that would be great...

And i won't kill myself because i promised mom i wouldn't and i don't want to be a liar.

But maybe if things got bad enough i wouldn't care about that anymore...",13Mar2020,1

82,"Hey guys,

I would appreciate your opinion on this issue. Short story: I grew up with my grandparents age 5-11 since my parents divorced when I was 5 and then moved with my mom age 11-17 to another country (who also passed away 2y ago). Then I met my husband and moved to Germany (18-24: my age now). I have dealt with anxiety since I was about 15/16, but it has gotten really bad in the last couple months, especially since breaking up with my husband because of cheating and moving to another city to start my Master's. The last couple of months were horrible because I couldn't sleep most nights til 3am due to my anxiety. Now I am visiting my dad and I am with him, his wife and my sister. Whenever visiting them, my anxiety and everything goes away 100%; I am super-confident, I don't have sleeping issues at all. I am wondering if all my anxiety comes from being alone in another country and without family. I have a lot of friends, but that doesn't really help. I am so worried that my anxiety will kick in once I go back and I am all by myself.",13Mar2020,1
83,"Hi all. 

I'm a 29 y/o man from England. This might be quite long I feel so I apologise. 

I came here purely because I need a little bit of clarification in regards to situations that I've been struggling with. I haven't been diagnosed with anything. In fact, I haven't even consulted a medical professional in any way. I also wouldn't claim to be self diagnosed with any kind of mental illness. However, I do feel deep down that something isn't right.

The bottom line is that I struggle on a daily basis really. I'm not going to sugar coat it because I've been doing that for years and it hasn't helped me in the slightest. I'm writing this from one of my many bad days. I have a wonderful home life. I have an incredible fiancee who loves me deeply and shows me every day. I have to young boys who I adore and they also love me immensely, and I have a 2 month old daughter who is the absolute light of my life. 

But I can't stand myself. Literally, I full on despise myself as a person. I have no idea why.

I haven't shared these feelings with anybody purely because I feel like I have no reason to feel like this. My fiancee believes I'm a happy man. My kids think I'm the best thing in the world and my parents think I'm a happy go lucky guy that likes a good laugh. 

I hate the fact that I don't like myself. And I hate the fact that other people think I'm okay. I get frustrated when I see strong people talk about their mental illness publicly, not because I think they're wrong to do so because they're incredible for it, but because I know I'll never do that.  

I started for a new football team last week. Well, I was supposed to I travelled all the way to training. I got my kit on. I collected my gear. I walked to the pitch. I turned around. Walked straight back the car and I fucking drove home because as soon as I stepped foot on the pitch my mind said 'You're absolutely not good enough for this. And even if you were why should you do things you enjoy'.

Of course I told my fiancee that training went great. 

I've read about getting councelling. But to do that I'd have to tell a loved one that I struggle and I really just can't do that.

I don't want to say I have any mental illness but I'm gettig more convinced that this is the case. 

I need help but I can't ask for it.

86,"I've been listening to a lot of psychology classes lately, mainly about personality, and it struck me that what the diagnosis of ""neurosis"" actually makes sense, because some people aren't clearly depressed, or anxious, or have OCD, but you can tell that they are a mess and exhibit symptoms of all of these separate states, however not in such an extent that would warrant a ""full"" diagnosis.

So my thinking has been: okay, some people are high in neuroticism which makes them predisposed to all kinds of negative states. It's like: today one worries about his job, tomorrow it's depression about the future, next day are worries about health and possibly having a disesase, day after that it's getting into arguments with friends, next day maybe having intrusive thoughts. Does that person indeed have depression, anxiety, hypohodrisasis, and an OCD all together at the same time or is that person ""simply"" neurotic which makes them messed up and all over the place (instable, that is), so that they constantly oscillate between these distressing emotional states?

Especially considering that there is an objective trait to one's psyche called ""Neuroticism"", which meanse exactly that. Is it possible that these ""old school"" psychiatrists actually got it right in a sense that yes, neurosis is a vague diagnosis, but it also accurately describes some people, moreso that separate comorbid states?

Enlighten me please, does this make sense?

I admit I'm like that. I don't fit neatly into any of these separate diagnoses, yet I'm deeply messed up in exactly the way that a neurotic person would be.

*According to* [*C. George Boeree*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._George_Boeree)*, professor emeritus at* [*Shippensburg University*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shippensburg_University_of_Pennsylvania)*, the symptoms of neurosis may involve:*

I am a very optimistic person, but that doesn’t work much for myself. I’m too anxious to take two steps of a staircase at the same time, fearing that I might trip and get hurt.

Matthew is the voice she has been able to hear the longest, according to her, and he says things at a normal level before slowly devolving into angrily screaming. Stacy is an overwhelmed voice that tries to get the previous to stop and tries to calm him down, but fails.

92,"As a child, I believed that my parents hated me.

I was mostly ignored, snapped at, and shouted at.

I was given the message that I was a nuisance. A burden. The look of contempt strewed upon the faces of those who I knew were supposed to love me remains a vivid memory.

I cried myself to sleep most nights.

And when I misbehaved, I was hit with a belt.

I remember the waiting and the hiding, the trembling with fear and the crying hysterically under my bed.

I don't think my Dad hit me hard enough to leave marks. But that didn’t matter. The damage was done.

All this time spent in fear was training my brain and body to be overreactive to threat and danger as an adult. All the time spent believing I was despised was training my mind to be supremely sensitive to the slightest hints of rejection or disapproval as an adult.

What my experiences have left me with is what author William Moyers eloquently describes as a “hole in the soul”. A void in the psyche and these walls that separate me from the rest of the world.

Disconnection.

I can now logically understand that as a human being I have inherent worth. Unfortunately, the emotional brain doesn’t give a shit about this.

I’m left with thoughts that jump to negativity relentlessly, a mind driven by the assumption that the world and other people are not safe, that nothing is to be trusted.

I’m left with the exhaustion that comes from having an overactive mind. The physical fatigue this produces that makes it hard to sustain socialising.

The numerous relationship breakdowns.

It’s okay though.

It’s far from optimal, but it’s okay.

I accept it.

It’s okay because I have free will and I use my free will to cope and to change.

I’ve learned how to recognize the array of “cognitive distortions” and stories my mind conjures up and how to step back from them and deconstruct them.

I’ve learned to distance myself from the thoughts and stories quite simply by focusing my attention externally – by practicing the hugely beneficial process of getting the hell out of one’s head.

I’ve learned to remind myself that my emotions do not reflect reality.

I’ve learned how to stop myself from spiraling; how to cultivate the balance between expressing and controlling my sadness and shame so that they do not cause an unhealthy amount of stress in my body.

I’ve learned to practice relaxation techniques that calm down my exhausted, trigger-happy nervous system.

I’ve learned to remind myself that I deserve to take up space. That my emotions matter. That in relationships it’s okay to express my feelings and my needs.

I’ve learned to choose to invest in people who respect me and treat me well, for I’ve learned – repeatedly, with the same lesson again and again – that I will not heal by going back to what hurt me. 

And with this, things are so much better than they were in the past.

I’m still learning and growing, and I always will be.

I honestly can’t stress the benefits of developing mental wellbeing skills enough. Without these skills, it’s so easy to spiral deeper and deeper into stuckness and negativity. It’s so easy to needlessly suffer and to double that suffering by beating oneself up about it.

I hate to think about the amount of distress happening right now due to childhood trauma. Research shows it’s disturbingly common.

The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study (ACE Study), one of the largest scale investigations into childhood trauma, found that a whopping two thirds – 11,078 out of 17,337 people surveyed – had experienced some form of abuse or parental dysfunction.

I find it astonishing that despite reading about psychology obsessively since I was 14 and studying it at university, I only reached a comprehensive understanding of my mental health in my late twenties. 

Self-education has been a godsend for me as therapy was always unaffordable.

Why is mental health, something that impacts us daily – something with such widespread ripple effects - not considered significant enough to be a school subject?

It’s absolutely absurd.",13Mar2020,1

96,"In a sense it is a phantom, in most cases the likelihood of most anxieties coming to fruition are small.

It comes from how your thoughts are looping in your brain. What one person is anxious about (fearful of) another person isn't, and it is not to do with personality, it is to do with your thought patterns.

You focus on what you fear and you feel more anxious, your mind lies to you about the reality of why you feel anxious as if it is a fact, when it is really only your own perception .

to overcome this i decided to face my fears. I also had depression and paranoia for most of my life too until i worked on changing how i thought.

An example for me was when i lived by myself i would get paranoid and anxious about someone breaking into my home. i even thought i heard someone breaking in once even though the sound wasn't that loud when i was in bed reading. i really believed someone had.

I decided to confront this in a method that may seem a bit too much for some, but here is an example,

I asked myself ""how likely is it that someone has broken in?' i thought ""not very likely as they would have had to make a lot of noise to do so where i lived"", so based on that, i proved to my rational mind that this supposed fact was not actually a fact at all,and therfore my minds so called facts already had a flaw as its not 100% true. Next i asked myself ""lets say someone has broken in, then what?"" i though of reasons people may break in and most likely they would just want to steal some stuff. i thought, fine, if that is the case, i will let them take what they want with no resistance.

next i asked ""what if they broke into hurt me?...but again how likely is that?, most people just want to steal stuff. But say they did want to hurt me, i thought worst case scenario is they would take my life and if they did, well it wouldn';t matter as i would not be around to realise it. Now i asked myself how likely is any of this based on my first question that it seems highly unlikely anyone has even broken in. So then using logic all the things that came after than thought process were total nonsense. 

i know this may seem extreme, but by doing this practice with everything in my life i started to see how my mind made up stories about situations, and i learned to use logic to see how likely something was to happen.

 Even if something seemed like it might happen, i always asked ""what is the worst that can happen? and how likely is that to happen"" - next i would ask ""what can i do about it?"" if i can do something then i will, if i can't i trained myself to accept that.

i hope this is of some help to someone.",13Mar2020,1

Hi guys and gals I am new to photography and I was wanting to design a photoshoot based around the realities of mental health.  I understand that this is a touchy subject for most but I feel that people will benefit from how these illnesses effect us and our lives on a daily basis.

  Yes I could’ve googled it but I wanted to see if anyone was willing to give their input on mental illnesses that I don’t know much about.  I have depression and I understand first hand how crippling that can be for me personally and I would like to know more about how you all might feel about mental illnesses that you might have, how you think they’re portrayed and how you would like them to be portrayed.

109,"In public, I pretend to be people I’m not. If I go to a restaurant and they ask for my name I’ll speak with accents and tell them that my name is something random. It’s gotten so bad that at these places I’m now considered a regular and all of these places see me and refer to me as the identity I put on in there. Recently I just realized how bad this was. Example:

I go to this sushi restaurant pretty often. When I’m there, while ordering I always pretend that I have a stutter and I change my name. I’ve gone here enough times that some of the employees remember who I am and how I stutter. Well this week, I went back to get some food and didn’t notice an acquaintance in the restaurant. I did my normal stuttering and stuff and he came up and was like “bro _______ I didn’t know you stuttered do you need help?” That was an awkward situation because basically the employees found out that I was a liar and it was really embarrassing for me.

I know that it’s fucked up to imitate someone with a stuttering problem and do these things but for some reason I can’t stop doing it? When I’m in public I put on all these personas and I can’t stop doing it. Is this a sign of something deeper mentally? As a background, I have already been medicated and diagnosed with OCD.

Sometimes I talk to myself, and not like you’d think. In my head I have like made up other people who don’t exist and I sometimes talk to that person. I guess it’s for comfort? I did grow up in a pretty toxic household. I’ve been in bad relationships. Just admitting this is giving me anxiety because I don’t want people to think that I am weird. 

To dive a little deeper, the “people” that I talk to are like.. I made up a protective brother, a loving and faithful husband, a best friend, etc. I have a vision of what they all would like like also. Whenever I’m super stressed or sad is when I talk to one of them.

 I'm still depressed, but it's a hack and I feel \*different\* at the very least.

2) sit up.  I'm not going for a brisk walk.  Rome wasn't built in a day.  I can be slouchy and just pay attention to a few breaths, and then lie back down and feel like crap upside down.

3) change clothes.  showering isn't happening any time either, but just changing my clothes and underwear again, is at least \*a change\* and again, I can lie down and feel like crap in bed and now maybe even sit up on my computer and express myself in some way to the world (this).

4) open the blinds.  that's all.  nothing made of it, just something to do that makes things different.

5) reach out in a smart way: if I'm still in here in a little while, I can text my mom saying that I am just busy and need some quiet and alone time and that I'm not isolating.

6) share: just sharing this, reaching out... first of all I'm expressing in a safe way (safer than if I were to try to go out and talk to my family about why the universe will never care whether or not I went for a walk today) what's going on with me in the present moment, and so it's less of a burden on ME.  It's shared and I'm at least believing that someone is out there reading.  If someone is, and it helps, and they want to help too, and maybe it takes hours... but relating with those who really understand helps.  If I share something that is helpful, too, I'll feel a little bit more self-esteem and self-worth.

Maybe I will do that short meditation, maybe I will brush my teeth, maybe I will pet my dog for a bit.  Maybe I will flip on the TV and even if I don't find anything... if noooone of this works, I can always go back to bed.

In the past, she's usually been ushered off to some corner of the ER, had to wait several hours just to see a social worker, then waited a while longer while the hospital attempted to find a bed for her in the psych ward. The whole process has taken as long as 15 hours in the past.

When you already feel so worthless and desperate that you're willing to kill yourself, that process can be excruciating. I can usually calm my mom down a little at the beginning, but her mental state always deteriorates as the hours tick by. She usually starts crying, starts begging to leave so that she can just go kill herself, sometimes throws things in the room and even wrestles with me, physically, in attempts to harm herself and/or escape.

And that's just what happens when the ER is running *normally.* 

Even on a normal day, resources for mental health patients are strained around here. There are too few social workers and too few hospital beds. Putting more pressure on those resources can only make it worse. I was talking about this with my dad last night. He went into psychology and became a social worker after my mom got sick, and now works at an inpatient psychiatric facility. He's already seeing the effects with his clients: much longer wait times in the ER, more frazzled case workers, more patients being shuffled around between hospitals (sometimes 3+ hours away) in search of empty beds, more pressure to discharge patients early.

I'm just worrying, as usual, and hopefully things won't get any worse. My mom is somewhat stable right now, but that can always change on a dime, and I'm hoping that if she *does* have a crisis and ends up in the ER, she won't be affected by any of this. It must be kind of rough for everyone, and I'm probably letting my own anxiety run rampant...but it's hard not to worry.",13Mar2020,1

131,"I've  had a problem with expressing since I was young. My mom would often  explode when she was upset but on a regular day she would be screaming  from sun up to sun down. She was hard to please as a black mother I  wasn't a stereotypical young black girl and that made our relationship  distant. I didn't fight, many of my friends were white, I didn't talk  ""black"".

Anyways, I've always been  more soft spoken but as I've gotten older, I've obviously had to become  more vocal as I progress through life. I guess I've dealt with all the  normal things. Although, I am not able to really deal appropriately with  stressful situations. I often just cut people off or explode. I've  exploded at people on the phone, exploded at coworkers after a stressful  day, etc.

One recent and shameful  example I've been in the most stressful academic program of my life for  9 months. We study from sun up to sun down with an exam on friday every  week and 1-2 exams per month on monday. We also have papers to write  every month and must meet for 2-3 hours on tuesdays and thursdays. On  top of this we also have rotations early in the morning into the  afternoon.

I'm not the most  intelligent of my program as it's all about memorization and mine is  terrible. It makes my experience difficult not to say that it's not  difficult for everyone in the program. I've just been one of the handful  that has failed multiple exams. I've reached out to instructors and  typically receive condescending or wishy washy answers. The work we do  is monumental as in we have mountains of information to learn in 4 days  before our exam.

So last week I  had a new meeting on Wednesday on top of the Tues and Thurs meetings and  it was at 1:00. I told my instructor that I needed to leave at 11:00 (I  know I was wrong for wanting to leave an hour early to get home but I  was just exhausted and wanted a small nap before starting the meeting)  but the other instructor (who is more involved with my program) was  upset because no one had told her I had to leave early (which I didn't  know since I usually don't even know who I'm going to be under each  day). She told me she was going to contact my site administrator about  the issue and I left.

My site  admin sent me an email about me leaving an hour earlier than I needed to  and told me to come into his office. When I came into his office, I  asked what did he want and he said, to see how I was doing?

But  here is the thing, he had so much time to reach out prior to me leaving  early the day before to see how I was doing. He told me in the email  that I had to meet him because I left early and I was annoyed, tired and  irritated after being in lab for 4 hours and having to meet him and  receive a tongue lashing like a child for leaving ONE hour early which  I've never done.

I screamed at  him. For about 20 minutes about how inefficient the program is, how the  instructors belittle us in front of everyone, how the management course  is just busywork and doesn't actually help. He told me I need to have a  good attitude (which I always do and he wouldn't know because he is  never with me in lab and doesn't have to experience all the horrible  things we do)

I know I was wrong  for yelling at him. I know I need help. This was last week. I guess I  just don't know what to do. I'm always busy so therapy is a no go. I was  going to do it once I got out of school. I just hate this. The other  students deal with the BS so much better but I just can't take being fed  BS day in and day out.

I love  what I am learning it's just that the program is not super empathetic if  you are actually having a hard time academically and emotionally.

Idk what I'm trying to get out of this but hopefully someone can advise.

132,"I don’t want to have a pity party on myself but the past couple of weeks my life has been such a rollercoaster and I’m finding it really hard to keep existing. 

My depression had gotten better for a while but it started to decline for numerous reasons. Having recently had a close friend (who I fell in love with) move to another country to sort his life out, not knowing if I’d hear from him again. Which has hit me so hard that I’m finding it hard to cope with the idea of them never coming back. And, knowing how much I want to be talking to him right now to make it feel better.

Realising I literally have no friends, bar one, and I can’t  rely on her because she’s pregnant and that just isn’t fair to dump my problems on her. 

To having just been told from a close family member that my mental health doesn’t matter and I basically won’t be receiving any support from them and if I continue I can no longer live where I do. 

I have no reasons to keep going. None. I’m on the edge of having a huge break down over it all. It’s too much to handle.",13Mar2020,1
133,"I went to the clinic yesterday with chest pains, an EKG showed that I was fine so they must be due to anxiety.  I can't relax and I am in an emotional crisis.   I'm dealing with likely job loss and estrangement from my parents.  I'm pretty sure my parents have narcissistic personalities, and I don't feel safe here right now, as I am dependent on them for my income and housing - they are my employers and landlords.    I'm likely dealing with some form of PTSD and childhood - lifelong trauma as well.  I'm not trying to be dramatic or attention-seeking - but I really need some help sorting all of this out.  I need a therapist who will help educate me and not just talk down to me and simplify / downplay the issues I'm dealing with right now.  And I am terrified I am going to be like them without realizing it.

Forgive me if I sound aggressive, I am just so frustrated because every doctor or therapist I see keeps suggesting SSRI's to me, which have not helped for all the years I took them.  I'm not seeking drug therapy unless absolutely necessary.  I think I may need to be screened for other mental disorders besides anxiety, such as ADHD which my father was diagnosed with.  My issues might stem actually from physical causes,I don't know, but I need someone who can help figure this out with me.

My physical and mental symptoms are so bad they are preventing me from working.  I am foggy and only get moments of clear thinking.  I can't focus on any one thing for long, except for some things which I can't un-focus from to the point where I block out everything else, even pain and thirst.  My brain is on overdrive, my memory is trash, I'm in constant pain from my muscles being so tight all the time, my nerves feel like they are fried.  I can't stop crying.  I struggle to actually finish anything I start except making dinner.  I am overwhelmed, agitated, and it's all I can do right now to care for my daughter and take care of our house.  I spend like 3-4 hours a day cooking and cleaning and shopping for fresh groceries because we are both on restricted diets.  And I still get crippling gut pain and I don't know why.  

All of the tests they have done on me say that I am fine.  I am not fine.  I've been dealing with a lot of this most of my life but it's been really bad the last year, particularly the mystery pain and IBS symptoms.  Now I'm having what sound like full-blown panic attacks.

I really don't need someone to help placate me or calm me down or ""put my fears into perspective"".  I do need someone who can give me a correct diagnosis and treatment plan and help me learn some life skills for coping with crazy co-dependent parents, and how to disentangle myself and my identity from them since they couldn't be bothered.  Sometimes I have a hard time asking for what I actually need because I feel like I don't deserve it - I was raised to doubt myself at every turn.  I need someone who understands how to explore and issue and not just take my first answer at face value. ",13Mar2020,1
134,"Hey I just wanted to thank you in advance if you end up reading all of this. I also want to apologize because I don't think anyone should read this as it's going to be very negative and depressing so back out now if you don't want to feel disgusted and shameful to be a human because of this post.

Anyway here goes I guess. I'll try to to organize this as best I can, but I'm in a pretty emotional state right now so it might be messy or hard to read. 

So I feel like either:

A. My parent or parents have fucked me up due to either awful parenting or non existent parenting. I've never had my biological father in my life. Just countless men that didn't really care about me and just wanted my mother for sex before they could leave and move on to the next mentally unstable single mom. One of them I thought was my real father until I was 8 years old which kind of fucked with me when I found out that who I thought was my father was actually like the 5th or 6th man she's been with at that point. I even called him ""dad"" for years. I can't imagine how he felt having this kid he wants nothing to do with call him their father. I kind of feel bad for him looking back on it. Maybe I was just a really stupid kid and that was my fault for getting attached to someone that didn't give a fuck about me.

Moving on though. Getting off topic a bit. More behind point A. My mother since I was maybe 2-4? Has been an extremely narcissist drunk/druggie with mental issues that has only ever cared for herself. She sure could put on a good show in front of others to make it seem like she was the world's perfect parent, but once back home it was ""I want nothing to do with you, leave me alone and go play your games or something so I can drink my pain away"". This left me feeling, yet I didn't realize it at the time or even know I felt this way that it was my fault that she or my real father didn't love me. Why else would he not be in the picture and she wants nothing to do with me? Obviously it's my fault right? I hate myself today, but feel so much love and feel so sorry for that kid back then. Sigh... 

Messed up the post a bit so it may be out of order of how I intended it to be so sorry for that. 

From a young age I feel like I've had the idea ""ok, nobody cares about you, you're all that you have and it will always be that way"". All of this started fucking with my head especially when I would see kids with their extremely loving and caring parents just enjoying life like it was so natural for them. I would think ""yeah there is definitely something wrong with me. That's why these kids are loved and I'm not."" I'd see kids make mistakes or anything that kids will obviously do because they're kids, and still be loved the same regardless of what they've done. I on the other hand would make a mistake or do anything kids do and it would become the end of the world. ""You broke something? You're so fucking stupid! Why the fuck were you so clumsy?!"" Or ""You don't want to come to church with me every Sunday to be forced to believe in something you truly don't?"" ""You're ruining my perfect social image""! She didn't actually say the last part but you know what I mean by that. 

She would tell me how ungrateful I am everytime I wouldn't do something she said. ""You wouldn't even exist because of me."" She thought that since she birthed me, she owned me and treated me like I wasn't my own person. She would say ""I brought you into this world and I have the power to take you out of it."" I became very lost and confused from a young age. 

It also doesn't help that my mine and my brother's only parent, yeah I didn't mention my brother yet, but he is from a different father as well so we are half-brothers both without fathers and stuck with our unfortunately biological mother. Thank god I had him and he was street smart because he kept himself and I alive. Anyway she ended up abandoning us one night when we were 10 and 14. Me 10 him 14. We were hanging out with his friends one night and when we went back home the house was locked and she was nowhere to be found. I of course blamed myself. Sigh... Turns out she just left the state without telling anyone. My brother's friend's mother offered us a place to stay until she was heard from and we had to live with his friend for 6 months before finally hearing that she was in rehab.

Or maybe it was option B: I was fucked up since birth and they never told me anything and just pretended like I was normal, but deep down they knew the ""truth"" and loved me less for it and treated me accordingly. I have no clue if there is something wrong with me to this day or not but honestly even if there wasn't I feel like I've become fucked up and now something may be wrong wrong with me regardless because of point A. Either way I feel fucked. Too fucked to ever live a normal happy life. To do the things most take for granted. To find love, get a job, start a career, to live with my partner, develop hobbies, enjoy life, etc.

I'm 19 years old and I've never been in a loving relationship, yet desperately craving to be in one. I know it is unrealistic for someone like me though so I try to say ""Hey life's unfair, you're just one of the unlucky one's. Deal with it.""

I've never had a job. Fear, depression, anxiety, and insecurity, along with who knows what others mental issues I may have have prevented me from trying to get one. I don't think I even meet the qualifications for a McDonald's crew member. Which leads me to the next point.

I failed the 7th grade and dropped out in 9th. I'm not sure if these were because of A. Fucked up childhood and the mental issues along with it. Or B. I'm just retarded and I'm destined to live an unhappy unsuccessful life because of it.

I have nothing good in my life it seems. I just want to idk maybe love someone and be loved by someone. I want to fall in love, go back to school, maybe college, get a job, maybe a career or trade, and start living my life happily and free and most other things people take for granted like it's just like breathing to them. But is it too unrealistic for me? Will I be alone and like this until I die? God I hope not.

I know I should seek therapy but I feel so fucking afraid. Like I'm too far gone and I'd just embarrass myself and be laughed at for someone like me even trying to be helped.

Anyway this post is getting long so I'm going to have to cut off some bits. I have so much more I wish to type but it won't fit and may be way too long to read. So I thank you again if you read this and sorry if there isn't much to go off, I wish I could add more, but there are even things that I probably don't consciously remember that are still fucking with me soo.. Idk. Thank you again.",13Mar2020,1

136,"I've never posted something like this, but for once I've no one, nowhere and not even the will to reach out in my personal life anymore. I have nowhere else to turn.

I had a psychiatry appointment today, one I've been waiting for for uite a while, you could say I've been waiting nearly a year since being told I'd be put straight into another mental health service and wouldn't be left alone out in the deep end. You can probably guess where this story's going.

The psychiatrist heading the community service that I was in until this morning decided to discharge me, against my wishes. She didn't allow me to speak in the appointment. When I could get a few words in she would cut me off. She wrote off some points that I wanted to bring up as simple personality traits and that I can't compare myself to others, that each person is different. Well if it were that simple I wouldn't be in the services. She said that I shouldn't strive to label myself or something when I brought up that I suspect I've autism. No matter how many times I said how it's getting more and more difficult to exist in day to day life with others I wasn't listened to.

She told me what I thought, or what I went through. I said my last psychiatrist dismissed a lot my issues. She said that he didn't, even though these are two completely different services. This doctor in particular stated that I don't have depression and the source of most of my issues is me over exaggerating things in my head. Never got to say that because she wasn't interested in listening to me. 

From the beginning she had an opinion of me that I felt like I was going to have to fight against, and she never let go of it, leading her to finally discharge me. She said that I don't appear to like the service, that it's not beneficial, that I'm not happy with it and that I always had something to say about it. From the beginning of my attendance to this service I was never entirely sure of how I was being deal with. I had a main appointment at the beginning where she had to get to know me and my history. I was at the end of my rope at that point in my life due to trying to finish school and being in an abusive relationship where I was gaslit into thinking I was an awful broken person. I had very few, maybe 2 max I think, ""check in"" appointments later where 2 different doctors did just that, check in on me and asking basic uestions to write down the answers to in my file. At these points in my life I was cripplingly depressed, had no idea what was going on at all due to, yk, trauma. My head was beyond broken and I couldn't articulate much other than ""I feel terrible"" in those appointments. Today she backtracked on those check-ins, that they were proper meetings, that I didn't like the service sure I can't even make sense of what she said now as I'm writing this. I had no appointment during the next period of my life where I genuinely just wanted to do away with myself which is a sentiment that has yet to leave me and has been massively exasperated from today.  One of the doctor's even said in the meetings I've had before that there was nothing he could really help me with because he didn't know me, that it was a bit pointless to be doing mindfulness exercises, that he didn't believe in half that shit. The other doctor ended up hugging me at the end of our meeting because I was so fucking depressing. And today there was this bitch again. 

Apologies if the above paragraph isn't all that clear, I'm truly confused as to what my situation is too.

She told me that I have no mental illnesses and cut me off whenever I tried to say that I had no official diagnosis', just recommendations and screenings because I never got the time of day anywhere. The only chance that I had originally was the last psychiatrist that demeaned me. She replied to me in these exact words: ""We're doctors, not imbeciles. These doctors haven't found anything in you before. They would've seen something if there was."" I had two check in appointments and that was it. She also said that I've already been diagnosed with aspergers. I haven't been, the child health service said it was a likely possibility and wrote a recommendation about it in my file. I was seen very little times because I was over 18 when they finally saw me. They told me explicitly that this wasn't an official diagnosis. If it was, my previous service would have known. She refused to listen and rejected that.

&amp;#x200B;

I began tearing up at some point, leading to full blown sobbing in the end, to which her only response was (at the door to the office) \[name\] come on, I have to move on to the next person.

I broke down crying on the floor of the toilet inside. I couldn't go out in public in that condition. This is possibly the lowest I've felt since I: 1: Was left on the floor of my abusive ex boyfriend's floor to curl into a fetal position and cry, and 2: Crying in the school bathroom and cutting my arm after being demeaned by my principal for the sin of reaching out for help.

For Trisha to call DISSOCIADID crazy in her video was disgusting to me. To call anyone with a mental disorder is disgusting. Mental disorders are the body's fight mechanism, changing the chemicals to help the body get through severe trauma. 

I only have severe anxiety and depression and I found Trisha's video extremely offensive. I have been called crazy by ignorant people who try to use my mental illness as a weapon against me.

As of late his anxiety has been through the roof and I have no idea how to help him when he’s so stressed. On one hand I don’t know if I should try to talk him down from the panic or just listen so he could get his feelings out. Either way I feel like I’m never doing the right thing.

I’m afraid she is going to be mad at me or judge me for just stopping it. I also think that an anxiety medication that acts right away like Xanax would be extremely helpful, but I don’t want her to think I’m just a pill seeker.

 I also had terrible chronic pain I was seeing her for the last few years that somehow went away recently, and that’s another thing I’m nervous about. It was a huge deal and I was making appointments with her all the time and going to all kinds of doctors who never found anything out, I’m terrified she thinks I’m a hypochondriac. No one took me seriously. Thankfully my physical body is MUCH better, but my mental health has declined. I’m also paying out of pocket.

For a while we were just kind if awkwardly tolerating each other, but yesterday he asked to talk and we talked for 1-2ish hours after everyone was kind of done hanging out for the last time yesterday. Ever since we broke up he has consistently been trying to get me to come back. I even expressed how it was a bit disconcerting how persistent he was but he seemed to think it was endearing? He flat out told me he would wait for me if my mental state was ever in a place where I wanted to be in a relationship. He said he didnt care, that he would wait for years, and that he knew I was the one for him. (Keep in mind, it was pretty much both of our first relationships)

He kept saying how he wanted to try again and prove he could be better and that he's done a lot of self-reflection. He just kept asking, and each time I said no. It was... I cant even describe it. I know it was the right decision tho. He didnt really care about my mental health, and often would guilt/try to emotionally manipulate me during the relationship. He isn't the worst person in the world, and the relationship wasnt abusive or anything - but for a while it certainly wasnt healthy. He apologised for those things, which I can appreciate as he seemed pretty genuine. But I dont know if he actually has changed, and I dont want to put myself in that situation again. Even besides him, I have just had so many toxic friend and family relationships, and I am working on myself and improving my quality of life - I dont want to add another potentially toxic relationship into the mix. After pretty much hours of begging me to take me out on another date and take things slow, he finally stopped.

He said he then said at least he didn't want to lose a best friend, and missed when we could play video games and send memes to each other- which I feel sort of weird but about but am maybe willing to try.

I am a bit worried because each time he has tried, hes told me he would stop trying to change my mind... but then has been doing it again and again. This time he said, ""I get it, I've lost you"", as in losing me as a gf... but will he ever really stop?

 I could tell it was hurting him that I said no to dating again, and I felt bad. I used to be angry with him, and probably would've been happy to do that back then, but I'm over it now... it hurt to see him like that. Even when we both were walking away I told him that there were other people - but he just looked at me really sadly and just said ""Not like you, there'll never be anyone like you.""

I really feel so screwed up right now. It's almost like I'm not in my body, and all of this really isn't happening. I just feel so sad and anxious and just wondering why all of this is happening? Everything basically just got flipped on its head (and the emotional conco with the ex didn't really help.)",13Mar2020,1

152,"So here it goes: I have been experiencing a period of strong self hate that was triggered by certain events. Anxiety has been building up for a long time and my mindset has just not been so good lately. I have confided in my best friend over the phone(text) and she tried to convince me otherwise. But when I'm like this (all the time but not on such an extreme scale) I dont believe her.

Now here is the problem: For the last few weeks we have been drifting from each other and I think its mostly my fault. I have been in a bad mood when talking to her because she triggers my insecurities. She is very talkative and funny and everybody want to be around her. The exact opposite of me. Another girl has started to ger close to her and always being by her side and i just feel jealous. So I withdraw, I move away because i dont feel like i am enough. If i was, she would choose me over her, she wouldn't just want to laugh and talk all the time, she would be by my side, because she knows what I go through and how i hate myself. I feel like a bitch for ignoring her but i just can't lower myself to the point where i have to force myself to be talkative when i just don't feel like it and follow her around everywhere like a leech. I feel like I have to prove that I am not going to chase after her when everybody want to be with her. I don't want to prove her popularity by being another follower, because i feel insecure about how uniteresting and boring I am. I am not going to be the desperate friend. If she truly was my best friend she would be there when I am not that interesting.
And I do another thing, which is worse. I feel like I have been intentionally connecting with my other classmates to make her jealous.  I force myself to be upbeat eventhough its fake most of the time. I And I feel bad about it, because I know she feels like I don't want to engage with her and like she is at fault. You see, this is where the problem is with me being a bitch and I hate myself for that. But the prideeee is just too strong ahgggg. But i gotta say i still try to talk to her and i have tried to connect again in school/messenger but she just has others that are more interesting i guess. She isnt the initiator of our conversations. Thats why i feel like she doesnt even feel like trying, like i am too much to deal with.

I know I am projecting, being a bitch and maybe even expecting too much from her. She doesn't owe me anything. Maybe she doesnt even know how to reach out to me. I wish she did, because I want our friendship back. But I act this way because I just want somebody who would accept me for who I am, my mood swing and all.

And then one night, I got to talking to her, and she was honest about wanting a little more out of our friendship, but not a relationship. I felt the same.

We made plans to meet, but those fell through. I'm hoping this weekend will go better.

I can't calmly handle this. I'm thinking about her a dozen times a day. It's agony not to text her, but it's a different kind of agony when I do text her. Did I overstep? 

I don't do this with everyone I meet, but I do this with every person I click with. I can't stop.

I usually do not struggle with helping people in tough situations but I have no clue what to do here.

My girlfriend ( we’re both 16) self-harms pretty regularly and she hasn’t clearly told me why. Being the only one that knows about it, not only am I really worried about her but I feel the responsibility to save her from this. I actually had been suffering from self-harm due to self-hatred and obsession until recently, so I understand why she would have the urge to cut herself but the reasoning is still unknown to me since she hasn’t given me an explanation and I know she doesn’t hate herself. Whenever I open up the topic she gets really uncomfortable and pushes me away by saying that the situation is only about her and is really insignificant, that she knows it will be over when she grows older.  She acts like she doesn’t care about anything people say to her and does not like to display sadness. I’ve told her that it is okay to show vulnerability and I’ll always be there for her, yet she still hasn’t opened up to me for months and it concerns me that I’m the only one that knows about this. I’ve sorta threatened to tell other people but it didn’t feel healthy so I let that go. I’ve also suggested therapy but she says it’s not necessary. I can’t think of any way to let her open up to me, and I’m really worried about her. What should I do?

179,"hello to everyone and no one in particular. 

it's been a few years since i could say i felt happy. 

during one of worst periods of time, i listened to the fear in me. the fear that told me i wasn't strong enough at the time. one particular person, a dear friend, was adamant in inspiring a more positive mindset. i'd lost my job of 2 years (that i'd been ready to quit but things weren't lining up at the time), and i'd just moved into a new apartment that gave me hope. that hope was mostly due to that particular friend, who was more like a soulmate. before we ever even officially met, i felt this immediate connection to him.  we kept crossing paths, then started working together, and he convinced me that moving into the artist complex he lived in, was the right move. 

he was busy often--working a couple jobs, on top of being an art student. I was busy applying for jobs and giving in to the familiar bouts of anxiety/depression.  he was always welcoming and tried to get me to socialize with his friends too. at the time, even though i should've been able to, a lot of the fellow artists just seemed too edgy and angsty for my already overloaded mind--plus as an introvert the social addition just felt too exhausting. of course my uncertainty and guarded-ness was met with the same. 

that fear that i mentioned earlier, it kept creeping in. i took a new job at another (!!!) grocery store and damn did i start to feel more paranoid and distrusting of basically everyone around me. most people were harmless, but i had a lot of intrusive thoughts and \*it was\* even more boujee that the prior place i worked. i felt a lot of ""i don't want this"" when it was supposed to be a welcome change. i just felt so damn out of place. despite the attention of this friend, that i so deeply craved, i was coerced into returning where i grew up. 

before the move (that i regret still in some ways), we were hanging out pretty regularly. we would watch rick and morty, do facemasks, eat some bomb vegan pizza (his fav), do art together, and get hella drunk on gin at least a couple times. something longing in me made me admit i had a crush on him, and i got the sense that it made him uncomfortable, so i felt awkward and embarrassed from there on out i guess.  i let my shitty, petty feeling of wanting more get in the way of what i had. we had so many, SO many eerie similarities to each other (especially after writing them all out). if i could change anything, it would be not leaving him like that. Like a cut cord, still plugged in.  i was so mired in my own stupid self pity, that i just left it there, not bothering to keep in touch (because i just assume people don't care) after i gave up on my impatient need for more and retreating to the safe alternative.

this very special friend committed suicide last september and it broke me so painfully. i found this out accidentally on social media from his sister (who i unfollowed prior) and this was after processing something else that was incredibly traumatic to me then. i think about him and miss him daily, still. he had so much pain he couldn't divulge beneath that carefree &amp; light exterior--the customer service schtick we were both so good at.

lately, i've been finding it hard to breathe and find hope. my sister is getting married next weekend, and i had every intention of moving back to where we met and REALLY trying this time, but that fear is dispersing more and more--telling me i should stay in the safe spot that i'd fought so hard to leave. the reality is it still doesn't feel right. i mean, my family is here, but my heart/soul are not. maybe it's a mental block, maybe it's all the trauma i've experienced in the south, maybe it's that i'm weird and gay and whatever diet version of life i've been caught in will never compare to that full flavor of where i've been. i feel like i've changed too much to accept this muted life here, but as it's easy to gather and despite my customer service background--i'm not really good with people long term. 

then again, things are very fucking different than before and i don't want to surrender to that fear. i long for that sense of community again, how ever fleeting it was. i long for another chance to be more than what the past dictates. 

thank you for reading this far if ya did--any input or thoughts would be welcome (just plz be kind).",13Mar2020,1
180,"I have been thinking a lot about the Corona virus and ""regular"" peoples reaction to it.

Like I said, I definitely have some pretty shitty side effects from taking an SSRI, but it’s so so so much more manageable than the brain fog of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation all bundled up into one. Can’t believe I’m where I’m at today. I’m about to graduate highschool with a 4.0 GPA, awards to go along with it, I have a girlfriend who I’m going to get to see soon, I’ve tackled my OCD and Hypochondria to such a large extent I don’t feel like it controls my life anymore, and I just have so many friends, family, and people who support me.",13Mar2020,1
182,"I am 24 and I'm diagnosed only by my GP for anxiety.

I am so goddamn sad. I go through periods of euphoric happiness and stuff seeming great but my mind still feels confused and frazzled

Then there are my lows and it hurts me physically in my chest it's so bad. I get so deoressed I bawl and the suicidal thoughts over run me. I've developed a drinking problem just a bit but this started way before my drinking ever did. It's been there my whole life but like trauma and abuse and death and dysfunctional family life have added on it.

And lately I feel I'm in such agony I cry all the time 
. I'm so sad life has little meaning I'll never get ahead or matter. Nothing ever feels right I dont feel happy but the pain in my chest from sadness hurts so bad. 

I tru telling people or conveying how i feel but i dont think they get it. Like irs a pain thats enough to make me want to cut my throat in front of them. Or hang myself.

I think about cutting my throat or hanging myself quite often. Even if I get happy it's this overwhelming thought in my mind. 

It's like I'd be happy if I could just escape this body and die.",13Mar2020,1

184,"After living abroad for nearly a decade in Germany and moving back to the UK because I felt isolated and couldn't make friends... Well let me give you some context. So I landed a job pretty quickly and thought I was so set, so ready for this. I would be perfect, I did my best to be well groomed (look I'm posting on mental health, just getting out of fucking bed is hard) I resolved to be unfailingly polite, I never once said anything even vaguely controversial, I even smiled and agreed with political views that I absolutely can't stand. I did fucking everything, even if no-one liked me at least I wasn't going to give anyone any justification to hate me. A month into my new job, I eat lunch alone every day, no one talks to me unless I make the effort, the two coworkers I was supposed to work closely with as copywriters have frozen me out to the extent that it's impeding my ability to do my job properly.

I want to just not give a fuck, and I swing between not letting it get to me to being unable to sleep over it all. All I want is just one to two fucking people that will just treat me like a normal person and just shoot the shit about whatever is in the news, video games, whatever.

The end result is that the problem has just got to be me. Everyone else manages to make acquaintances and friends, I get people who actively dislike me or who, even worse, just tolerate me out of pity. I would say there's plenty of evidence that my colleagues are just cunts, but if people are jerks everywhere I go then the problem just be me right? I'm self aware, it really fucking hurts, and it's been like this since I was a teenager. I'm fucking 30 now. I'm not a perfect guy but I try to listen, be attentive, do good work, be the best copywriter I can be, all I get in return is contempt and I just fucking hate myself for it.

Back to YouTube, video games and dreading Monday. I'd leave a positive message or something but as it makes no difference, fuck it.",13Mar2020,1
185,"Hi everyone. I am in need of some advice on how to deal with mental issues from abuse. I grew up in an abusive household and my relationship with my family is pretty nonexisitent now since moving into an apartment with my boyfriend. He tells me all the time I think like a child and act like one. When it comes to fights, Ill admit I still slam doors and have in the past ran out of the apartment a couple times. However, that is the only time Id say I can be immature, and I havent ran out like that in a long time. Like any one else, I can think for myself and make my own decisions but he makes me feel like im actually retarded or have some mental illness.  I am trying to cope better but when he resorts to degrading me saying im a child who cant think properly and a fucked up retard, I dont know what to think. He tells me my judgment makes zero sense but I feel the same way about him sometimes. He tells me im a retard bc of how I grew up and theres a reason I have little to no friends. Ive never had this issue with anyone else before, but I also havent been close to someone the way I am with him. I am NOT perfect and I have regrets on my behavior during intense fights. 

Because I grew up in a fucked up environment, I always doubt myself and wonder if I have something wrong with me. Im not a mean person and I try everyday to be the best person I can be. I have zero confidence, like none. But i know Im a good person and treat everyone around me with the same respect Id want. I cant tell if my boyfriend is accurate with his judgment or if his judgment is off. For example, he told me I have daddy issues because I seek older friends instead of friends my own age? I dont see how that has to do with my dad, and I havent thought about my dad nor mentioned him for months. Its not my fault he was a shitbag my whole life ya know? Has anyone else that grew up with abuse had this problem of not knowing whether something was wrong with you or not? I question myself at least 10 times a day but never express this to my boyfriend since Im afraid he'll judge me. Id really like to know how you learned to deal with past abuse and what you did to overcome your mental problems since then. Thank you.",13Mar2020,1
186,"A lil explanation to my question; there are a lot of times I've 'blackedout' and find myself in a place I don't remember going to, with people telling me I've said and done things I don't remember. 

One example I was anxious at school and trying to get to class, and I felt relieved seeing the doorway and remember walking into class, but one of my friends would come in right after me and ask me why I flipped out on someone who bumped into me. No clue, I don't even remember being bumped into. I thought I had made it to class quickly without anything happening. Must of been an anger blackout, right?

Then there's times I do remember things. Like for an example a time one of my ex friends refused to  leave and I felt so helpless, but I remember it was like I was suddenly watching myself say things to him, like someone else was in control. When I looked in the mirror at myself I didn't really regonize myself. There was no yelling, and my voice sounded icy and different. My other friend told me right afterward that it terrified her because she said I didn't look or sound like myself at all, it was like I was possessed. I just told her I must've blackedout again, because I didn't want to explain how I felt like I was backseat driving, watching myself do and say things without my control and her think I acted that way on purpose. 

I've looked into anger blackouts but none really explain the 'backseat driving' and not even remembering what led me to be angry to begin with. 

I don't have ADD or ADHD or Bipolar or anything like that. Just regular anxiety. 

Sorry if that's too thick/heavy a question, I'm just looking for some insight to this situation.",13Mar2020,1
187,"I have struggled with depression for a while, like years while, and have always been there extremely critical of myself. I'm in therapy and got medication prescribed by a psychologist the other day. I've lived this whole time telling myself, ""I'm fine"", or, ""you don't have it that bad, stop feeling sorry for yourself"". I've had the hardest time trusting people and opening up because I was betrayed and bullied a lot when I was younger, so I've always had walls up and never let anyone truly and deeply in. I guess I'm lost because I know I've not been right and have thought and attempted things in the past that aren't normal or healthy, but my mind is still telling me that there's nothing wrong. I want to trust my therapist and psychologist and other people, but my job is on the line and my life honestly and I don't want to get hurt or betrayed because of my own confusion and mixed emotions. I'm always holding onto hope, but this shit is hard!!",13Mar2020,1
188," 

As someone who has lived a life surrounded by the effects of mental illness I was surprised at the insights I gained in my first week of staying at a mental institution. At 20 years of age I have spent much of my life in and out of therapy, arguably due to the lack of self care my parents chose to maintain. It was many years ago I accepted that a constant state of anxiety would be my normal and I have since been trying to find a way to find peace with that concept. It took accepting that I needed extra help on that path and coming here that I realised that it need not be my reality.

Going to a hospital seemed drastic, and due to both media and social portrayal of these places I had come to expect that these hospitals were reserved for the crazy. Now, not even a week in I have come to see it as a sanctuary of healing and growth, partly due to the facilities and kind nurses but mainly as a result of the comfort I have found with the other residents. 

Ever since I was a child I have experienced anxiety and suicidal ideations, I have seen my family suffer through these same symptoms as well as many of my friends. In my attempts to find strategies that could help me manage my life I have thrown myself at therapy, drugs and alcohol. I read of others journeys and have studied psychology intensively. I thought I knew so much about mental health but the people I have met here have awakened me to the fact that I have so much more I need to open my mind to. 

My thoughts often cloud my judgement and I think that has made me become delusional in my expectations of the world. I have had such a rigid approach to my mental health. To me it appeared formulaic: I have been abused and am traumatised and as a result I have this illness. Therefore if I work hard to better my circumstances, slowly I will start to feel better and with distance from my traumas one day I’ll be cured. This approach has been cyclical and counter intuitive as it provides no room for further obstacles in my life to occur. It works until it doesn’t. One year ago, I was going well for so long, things looked like they were taking a turn, then I was raped and  this all unravelled. So I took time off work, regrouped, applied this approach and it worked. Until it didn’t. My life is in peaks and troughs, periods of fine and very not fine. The older I get the shorter and more intense these periods become. I have this mindset of that when something bad happens healing needs to occur directly after the event. A period of intense self care and therapy will cure that problem. A lifetime of this approach resulted in a drunken breakdown of telling my family and my friends my plan to kill myself a little over a week ago. That was one hell of a hangover, no amount of nuggets and netflix was easing that embarrassment. A long Sunday under my covers allowed a thought that was placed in the back of my mind to come to life and I decided to admit myself to a mental hospital.

A few days later I drove with my mum and older sister to a coastal town. Despite the nagging of my sister to play her music (“ I’m going to hospital I pick the music”) the drive was nice, a respite in what was a very hard week. Normally I hate car trips, I’m so excited to get to the destination and unpack that I can not wait for the drive to be over. This road trip was not one I wanted to end, a three hour drive has never felt so short .Not once did it cross my mind in that three hour car trip that I would find such a sense of grounding and freedom in where I was heading. The usual joy I feel when driving over the hill to reveal the ocean was tarnished by a deep feeling of dread. I pleaded with my mum to let us stop at the shops before checking in, gutted there was no time for a milkshake. I knew the sense of normality I have been clinging on to for so long now was going to dissipate as soon as I entered the hospital. 

After a very long and silent wait with my family in the lobby I am taken to my treating psychiatrist’s office. In a brief 15 minutes I give a summary of my life to this stranger, an insight for him into where things started to go wrong. “You’re depressed that’s why you’re here, now we just need to figure out why”. His words stung. His words did no justice to the torment I have experienced. I thought I told him. I have taken the practise of telling my story to doctors in what I believe to be the most effective form. Taking out my key and most traumatising sexual assaults along with my Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis. Surely that is enough for a doctor of psychology to know why I’m depressed. I think my treatment is burdened by failure to disclose specifics. He writes me a script for sleeping pills and I am sent back to the lobby with my family where we meet a nurse. She was brisk and initially struck me as rude, I found myself rolling my eyes at her behind her back. I thought she lacked compassion. I was wrong. There was something calming about her. I was taken on a brief tour of the facility and arrived at my room. My mum feels like she is clinging off me, I know this is hard for her too but I don’t want her to see me cry and I feel coddled so I act short with her. She senses my discomfort and leaves to go home. It’s a funny relationship with mothers, when they’re around we feel like we don’t need them, as soon as they’re gone they’re who we need most. I sit down as the nurse searches my bag for any contraband. A razor to shave my legs is confiscated. She says goodbye and lets me know she’s there if I need anything and leaves me be. As soon as the door closes I cry, I have been holding my tears all day now.  I recompose myself and grab my cigarettes and head to the smoking room. It’s a warm summers day but I’m wearing a hoodie to cover my face, I don’t want to be spoken to. Thankfully the air conditioning in the building means a jumper is always appropriate, yet another disconnect from the outside world. I arrive on level 2 and follow others to find the smoking room so as to avoid needing to ask anyone for help. Two doors, one to let you in, another to keep the smoke in. I walk in and am immediately reminded of an airport smoking room. Cemented floors, no windows, no seats. I begin to realise why the elevator smelt so strongly of cigarettes. It was the first time since I started smoking I could so obviously smell it on a person. At first I thought this might be a deterrent in me smoking while I’m here but quickly came to the realisation that I will become desensitised to the smell in no time. A man named Greg approaches me, he uses a walking stick and is very brash. He smiles and introduces himself in a friendly manner, asking how I am, a question I find peculiar in a place like this. I am not ok I think to myself  surely that is a common understanding amongst the patients here however, it is rude to say otherwise so I say I’m alright. A happy medium I often use when I don’t want to lie but it’s rude to tell the truth. I distract myself from engaging in conversations by reading the signs on the door. Rules about where to smoke, nothing interesting. I return up the elevator trying to ignore the people walking around ticking in a state of obvious stress, these observations only reinforce my idea I’m in a house of crazy. I go to my room and unpack my things. My mum has packed me a bag full of my favourite snacks and water. I feel a sense of guilt about the way I said goodbye, she always gets my worst even though she deserves my best more than anyone. I sign my admission contracts reading them thoroughly. They were no different to the forms my mum would sign before sending me on school camp. Nothing unexpected, no drugs, no alcohol, no sex. At school it was almost a mission to break these rules, providing esteem among your peers, here it only makes you a failure. I go to the dining hall and wait for my dinner. I barely touch it but enjoy the fact I could be on my phone and use as much salt as I want. I head upstairs for another cigarette. The room is much foggier than earlier, filled with people enjoying their after dinner cigarette. There is an older man who reminds me of my grumps, both in appearance and manner. He is friendly in the same way grumps is, which is inappropriate and loud. Some people you have to give time to like, Andy is one of those people. His kind heart and open mind is hidden behind the exterior of a harsh voice and a preconception of what an old man is. I make small talk with the other patients and leave. A woman named Nicky follows me out, she has a roughness and sense of personal strength to her yet such a softness and humility, traits I always find very likeable in women. She tells me not to worry about Andy and that he is harmless, a fact that will not take long for me to learn.",13Mar2020,1

Even worst, with my younger brother's health condition there is likeliness of higher risk than my grandparents... But I don't feel scared or anxious for their safety or to see them.  


Recently had a argument with a long time friend who I also work with, the argument started work related and ended up personal. The things got heated up and he pointed and said that ""how many of the people you know think and speak good of you, have they said anything good about you? Our boss? even your other friends ask me how I'm  are tolerating you"" (translating)..  



This statement really got me thinking about what I meant for the people around me.. I always thought that I was a good friend even though I have only a handful of friends.

In a country where I don't know the native language, can't speak to people, unable to make new acquaintances, shut in my house and room for the next few weeks, feeling like nothing else matters anymore,

Now, the only thoughts I get are only of self preservation... the only things that come up in my mind are how to survive this, evrything and live through.. but not to make amends with my friend or try to change.  


I realised that something is wrong with me.  


Previously when this happened I messaged to my other friend (the one I share my intimate secrets with) about these thoughts as ""I have some scary thoughts"" (translating). 


and he said these are just thoughts every adult goes through once in a while and as I grow I'll be able to manage these as the process of ""growing up""..  


And after that I'm here again with the same kind of thoughts after several previous times it came again and again and I try to shoo it away as ""growing up""..  


I think that something is very wrong with me and if I proceed the way the things are I might end up losing even the ones I got if I continue to distant myself.

i see a lot of tips about breathing excercises and yoga but neither feel appropriate when you're standing there talking to someone.

Professional help is out of the question since none of my doctors take my anxiety seriously because it's not my main diagnosis (and also because it's not a diagnosis), because I have (addictive) anxiety pills (that i can only take once a week), and because some don't even believe me.

So, first of all, I’m an (almost) 17 year old male and I think I might have HPD. But I don’t even know if I can have HPD since I’m a male. I’m also gay if that changes anything.

I’m going to list the symptoms and explain to you if I have them or not.

Be uncomfortable unless he or she is the center of attention: I LOVE when people pay attention to me, but it’s not that I feel *uncomfortable* when people don’t. 

Dress provocatively and/or exhibit inappropriately seductive or flirtatious behavior: I don’t dress provocatively but I can be flirtatious. I’m not like, an extremely sexual person though.

Shifts emotions rapidly: sort of


Act very dramatically, as though performing before an audience, with exaggerated emotions and expressions, yet appears to lack sincerity: MAJOR YES, I do this literally all the time. All. The. Time.


Be overly concerned with physical appearance: yes absolutely


Constantly seek reassurance or approval: yup


Be gullible and easily influenced by others: yup


Be excessively sensitive to criticism or disapproval: extremely

Have a low tolerance for frustration and be easily bored by routine, often beginning projects without finishing them or skipping from one event to another: YUP. Like, this REALLY sounds like me.


Not think before acting: I don’t think before I say things a lot, and I don’t think before acting on other things as well

Make rash decisions: yup 

Be self-centered and rarely show concern for others: yuppp


Have difficulty maintaining relationships, often seeming fake or shallow in their dealings with others: yes. I have friends but only a few of them have been consistent over the years


Threaten or attempt suicide to get attention: never done this

Other symptoms that I’ve read about that weren’t on this list is that my personality and opinions change depending on who I’m with, because I want people to like and approve of me. Another is, I state extremely unsubstantiated opinions ALL THE TIME. I really have no set opinions on much of anything. I often say crazy things that will get a reaction out of people. I used to post pro-Trump stuff on my snapchat story just to get people riled up even though I didn’t support him. I don’t know anything about politics.

I've been switching between both for several years now. I am almost 25 in april, and have basically been living in a crisis situation since 18 and thought I could handle it but it has gotten much worse, and I should have been institutionalized multiple times since but don't want to accept that I am very mentally ill.
