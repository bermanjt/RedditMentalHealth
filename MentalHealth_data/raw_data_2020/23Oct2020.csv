1,"My friend is struggling with anxiety and a heavy user of social media. I'm searching for an animated cartoon image/ infographic that showed how people represent themselves through posts, how it is observed/ perceived by others.

It was represented by a number of people along the X axis, with one of them posting to make their life look great (Y axis) and everyone else measuring themselves by looking up at it - yet feeling they were 'lower' than the persons perceived great life. 

The image showed that in reality we all feel the same behind posts, but we all make our public lives look better and more polished than they perhaps are irl.

If anyone knows what I'm talking about or has a similar image that would help I'd very much appreciate it. 

I've had a solid Google but couldn't find it! 

Thank you",23Oct2020,1

3,"My mom is sure I have one. In July of this year I was so deep in depression and stress from traumatic events I had a hard time eating. I didn’t have an eating disorder though, I was not wanting to starve myself. She even brought me to the doctor for a possible stomach ulcer. I’ve since gotten a lot of my hunger back. 

Fast forward to now, I have had countless stomach problems. Changed my diet, drank lots of water, went on pills, laxatives, never truly worked. 
Right now I’m in the midst of not being able to use the bathroom (TMI I know) and have been in and out of the bathroom frequently. 

After dinner I went to the bathroom and went about my business. But when I came out of the bathroom I was greeted with a livid mother. 
 
She proceeded to tell me that if I was starving myself I’d have no place in her home, accused me of eating nothing (which is absolutely false), and never believed what I was saying. 

Im so fucking frustrated, she doesn’t listen and I hate being accused of false things. I don’t want to starve myself. We have no trust between each other. 

What do I do?",23Oct2020,1
5,"I’ve been under a lot of stress for a while now and it’s affected me physically like loss of appetite/weight, periods have stopped, frequent headaches etc. But I’ve also become extremely paranoid especially recently, I was petrified one night about having cancer in my womb, another night I was petrified about people looking at me through my camera and stealing my data, im paranoid about bugs in my food and bugs crawling in my ears etc and tonight I’ve just had a meltdown because i was scared my skull is wrong like I felt my head and I’m certain I have a strange long bump across the right side and I currently have a headache so I freaked out wondering if I have internal bleeding in the brain or something. Anyway the point is I’m so paranoid about everything and I don’t want to go to the doctors cause last time I opened up my privacy was violated, I dropped out of college, lost all my friends, humiliated etc. So i don’t know what to do. I’m still pretty concerned about my skull, two I hit my head a few times hard repetitively whenever I got stressed and had the mentality of “at least if I’m brain dead I won’t have to bother or know anything”  so now I’m worried that It’s started to affect me now or something or if I have cancer in my head or something? 

Sorry if it sounds so dumb I’m just concerned my life is in danger. Like the moment I started to enjoy life and be grateful for it I’m now crippled with anxiety of losing it",23Oct2020,1
6,"I'm a girl going on sixteen next month. Almost everyone around me seems to have something that stands out or is special about them... except me. I don't excel at anything (even though I've been doing drawing as a hobby for over a decade). I am not beautiful or athletic. I'm not bilingual even though I'm supposed to be (and get really mad at myself for it). My life is so boring, and other people seem to have way more fun than me.

Everything from putting on her pjs to do finishing her food and writing greeting cards. Now this has caught up to her in school and she has been labeled as slow. Again she has no problem doing the work but she comes home every day with unfinished work. I worry this is affecting her self esteem and make her feel like an outcast. I am considering noise cancelling headphones for class but will that help? How can I improve her slow behaviour even though I think it's beautiful to take your time and be a thinker unfortunately that doesn't play well in school.

9,"Haven't left my bed nor eaten anything since 2 days ago. My brain is physically making me rot. I'm only venting here since i could'nt properly channel out how i feel irl and being stuck with emotionally detached people.

10," Thankfully, I am doing relatively well at the moment. The main reason for this is because I' have holydays, but on monday I have to go to school again. In the past it was always the case that after the vacations when I came back to school, I quickly felt very miserable again.

Currently I am trying to avoid this by making a plan of what I am going to do each day and when. This includes things like sports, learning the piano, but also small things like when I do things for school and when I go to sleep. However, I am very afraid that I will fall back into the same behavior patterns as soon as school starts again.

The last year was the worst, in the beginning it went relatively ok but when the winter started it went downhill. I was depressed and have very few good friends within the school. I slept an average of 4 hours a week, and as a result, my school performance dropped. I hardly studied for exams because I didn't understand anything at school and was too tired at home. The thing that saved me and my grades in spring was corona. But I can't expect that this school year.

The first exams did not go so well, I find it very difficult to work independently on school tasks and to learn for exams. Once I start to study a topic I understand it relatively quickly. Except maybe math, that takes a little longer. A lot of things are only memorizing, but even then it is hard for me to dedicate myself to it.

I just want to do everything I can to make sure that it doesn't become the way it was before.

Do you have any ideas or tips on how I can do this and maybe some things I can add to my daily schedule?

Or just general tips that might help me?

11,"Hello everyone I’m not really sure where to start of what to say but right now I could really use some help. My moms first language is Japanese, I do know some to get by but whenever I try and communicate with her about certain things, there is always some obvious confusion and frustration from her end. 

My moms always been a bit paranoid about technology and being listened in. I don’t think it ever helped that keywords allow her to see ads for things she talked about during the day. One birthday I think two years ago she had a meltdown on her birthday. It came out of nowhere but essentially, she just started yelling that everything was weird “HEN, HEN, HEN!!!” she would yell, which means weird in Japanese. She said we all knew something she didn’t. This would go for quite some time on occasion. Things seem to be fine but if a small coincidence would happen, she would get incredibly paranoid again. It’s been getting worse. My dad asked her to go to a therapist but she says they wouldn’t understand. And she doesn’t trust medicine at all. She thinks it will make her worse. She started to associate colors with things too. She would ask me what “color” I was and thinks red is a bad color. A color that she thinks makes my dad mean so she avoids it. I started to avoid wearing any red around her. One time she freaked on my dad for getting her a candle with three wicks. I assumed it was a Japanese superstition at the time that triggered her to get upset but I couldn’t find anything. 

I’m sorry if all these things are kinda just random moments. As I write this my mom left the house for her birthday. She said she sometimes just wants to leave everything behind and run away. I don’t know what to do. I live in another city and she just lives with my dad and brother. Should I maybe call a Japanese consulate to go to therapy with her? I just need some guidance, this isn’t something I am familiar with dealing with and I’m ignorant about the subject. 

I just need to help my mom.",23Oct2020,1

13,"I have crippling social anxiety. I often feel alone, even if I realize that rationally I am not alone. I desperately crave human connection, but feel like I annoy and alienate people. I often feel like the world would be better off if I just drove out to the middle of nowhere and shot myself in the head, but I also realize that this would crush the people who love me. No matter how hard people try to connect, I always manage to end up feeling alone and alienated. I have thought of killing myself for years, but am stopped by the fear of either destroying the people I love or making a mess.

I really want to share what she told me, because it was exactly what i needed to hear and maybe it will help someone else. She simply reminded me that at the time i did not have the ability to effectively handle the situation nor cope with it. It is easy as a adult to have the feeling of shame and guilt because I understand right from wrong whereas a young girl, i wasnt sure.

18,"So delete this if not a mentalhealth topic but it just seemed like the best place to post. To give a little background let me say what happened in a previous relationship. Towards the end of my previous relationship which lasted around 2 and a half years my gf at the time was pretty disconnected. K could tell something was up but didn't know what to do. Eventually she ended up saying that she wanted an open relationship (mostly I think because she pittied me so much that she didn't want to be the one that breaks up with the other). I didn't know what to do at the time but soon after we broke up because she started seeing someone else. Fast forward to now. I have been with my current gf for almost 2 years now. Its been really great and I love her a lot and she always tells me that she loves me a lot too. As I'm getting closer to the 2 year mark though I have been feeling really paranoid; that ""I've seen how this ends before"" kind of mentality and I have just been expecting her to end up leaving me for someone else. It has been surprisingly stressful. She has never once given me any reason to think that she will be leaving any time soon or cheating on me,  I just feel like this is a leftover automatic response to her and I approaching that 2 year mark. If anyone has been in a similar place before what helped you with tuning out the paranoia and feeling confident or safe in a relationship thats going well (from what I can tell).",23Oct2020,1
19,"I was wondering if anybody had the same things happen to them. I was not born when this happened but I just found out from my mother last night. 

My aunt got pregnant when she was 18 because of inadequate sex education in rural China and she didn't use a condom. She felt shame from this and didn't tell anybody about her pregnancy nor did she speak about her abortion until years after. 

Nobody knew about this matching up time frames, she started showing schizophrenia symptoms which led her to be taken to a mental institution two years afterwards when it started threatening her own heath. 

Have you guys heard about these cases happening? Do you guys think maybe her abortion was botched (she had a healthy daughter a decade after her abortion)? Or maybe she felt so much stress before and after the abortion that it caused her to develop it? She still suffers from it to this day especially when she isn't on medication where she has large gaps in her memory.",23Oct2020,1

21,"About 2 years ago I was in the middle of severe bullying because of bullies from my previous school and my friends ditched me. I was at a pretty low point. I always told myself it didn’t bother me but in reality it did. Maybe not the individual comments, but more the overwhelming amount of them. At home I broke down a few times. Sometimes in anger sometimes in tears often both. I was generally down most of the time. Then my uncle got arrested and my grandad got put into intensive care within a 6 month period later and he would die one year later. That’s generally the period of time I think I may have been depressed. Quite early on in the bullying, the one thing that stood out to me was when a group of 3-4 told me I should kill my self and that every one would be better off and happier if I was dead. After that I thought about suicide a few times.

Now onto my doubts. During this time I went on some amazing trips to Iceland, Belgium, Germany and to the British gp. These are some of my happiest moments but from what I’ve seen depressed people struggle to find joy in anything. Also my doubts about weather or not it counts as suicidal thoughts is that I always shut them down very quickly, I always came to the conclusion that although to most at school it would make very little difference, I knew I had a loving family. I also knew that my grades were good so I knew I could work towards my aimed career path and had a real good chance.

23,"Hi, I'm not sure if this post belongs here but I'm really scared for the impact this is having on my mental health.

As of lately, I've had increasingly intrusive thoughts regarding cases of animal cruelty, which is a subject that triggers me horribly.

I love animals, reading stories/cases of abuse break me in such a deep way that I skip news/headlines about them because to even think about the pain animals endure at the hands of evil humans scar my soul.

As I mentioned, lately this has been taking a toll on me. Even when I'm watching TV, reading books, just chilling, suddenly the thought hits me: there are puppies being tortured right now and I can't help them. There are cows and chickens being tortured in meat farms, horses being exploited for tourism, elephants and sharks being killed in a disgustingly cruel way, and I can't do anything to ease their pain. I think that there are people shooting horrifying videos to upload in the dark web and that just breaks me, I start crying and feeling useless and powerless to stop these kind of things from happening.

I'm not really sure what has triggered this, but I need it to stop, it's breaking my spirit and making me question my sanity. Any words of advice would be appreciated, thank you for reading.",23Oct2020,1

Do I need help? Yes. But I don't need forced help. I know sometimes that's the best thing for some people but the thought if it being involuntary for me just makes me not want to call any of these lines. 

Sometimes I just want to talk to someone over the phone about my issues and not have a robot that says ""Everything will be okay"" ""You're not alone"" like yea you and everyone else on this planet tell me the same thing.

I miss my one friend who I used to talk to who we would talk to each other and share same experiences and helping each other through the other's problems would make ourselves feel better and forget about our pain.

We wouldn't BS it and say everything is going to be okay, if we wanted to hear that we'd go to someone else.

I'm not really sure what the point of this post will be?  I feel like I want to express how I'm feeling, even if its for myself.  its so weird how i feel more secure and trusting in telling thousands of strangers my shit, but it's so hard to open up to the people who care about me.  i have been seeing a lot of warning flags in my behaviors and i guess i just wanna know like, is any of this within the realms of normal human activity?  how alarmed should i be about myself?

&amp;#x200B;

as a quick summary of who i am and where im at; i am a 28 year old gay male living outside of Denver.  i'm not from here originally; i'm from maine.  i grew up in maine, then lived between boston and nyc for 5 years.  once the pandemic hit, i moved back in with my parents in maine.

&amp;#x200B;

i lived with them for approximately six months.  i was working a lot, pushing myself towards upwards of 90 hour work weeks.  Partially because I had nothing else to do, partially because i really care about the work i was doing, and partially because i wanted to stay distracted from everything that has happened from the world.

&amp;#x200B;

i wanted to take a break from living with my parents.  so i drove out here to colorado where i've been for the past month.  i thought things would start to feel a bit more normal; i'd be living away from my parents, i'd be able to see really beautiful nature, and be able to date/socialize with people.

&amp;#x200B;

but i've been noticing a lot of my bad habits getting more exhasterbated here.  i'm spending at least 6 hours a day twiddling on my phone between wikipedia/reddit/instagram/dating apps/the news/etc.  i'm smoking a fuck-ton of weed (about an 1/8 every two days).  i've been having a lot of hookups on apps like Grindr.  I'm trying to focus on my work but i've been feeling less and less motivated.  and i've on more than one occasion drove when i probably was a bit too stoned not to. 

&amp;#x200B;

things sort of climaxed today.  i needed to see a doctor to get my ears checked because they are clogged with ear-wax,  and have him perform a physical on me.

&amp;#x200B;

the doctor came into the room with a younger woman with him, whom he did not introduce.  i presume she was a shadowing medical student or assistant which is fine, but i would have liked to know who this random woman was?  it felt humiliating to had to have gone through a physical, including a screening of my genitals, in front of this random person.

&amp;#x200B;

i had a snapping point when he went to clean out my ears.  ever since i was a little kid i hated having my ears touched.  or having anything put inside them.  he was rough, he kept going even as i was wincing to the point that i was biting my lip enough that blood came out.  which at that point, i abruptly left the clinic and went home.

&amp;#x200B;

luckily i have enough $ that if i need to see a different doctor to get a physical, or my ears cleaned, i can.  but i just felt so weirdly violated and hurt physically.  that i relapsed into self harm.  nothing like horrible, but just a little bit of cutting.

&amp;#x200B;

so i feel really raw writing all of this out.  i don't really know what i am doing it for.  like, how concerned should i be?  about spending so much of my time on my phone/smoking a lot of feed/relapsing in self harming?",23Oct2020,1

33,"Around july I was going through a hard time and that was when I began to use alcohol to cope with it, I think. I felt like I never wanted to be sober. I wanted to be in a constant state of drunkenness so I wouldn't have to care about anything. 

The thing about that though is the drinking made me feel even more depressed, and I would get suicidal when I was really drunk and I would break down and cry. I started cutting myself, which is something I would never do sober even if I wanted to because of the pain but if I was drunk, i could. And I've tried other ways to harm myself like wrapping rope around my neck and pulling it. Or banging my hand against the wall or my steering wheel. I'm not sure why I do that though. 

I dont open up to people about the things I go through. I feel like I've gone through a lot because of the alcohol, it's having a negative impact on me and my life and even though it does I still choose to drink. I dont really want to stop drinking even though I should. Mainly because I can feel something when I'm drunk, the way I would explain it is I feel everything more intensely, so I feel the sadness more and I can cry. When I'm sober I can't cry. I just feel empty. Like nothing in this world could fulfill the void in my heart. I think I might be really depressed but I dont want to change. I've been to therapy before and it's helped but when I finished it, i went back to feeling depressed. I feel like no matter what, no matter how good things go in life I'll always go back to being depressed. So why should I bother to get better if I'm just end up in the same place as before. I might as well just stay here. I dont really have dreams, or want anything in life. I feel apathetic and empty. I dont know what I'm supposed to be doing, I dont want anything other than to drink.

36,today was my birthday. my 19th fricking birthday. i couldn’t enjoy it because my life is falling apart. i just recently cut off one of my best friends bc i realized they were bad for me. i’ve been a straight A student up till this point and i suddenly cant even barely keep a passing grade in my classes anymore. my mother ate my birthday cake yesterday and said to my face my birthday meant nothing to her. i’m drowning in work. i have an immobilizing spinal injury. all i wanted to do was enjoy my birthday and eat one stupid cake and i think that’s what sent me over the edge. it was all i wanted it was the one thing i had left in my life as pathetic as it sounds. so now here i am ten minutes after my birthday that i spent sobbing and studying for midterms for classes i’m failing. I couldn’t even have my stupid cake to distract myself from my awful excuse for a life. everything hurts and i don’t want to do this anymore. i can’t even find words to describe how awful i feel. it’s past sad or angry. i feel like everything. i mean everything. hurts. i’ll be walking and i just cant physically hold my weight anymore i just fucking let go and fall to the ground and sob in the middle of the hallway. it’s so hard to do this anymore. i just wanted this one thing. a stupid piece of cake on my miserable birthday to somehow convince myself i’m not a depressed piece of garbage with a miserable excuse for a life.,23Oct2020,1
37,"I miss my mom so much today. It's been 4 years. I feel like people expect me to be over it by now, I still cry when I hear her name, I still have guilt, I still am jealous when other people my age realm about their moms. I was barely 17 and I watched her die in front of me and even though it was considered peaceful it messes with me to this day. She was so sick she couldn't even tell me she loved me. Did she even love me? I was such a bad daughter and I caused her so much stress as a single working mom with cancer. I can't feel her love anymore so I feel like she hated me and that I was a burden to her. I'm not spiritual or religious so there is no getting closure or peace through that. I pretty much gave up on life the day she died and here I am 4 years later, a failure, a burden, and honestly just ready for life to end",23Oct2020,1
38,I can’t sleep without getting high anymore but I can’t tell anyone because then I’ll make an all ready chaotic time even more chaotic it’s late right now and I’m so high I feel like I’m in a fever dream I feel hopeless I feel miserably amazing if that makes any sense I just wanna feel ok I just wanna feel alright for a little while I’m so scared my brain feels so scrambled I feel like I’m fallen out of touch with reality like I’m living on autopilot  I want to be helped but at the same time I’m scared because I know what to expect with feeling like shit but I can’t stop thinking I wanna cry someone please help me I’m dying the lost painful death in the world,23Oct2020,1
39,"For the past... I don't even know how long. It seems like forever. I've felt empty. Sometimes I'll cry. I'm angry a lot. But it just feels so empty. And sometimes it feels like it isn't real, whatever 'it' is.  And it's weird because I can switch to feeling so powerful really quickly. Like I'm a god. Mood swings have always been my thing, I can go from feeling amazing to feeling like shit with one shit comment from my sister. It just feels so profoundly *empty*. There's no other word I know. I used to cut myself. I stopped about six months ago, but my sister said something really bad about how she saved me and shouldn't have and all that crap, and I did it again. And I don't have anyone to talk to because I can't really hold a friendship and I don't want my mom to feel bad.",23Oct2020,1
40,"The recent covid-19 pandemic and my 1 year therapy session has slowly uncover some of the ugly things I have in my life.

I used to be a very funny guy and didn't had any care in the world. But my life slowly became a constant race to the top. I was a high achiever in my previous company. But my mental health was in jeopardy, and I got fired because I couldn't sustain the performance and handling the stress of the sales job.

My therapist talked to me about having a low self esteem after a terrible betrayal by my ex when I was 19 years old. She got pregnant with another man whom she met at work. I got so triggered that I felt that I must be successful to prove my worth and be accepted. I had been living in this mentality for almost 10 years. I'm 28 this year. In fact, I completely forgotten about the breakup but turns out it carved a really deep scar in my mind.

Now I'm trying to look for a job with slower pace so that I can feel like breathing again. I rarely travel back to my hometown to see my parents, when I'm having dinner with my lover I'm always thinking about how to achieve more in work. I want to slow down to put things into perspective again.",23Oct2020,1
41,"I've been depressed on and off since early middle school, first became suicidal since the eighth grade and diagnosed with major disorder in the 9th. I'm graduated last spring and battled depression at least every week for the last four years or so even after several medications, therapists, and councilors. Do I have to live with this for the rest of my life? Is it a me problem? I am open to all answers.",23Oct2020,1
42,"I highly doubt I’m a sociopath, have antisocial personality disorder or anything like that, because I frequently display levels of empathy I rarely see out of other people, but my interest in getting to know people or make friends is practically zero. 

I’m not curious about other people, typically if I want to reach out to anyone it’s only to vent about my own problems. I’m completely unconcerned with the lives of anyone else, their hobbies/interests, etc. and asking about these things feels more like a chore/interview than something I actually enjoy. I’ve had coworkers invite me out for drinks before, but I feel like more enjoyment and utility can be had just going home and watching YouTube. 

What I do want, however, is a boyfriend/husband, but even then I have the same issue of feigning interest in what they have to say. It seems like what drives me to talk to them is purely sexual or something. I can’t force myself to care about who they are or what their interests are unless it’s an opportunity to talk about myself. 

I don’t know why I feel this way. As stated in the title, I’ve never really had friends (even as a kid) and do everything by myself. At times I do lament not having friends, but I think that’s more of an ego thing and a result of people making me feel inadequate for not having them. I would really like some insight on what this might mean, if I just haven’t found my type of people, if this is common among the depressed or what.",23Oct2020,1
43,"Just need to vent. I’ve been worried about my partner all day. I have a feeling they went to bed triggered and woke up still in an emotional flashback. 

I worked my ass off today (I picked up more work so they would have time to start to process their trauma without having to worry about our livelihood), so I’m already emotionally spent. And now that it’s so late they are tired too and probably hungry because nobody had the wherewithal to make dinner, and it’s just a full on flashback now. 

I can tell by how they’re looking at me that they’re not really seeing me. They’re seeing the person who abused them for their entire childhood. I wear my emotions on my sleeve, so it’s clear that I’m frustrated, even though I’m frustrated with the situation and not my partner. But all that does is further convince them that they’re in danger, because they’re just seeing their angry abuser 30 years ago. Not me. Based on past experience I don’t think they would be able to tell me what city, state or year we’re in. 

At this point I don’t think I can help them ground. And, they’ve also told me after similar episodes that sometimes it’s easier to stay in the past than to deal with their current emotional state. (Processing trauma sucks, that’s the entire point of dissociation. It’s a coping mechanism.)

I’m just so angry that someone could hurt another person so badly that this happens. And angry that I can’t do a damn thing about it. And pissed at myself for being so pissed, and blaming myself for saying stupid things, not saying helpful things, working too hard, not working hard enough.

As the partner of a survivor of CSA, physical abuse, and emotional abuse. I’m just feeling today that “too much is never enough.”

I wish they weren’t hurting so much. I wish this would stop happening to both of us. It’s so fucking frustrating not being able to explain to someone that it’s not 1989 and that we’re hundreds of miles away from where they think we are. 

I also feel hella alone. My therapist tried to put me in touch with a family support group, but I’m messed up enough that I had imposter syndrome for like two days after the first zoom meeting I attended. 

Anyway. That’s my vent. Hope someone out there is having a better evening than me, sitting here feeling sorry for myself while my partner is virtually re-experiencing the ninth circle of hell out in the living room.",23Oct2020,1
44,"I grew up with a single abusive mother and a deadbeat bad who left when I was 6. I never had the drinking, drugs, promiscuity kinda of outlets/phases late a lot of kids do. I've always tried my best to be extra nice, never come across as angry or frustrated to avoid coming across as aggressive or inconvenient to others. But I've always been super anxious and afraid of people yelling at me or going off at me ever since. In response to this, I've battled with depression, anxiety, self harm and an eating disorders up until my adult life. From the outside, I look like a perfectly normal and high functioning adult. 

I've always had a rocky relationship with my sister. She grew up in a different household and does not have the same parents as above. Basically she is hyper sensitive to criticism but has no qualms dishing it out to others. The last few years I've tried to tread carefully near her so not to offend her or make her unhappy with me. About a month before my wedding my sister completely ripped into me saying she always hated me and said I was always making her miserable. This was in response to me sending her a message I sent asking her for more help with the wedding (organising a bridal tea).

She said I was always being overly critical of her and that she had a fear that I would always control her life with her children (she did not have children at this point). She said that I was selfish and always made everything about myself without helping her. I told her I would help but I that couldn't help if she didnt tell me what was wrong. She said that she gives hints, and that I should know she doesn't like sharing things (note, we're adults and don't live at home together).

I apologised profusely and said I would change. I said I was sorry and I didn't know I was making her feel that way. I was begging her to forgive me, and saying I could change. Looking back at it, I was pretty pathetic. In the end it was resolved by me saying I would change and apologising while I asked her not to accuse me of stuff I hadn't done yet (i.e. The kids thing) Now whenever I see her (we're both adults living out of home) I get super anxious. I worry that everything I say or do will offend her so I just try to focus on only good things and be very supportive and not mention my life. I honestly don't love her anymore but don't want to cause conflict or make her feel bad.

Any how. Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this. Or if it came across as too much of a rant.",23Oct2020,1
45,"Hello Reddit! Not sure if I can post this kind of thing, so mods please feel free to delete or message me to delete if it’s not allowed...

&amp;#x200B;

 I’m seeking assistance for a friend who lives in Wales (I live on the other side of the world from him). He believes he might have BPD, or something similar, but an NHS mental health assessor basically told him “it’s too complicated” to pursue a diagnosis, and would not assess him or give him any assistance to find someone who would diagnose him.

&amp;#x200B;

As many of us know all too well, sometimes the diagnosis portion is the biggest hurdle...the fact that he mustered up the courage to finally contact a mental health service for an assessment was pretty brave and nervewracking already, but now that they refused to assist, it’s like he’s back at square one...

&amp;#x200B;

I’m worried about him, and I know he’s in distress, so I offered to ask around for help (it’s sadly all I can do right now). Does anyone know of a psychiatrist in Wales (he says Cardiff area preferably) who can diagnose personality disorders? Preferably inexpensive, but at this point, any info at all helps. He was hoping that the mental health service could get him in contact with someone, but if they don’t change their mind, he is willing to find the funds to go to a private practice. All my friend is looking for is assistance to pursue getting a diagnosis and then get the help he needs.",23Oct2020,1

47,"I was hoping someone could figure out why this habit has persisted my entire life. Ever since I was quite young (5 maybe?) I’ve been spinning around and around to songs I like. I usually wear headphones and listen to the same songs over and over until eventually I grow tired of them. I’m in my 30s and I’ve been doing this consistently my entire life. No one knows. I do it in the privacy of the washroom or closet. I can do it for hours and I basically disassociate / live in an alternate reality / daydream. I don’t think it interferes with my daily life much because I work, I’m married and have friends etc. However, I do think I initially started doing it because I was lonely and misunderstood. Many times during my life, my social life was shitty so I disappeared into this amazing fantasy world by spinning. 

Can anyone explain to me why I’ve been doing this my entire life? Is it stimming? Could I be high functioning autistic? (I was always very shy socially growing up. Now I’m alright).

48,"When everyone on the outside looks at me they see “success.” They see a medical student. They see a kid who came from nothing, overcame all the odds and made something of himself. A person who runs marathons and triathlons, trains MMA, always dancing, plays guitar. They see a kid who is bubbly, outgoing, the loudest in room, the person who could make friends and conversation with a brick wall. They see a kid who loves everyone around him so much there’s no way he isn’t happy, he’s “perfect”. Every-time someone from home messages me congratulating me on some thing they don’t know the truth, that it is all a front and I hate myself. They are nothing but activities I do and fill my day to try to make myself feel whole and human. That maybe, just maybe, if I love everyone around me enough I will feel something. I am so fucked up. I have crippling depression, anxiety, and have struggled with suicide for a decade . People don’t see the scars of sexual abuse as a child. They don’t see that nearly every person I have loved unconditionally as a child and in my adult life has left me or hurt me and that has left a huge fear of trusting anyone. If I fail. I fail, I have no backup plan. No one to run to. I kept moving forward despite how horrible I felt about myself. The pressure from society and stigma on men not allowed to struggle kept it within me. Well this caught up to me. 2020 has kicked me in the face. Being locked in a room because of corona spiraled me out of control. I lost all my outlets. And I failed my first year of medical school and have to repeat. I failed. At my life goal. All the work and time I invested for what? I told myself I was a failure. Then Life was cruel again to teach me this lesson. From summer to October it seemed like I may be okay. I’m doing well in school. I met this incredible person who Made me believe I could trust another human fully again. Then October happened. My mom is in the ICU, we were informed she was a goner. I travel to be with my family and don’t touch school in weeks. The stress is heavy. Then  two days after I think I am saying good bye to my mom I get blind sided and left by that person mentioned before. I was in disbelief that someone I let in and trusted could do something so inconsiderate to me at this specific time in my life where I really needed her and I was devastated. It was the final straw and I completely shattered from the years of internalizing. I could not fail another med school year and that drove me to Learn something. It is okay to reach out. And I made it through it becasue of it. People do love me and anything other than that is a lie. As a guy there is so much stigma to asking for help. I learned that it is okay to not be okay. To ask for help is okay and everything we do we cannot do alone. So if you ever need to talk to someone. Cry, vent, scream. I am here at all hours of the day. Your trauma does not define you and you can do it. Go get help. Take it from me. The abuse survivor. The depressed kid. The repeat medical student. Becasue for once in my life i can truly say I am okay. I am fulfilling my life goal and have wonderful people in my corner. I know I am worth loving.

49,"i’m a 15 y/o male sophomore in high school. i guess i’m doing alright. i have a lot of stuff outside of school on my shoulders and i really miss my friends but that’s besides the point. online school has been incredibly demotivating for me. it feels ten times more stressful than normal school. i’m tired, and unmotivated, or maybe i’m just lazy. i want to say i’m trying my best but i just don’t know if that’s true. school is going so hard on me and it doesn’t seem they’re gonna be giving us any leeway due to this pandemic. grading us like how school normally would. i’m failing my physics class, i don’t think i got a good teacher this year. the amount of work he gives me is actually insane, and i haven’t done work for that class since september. signed up for a video production class last year, before all this pandemic stuff happened. a mistake. i don’t have the energy to film my boring and uneventful life right now. this class would usually be easier in school. i just can’t do it.
the only people i talk to are a group of friends on playstation. they started to attend my school this year, they’re freshmen. i was really looking forward to having them there in real life. my friends are my prime motivator in school. 
but one of them makes me feel pretty stupid. he talks about how easy things are for him, and how easy things should be for me. him and i are different. he’s quite the introvert, and he’s at peace being home everyday with his playstation. i’m more in the middle. i like my alone time but i love my friends more than anything in the world. i got tired of being at home a month or two after quarantine. 
my parents don’t give me the support i need either. they just don’t understand, they make me feel stupid too. they have their own stresses. it’s whatever.

And i get some praise from my parents. I get an A, ""Good""! But it just doesnt feel like enough. Like i know this is extremely unrealistic but i feel like people dont know how ""great"" i am.

Ive litteraly had dreams (when im really sad) about just everyone going wow OP youre so smart and great thanks for carrying out team or our school in the math competition( i did this once)
Now i know what this is, this is narcisicim because ive litteraly wished sometimes that everybody praises me and such. 
But the weird thing is, i don't think im all that. I think very poorly of myself because of my social inadequacies. I feel so frustrated because im not like my friends.

54,"I’m 18 and in college in Hawaii. Not only am I running out of the money my job at target gave me back home in Colorado due to the high costs of groceries, food, and necessities here, but I need physical therapy now more urgently than ever. I’m a pre-PT student so instead of going crazy on the terminology I’ll just say I have uneven musculature on my left and right sides, very tight and rounded shoulders, and a large curve on my upper back towards the back, and a curve on my lower back towards the front, making working out so unbearable and daily activities painful. I’ve started losing all fucking hope to become a personal trainer/physical therapist because 1. I have really bad BDD, and 2. How the hell can I fix someone else if my problems are so severe I haven’t been able to fix them (I’ve watched hundreds of YouTube videos, done all the stretches and corrective exercises, been through past PT, nothing helps). Once again, being in Hawaii, it’s both more expensive to do physical therapy (especially for an 18 year old with no job) and it doesn’t make sense, as I’ll be returning home to study from home in December and transferring to an instate school for the fall semester.

That being said, I have the same issues with therapy. I know this isn’t a subreddit full of licensed psychologists/psychiatrists, so I’m not gonna go out and list my issues, but that BDD and the actual real body issues I have are just surface level. The pain is so fucking deep from everything else - every day I get closer and closer to suicide but thinking about what that would do to my girlfriend, my two best friends since I’ve had over half my life, and my family - I can’t even comprehend. My biggest fear is death - I’m so afraid that there’s nothing after this, so that also keeps me from doing it, so essentially I’m stuck in this limbo state of constant fucking pain and sadness with the realization I don’t have the willpower to kill myself and so I have to deal with the fucking agony every day, both physically and mentally. To top that all off, not only am I stuck on how I’d be able to afford physical therapy which isn’t even worth it to do until I’m back home, but how the hell am I gonna afford therapy with that? Also, why would I even get a therapist here if I’m going back home? 

If I’m being real, I have about $1000 left in the bank. Weekly I spend about $75-100+ (some weeks far less, some weeks slightly more) due to laundry, necessities, and groceries associated with the extreme high cost due to importation here in hawaii. I don’t see how I could fit in therapy, and then physical therapy later on, also knowing I’m gonna be going home in ~2 months. 
I am just so far gone with this pain. I’ve never been so fucking depressed and sad in my entire life. I love the hikes and beaches on this island but every fucking day I fake a smile and destroy my mental even more with the workload of a pre-PT student. Please help me.",23Oct2020,1

Today I was napping with the light on and when I woke up there was blood on my sheets— not a lot so I wasn’t scared I just thought I had a little cut or something, but it wasn’t there and it was a hallucination.

58,"I recently had to start working again, with us unemployment situation I didn’t have a choice, but I feel I got fairly lucky landing a minimum wage job that is overall p nice. It’s a fairly antisocial job (a plus for me) of just organizing and putting away magic cards. Nothing excited or capable of bringing me joy in itself  far from my long term passion of art, but it isn’t horrible or hurtful in of itself and it’ll pay the bills 

However, I have already had to call out twice due to lack of motivation and finding myself crying and locked into my bed by my own head. I feel as though each day I go to work I am pushing myself past my personal limits, in some hope that by the end of the day I’ll have a chance to reset my mental energy for say.

The best way I’ve found to explain it is through a weird analogy so bear with me. It’s like in some video games where if you continue to sprint after your stamina is run out it’ll start taking from your hp bar. That is how working currently feels for me. Except no safe spot to stop and regenerate my stamina ever comes. I keep thinking and hoping it will, I constantly look forward to the weekend hopefully but always wind up disappointed and depressed when I realize I did not reset at all and I’m about to have to do another five days on empty

And so Im trying to mitigate it on many fronts, I’ll be talking to my hr and seeing about possibly working 1 less day a week but I feel the more direct way to improve this situation for me is to find a better way to reset after each day/ week. I’ve been working once every other week with my therapist on this to no avail yet. I’ve mostly been focused on finding and enjoying things I find fun and trying to do more of them, minimizing time wasted after work in exchange for playing more video games or hanging with friends. 

Video games are okay in the moment, a decent distraction when I’m alone and if I have friends online available (though I rarely do) it can be a genuinely fun time. But even still it doesn’t leave me revitalized or what not.

I also have a strong passion for digital art, specifically character design, though I’ve been struggling to get myself to draw in my free time and the few times I do becomes frustrating as I’m out of practice and unable to progress on any projects of mine.

Lastly I try to do more direct relaxation type things, like meditation or simply quiet time but that seems rare and far in between as I struggle quite a lot to convince myself to do it. My brain switches into “oh that sounds boring why do that when I could just go play X video game “

I’m just unsure what will actually help me refresh between each day/ week, all these I’ve listed don’t seem to be enough. How do I approach this.

61,"I have a bad upbringing and a lot of bad things happened but whe are they really as bas as I thought? My parents separated when I was 4 and all the anger that my mother had for my father all ended up being released on me. My mother would beat me for even the slightest things and my siblings weren't of any help either, always just watching while i was beat and my elder brother(My only brother) even joining in and started beating me along with my mother. My sister(Youngest of 3 sisters) always trying to humiliate me and discriminate against me for reasons unknown to me. My eldest 2 sisters where of no help to the situation, the second eldest always watched without interfering and the eldest one was always partying around not leaving time to spend with family. I never thought much of it and thought it always happened to the youngest member of the family until I grew up a bit and started to understand it wasn't the case. I remember there was this one time where I tried to reach out to the teachers at my school but all they did was make it worse after calling my mother to tell her I spoke to them about the abuse. I got home to a fierce beating after getting dragged up the stairs by my hair and getting my head slammed repeatedly against the wall. I thought about fighting back but I was only 7 at the time so I did not have the physical strength to fight back.

Recently all those feelings and anger that I had repressed for all thise years is finally exploding and I feel myself being angrier for the smallest things or I find myself crying because of the sudden realizations that I've never been loved and I probably never will be. I've been having rare and sudden thoughts telling me me to kill them for all they've done to me but I can't bring myself to try and kill. These thought have been appearing for the last year and I've been trying to keep acting like I don't have those thoughts about killing them. I don't want to turn into a monster and end up killing someone so I've thought that suicide was the best solution but I'm scared. These feelings and thoughts have been appearing for the last year and I've been acting as if it's normal to have these kinds of thoughts.  Everytime I think about how bad it's getting I always end up thinking that it isn't a big deal and I'll get over it someday but it's getting worse. Is it really that bad? Is it really a thing to be concerned about? I don't know how to judge this anymore, I always try and downplay it saying that it isn't anything compared to what other people are going through and I don't have the right to get help for something so minor but I think it's getting worse and worse by the day. Even if I csn get help do I even deserve it? I thought about killing people and that is a sin even god couldn't forgive. I just don't want to turn into a monster but I feel that monster hatching and starting to grow. Is suicide the best solution to this? It seems like that is all I can do but even so I am scared. I am scared of leaving this world without having ever been loved or ever feeling the warmth of a loved one. I'm scared of dying and not leaving a single trace of my existence as if I was never even alive. I don't know what to do but I know I can't go to a doctor for help cause they'll think I'm crazy and lock me up. I'm running out if options and I think suicide will be the only way out",23Oct2020,1

I posted on reddit a couple days ago about a relationship trouble, my partner saw it and saw how absolutely slating everyone was. It hurt them and it wasn’t my intention. All I wanted was advice and comfort (seeking it in the wrong place I reckon, should’ve trusted my partner) and it turned into something awful for them. One small issue has now blown up into a huge issue. 

The level of shame, embarrassment and humiliation I feel is unreal. I thought I was being so hard done by but I was severely misguided, they weren’t as bad, unloving or uncaring as I thought - or my brain has led me to believe. My partner has been so supportive all along, they just roll a nat 1 on speech sometimes and phrase things a bit wrongly even though that’s not their intention. 

I feel like I’ve screwed everything up. Why are my emotions so strong? Why do I feel such a need to have reassurance in my thoughts and feelings? Why do I have periods where I get super needy?

68,"never run away from your flaws at an early age. you will give up on even looking at yourself afterwards.

Im still in college and i live with 2 girls in mid to late 30s. When i moved here i was still in a low place in my mind. I was intimidated with one of them because she was pretty, studying, working part time, taking care of herself.
After living with them for a few months and self reflecting on my flaws and what i should do to move on, i can see clearly.

These 2 have nothing going on in their lives. No career goal, no plan for their lives, no stable job or plans to find one, no hobbies except watching loud shows on tv and eating and drinking booz. On top of that they are lazy, wont clean after themselves and will run away from the weekly house cleaning. Even if they do it they will sweep the dust under the rug per say. Will eat 200 dollars of food each per week and will say they have no money, will use my shit and hide theirs. Wont add any value to the house but will be entitled the things you buy. They are empty.

They are literally waiting for a man to take them foward. This is the first time im seeing a female loser.2 of them at the same time. They have nothing to offer except their pussy.

69,"Long story short I had two major traumas in my childhood: my father was an alcoholic/drug abuser during my Adolescence and my best friend's dad killed their mom when we were 17. I never sought out help and fell into a destructive pattern until I was in my mid twenties when I began to clean up my act, re enrolled in school (psychology), and gradually stopped using drugs. Time went by, I had some dysfunctional relationships (mostly my fault) and eventually landed in a healthy relationship a little over a year ago. 

I've done alot of work on myself, or so I thought...

I don't use drugs anymore (aside from psychedelics on occasion), I drink once a week, and quit smoking pot entirely 2 weeks ago (I had been smoking 2/3 times a week). I'm halfway through my first semester at my dream graduate program working towards becoming a therapist. 

Since the semester began I've been struggling to retain the info, participate regularly in class, share coherent thoughts, and I know I am capable of meeting these standards. I've been experiencing severe anxiety in classes presenting content that challenges my emotional equilibrium. Complexes, self states, false selves, impasses, repression, resistance, disassociation, the just goes on... To make matters worse we're on zoom which makes me feel isolated and alone. More self conscious about what I'm saying because I'm not feeling the room or connecting with others outside of class as regularly. 

I have never been to therapy but can't afford even $40 a month because I'm in school and my hours at work are cut severely. My grandma was just diagnosed with alzheimer's last week and I'm trying to be supportive to my family. But I'm falling apart.

Today I broke down in my dyad and never regrouped. In my next class I shared the feeling and it immediately triggered an overwhelming sense of grief. I had to sign off, I didn't know what to do. I called out of work, my professor was worried about me, but I was too overcome to stop and regroup. 

I spent from noon to 7 crying, sobbing, talking myself through the feelings. Now I don't know what to do... I feel guilty for leaving class and not being open but I also needed to care for myself as I was sobbing uncontrollably. 

I need emotional support but feel like it's impossible to get. I started looking at 12 step group therapy for children of alcoholics. I've reached out and explained what happened to my professor. I just feel raw, burnt, and totally unsettled. I live in the bay area and was wondering if anyone has any suggestions for low cost therapy, group therapy, anything that could serve as a emotional support during this passage in my life.",23Oct2020,1
70,"Hi all, 

  I would first like to address that I am a lifelong sufferer of anxiety and depression. I was diagnosed with Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Major Depression when I was about thirteen (I am eighteen now) years of age. Two years ago, on 13 August, I suffered a Traumatic Brain Injury. I continue to deal with the implications to this day. All three are getting the best of me. I can’t even hide my sadness anymore. My face constantly looks drained and my eyes lifeless. Due to the tbi and my perfectionism (can thank anxiety for that), academics are extremely challenging for me. I am taking a couple online courses at a junior college and I’m falling behind. I can physically feel myself gradually becoming weaker. My crippling insomnia (tbi) only worsens my health. I consider myself to be in a pretty suicidal mindset. This being that I selfishly do not care to stick around for others anymore, which was my main reason for continued existence. I am just so exhausted. Sleep is my only release from the inner turmoil I experience. I long for eternal sleep.

74,"I woke to my family saying happy birthday. My brother (who lives in a different state) sent me a nice, practical gift. My mum got me a cake and money so I could buy a nice dress for my 21st birthday brunch. My sister gave me my present (an ADHD workbook that I desperately wanted) earlier in the year. We took a lot of photos together. I then went to a desert place to have brunch with my friends and then we went to an escape room. I brought their birthday presents with me and gave it to them since I didn't give it to them earlier in the year. My favourite artist (Ariana Grande) released her new single on my birthday. I had a good time with everyone but it's the 'in between moments' when I'm alone that makes me wanna cry my eyes out. After my mum took all the photos, I started getting ready to go out with my friends and that's when it hit me: I'm still a piece of shit. I'm 21 with no job or drivers licence. I promised my brother that I would do both of those things and I've made little to no  progress with either of these goals.  All I do is take. My mum is an older woman with health issues. I need to step up for her and I've done a piss poor job of doing that. I'm still relying on her for money even though she's on medical leave.

(Sorry for shitty english, 3rd language).

Im normally a lurker but I kind of need some perspective right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ive had a couple of years of pretty heavy stressload (Due to shit happening around me) which led to bad sleep. Over the years the stress has reduced and I got some help to deal with my sleeping issues and that has been my main focus the last 2 years. Now that Im almost stress free and my sleep has improved a lot but some odd shit has been happening to my body.

&amp;#x200B;

First off: Im sooo much more tired then when I didnt sleep, Im thinking its my body finally being able to communicate wtf is up and that it needs rest but other than that I cant figure out why Im so tired. 

Second and the biggest issue for me is that I kind dont feel that much emotions but I tend to get reactions. If someone tells me to fuck off Id instantly react like Im angry but I dont feel anger. Same goes for positive situations, if I win something or do something well I automaticly cheer or act as a happy person should do but I dont really feel it(Execept for sometimes).

I mostly have postive thoughts, I go to the gym (I dont feel GREAT  after working out, its pretty plain but I know its good so I keep doing it). I have a girlfriend who I love, a good job, I have often thinking positive and I do try new stuff but my emotions rarely show up, good or bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Im tired as fk even tho I started sleeping better. I dont really feel emotions but my body acts accordingly like I do. So I act scared if something scary happens but I dont feel it when I start thinking about it.

I spoke to a therapist about this and she didnt think it was depression but me rather me being unable to tap in into my emotions. Ive but 100s of hours in mediatation and still it doesnt seem to help.

89,"Hi all! Please excuse my poor English. Thanks.

So to the point. I've been struggling with childhood trauma recently. I thought I had healed through the years but recent incident unlocked all my emotions and fears once again and it all hit me like a tornado. I've been struggling with that for the past year or so, reading a lot about it, trying to meditate, etc but so far no joy. Went to CBT for a few months but it didn't do anything for me. Also tried counselling which helped me figure where some of my issues and mental struggles are coming from but didn't really help me to cope.

I've been struggling more and more lately. It's affecting my physical, mental and emotional health all at once. I started drinking heavily as it's the only thing that helps me relax and maybe forget for a moment but that just added liver pain to my list. I really don't want to get myself into hospital or worse so I thought it's time to find another way to deal with my trauma. So I started looking into alternative ways and that's how I found out about RTT.

Unfortunately, my online research didn't give any results. I only find sites of rtt therapists. There's testimonials but I don't feel like they are reliable source of information. I also found a few articles but can't say I blindly trust them either. So I thought I'd try here. 

I understand that most people will quickly dismiss it as a scam. And I am myself on the fence. But I'm really interested in the opinions of people who have tried it themselves and whether they have found it helpful at all. Hopefully, there will be at least a few here!

90,"It's gonna be long, I'm sorry lol

I'm not a native English speaker so if something is unclear please ask!

Ok first of all, I never got a diagnosis, and put that in the title to be brief. To be honest, I think I might have it, but I would never dare to say something like ""oh yeah, I'm depressed"" knowing the struggles that an ill person actually goes through (one of my best friends has been in therapy since she was like, 13, we're both 20 now) I'm gonna call her Jerry.
We both have another close friend in common, whis is a guy. We're gonna call him Tom.
I'm also a girl.

To give you a little bit of context:
It's been more or less two years that I struggle with anxiety, and I got medication from my family doctor, and that helped a lot, although I sometimes still have anxiety attacks.
I've been having suicidal thoughts since March of this year, and it was before the pandemic and lockdown, so that really didn't help much either
I've lost all interest in everything I love/d and just get through each day procrastinating.
Honestly right now, I don't see the point in continuing to live.
It's fucking scary.

Those two friends of mine have known this since March, and every now and then, I knew they were there, and I shared pretty much everything that was going on.
Honestly, they kept me here.

I know that I have to look for a therapist or things are gonna get even worse (here healthcare is free, so it would not be a money problem) but I'm kinda scared of therapy at the moment.
And as I said, I don't really feel like doing anything, it's just like I don't care.
I know I have to do things, but I can't be bothered.

To be short, a couple nights ago I wrote on my journal, as I always do when I find myself to be particularly sad, and decided to send it to them, and I'm not gonna deny it, I thought about it, and I realized I did it because I wanted someone to tell me ""oh poor thing, there there""; instead I received a little bit of tough love from Jerry, which honestly I needed, but I found Tom to be cold, and just honestly pissed off.
We have been fighting a lot in the past month or so, so I knew something was off.

All of this was through texts and God I hate it
I was thrown off and said ""aight I'm not gonna tell you anything anymore""
So they were like ""nooo you have to, absolutely""
And I said that I would, as I always did, but at that time there was really no point in answering the question ""how are you"".
The next day (which is yesterday) Jerry apologized and said she was too worried. I said I understood, I was just in a really bad mood.
Tom just said ""yeah, but you have to call (the therapy centre or something like that)""
I replied ""I know, but I wasn't talking about that now""
I received an ""ok"" as an answer.
That pissed me off a lot to be honest, but I decided to just let it go.

Later, Jerry tells me she has been talking with Tom after I went to sleep. I tell her ""oh yes spill the tea""
She sends me a screenshot of their chat
Tom said some things referring to me talking about my problems ""when you listen to that the first time, you help her, the second time, same, the third, same, but the 736484 time you get tired, like, you can't just sit still and say I'm depressed here and I'm depressed there you have to do something"".
Yes, that's the actual number he wrote.

I feel like my translation doesn't do it justice lol
So yeah, I felt betrayed, also because I did ask him, if I bothered him, if it was too much, and he always said ""it's okay, of course"". It's not like I didn't imagine it, but I know it for sure now and it's sad. I'm just disappointed.

I want to try and fix this though, because I really care about him and we had a really great relationship.
I mean, that is one of my problems. I even struggle in finishing to read a book. It's not that easy to just call a therapist, go there, talk with a stranger, etc. Did I say I'm also an introvert? So yeah.

I don't think I'm wrong, honestly. If I am, by all means, tell me.

TL;DR: My best friend told me to just ""do something about my depression"" and now I'm even more sad, how do I fix it?",23Oct2020,1

92,"I made a post about this in the past because I really dislike how mental health awareness tries to portray to mental health in general. I know that awareness is not an easy thing to do and to structure complicated mechanics of years of research into bite sized portions for everyone to understand is not easy.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet at the same time, I really dislike the common approach that I see on how mental health awareness is portrayed.

Too many times I see it too heavily romanticised that it omits the human element of the subject - the complicated parts, the difficult parts, the ugly parts. It feels as though you are replacing one label with another like the autistic person who has to be good in something but that person could be anything, not necessarily a genius or an artist.

I hate how modern media portrays mental health is this overly good thing where there are potential and beauty. There is to some extent and there is definitely some good or beauty or use from it but only if you know how to use it right and acknowledge the bad or more complicated side of mental health. I find this to be too overly cheesy and too good to be be true and it is not progressive at all and overly shields the person from acknowledging and making sense of the bad side of mental health and making peace with it.

I find this to be simple marketing that gives people the wrong message especially to those who are not familiar with mental health.

&amp;#x200B;

And that being said, at the same time, mental health is a very, very, very complicated issue.

There is politics involved, ethics, biology, social factors and culture, personal beliefs and ideals, bureaucracy, economics and so on.

Even human psychology how we interpret it is very complicated and not every psychologist and scientist thinks the same way. 

And the implementation of all these practices on a large social scale is not easy either.

&amp;#x200B;

Working in a social work environment, there are loads of restrictions, stresses, expectations, bureaucracy, and even human errors that can interfere with someone's work like bias or stress.

It feels as though we are giving these people mixed messages where we are trying to be as humanistic as possible but also incredibly cold and distant.

Follow the rules. Do what we tell you is right. Good parts are good. Bad parts are bad. Rules are rules. Laws are absolute. And so on.

&amp;#x200B;

It feels as though there is little room for autonomy or empowerment or even validation of the other human of what he/she is, whether that part is good, bad or otherwise given that people come all shapes and sizes.

And I realised that this is a problem on a global scale in social workloads of stresses and demands, people who are not given enough training or time to care for their clients, little distribution of resources on what is desired like people in residential care or people with co-dependency.

&amp;#x200B;

It does not feel as though these services are meant to be there to help these people and empower them but more like this mixed message of a cold and instant business or factory that is structured to condition people in a certain way like a part of a machine and that's it; or making the situation more complicated because different disciplines have different protocols or different people in a multi-disciplinary team think differently or certain niches in law or rule or ethic is making the situation more complicated. 

&amp;#x200B;

It really puts a lot of pressure for both the people who are seeking help and also the people who try to give this help and it feels as though both sides of the story are getting mixed messages when they are trying to achieve the same goal - a good sense of well-being",23Oct2020,1
93,"I’ve realized there’s no real place for me in this world.

I’m sorry for being what I am, I truly am. I honestly wish I could kill myself but I’ve tried many times before and guess what...

I was hoping she could help me with coping skills and help me work through my feelings. So far the sessions have just been her asking how my week has gone and i tell her about my feelings.

And I'm worried this is gonna keep going.  Hopefully it'll end when the pandemic ends, but who knows?  I'm terrified that society's gonna fall apart, I'm struggling to care about anything for long enough to keep even one class in check, I'm terrified my roommate is gonna flip on me and kick me out even though I know that there's no reason to worry about that, I've been even more depersonalized than usual, I'm worried my mental health is going to keep spiraling until it kills me, and meanwhile, I'm horribly underdiagnosed.  (Current diagnoses include depression, anxiety, and other specified traumatic disorder.  I've got a few hypotheses for what my therapists are missing, including BPD and cPTSD.)  And meanwhile, I can't even cook for myself consistently, so I'm bleeding my account dry relying on Doordash, so it's only a matter of time before I starve.  And I can't even handle the forms for my social welfare, so I guess I'm gonna starve.

And I can't move back in with my parents, because ... they'll yell at me, then insist that they don't yell at me, and then insist that it's not actually traumatic, and then insist that I deserve to be traumatized because I made some minor screw-up and am way too sensitive (while ignoring the neurodivergences that they refuse to accommodate).  Also when I came out as transgender they tried to stop me by withholding their money.  And when I come to them with a physical health concern I have to actively convince them to get me the care I need.  And when I use diagonstic terms they yell at me for overmedicalizing, but when I try to use common terms they yell at me for not communicating clearly enough.  And they don't respect my boundaries, at all.  So yeah, they aren't an option.

112,"If anyone knows of a support sub for people who were isolated, abandoned, and neglected please let me know. I know the r/emotionalneglect sub but idk if this would fit there since it’s both emotional and physical. I haven’t really ever met anyone else who was just completely isolated like I was. 

I was neglected from a very young age in all aspects. My parents homeschooled us (all 9 kids) and eventually drifted to “free schooling” which was just them being too lazy to actually teach us anything. We lived on a broken down farm out in the middle of nowhere. My mom would shut herself away for weeks and even months on end in her bedroom while my dad worked 3 jobs 7 days a week so she could “homeschool us” and “give us a better education than those evil public schools.” There was absolutely ZERO exposure to the outside world so it wouldn’t “corrupt” us. We didn’t actually have school, we didn’t have friends, we didn’t have TV because that was “evil” and any modern music was also forbidden. I grew up in a very “little house on the prairie “ way out in the middle of nowhere but without the warm loving family part. 

I’ve been pretty fucked up from it for most of my life and finally starting to feel somewhat “normal.” But I realized something recently about why I don’t seem to be able to maintain social circles. One is obviously because I had ZERO practice on social communication until age 17-18. So I didn’t know how to act around people. But also, since I was so freaking sheltered from the world I was as ignorant and naive as a 5 year old! I didn’t know basic basic things like what a freshman/sophomore/junior/senior meant. I didn’t know what calculus was and had little to know knowledge of algebra or any other school subject for that matter. There were so many words people used that I would just not understand and stare at them blankly like an idiot. 

Now that I’m 27, I’ve been able to more or less get myself educated on the world and un-isolate myself. But to avoid the awkward stares or the finger pointing and laughing at me when I didn’t know something, after a time I developed a habit of just nodding along even if I didn’t understand. I pretended to know and would laugh or say “oh wow that’s crazy” and avoid the endless mockery. But I still fall into that habit if I don’t know something, even if it’s OK to not know it! I can’t distinguish between if it’s something I should know already, or if it’s an opportunity to learn something new and be humble and honest about my ignorance on the subject. So I pretend to know it. Which then comes across to people like I’m full of it and a know-it-all, despite the fact I feel like I’m the least knowledgeable person in the room! 

I’m scared to admit things and if it IS something I should have known, people ask why and don’t let it go.I hate that, I don’t want to tell people about my awful past. I don’t want looks of pity I want to be viewed as a normal person. But I can’t seem to get out of my own way.

123,I feel sad for most of the time. If I am not sad then i am bad minded. I do not want to wake up. I go to school and wait for ot to end. Most of the time I am anxious there and have no real friends. Beside from my girlfriend I have no friends at all. And this is my fault because I have no drive to meet anyone nor do anything. I just feel like doing nothing. Sometimes i run and then i feel better. But that id not always the case. When I was younger I trained handball and was very dedicated to it. Still I remember being numb and   sad at the time. I am in last year of school and having my finals in a  few months but can not get motivated enough to study. I also lost interest in sex. I have no interest in nothing. Doing everyday stuff like keeping hygene or tyding my room is hard. I worked my summer holiday and even though I was with my girlfriend I felt anxious. I was nervous and felt scared and unsafe because it was another city and i knew no one. The best way to describe it all is that my basic state of mind is being sad and it has been this way for a long time. Should I seek help?,23Oct2020,1

125,So i work for a copay assistance program so I basically answer phones all day. Its easy to do but I began to notice that for some on the serious medications that we cover deny patients enrolled in Medicare or Medicade with no alternative ways to find them assistance so it usually ends up with hearing the disappointment in their voice or get yelled at or hear them describe the horrible pain that they will endure or how they are going into debt for something they need. This has started making me noticed im slipping back into my depression to a point where my meds won't work. So I was thinking of leaving and trying to apply for a QA tester at Epic games they are looking for full time and they pay more than what I make now. Any suggestions?,23Oct2020,1
126,"I don’t care if no one responds like usual. I just need to express myself. My mental health is not very good right now. My bf shut himself off from the world for two weeks because everything just became too overwhelming for him. I can’t blame him though. School and work has been taking a toll on him. 

Yesterday I had a moment of panic and texted him while he was trying to take test. I should have just not done that because it’s partly what led him to self isolate. I do this whenever I’m in a stressful situation and start to panic. I wish I was better at handling these moments on my own. Though it’s a possibility that we were exposed to the virus from his co worker so he’s using that as a way to isolate from others. 

I did apologize. I mostly confide in him in moments of panic because he’s the only one I trust but I probably but too much pressure on him. I just wish I had more people to talk to. I have other friends but neither of us ever confide in each other about our mental health so it feels hard to open up first, especially if they respond by not knowing the right words when they might not understand.

I am somewhat hurt that my bf wants to not be around anyone. I just can’t go on feeling like this.  I wish I had someone to talk to because my family is not the best at understanding mental health and they just make me feel worse talking to them. 
I also have been suspecting that I may have autism to some degree. Everyone in my life has doubted that being a possibility but whenever I research I just keep finding similarities and it’s just been in the back of my mind for a long time.

It would be nice to see a psychiatrist or psychologist but I’m still dependent so I use my family’s insurance and I am in know way able to get my own insurance as I don’t have money coming in or that much saved. It would help me figure out my issues and concerns about my mental health. My mom would likely confront me if he sees a charge anyways and ask me about it and I don’t want to deal with that.

I’ve tried on campus counseling but I didn’t like it. Group therapy was uncomfortable for various reasons and it’s hard for me to open up. Individual therapy was not helpful either because the counselor didn’t seem to care and often seemed to describe my problems as minimal or normal. I feel like I didn’t progress that much.

I feel better now that I’ve expressed my thoughts. Thank you to anyone (if any) who took the time to read this. I Would appreciate any suggestions for what I could possibly do to keep my mind at ease or how to deal with what I’m feeling at the moment.",23Oct2020,1

133,"I’m looking for some advice for tackling insomnia.

Backstory: I was diagnosed with generalised anxiety and clinical depression 6 years ago w/ insomnia as a side effect of this. I got to a point where I could manage it with a combination of lifestyle, therapy and meds. I got into a really good place and came off the meds and stopped therapy. However, it’s gotten bad again over the last year. 

When I was bad before I had issues with falling asleep and would end up staying up at night. 
However, I figured out coping methods for it and can now pretty much fall asleep on command and I pretty much had no issue with this for a number of years.

However, I now have a problem with staying asleep. I wake up every night from 2:30-5:30am like clockwork. I can’t fall back to sleep until nearly 6am which gives me on average of 4-5 hours of sleep a night. It’s been this bad for the last 6 months. 

I feel like I’ve tried nearly everything. I’m back in therapy, I’ve cut out caffeine after noon, I’ve tried meditation and mindfulness practises both before I fall asleep and when I wake up, Ive played classical music, podcasts, tv. for background noise. Ive tried avoiding technology. I’ve tried reading. Hot showers (no bath) I’ve even tried a valerian/melatonin supplements. I’m going back to my doctor again for tests if it’s anything else or meds. Some of these I tried in conjunction but all for at least 2 weeks with no success. I’m at a loss with what else I can do.

Any advice would be appreciated. I’m so tired and I just feel that if I could actually sleep that it would immensely help me get a grip again on the anxiety and depression.",23Oct2020,1

I believe that some healthy lifestyle or behaviour changes could help me to get things done and be more productive. Right now the thought of future tasks often fill me with dread, so I ignore them. I definitely use avoidance as a (terrible) strategy in many situations.

When I do have productive moments, they often snowball into large bursts of productivity all at once. Sometimes I can sustain the wave of productivity for a short time but eventually I revert back to old habits.

I'm writing this assuming that several people can relate to these feelings as I describe them. For anyone who can relate, do you have any lifestyle changes, habits, systems, productivity tools, books, or any other resources that has helped you that you wouldn't mind sharing?

Obviously no two people are exactly the same, so there's no ""one size fits all"" strategy, but it could be beneficial to learn more about strategies that *are* working for some people.

148,"I’ve thought about this for a while now because sometimes it’s really hard to handle this stuff and not know how to help. I can also elaborate more if needed, but basically since I was younger my mom has always been ‘different’. She doesn’t seem to fully understand social queues, or chooses to ignore them if she does (for example, if she’s doing a task like writing a text while walking, and she stops to finish typing, she would stay in the middle of the crosswalk instead of stepping to the side to let others through). She holds grudges for extended periods of time (her aunt almost pushed her down the stairs when she was a teenager and she still doesn’t forgive her for it. I’ve told her to move on for herself and she says she has but she still brings it up regularly).  She is a very loving person to me and loves to give to others (sometimes very elaborately) but other times to some she’s very cold or can come off as “bitchy”, and many times she is unaware of how she is coming off. She also can sometimes be really cold to people who are trying to be nice to her and overly nice (sometimes even walked on) to people who are cold or rude to her. She has many dreams that she seems to spend a lot of time thinking about, but these dreams are very unlikely to actually happen (winning the lottery, meeting a celebrity and having a home concert, etc. these are just a few) and she doesn’t take hearing that these are far fetched very well either. She’s not dumb, she’s always been self sufficient and she has taken care of me very well for the most part. When she was married to my father I think it’s safe to say he was pretty emotionally abusive and I definitely think he took advantage of her, but I don’t think he caused whatever this is. I have a lot of mental health problems, but so does my dad’s side, and her side of the family doesn’t really discuss mental health problems, so I don’t have any idea as to what it could be genetically. I thought she might have Asperger’s or autism but she doesn’t seem to have some of the key symptoms of these so I’m not sure.

My dad disappeared when I was younger, and we didn't find out for 5-6 years that he passed away. I somehow did not connect the dots until this year in therapy that this was what made me unconsciously terrified of being vulnerable. After stronger depressive episodes and a serious hypomanic episode that damaged parts of my life, I finally acknowledged my mental health this year.

What helped most, other than medication, was learning to be vulnerable and bringing out emotions I wasn't aware of. This still feels impossible alone, but it's more doable when I express it to others. There’s one friend I've related to for 9 years through our shared struggles with ADHD (diagnosed this year). After our many conversations on ADHD and mental health, we were inspired by a friend to create a podcast to share our vulnerable, authentic selves and encourage others to do the same. If you want to listen to our unfiltered experiences and perspectives on mental health, we just uploaded the first episodes to our podcast. It's called Two Addys and a Coffee, Please.

But when it comes to anger (specially with my parents) I shout at them, insult them and my heart beat rises so high that it wouldn't stop tearing my chest apart for another 20-30 minutes.
Also, I feel jealousy and the fear of being abandoned. But these two feelings, as well, will be converted (after a few minutes) into anger at my FP and I would stop loving her to become totally apathetic in the end.

160,"Over the past two weeks, we’ve talked about some practical steps on how to see a therapist. But when exactly should you see one?

When I’ve suggested seeing a therapist to people in the past who I thought could really benefit from it, some of the reactions I got included:

&gt;Oh my problem isn’t that serious. I don’t need it.  
Therapy is for other people, but not for me.  
Why should I see one? I don’t have a disorder.

But therapy isn’t just those who are struggling mental illness. I’m a firm believer that people at any stage in their lives could benefit from it. Whether you want to get a mental health check up or just talk through something that happened earlier in the week, it can be really helpful.

In order to understand how therapy can be useful, here is a framework for how I think about the different levels of [Emotional Debt](https://heem.substack.com/p/introducing-heem-publication-and):

* Mild
* Moderate
* Severe

# Different Levels of Emotional Debt

In order to make this discussion really concrete, let’s use an example and pretend that my pet dog El Chapo just passed away and I’m grieving.

## Mild

This level Emotional Debt affects me but doesn’t really disrupt my life.

*How I’m reacting*

I’m sad at work. It’s hard to focus on my tasks but I still complete them. I think about El Chapo a lot and post pictures of him on Facebook. I chat with my friends about how much I miss my dog. Sadness sticks with me but doesn’t overwhelm me.

*How therapy can help*

Therapy can help me process the loss of El Chapo in a judgement free zone. It’ll give me the space I need to truly grieve and express everything I might be going through. I can also receive the comfort and care that I may not get through my friends or family. I don’t need a therapist, but it could help accelerate the process of me coming to terms with my dog’s death.

## Moderate

This level of Emotional Debt disrupts my life but doesn’t completely stop me from functioning.

*How I’m reacting*

I feel sad, maybe even depressed. It’s really hard for me to finish my tasks and I’m even late on a few of them. My boss ends up asking if I’m doing okay because she notices that my work is being affected. I don’t want to hang out with my friends even though they ask me to get dinner. There are times when I’m overwhelmed by my sadness. At night, I cry before I go to bed.

*How therapy can help*

Therapy can help me understand the process of grief. It can help me explore the deeper themes that El Chapo is bringing up. I’ll be able to receive not only the compassion and care that I need, but some tools to not get stuck in the sadness. In this way, it can even prevent depression from setting in. Therapy isn’t required, but is highly recommended.

## Severe

This level of Emotional Debt completely disrupts my life and prevents me from functioning.

*How I’m reacting*

I can’t get out of bed. I can’t go to work. I stay in my room and don’t want to talk to anyone. I barely eat and I sleep 16 hours a day. I don’t have the energy to do anything and it’s been like this for months.

*How therapy can help*

At this point, professional help is strongly recommended. My sadness has gotten to the point where it has completely overwhelmed me and I can’t do the basic things such as eating or sleeping. I need someone to help guide me through my grief and to help process it in a healthy way. I may even need some medication.

# Discussion Questions

The different levels of Emotional Debt can be applied to almost anything you are going through. Next week, we are going to use this framework to explore anxiety, something many of us are dealing with in the midst of this pandemic.

* What was something you recently have been bothered by?
* Was it mild, moderate, or severe?
* How did you process or attempt to pay down that Emotional Debt?",23Oct2020,1
161,"so i have pretty severe social anxiety, so yeah i got called on, and my document wasn’t loading at the time so i had a few seconds of awkward silence before i squeakily unmuted and said “it’s loading..” 

i must’ve sounded so stupid oh my god- the question should have been answered by memory how did i NOT REMEMBER THIS ITS LITERALLY COMMON SENSE

163,"I know this sounds weird. But I'm struggling to express myself, and from the only time i went to therapy the therapist didn't sound convinced and i felt like a fool. Although she did give me a prescription and meds, i don't feel comfortable going to her again and for the next one i really don't want the same experience again.

I always had issues in seeing a doctor, i just can't do it. I was always a very shy person and i just freeze, so in most cases the doctor doesn't believe me because i don't sound convincing i guess. 

But i really need help. 

For example, how detailed should i go? I don't feel comfortable saying the details of my sexual assault to a therapist and is that ok?

Anyone who have experience? Please help",23Oct2020,1

sometimes I think everything would be so much more relieving if I killed myself. just a quick release of all the things that bothered me yk. i would stop comparing myself to everyone, stop thinking about what other people’s perceptions of me are and stop worrying overall. what if i did it right now, i wouldn’t have to sit through the whole attention thing where people tell u ur pretty or loved in order to make themselves feel like a good person. i wouldn’t have to be there for that. i’d find out the truth i’d be free of all the stupid things that me sad. is there something wrong with me. i don’t know, i don’t wanna say i’m depressed cause i don’t think i am. i feel like that requires u to always feel like ur in pain. maybe i am in pain idk. i struggle to find anything real, i don’t know who i am. all i know is that i hate myself, i mean i’m sat on a toilet at a sesh practically writing my suicide note of course i’m gonna hate myself i sound like a 14 year old who thinks they’re deep. but maybe i shouldn’t put myself down for feeling like shit cause that’s what i do everytime. i don’t wanna go downstairs where i’m surrounded by the people i wish i was. if i died rn i wouldn’t have to go downstairs. it would be a freak accident and people wouldn’t call me selfish. don’t get me wrong there are bigger problems than what’s going on inside my head but i’m just so tired of the horrible routine. this is the best it can be. it doesn’t get better why don’t i end it while i’m ahead yk?",23Oct2020,1

I've told her that I'm totally fine with it, and I'm willing to give her the right amount of space. That is true, in the sense that I accept how she is, and I know she's worth that effort. It doesnt change the fact, however, that it makes me feel pretty awful that when I ask about her weekend plans, she talks about resting. Knowing that I will need to wait at least another week before she feels ready is already kinda crushing. I would love some tips for how to just deal with that intense sensation of neediness.

I am 25 and I had depressive episodes from ages 15 to 22, light adhd since childhood (both genetic) and, since all of that went COMPLETELY undiagnosed, also some kind of anxiety problem. I never wanted to be one of those people for whom their list of mental problems becomes the first thing that defines them. And I never believed I was, until recently, when I realized how much I have lost to these illnesses.

Maybe the good things first: I somehow managed to fight my way out of the depression without meds at 22 and turned my life around completely. Moved out, got out of my toxic relationship, made lots of new friends and have a very active social life now. Actually, nearly all areas in my life that used to be absolutely barren like 5 years ago, are now just as I'd always wanted them to be. So there's that. 

The thing is, I'm a person with many passions and interests. When I was a teenager, there were so many things I wanted to do and this hasn't changed much. I always wanted to be a circus artist, but also write as some kind of journalist on social and cultural topics, all the while painting was my biggest passion. 

I know this is a lot, but if I had started right away at 18, like everybody else, I could have had done a lot of this and there still would have been time for a year or more of traveling. Instead, I spend those 7 years since school bumming around in a relationship I never wanted, being sick, crying my eyes out and studying for 5 and a half years now, for a bachelor's degree that was supposed to take 3 years, all the while never having a real job.

And now I see all those people my age and they all have so much more going for them! Some have been traveling for 4 years, learned acrobatics and juggling during it and now started studying at a professional circus school. Others have finished their masters degrees already and some guys from my school became a really popular band. They are living those dreams that used to be mine. 

And then there's me... I had all this talent and all these opportunities. I'm actually intelligent enough to really have a chance at a career in academics, I have been told multiple times by my professors. And I have real talent in drawing and Hula hoop dance, which I could both turn into my dream careers. 

But I have wasted so much time and I feel like I can't make up anymore, since my problems with procrastination and executive dysfunction still haven't vanished completely. I know that I just have to forget the past and my age and go on from where I'm at now. But today it has just been really hard and I feel like a total failure. 😞

Well... This got long. Who would have thought 😅
Thanks a lot and warm hugs to everyone who actually read this! ❤️

173,"Hello -  
I created a video on escapism (focused on gaming) -  highlighting its positive and negative effects through personal stories. I believe a good dose of escapism is necessary to maintain a healthy mental state, while 'overdosing' it can (and will) lead to places, that no one wants to go to, and from where it is extremely hard to find your way back - especially that it tempts you to stay in the world that you created for yourself (let that be alcohol, drugs or anything else).

I think that identifying the problem and admitting to yourself, that you are in a bad place is the key to turn around, and decrease the time spent not in the 'real world'.

I'll leave a link to the video, if that is alright, if it's considered a promotion, please take it down, but I believe someone may take my stories to heart, and turn back on the dark path, like I did.

176," Please direct me if this is not the correct sub to post. I needed some help from people who understand neurology rather than therapists. TL; DR at the end.

Over years, I have realized that I am a slow learner, I usually say I have slow/low RAM. It takes me time to collect and assimilate all the stuff. I am passionate about learning and like to think and visualize every single little detail. But I miss a lot of sentences and points people make when they talk to me, I just completely black out often. If they explain 10 points to me an hour, the max I can remember is like 5-6. Then I spend some more time on that 5-6 points, visualize-see-think over every possible angle and combinations and then I can say i understand those points. But the remaining points I completely ignore and that causes me trouble. So, I have to go back and revisit and take more time than people usually take. In the end, I would definitely remember all those 10 points but I took way more time than others.

When it comes to speaking, I have a similar trouble. I usually say that I am terrible at explaining stuff. Its hard for me to remember exact terms but I understand the process well. So, you can say I am bad in jargons. There are times when I am explaining something and I completely forget what (method) I was talking about and start explaining something else(on the related subject). My colleague told me that he thinks I am abstract thinker and I have a lot of thoughts going on at the same time and they get all muddled up trying to come out at the same time. I work in a highly technical design field and my job involves brainstorming and coming up with new ideas/designs from scratch. Thus, it also involves plenty of communication both to and fro. And I seem to have trouble in both. This really hits my confidence hard from time to time.

For a background, I am 26M. I have a Masters in Electrical Engineering from one of the top schools in US. I work in highly sought after position.(And honestly, it was the worst experience to reach here because I keep on failing interviews due to above issues.) I have depression, anxiety, OCD and bipolar disorder. Have been on medications since last 10 years.

I am also very instinctive guy and don't like to follow steps and rules because I can't remember them and it makes me anxious. I've had trouble in math classes through out my high-school/college because I was never really on same page with my peers. Either I was too behind or way too ahead. I couldn't understand the steps and methods mentioned in the book and always had to come up with my own logic and formulas after spending quite some time on the subject. Either I am exceptionally good at some math topics or I am completely clueless. This has done more harm in my academic career since quick and broad learning is usually preferred everywhere.

Do I have some kind of learning difficulty? Any solutions to cope up?

TL;DR: Badly losing confidence about my learning capabilities and sometimes feel imposter syndrome. It takes me way more time to focus &amp; understand something than a normal person.",23Oct2020,1

184,"I (M,19) have had a really tough time in highschool.

I won’t explain everything that happened, bc it’s a lot, but basically at that point in my life it was like everywhere I went people were mean to me. 

I know that sounds Whine-y and all, but as a teenager growing up gay with no support from my parents, it was really hard for me to not have anyone around to feel comfortable with.

I would go to school and teachers would call me lazy and all sorts of things for never turning work in (they didn’t know that my home life was rough), I would have classmates be mean to me, I would go to work and have people be mean to me all day, my mom was mean to me and my dad too. 

I’ve been called slurs and degraded for almost everything imaginable. It’s like I could never do anything right. The only gentle place of calm that I had was in my room with my dogs.

I’m in college now, I moved out and I’m financially independent. 

But something I never understood, is after surviving a period in my life where I was regularly spoken down to and had to deal with people saying just awful things about me regularly, why am I still so sensitive?

It seems like whenever a narrative like this happens, the person comes out stronger or is at least able to take simple things like mean comments and not be affected.


But I’m still such a sensitive person, so much more than my friends and coworkers and classmates.

someone even implying something bad about me makes me want to cry. 

Sometimes my friends won’t be thinking and will make a joke about something I’m insecure about, and as soon as I’m alone I’ll burst into tears.

Whenever I even think about my mom too much and the stuff she’s said to me in the past, I sob.


I like to think that my sensitivity can be kind of a good thing, but honestly I would much rather have tough skin and struggle with letting myself be sensitive, than to struggle with being /too/ sensitive. Esp since I’m a guy and there’s a lot of stigma against men who are overly sensitive.

It’s just frustrating idk. Like I’m almost 20 and I still cry so easily and take everything so personally. 

I /hate/ self righteous people who say stuff like “I’m too kind for this world”
and I don’t feel that way at all about myself
But honestly sometimes I really feel like I’m just weak and this world isn’t gentle enough for me.

I’ve had people tell me that I’m strong before for going through what I had to go through but I barely survived, and the whole time I was a weak mess.

Anyone else have a similar experience? Anyone have advice for being so sensitive? I’m working on seeing a therapist soon but idk",23Oct2020,1
185,"Sorry in advance for the long post. I have quite a bit of background to give. 

I’ve had nightmares for as long as I can remember. One of my earliest memories as a kid is of a time I woke up screaming for help because of a nightmare I had about trees. I was three years old and I can still remember every detail. To this day I am afraid of storm drains because of a nightmare (not “It” related) that I had as a child. 

My nightmares became more frequent some time in middle school, and this continued all the way through high school. This was around the time I started having a recurring nightmare where someone is in my bedroom and they’re going to hurt me, but I have sleep paralysis. The bedroom in the dream is always the bedroom I go to sleep in, with everything the exact same so I can’t tell I’m dreaming until I’m fully awake. The majority of my nightmares, however, are what we (my family and I) have always called my death dreams. These death dreams were always incredibly detailed and vivid, and they were always about a loved one dying. In some I would witness their death and in others I would just get news of their death, but the dreams always included the very long and hard grieving processes. Weeks would pass in my dreams and when I would wake up, I would feel as if I really did just mourn the death of a family member and I wouldn’t realize it was a dream for a while. I had them so often my family kept a tally of how many times each of them had “died” and what had “killed” them. 

There was about a year or two during high school where I would refuse to sleep because of my nightmares. They would cause pretty severe anxiety at night and I would just stay awake instead, sometimes for days (I also have bipolar 2 disorder so I think that contributed). 

My nightmares eased up a little while after high school, and, while I still get one every now and then, I think I handle them well and I can go on with my life pretty soon after.  At least that was the case until today. Pretty early on this morning I had one of my recurring nightmares where someone was in my
room, except this time they were trying to hurt my 4 month old son and I couldn’t do anything because of my sleep paralysis. When I finally screamed myself awake, I was so scared and anxious because I felt so helpless as I just watched someone try to hurt my child. It freaked me out and I decided not to sleep the rest of the night. When I finally (unintentionally) fell back asleep, I had a dream that my husband cheated on me and then became very cold and verbally abusive towards me. It went on for weeks (in the dream obviously) and when I woke up it felt so real. I can’t believe this but I woke up hating my husband. It didn’t feel like a dream, it felt like memories. I had to go through my recent texts with him to assure myself it was a dream (he is at work and I am at home today). 

I’ve spoken to him on his breaks, but I can’t shake this uncomfortable feeling I have when speaking to him. Like at any moment a switch will flip and he’ll be back to the horrible person I was afraid of in my dream. I saw his running shoes by the door this morning and I nearly vomited. On top of that I’ve also had severe anxiety all day that someone will come into the house and try to hurt my son. This is worrisome because when my anxiety gets severe I develop agoraphobic tendencies and have gone weeks without leaving the house before. 

I don’t know if this is my post partum, my bipolar, my anxiety, or just a separate thing all together, but It’s been hours and hours and I still can’t shake this. I can’t think straight, I keep jumbling words, Ive been zoning out all day even though I’m taking care of my son. 

I guess I’m just wondering if other people have experienced anything similar? I want to know how to cope with these nightmares so they don’t affect my daily life like they used to. 

Thanks if you read the whole thing. Sorry if it’s all
over the place. I kinda dumped everything on this post.

191,"For the past month or so I've been consistently waking up to memories of things that happened to me years ago, things that might be kind of annoying or upsetting to other people, but they affect me very deeply. These things stay in my head for hours and sometimes days, and I can't shake the feeling of anxiety. I get flashbacks too and it makes me feel ashamed and unsure of what to do. 

For instance, I know this sounds stupid, but I lost a much beloved video game years ago that I'd spent a lot of time on, and for a few days I couldn't get myself calm because I felt like someone had stolen it from me, and did it out of spite. I couldn't shake this feeling for a long time and I felt really panicked and like people were plotting against me, or that I couldn't trust people anymore. This has happened time and time again with small things from childhood up to a few years ago. I'm probably not explaining this very well but I seem to be obsessed with protecting myself from things that have happened to me in the past, like I'm traumatised by being betrayed by other people. 

I don't really have friends and I'm not interested in making any because I find it hard to be myself with them. I come from an emotionally abusive family and never really learned social skills, so I find that people use me and mistreat me a lot. It seems safer to keep myself away from people.

I really want to know what to do because these thoughts of having been betrayed enter my head all the time.

192," I have so many nonsensical rules about the things I eat. I can't eat or even be near many foods due to what they look like or smell like. By look like, I mean like the shape of it very often. A lot of circular foods make me feel really sick or make me gag being near them. These rules don't make sense sometimes as I can eat the same food in a different shape, but if it's that shape or was originally that shape, I will not eat it. I've always been like this since I was very young, but it feels like it's worse than ever now. If I have ate something containing that food without realising, I will then feel so sick to my stomach, almost like guilt or as if I've done something disgusting.

These days I have been 'busy', not physically(?) But mentally, I feel like i'm slowly losing it, I have always dealt with overthinking/worrying but it got worse especially since I have absolutely nothing to do, I am always overthinking about anything, I have this worry that someone is gonna break in and steal/hurt my family, I have to check that the door is locked and that no one is in the kitchen before I sleep, I have to check on my parents and any small sound makes me worried. Ever since they announced when school will start in my country, I started overthinking my parents' reaction to my fucked up grades (we ended school without getting our 2nd semester grades),  and how I have to find ways to lie my way through it,and keep having weird dreams about school. I keep worrying that someone is watching me from my phone, I can't do anything when facing my phone, I'm even scared to take pictures! And now with the stupid worry that won't let me rest, that someone can read my mind, I know it's stupid and I don't really believe in mind reading, but I keep worrying that someone is reading my mind and start feeling uncomfortable to even *think* of anything, I keep worrying that I said something embarrassing or that I did something disgusting, I keep worrying about all these that I sleep late and wake up very late in the morning, I don't have breakfast anymore because I wake up on lunch time, I'm scared of the time where I'll have to go outside because I worry I'll need the bathroom or I'll get thirsty and other dumb things, all these thoughts just keep piling up and cause me to not focus, and make me too busy to do things that I love and are kinda the reason my grades drastically dropped, because I can't study, because my memory got so bad I can't remember anything I ever studied, I can't speak well anymore, I forget very easy words when trying to speak and it's making me look so stupid, I won't stop stuttering and can't raise my voice, I'm really tired and no matter how much I get better, there's always places where I'm lacking, I'll try to get through all this, and hope I success because I genuinely want to live be happy.",23Oct2020,1

199,"I am 17, when i was a little kid i was always happy, filled with happiness, always smiling, but as soon as i hit 12-13 years i changed, i became sad all the time, no motivation or energy, when i am out i always think about how i just want to go home, nothing excites me, i am having a really hard time at school due to lack of motivation, i am just always so tired. I even tried asking my mom for help, we had an argument and i just shouted that i am tired of everything and want to die, she just screamed back: ''just fricking stop cutting yourself!'' (she doesn't know if i cut or not) i've tried talking to her about that for couple of times but she just told me that it's all in my head and apparently depression is just a ''trend''.  I stopped reaching out for help for couple of months, and week ago i reached out again, she said then why didn't you say anything back then? I said well when i asked you for help you just told me to stop cutting myseld and that is all in my head, and she said: ''i never said that, you are lying!''. Funny how i do or something and she will remember that for whole life, but if she says something or does she forgets instantly!

I would really like to see a psychiatrist and get some help maybe take some medicine.

201,"I don't exactly know what it is or why, but I just feel stuck in life, like I'm not growing as a person. I'm a 20 year old female, but I'm the same as how I was in high school and I have the same problems. I look at all my high school friends and how they are now, and they've all grown and overcame their struggles and problems and they're doing A LOT better now in many different areas of life. On the other hand, I'm still the same. Also, after high school my friends and I drifted apart so we don't really talk anymore. We just have other on social media, so I don't really have any friends right now either. I only have one friend that I talk to. She's younger than me by 3 years, but I still consider her my best friend. The thing is though, I don't think she considers me her best friend. I feel like I'm annoying her by being so clingy because of my loneliness. She has other close friends and she likes talking to them and hanging out with them more than me. It also kinda hurts too that I'm willing to do all these things for her, but she doesn't do anything for me. I do really want to make other friends, but whenever someone tries to befriend me, I don't put any effort into maintaining that friendship. It's like I can't accept new people in my life or something. And when I do try to put effort, I come off as a try-hard according to my sister and then it scares them away.

I'm also in community college right now. I'm in my 2nd year. I've been feeling this way ever since I started college and I let this feeling of being stuck affect my studies. I barely study and I used to care so much about my grades in high school, but now I basically don't give a fuck even though I really do want to succeed. I also want to make my parents proud, so I don't tell them about what's really going on in my studies and I keep telling myself that I'll do better but I just can't bring myself to actually do it. I'm still not doing too well academically this semester, and I know that this is going to hurt me in the future but that still doesn't get me to do better.

This is also affecting my hobbies and interests. I like playing piano and art and I want to learn more about them and be better at both, but I just feel so lazy and don't do that.

As for what I feel stuck in, I just feel stuck in life in general. I don't have any real friends that I could hang out with that don't find me annoying or friends that would actually care and do things for me. I don't have a boyfriend, which I feel like would make my life better since I never had one before but idk. I'm doing so bad in college and I don't see my purpose. I know I said I feel the same as how I was in high school, but thinking about it more, I actually feel worse. I had motivation in high school. I had good friends in high school. Guys actually talked to me in high school. I was excited for the future back then too. Now, I just feel like my self-esteem went down more and I just feel more angry at the world. I can't even properly explain myself or how I feel, so I hope some things made sense.

Everyday seems so dull and monotone. Life isn't exciting for me anymore and I feel lonely. I really don't want to live like this anymore. I want to live my best life. How can I stop dreaming and saying that I'll change and actually do something about it?",23Oct2020,1

206," **TL;DR: Lived with an abusive parent for most of my life which bred mental health and trust issues, so now living with sister, effectively making her a caregiver/an adoptive/foster family. I can form strong emotional connection with friends and partners, but why am I so detached with my foster/adoptive family?**

I'm a 21F living in Indonesia. I've lived with a single mother (60-ish by now?) for 19 years and a physically absent father who is dead now, barely remembering past interactions with him during childhood. The stereotypical asian drama you see in the media I guess. My mother was physically, emotionally, and financially abusive throughout her life to me that created crippling self-worth issues and inability to handle/communicate emotions properly. For context I was also diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and depression in my adulthood due to the trauma and have symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder (undiagnosed), treating my past exes and close friends in less than proper ways at times.

For 14 years me and my mother have lived alone separated from my sister (42) who has a stable job and her own family consisting of her ex husband (60) and three kids around my age. Due to serious financial issues, we moved to her house and lived with her trying to get by. She (my sister) has since been paying for our life necessities, including my college tuition. Suffice to say she (mom) was a toxic force and kinda tore the family apart, driving everyone crazy and leaving me emotionally debilitated and agitated. When I was around 18 yo, me and my sister had a fallout with her, causing her to leave the family and stay permanently on her (by then recently bought) house. I was unable to support myself financially and my sister and her ex husband fully filled this role as my caregiver, effectively becoming my foster/adoptive parents.

Here's the thing: I was emotionally detached from my mother. I can NOT for the love of god identify what the word ""love"" meant, especially the kind of love you're supposed to feel around a family. My mother's treatment was confusing for me, rapidly cycling from abuse and what she called love in her own ways (like buying me stuff but refusing to ever apologize) to threatening to kill me and wishing I was never born that i had severe trust issues with everyone in my life and causing significant difficulties in forming relationships (I honestly can't tell if she ever actually loved me). After she left, this never really goes away. I develop ""push-pull"" relationships with people around me, but I do feel immense and intense care for romantic partners and close friends, even those who has left me due to my toxic ways. I can identify ""love"" for people outside of my family circle, I can pour out my heart and soul to them and would make myself a carpet for them to walk on if it makes them happy (it's unhealthy but this is an issue for another time), but my own family is another story.

I was extremely reserved and never talks about my personal feelings to them. They're very caring of course, nothing wrong with them. They ask me mundane stuffs like how my classes were going or buy me wholesome Christmas presents every year, acting like a parent should be I guess. So why is it so hard for me to feel emotional attachment to the people who has been spoon feeding me for years and has emotionally invested a lot to take care of me? Why does it comes really easily for me to care for friends and partners, but not my own family? I obviously have no malicious intent and wishes the best for them but I never really feel like I can trust or open myself to them and it's making me uncomfortable in my own home. They don't do the same because of this, i feel like, since they dont often have personal conversations with me. I don't have anyone i can go to for emotional comfort (out of my own detachment) and I feel extremely upset and disgusted at myself for that, because why the fuck not? These people have been nothing but loving and accommodating. When my sister's ex husband died I was upset, but not to the point where I was consumed by overwhelming grief. I wallowed in guilt because of this, felt really horrible as a human being, feeling like I wasnt sad enough with his passing. long I tried to have emotional connections with them and one way or another it doesn't really work out, some even can argue that my mindset is the cause of this, i dont know, im trying to work it out. Cant really afford a therapist rn (was doing sessions for 2 years prior) and I havent figured why I feel such detachment (I mean I know it's probably from the abuse trauma but I dont really comprehend how it works). Dont get me wrong, I care for them, but I often feel like it's superficial if it's coming from me, and vice versa at times. Makes me feel really **SHITTY** for even feeling detached (""what a horrible and ungrateful family member!"") and been bugging me for years.

Any say in this? What should I do? Am i really just that horrible, need to collect my shit further, and learn some fucking empathy or is it something else? Sorry for the long post and emotional baggage ya'll, hope ya have a great night/day.",23Oct2020,1

My younger brother just said to me that every time his life going right that he is feeling the most depressed and suicidal (He has ASD and ADHD and is on sleeping pills) and I am struggling to make a fair exploitation to him why that is - I feel it too when I've worked it's caused me a total breakdownu after a few months every - single - time.

Since at least 5th grade I’ve had issues around change and attachment to objects. I think in my case they kind of go hand in hand. I have a hard time selling stuff or taking it to a junk yard. Once I went to throw some stuff away with my mom and had a panic attack when we pulled in. I don’t know why and I don’t really know what to do. It’s gotten worse and worse as I’ve gotten older and when my mom got rid of a couch we’d had for a while I barely ate anything or left my room for a week. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not a hoarder. I barely buy anything at all. I just don’t get rid of a lot of things once I have them. I kind of like to think of it as a dragon protecting their gold. 

I’ve liked collecting stuff since I was in kindergarten. I used to save my used bandaids in a box. So maybe that’s one reason why I do this? I feel one of the main drives is that I am afraid that if I get rid of the object I’ll lose the memories around with it. I’m terrified that I’ll forget something. 

I have panic attacks or near panic attacks when things change around me and I’m worried that I come off as controlling when I try to keep things the same.

I’m looking for advice on what to do and also just wondering if other people feel the same way. I was thinking of maybe seeking therapy but I don’t even know where to start in terms of who to go to.

Now I got to know someone else and can’t of start losing interest in that other guy. My ex’ friend who’s a girl (someone said he didn’t like her because of her looks) is attractive to me. Someone in school is attractive to me. Everyone’s so attractive and I feel like I’m getting lost. I feel like I just can’t build up a bond to anyone. 

God, my head hurts. Feels like it’s going to explode. All because I played video games the whole day. I should learn for my exams, but my procrastination is hitting so hard right now. Probably because I applied for a job that might make me drop out of school (it’s a good job, I’m not doing anything stupid, don’t worry). But I fear that I might not get it. And I fear I do get it. I’ll have to move across the country. Bye bye everything I know I guess. And all the social interaction. I kinda wanna die thinking about all these strangers. But it’ll be okay. One day they’ll be no strangers anymore. 

There’s more I wanted to say but my headache really makes me lose my thoughts. Good night. The most important part is the crush part. I really don’t know what to do. I feel like a terrible person. I don’t even want a relationship, but I crush on everyone around me. 

Head hurts. Goodnight.",23Oct2020,1
221,So I a year ago liked this girl or crushed on her a lot and it was a huge crush well eventually we stopped being friends because of some stuff between us but my feelings were still there and ever since then I’ve been having dreams about us meeting for the first time online and then us with all our friends and no matter how hard I try I regain my feelings for her over and over and then I wake up and then I have to deal with losing her again it’s been going on for 10 months now and I want it to stop I’ve tried therapy but we focused more on my dad and not her. So if anyone knows how to cope with it or to get it to stop or even why it’s happening that’d help,23Oct2020,1
222,"I had my first session with a life coach last week. I wanted to go for a life coach instead of a therapist/counseling because I've already done that, and I'm more-so seeking someone who will assist me in following through with some short-term goals that I've struggled to hold myself accountable for, and prepare for my longer-term goals. One of my short-term goals relates to cutting contact with my narcissistic mother - and I specifically chose this life coach because she 'specializes' in that. 

I paid in full for her 3-session patient intake period, each 60 minutes. My first one felt exactly like my past therapy sessions, and there were a few times where I just... didn't feel like it was that productive, and I felt like a lot of what she was saying I could've just read out of a book instead. I have two more of these sessions, and if the next ones go the same as the first, I don't think it's worth my time or money to continue with them, but I dunno... I feel weird completing several intake sessions only to not continue with her services. Has anything like this happened to anyone else?",23Oct2020,1
223,"Hello everyone, last week I started a new antidepressant. I am on a low dose of Celexa. My doctor has started me off on 10 mg. The first day I took the medication I felt high. The next few days I felt relatively good. However, I have noticed that I don’t feel like doing anything. I don’t feel like going out or talking to friends. I haven’t messaged my friends back simply because I don’t feel like talking. I feel very tired. I just want to lay in bed and nap. Today I am feeling anxious and lethargic. Should I be worried about this? I feel like I shouldn’t be feeling like this a week later. Anyone else have this kind of experience?",23Oct2020,1
224,"Hi

I’m 23 M and in the UK 

I’ve never really openly spoke around my mental health before. It’s something I’ve struggled with for a while. 

Earlier in the year I saw a doctor and they signed me off work for 6 weeks, and put me on anti depressants. I also took a 8 weeks of talking therapy. This seemed to help and I got a new job as I was previously unhappy where I used to work. I took myself off the tablets against doctors advice something I now regret. 

The new job went well and I felt great however I feel like I’ve rebounded and back to square one but this time I feel worse. Work has gotten extremely stressful (I work in management in social care) I’ve been threatened by staff, under huge amounts of pressure, no days off hardly and working double my contracted weekly hours. It’s impacting my life massively as I’m getting a lot of grief off other professionals. A doctor as referred me for my counselling and put me on anti depressants again this time a different type. 

I’ve spoken to work but I didn’t really get any response. I feel at times I don’t want to be here as I don’t enjoy life. I really want to but I don’t. I miss how full of life I used to be and the happiness I used to feel. I want that back but it doesn’t feel possible anymore. 

I’m overwhelmed, emotional and quite scared to be honest. Has anyone else felt this? Sorry for the essay. I just feel I’ve let people down and I’ve failed. I have fantastic friends and family but I don’t feel like I can tell them. 

If anyone has read this I really appreciate you taking the time to read it :)",23Oct2020,1
225,"Back in January I needed to get back to 10th grade. It was all pretty spontaneous, the decision was made within a week, it was all pretty quick and not expected at all. So there was no real time to mentally prepare and say goodbye to everyone. On my last day everyone left as normal, most of them even forgot that I was going to leave them, my teacher didn’t say anything at all because I still had to sign the paper that I go back to 10th grade. He didn’t wanna say that I leave since I still had the option to stay (although it wouldn’t have made much sense to stay since I had missed too much school due to health issues). 
One girl gave me a hug, and a few others told me that I could visit them any time I like. It’s not like we are world apart, we were only one corridor apart. 

I spend 4 weeks in my new class, I hadn’t visited my old class yet, only at the corridor once, so they texted me and asked me if I would like to visit, but the we went into lockdown. I mean schools are open again, I‘m in 11th grade now, my old class is now 12th grade. But we are not allowed to meet other grades than ourselves. So I still had no chance to see them again. And I miss them dearly. My new class is ok- not great but also not too bad. 

Is it weird to still miss your old class mates even after nearly half a year? I have to say my grades got in most subjects way better, so it was worth it. 

Maybe I should add that I was bullied from year 7 to 9, and my class in year 10 was the first one in years who was kind to me. I did have some issues as well because I hat forgotten how to talk to people and I still fared that they mich hurt me, but they were very kind to me, especially during the time I was sick. They have me lots of support and I‘m still very grateful.",23Oct2020,1

227,"For some time (a few years) I've felt like theres something wrong with my mental health, but I've never really been able to describe it. I think what it boils down to is that I dont feel in control of my own thoughts sometimes.

What I mean by this is impulsive thoughts mostly, like all of a sudden my mind just springs something on me and it's almost never anything positive. When theres something to be worried about, even something mild my mind obsesses over it, I'll do all I can to solve the issue, but its regular that I lose sleep over stupid things. Recently my car made a funny noise and I barely slept for 2 nights. 

More worryingly the impulsive thoughts are about how I dont want to be alive, or that if my worries come true I could always just kill myself. I dont think I'm suicidal, but these thought bother me.

I used to think this was depression (at the time when they really first started my father had been diagnosed with terminal cancer), or maybe that I'm hearing voices or its simple paranoia, but I don't think any of them are true.

I want to speak to someone about it, but i dont really know who or how. I dont have money for therapy and as i cant even describe what I'm feeling or thinking i feel like I'd be wasting someones time anyway. I'm in the UK if you have any advice on this.

This all sounds so over dramatic now i write it down. I've written posts like this in the past and just deleted them because i feel I'm being ridiculous. But I guess its bothering me enough to feel the need to talk about it. I'm starting to dread trying to go to bed because it means I'll just be lying there listening to my own paranoid negative thoughts.",23Oct2020,1

I am completely alone. I have pretty much no one I can say this to, hence, reddit! (thank you).

234,"First of all, I’m a super friendly, outgoing, slightly depressed, fun guy. My depression doesn’t usually affect social situations. Being around people brings out the best in me. I’m especially good and comfortable with women. Always on my game socially and comedically. 

But I do have low ambition. And I have recently been turned down by 2 different women after a few dates because of it. 

Im kind of a catch outside of that. Young, handsome, understanding, passionate, good in bed, fun, supportive, caring, i could go on... But I just don’t have much of a drive to do anything more with my life. I’m overall quite content and complacent. I’m without a job right now, but only because I chose to be laid off to spend more time with my son while collecting unemployment. I am starting my next job very shortly, as an electrician apprentice, which will give me a very comfortable living to support a family once I become a journeyman in 2 years. 

Not sure where to go from here. I’m yearning to share a life with someone again, but seem to be lacking what all the women are looking for. Even though I kinda feel like I’m on the right path. 

Advice?

PS, the women I’ve been out of luck with are not in anyway gold diggers, or something like that. They’re not the type who are looking to get with someone with big pockets. Both very down to earth.",23Oct2020,1

236,"Hi there!

I'm currently on the lowest dose of trazodone for insomnia - my doctor had tried SSRIs and even klonopin with me before for my sleep issues but I didn't like the side effects of SSRIs and klonopin didn't help me stay asleep. 

Trazodone is the. Best. Thing. I've ever tried for sleep. I've been on it for 1 month and 1 week and its been the best month of sleep I've had since I can remember. I literally cannot be happier about that.

About two weeks ago I started to spiral into a depression that has seemed to just get worse every day. I feel so tired every waking moment and I dread anything I have to do, like responsibilities tied to work or basic care for myself. 

I've not been this low in a long time, and I'm scared. I know this isn't me but I feel so unhappy. 

If its the trazodone messing with my head, will it stop if I continue with it for long enough? Or will it get worse?",23Oct2020,1

Before, I was able to reach some kind of satisfaction with having all of my work done, but now I feel like I still have yet another thing to do.

It started a week ago when I decided that I have to stop procrastination and get my blog updated. When I was procrastinating, I felt like I didn't do anything for the day and just wasted a whole 24 hours playing video games and such. But now, when I'm actually doing work, I still feel like I didn't achieve anything.

I'm honestly obsessed with the busy lifestyle where you have meetings, conferences, TED talks, flights, trips, speeches in a single day. You know, the business lifestyle. But now, my obsession with it has become too much.

I feel like I must achieve it.

238,"Recently (past week) I have been feeling like I lack love as an emotion. I am going through a bit of stress at the moment, (coming out as lgbtq+ and college workloads), but it is nothing I haven’t experienced before. Also I have been aware of my sexuality for a long time, my problem doesn’t revolve around coming out just to clarify, I’m just mentioning it because it is stressful.

I also now have a boyfriend, he is great and I can see myself with him for a long time, but I feel like I am not going to develop the feeling of love, if that makes any sense. I don’t think this is about him though, I think it’s more of a me problem.

I also have great friends and family, but even with my parents my brother, I don’t feel like I “love” them. Additionally, when I lost people close to me I felt under emotional about it.

Now I don’t think I’m a sociopath, and definitely not a psychopath. I am pretty in tune with my emotions and the emotions of others. I sympathize with people and am very compassionate. I also like people, I really like my friends and family and my boyfriend. But I feel like I don’t love anyone or anything.

I could just use some of your guy’s opinions. This may be because I’m in a bit of a slump, but I’m not really sure. Maybe because I have a weird conception of what love is. Is not being able to “love” a mental disorder? Idk. I could just use some help",23Oct2020,1

I want to start by saying that I believe I sort of pseudo-dissociate sometimes. Like, idk, everything just kind of feels distant. And I'm there, obviously, but I can't connect correctly. Idk, it's not a big deal, so I just kind of ignore it. (Maybe it's just an anxiety thing? I don't want to call it dissociating since I don't really know for sure.)

Also, I sort of think of myself as not the same as the person I know that I look like. Trying to explain this is making me think I've lost it, but hear me out. It's like the me who's perspective I only ever see from is ME (including all my thoughts and decisions), but when I look in the mirror, she's just different. Idk. Like obviously that's me, but it just feels different. This might be normal and I'm just being dumb but I have no clue.

So what made me type this post is this: I got into a really big argument with my mother this morning and I hadn't slept the night before because I was hanging out at a friend's house. So, a lot of this could probably be chalked up to silly sleepy-loopiness, but I sat in front of a long mirror I have in my room and looked at my reflection and I just felt like I popped into existence or something. Or like I don't exist at all. 

I have no fucking idea what I'm even trying to say. I can't even explain it. Idk why this dumb argument is making me feel like I've reached a breaking point.
