0,I feel like I can be empathetic when I read but not so much in real life,26May2020,1
1,"Hello all, I hope your days in quarantine are going well and you’re finding things to keep you upbeat and mentally/physically healthy! 

I need some advice. I have severe depression and anxiety that I am managing with medication. I am currently trying to find a therapist to help me with self-esteem issues, working through crippling anxieties, and, what the title suggests, the inability to talk to anyone about what’s going on in my head. 

I have never really confided with anyone about my depression and anxieties. I know that talking through what troubles me can be really helpful and definitely healthier than bottling it up and waiting for the sadness/worries to pass, but I have not mustered the courage to find a therapist or had someone trustworthy to talk things out with until now. I have a very loving, caring, supportive boyfriend who I plan on marrying. However, my communication with him about how I am feeling when I am anxious or upset is severely lacking. This hurts him a lot and rightfully so—it derails our plans, our moods, and puts us both in a funk for the rest of the day because I try to escape with a “nothing’s wrong”, a “stop asking”, or a “I’m fine” when he can see my true feelings as much as he can tell that boiling water is hot. I want to be able to give him an idea of what i’m going through as to lessen my mental and emotional burden, give him peace of mind, and open up communication for a healthy and successful relationship for years to come. 

Thus I ask, how do I speak my mind? I plan on talking through all of this and more with my therapist, but for those of you who have struggled with communication and expressing your thoughts, any advice, tips, or tricks are appreciated. Thank you in advance :)",26May2020,1
2, Im feeling really disconected to myself lately and i want a place where i could be challenged to understand myself. How can i do that without going to therapy?,26May2020,1
3,"Ever since I could remember, my dad always bought my family expensive things like a new car, new house, new furniture, etc. Every time him and my family members get into an argument, he always makes himself the victim. He always pressured my siblings to graduate high school and go to college right afterwards, even if we didn’t want to. He’s always talking to his friends or family about how “successful” we are. Every time he makes me or my siblings cry, he apologizes but ends up doing the same thing again. He says when he gets really old, he wants to move far away and doesn’t want any of us to visit him. He’s also really full of himself.",26May2020,1
4,"I [24M] have been dating my girlfriend [26F] for about 10 months, but we have closely known each other as friends for over 4 years.

I am an American citizen, she is a Chinese citizen working in the US under an H1B work visa (important fact to be expanded upon later).

She works in Big 4 accounting, which for those who don't know, it's a very demanding work culture. (Multiple projects, tight deadlines, high stress, 50-80 hour work weeks, working on weekends). She has been working in big 4 for the last 3 years and at this point she is burnt out. 

Here's the issue: 

She's burnt out and has been crying, feeling frustrated, helpless in her situation because she wants out of this job, but the challenge is finding a new job. 

The challenge with finding a new job is the H1B visa. I would say over 90% of employers do not want to hire H1B employees because it's more of a hassle when there are plenty of American citizens who can fill the position. So, she has been searching for a job since last October (over 8 months of job hunting). The result is consistent denials simply because of the work authorization status.

Additionally, we live outside of DC, where a lot of the jobs are government related jobs and require security clearance, which she cannot get as a Chinese citizen.

She wants to change so bad but feels stuck and in a hopeless situation where nothing will get better. 

I want to help her so badly. I have applied to hundreds of jobs for her. She got a few interviews, but nothing turned into an offer.

At this point, it almost feels like she dwells on the situation day after, how hopeless it is, and day after day laments about the situation. Sometimes it's just complaining, but sometimes it's as bad as crying and mental breakdown. Even saying she wants to kill herself - though she is not serious about this. She has lost all motivation towards this job. She wants to quit so badly, but can't otherwise she needs to leave the country. She doesn't know what to do anymore because everything just seems hopeless. She feels broken mentally and physically (the job is an office job with a lot of sitting so her back and neck is in a lot of physical pain and the physical pain is adding to the mental pain)

I really don't know what to do to help her and I really want to help her. But at the same time its is so tiring for me to try to comfort her time and time again hearing the same story over and over. 

Some options that I/she have thought of:

1) get married - I think it's too early to get married. We were thinking to get engaged later this year. But later this year seems too long for her to wait in her current situation. But once we get married she can get a green card through marriage which will open the door to more job opportunities.
2) continue job hunting - again, very low odds of success
3) go back to school for masters - again this will take at least a year to happen, which seems too far away.

I would like to know what your thoughts are on 1) how can I help her find a new job or improve her situation 2) how should I deal with the emotional stress on my end trying to comfort her on a hopeless situation 3) any tips for her to improve her mindset

Let me know if you need any other details. Any thoughts appreciated.",26May2020,1
5,I was getting my cats food ready when my migraine kicked up and my hand went numb. Dropped the dish in the sink. Almost want to cry but that will definitely make the migraine worse lol. Don't know why I'm sharing this. Laugh at my pain!,26May2020,1
6,"I've been doing well lately, oddly enough. Not manic, not even hypomanic (at least not for a long enough amount of time). Just content and generally happy, besides the underlying issues that I've known for a while. 

I've just been thinking about how I haven't actually changed all that much in my core. Yeah, I was almost an SJW a few years ago, but I was also vulnerable and depressed. I'm thinking about how even back in 1st-3rd grade how I was manipulative and a liar. There's the big stories: I was a bully, sucked up to my teachers, acted out, yada yada. I was also in therapy at this time (weird and complicated reasons). 

I wonder how much of me would have changed, had I actually been honest about my reasons for being there. If I didn't make excuses for the sake of protecting myself. If I had just been honest about how fucked up I actually was, I might not be where I am now.

And that's weird because I don't really mind being ""out there"" or ""that"" kid. It's bizarre to me to think that most kids didn't think or act the way I did and they're ""normal"" now. But I'm also partially grateful because now I've kind of grown into my personality and I'm at peace with it, for the most part. I guess I'm just a little lonely in the grand scheme of things, and wondering how I as a whole would be different or if I would even care about being an honest human being.",26May2020,1
7,My parents and I were just having an argument about how lazy and entitled I am. They started asking me why I found it so hard to talk to them. It ended with my parents cussing me out and my mom throwing things around. I really thought she might hurt me too. I kinda wanted to laugh because this is exactly the reason I don't talk to them. Then they acted like nothing happened afterwards. They took a nice walk together while I was still crying and shaking in the kitchen. The whole thing is ridiculous lol.,26May2020,1
8,"A close friend of mine recently told me that she felt bad. When I asked her to elaborate she said she didn't feel like herself anymore, that everything is weird and everything is different. As if it's a dream. I don't really know what this is and I was hoping someone could help me so that I could better understand what she's going through.",26May2020,1
9,"Every time I manage to leave the house to get something done, something goes wrong, the errand multiplies into more errands and waiting in lines. I don't know if I have bad luck but what's going on now is I've been trying to get my phone fixed for two weeks and I have to leave the house again tomorrow to find a place that will sell me a new chip. I'm sobbing because I can't do these things on my own and there's no one to help me. I feel ridiculous which makes it worse. Does anyone else experience this? thanks",26May2020,1
10,"Hi I’m 17 and going through the senior year of highs school. 

I’ve been in a loop of a mindset for the past week (coincidentally the same week lockdown ended for my country) and all my thoughts have centred around death anxiety. Specifically I’ve been feeling incredibly disconnected with my false reality. Recently I keep thinking the people around me will die and I can’t seem to put effort into being social and take anything earnestly. This has stretched to my parents who are older than usual (78 and 53). I can’t look at them in the present and keep thinking about how one day I’ll never see them again. These thoughts on mortality and death has affected my enjoyment in activities and I can’t remember ever feeling normal (even though I was two weeks ago). It feels like a pit that’s been digging deeper and deeper and there’s no line out or a memory of being pushed into it. I don’t want to deny my mortality, I just want these thoughts to stop. Is there anyone here who can help or relate to this feeling of constant anxiety? (Sorry if it’s messy I’m usually a strong writer)

Hopefully it just goes away with time.",26May2020,1
11,"Hey everyone!  I just want to remind everyone that there is hope.  I know that so much of you are hurting and that the pain seems unbearable.  I know that the future looks bleak.  I have been there plenty of times.  I have wanted to die more times than I can remember.  Even as soon as a month ago, all I could think about was dying.  There are people who love you and need you to stay alive.  There is a purpose to your existence, no matter how small.  You are not broken.  Don’t be afraid to talk about your pain.  Hold onto the ones you love even tighter.  Appreciate the little things in life.  The small things that don’t seem important are often times the source of our happiness.  I’m not going to feed anyone bullshit and say that everything is perfect or that you’ll never feel pain again.  Pain is a part of life and feeling pain is what makes us human.  What matters is how we take that negative energy and  put it into something positive.  Speaking to and caring for others is how I take my pain and turn it into something positive.  If my words can save even one person’s life, maybe the pain was worth it.  I love you all.  Stay strong 💪🏼",26May2020,1
13,"I’m 33 and ever since I was a little girl, the thought of losing someone or breaking up has always been terrifying to me and when a relationship breaks, I grieve it so much that my body shuts down and I feel like part of me has died.

I have a schizophrenic mother who has refused treatment and has been diagnosed since September of last year. She has moved across 6 states, been in 6 hospitals, and is completely off.

15,"For maybe 4 months I have felt like I am slowly losing my personality, especially my sense of humor. Nothing traumatic happened but it has just gradually gone away. Even with my closest friends I feel like I don’t know how to be funny any more and it feels awkward and forced to be around them. Even around my family I feel like I overthink everything I do. I hate feeling this way, I feel so void of emotion and I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Can anyone else relate or have any advice?",26May2020,1
16,"It sounds simple enough but what this basically boils down to is ""stop being so depressed and you wont be depressed"" 

WOW WHY DIDNT I THINK OF THAT! ALL MY PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED NOW! 

Reassure them. Talk to them about their worrys. Because yes if a depressed person just stops being depressed their life will get better problom is it doesnt work like that in the slightest. 

If someone in your life believes themselves to be worthless. Talk to them. Reassure them. Help the find the help they need to get better. Dont say dumb crap like ""well yeah tomarrow is gunna suck with that attitude"" well it's the attitude tomarrow is getting so its gunna need to deal",26May2020,1
17,"So, at the age of 14 I was diagnosed with depression. I was picked on, had no one to talk to so was often times by myself at school or in my room. Something I never spoke about with my therapist that I know has affected me greatly was this imaginary friend or bad daydreaming habit I'd developed. I was too embarrassed. 

I could be sitting in class, walking home, or trying to sleep and each time this girl would pop into my brain. She was so pretty, so sweet and funny. The daydreams were mostly about her singing to me, dancing, telling me jokes to make me feel happy. She would travel, and do all these crazy amazing things. For me it felt better to watch her than going to school everyday to get things thrown at me so I'd stay home. Fake sick. To sleep and daydream about this girl I envied, and wanted to be around. 

I thought I'd grow out of it but 7 years later and she's still here only now when she's not singing or dancing she's doing what I've been doing. Laying or sitting blankly. I don't know what it is about this girl but she makes me feel like I was born the wrong person. Shes made me feel like I have to get rid of myself. I was meant to be her or she was meant to be in my position. I wasn't suppose to exist. 

I don't want to sleep anymore but I've been more tired than usual. I don't want to think about her anymore and I don't want to be here anymore. I feel crazy.",26May2020,1
18,"Today I texted someone I had been previously seeing (but cut things off with) in order to ask him to delete my nudes that I’d sent him. He’s a nice guy, so I had faith that he would, and thankfully I was right and he told me that he already had because he knew that was something I would have wanted. Even that was a good thing I burst out in tears. 

I had cut things off with him because I didn’t feel like he had space for me (and he admitted he didn’t beyond anything casual) which would have been okay. But he would often say that he liked talking to me because it was a distraction, or because he was bored or lonely and there was nothing else to do and that made me feel so gross. So unwanted. Not that I was wanted around because I was fun or funny or interesting, but because there was literally nothing else to do. Forget the fact that I actually liked him, but who wants to hear that? Even as friends, who wants to hear that your friends want to hang out with you only because they have no other options? 

Or at least that’s how my brain heard it. My brain that suffers with depression and social anxiety and constantly tells me that I’m not wanted and I have nothing to offer. 

I know that a guy deleting your nudes is literally as low as the bar can get, but the fact that he did it knowing I’d want him to showed that he at some level understood me. That’s why I cried. Because I’m seeing that maybe I wasn’t there purely out of boredom. I was at least interesting enough for him to listen to me and listen seriously. Maybe he didn’t communicate himself well? Maybe I just got scared of being rejected that I rejected him before he could do it me... 

This was an issue I had in my last relationship too. My ex was not good with words at all. I once asked him what he liked about me and he couldn’t think of what to say (not even something shallow like “you’re beautiful”). We dated for 6 months before I broke up with him, and I still couldn’t tell you what it why he dated me. It seems dumb and I know that we shouldn’t have to depend on other people to validate us, but when your brain is constantly telling you that you’re not good enough, that you offer nothing, that no one likes you... knowing why people want to be around you and having them be good reasons (and not “because I have no other choice”) can really make a difference.

I just wish I knew how to stop sabotaging myself when I’m in situations where I’m not getting that. Overthinking and overreacting.  It makes me feel stupid for being this way but I literally can’t help it. If I could I would.",26May2020,1
19,"Well, I typically only deal with depression and severe anxiety. But recently about two or three months ago I started getting really detached from reality. People I’m close to looking like strangers, feeling outside of my body, and having really weird detached freak outs. I went to the ER. And the prescribed me Ativan and told me to see a psychologist. I did and wasted $110 on a 5 min meeting and prescribed me seroquel that made me worse and felt like a roofied psychosis panic attack. The Ativan helped more than that. But not rly for the psychosis. Now I have to go spend more money to get prescribed something else that may not even work, and I don’t have health insurance. I need help. I’m terrified. I’ve been trying to distract myself by staying busy and active. I eat healthy af. I’m 25, and ready to die, except I don’t want to really. I just want my life back. I guess, any tips? Best medication for it?",26May2020,1
20,"So basically I’ve been struggling for many years with Sadness and loneliness but only first opened up at the start of academic year. I’ve talked to a Counsellor but had to stop the sessions after a few weeks as I felt I was wasting his time as I always kept finding reasons (most of the time lies) to not go to a session. I had amazing support from my 6th form Psychology Teacher/Head of Form and Assistant Head and started feeling comfortable. 

However, everything changed around March 17th. This was when the UK began talking about its Covid Plan. Being In the last year of A-Levels we basically had to preemptively end our life as a student as the rest of the year was cancelled and exams stopped. Now, earlier in the year I had already decided I wasn’t in the right place to go to Uni so began to look apprenticeships. This is already been very stressful for me as whilst of my colleagues are likely to get unconditional offers, my career is in question as long-term apprenticeships are unlikely to start being considered for another few months.

On top of this, over the last few years I began to isolate myself away from people as I felt I was hindering more than helping them. This was all good because I was getting a decent amount of social health from 6th. However because of just floating between groups (basically being chill with everyone) I didn’t actually stay friends with anyone. This has been really illustrated during the lockdown, as due to my persistence that I won’t go out as to not risk my Mum and Brother with heart issues, I have only ended up speaking to:
- My Mum and Stepdad who I live with
- 2 of my brothers
- 3 of my eldest brother’s friends who I’ve played COD MW with.

This has led to me reaching a very low point (I normally have what I call my time of the month but this has been way worse than any before) I find it very difficult to get through a day and have spent most days waking up, maintaining my Sexual wellbeing in the evening (Something that I recently learned about and have found to be very positive thanks to Hannah Witton’s videos on YouTube) and then going to bed. Also recently I’ve lost how natural conversations work and have ended up talking a lot to fictional characters or celebrities in my head. 

I don’t even know if anyone is even going to see this but if anyone has and advice other than about calling professionals on how to get better or even just how to reach out to new people in a time like this (I thought about downloading Tinder but have the impression that people who use it aren’t looking for meaningful bondships on there).

23,"
I haven’t had an easy life. But I wouldn’t considered it tragedy.

I’m not naive to the hardships others have faced but my history hasn’t been a walk in the park either.

The anxiety probably began when I was eleven. Of course no one, including myself, would have labeled it as such. I’ve always kept my feelings inside, preferring to keep any negative emotions to myself then voice them out loud. I like to say it’s part of my personality, my therapist said I had been conditioned that way. Maybe it’s both.

The depression started in high school. Like all good things that come with being a teenager I traded acne and braces for depression and insomnia- I never liked doing things the easy way.

I never said anything about it though. Not really. 

It was decided that I need to speak with someone after I stopped being “vocal” about my feelings. It didn’t help. I would open a fracture into my mind and the therapist seemed satisfied with it and I so was I for a while. 

But sitting in the eye of the storm will do that. You can’t really understand the damage that is occurring till you walk through it.

The thoughts began when I was sixteen, stress and anxiety grew like poisonous vines coiling tightly in my mind. I couldn’t sleep and school was becoming too much, I’d escape into my own world using books and the internet as a coping mechanism. But I liked my world too much so I ignored my responsibilities and schooling causing my stress and anxiety to mount. And like any junkie I couldn’t wait for my next fix, needing more and igniting the cycle a new. 

My last year of high school was the literally plunge into the depth. It started with creeping thoughts; I’d be washing the dishes and find myself staring at the knife in my hand. A voice would whisper how easy it would be to slide the knife into my belly. If I found myself walking home alone after a stressful day, the passing cars would taunt me.

The internet didn’t help either. My depression fed off my anxiety and with each google search it would lie in wait with its jaws open. Something was wrong, surely but the few articles and psychology examinations left me helpless more then enlightened. 

I attempted to reach my parents but their attitudes had been lacklustre. Why would a seventeen year old be depressed? Academically I wasn’t rock bottom but I procrastinated and drifted too often. I wasn’t bullied, I had a good group of friends. I ate regularly and had no visible scars. I had adults that would “listen”. 
Why the fuck would I be depressed.



I can’t remember what day or even month it been when I decide to kill myself. 



I believe it happened during the winter I’d been home alone, I can’t even remember where my family had gone. I had been crying over a group project that was going terribly, my marks had been deducted as it was now late because of my procrastination. I was running out of time and no matter what I did nothing seemed to work. Anxiety attacks wracked my body, I had no one to run too. I slipped further and further into that hell, helpless to do nothing but let the black depths swallow me. 


I just wanted it to stop. 
I needed the pain to stop. 
The world was just too loud. 


I don’t know how long I stood in the kitchen staring at the cupboard, repeating the scenario over and over in my head.

The bottle of Tylenol was new. If someone went for it they wouldn’t notice the missing pills. I’d swallow a handful and go upstairs to bed. My family would think I was just sleeping and then come to wake me for dinner. 



It’s funny now, whenever I hear someone connect suicide with cowardice and the weak minded. I bite my tongue as to not let my secret out, to correct them that suicide takes a...strength or willpower that you never knew you possessed. A power I hope to never hold again. 


I guess I had spent too long contemplating my death. My mind slowly comprehending the garage door opening, my brothers voice was what woke me from my haze. His calls for me were like icy daggers to the heart.

My mom found me sitting down in front of my computer and asked why I was crying. I told her my tears were for my project.

I remember sitting on the couch numbly while my mom tried to fix my work. My grandma had laid my head on her lap, her nails scrapping my scalp playing with my hair. Each stroke was a bolt to the heart as I lay there silently crying. 



After that day, killing myself never became an option. My depression and anxiety certainly didn’t disappear but my hunger for life replaced my desire for death.

Life hasn’t been easier but I am nonetheless alive and I will keep fighting to be so. Because everyday I am reminded of what I can lose, of what I could have done.

I ended up going to therapy to talk about it and it did help, however, being away from them with the quarantine going, these thoughts have started to come back, this isn't helped by the fact that I see patterns, that are probably just coincidences, suggesting that they could be cheating, but in my mind they spiral out of control.

30,"This post will be long and messy, so apologies in advance.

To start off, I am 80% sure I have OCD. I have this bad compulsion that I have to repeat over and over until I feel it's perfect, and it is affecting my life to the point I am becoming s*icidal.

It started out as me formatting my Nintendo 3DS and just creating new accounts on it. I felt the need to do this because it was ""imperfect"" and it needs to be perfect. My siblings did grow tired of me doing it and questioned why I did it, but I could never answer. Back then, I didn't know why I did it, it just felt right. As years passed, I had gotten worse. I started formatting/resetting every device I had, cleaning them, and putting them on the charger. I also decided I needed to ""reset"" my life and get it together. I needed to become skinnier, prettier, smarter, etc. I needed to become a different persona. And if I made one small mistake like mispronouncing/wording things incorrectly, reacting a different way than I wanted to, being incorrect, or even making a small typo, I would have to start over again.

Every time I would ""reset"" my life, I would create another social media account because the previous one was ""imperfect."" So I have many accounts that are no longer in use. Probably over 1,500.
The longest I have kept an account was approximately 6 months. 
It bothers me that I can't keep 1 account. It's tiring to do this, but I have to, otherwise I can't do anything until I am ""perfect."" I truly just want to be able to not care and just stick with 1 account. But if I don't do this, it'll p*ss me off and stress me out tremendously to the point I can barely sleep at all. It stays on my mind until I do it. 

Of course, I get made fun of by my siblings and friends for creating so many accounts, but I really don't know if I can stop. I've tried so hard, but I can't and it truly exhausts me. I'm sick of it, and I really do feel like d*ath is the only option. I don't know if I'll ever get over this because it's been years.

Has anyone ever dealt with this? Can it be helped?
Is there any hope for me at all?

33,"I was in a relationship with my ex from Dec 2016 until Oct 2019 so just shy of three years. We met in a popular online MMO so it was long distance (UK/NL) but we met up 4-5 times a year for a week or so at a time. Not long in the grand scheme of things, but the physical side was there and healthy when it was. We argued as much as any other couple about petty things usually, but we were mostly fine. 

Only mid-last year did it heat up too much between around April and breakup in Oct, as he stopped doing something I was passionate about and gave it to someone else. My anxiety reached overdrive and then combined with work problems and debt, it all got too much for me and I got heavily suicidal. 

I reached out to him and sought help. An opportunity arose for him to give back the thing I was passionate about, and he said he'd consider it. But even in the midst of me being suicidal, he refused me. We had a last ditch attempt at mending things in September for our birthdays and it seemed alright. We were happy, we got on well, we agreed to try again. Barely two weeks later he broke up with me when the suicidal feelings returned.

Since then, we've fluctuated back and forth. He's on various occasions broken down and admitted he missed me and would like to try again when the time was healthy, sometimes dating things and saying stuff like ""after this, let's see how we are and consider starting anew"". Then the date would come and he'd suddenly be unsure and unclear, saying he never meant that, even suggesting it was my idea and he'd never agreed to it.

We continued on as friends ultimately. We'd hang out and play video games or listen to music or whatever, but nothing more than that. Two months or so ago, we had another of those maybe try again moments where he considered things. Then next thing I knew, he'd decided that actually, it's time to say ""actually, it will never happen again"". 

Around this time we'd also started doing a project together on his volition, where he wanted to do a thing and said he'd like my company when doing so. As of literally today, we're still doing said project, but recently it began involving other people. And in the middle of all this, one of them fell for him. I understand what it means being apart, but watching the pair literally flirting in front of me and even being sexual together on a night I was suicidal has just made things torturous. He's not particularly interested in her in a relationship sense, but she's all over him and about as subtle as a neon glow-in-the-dark sign at night in a desert. It feels like constant punishment and I just can't handle it.

Yes, before asked, the obvious thing would be to cut him out entirely. And I would like to. But the shared environment we have has a ton of friends in it. I don't really have many friends outside of this bubble, so it feels like cutting myself out of it will only cost me greatly. I feel like I'm just trapped between either constant torture as I watch him digital sex a girl right in front of me, or I lose a whole bunch of friends and hobbies just to escape him.

I just don't know what to do any more. The story probably misses a ton but please please please ask away anything and I'll answer as best I can. I need serious help (I'm applied to see a therapist for the fourth time in about two years but there's a waiting list) as I feel like I'm at absolute breaking point.

Thank you in advance.",26May2020,1
34,"I realized tonight I was bred to be an outcast and it has messed me up in a seemingly permanent way. I say it was bred, but that is only true in part. My genetics had a very helpful hand in it as well.

What I mean. 

I was born in a poor family, so that meant no video games, no bikes, and nothing that other kids my age were interested in. That lead me to being materialistic, jealous, and picked on. In turn, I resorted to thievery to get the things they made fun of me for not having. And of course that also had its hand in pushing me away.

I couldn’t see well, I had asthma, and I had many surgeries on my ears. Since I was always in ear casts and couldn’t breathe, I wasn’t physically able to keep up with the other kids. But they kept me around for the jokes, how kind.

My mother put her fear into me. Since she’s deeply rooted into her religion, she acts as if everything around her is some type of attack. I learned this well from her. I learned to never speak my mind because it will be met with questions and ridicule. I learned to think that I was better than everyone else while also feeling worthless. I learned a great deal of bad habits.

My father and his anger. He felt very comfortable expressing his grief to us kids. He was very vocal. He loved to tell us that he never wanted us and that he wants to die. I loved our talks.

I pissed the bed until I was 10ish  because of anxieties, and that gave me more anxiety. I wouldn’t stop pissing the bed until the doctor gave me sugar pills saying it would help. Since I didn’t know any better, I believed her. And hey, it worked.

I’ve met some great people in my adult years, and I’ve managed to fuck most of it up. And I met some awful people who’ve definitely managed to fuck me up. I wish I didn’t hold onto shit for so long, and make it so personal. I wish I had that control.

Before you can say it, I’ll say it for you. People have it far worse than me, yet handle it way better. Let me tell you something. I couldn’t give less of a flying fuck. I feel angry, hurt, and unloved. I had to let this out in whatever ramble I could manage.

I was always taught that I was a failure. At least I lived up to something.",26May2020,1
35,"I think I’m just now realizing that it’s not always right to always be a “good kid”. A kid who listens to parents, never goes out, never argues and obeys. I had learned that being a good kid avoided more arguments, got me praise, and kept the thin ice from breaking. But what did that get me? It gave me no childhood, the inability to deal with confrontation, and the inability to stand up for myself. If i do stand up for myself i feel guilty. Like i should always be pleasing others and if they’re upset it’s my fault. 

I don’t think it was worth being a good kid.",26May2020,1

37,"This might be a bit of a long one, so I apologize in advance.

I'm (30 f) trying to figure out what's wrong with me, but I can't afford mental health help or an assessment. I lost my health insurance after COVID-19 and never got my first appointment. Perhaps someone can give me an idea of what the problem might be. I'm not asking for a diagnosis.

For as long as I can remember, I've suffered from depression and horrible anger issues. I'm never violent, but I tend to snap at loved ones and get vengeful for things I've blown out of proportion. I never realize I've done it until after the fact. I know I'm a toxic person, but no matter how hard I try to overcome these wretched habits, I always sink back into them.

Part of me wants to blame the upbringing I had, but I also realize this is just an excuse.

A bit of history on my upbringing:
I have a sibling that's 3 years older than me. Older sibling was molested starting at the age of 4. The abuse lasted for years. Older sibling told our parents, but they did nothing about it. I was raped repeatedly starting at the age of 12, but older sibling says it started before that. We've since gotten together and hashed out our memories of things and have come to the realization that much of our childhood was us being conditioned to seek the attention and affection of men. Much of our childhood was filled with some form of abuse or another.

We also grew up in a home with constant fighting, verbal and mental abuse, and occasional physical abuse. (Older sibling had a chair thrown at them and I was punched, as small examples.) 

As an adult, I now see the problems I faced, but I'm also aware that they don't excuse my behavior.

Anyway, back to the now. I can't hold a job for longer than a year, I've failed college 3 times. I have spending problems, I've been married twice because both marriages failed due to my issues (I think.)

I should also mention that a huge factor in my depression is my health. I'm legally blind, half deaf, have severe degenerative disc disease, have had vertebrae fused, have heart disease, etc. It's a long list of stupid diagnoses. I can't keep up with the active lifestyles of any friends or my amazing boyfriend. (He knows about everything and is willing to walk the path with me.) I try and I do fairly well, but my back issues slow me down and I feel like a drag on everyone else.

In any kind of relationship, I tend to get clingy and need reassurance constantly. I'm always worried I'm going to upset them, that I've said something wrong. I'm constantly worried that they'll get sick of me and ignore me/ghost me. The list just goes on and on.

I just want some kind of idea what it is I'm dealing with mentally and a few suggestions to help myself get out of this crazy head of mine. I'm desperate to be better...",26May2020,1

39,So I’ve been suffering from depression and anxiety for over 7 years . My family looked down on medication such as anti depressants and anti anxiety. From my family and what they say to me about be depressed they believe it’s a thing I should do by myself without medication. My friends want me on medication and she’s been with me throughout my life. I’ve never really thought of medication but I was wondering if it really does help. I’ve been in low places before but it’s recently effecting everything now. I just want to know some stories and if it’s worth it over time. I’m scared to be on medication because I’ve never really seen myself outgoing and happy. I just want to know some thoughts on it and if worked out for someone you know or yourself.,26May2020,1
40,"I know this whole tangent about my life may be bothersome to some of you and I apologize in advance. I just need to get stiff off my chest and make my feelings clear.


Ive always suffered with my body image and mental health dating back to the fifth grade. I was constantly getting bullied so my self image began to drop and drop, then one day I said to myself that I wanted to simply die and escape. I would draw knives and guns pointing to my head on worksheets and eventually my teachers took me to counselers. They had reported my behavior to my parents and instead of a stereotypical ""are you okay"" or even ""I love you"" my parents scolded me saying I would go to hell for doing that and saying Im weak for it even crossing my mind, stuff like your getting us in trouble etc.This conditioned my 5th grade brain to learn that showing your true emotions to people will just lead to trouble for them and you. The counslers kept checking on me and I would simply say the desired answers and get it over with. The following year I decided that I would begin working hard acedemically and my new teacher really helped with that, that year was most likely the happiest year I would remember. Im that year I almost never thought of my body or self harm. The only issue I remember was my need to please others. I felt joyus everyday untill coming home where my parents being judgmental would nitpick every thing I do and talking about my body. The only escape I got from this was education and the need to escape from this emvoirment. I became so obsessed with school that the followimg years thats all my life was, untill I became burntout. I had lost the sole element that brought me motivation to live and slowly my body dismorphia came back along with suicidal thoughts. I was so unpleased with myself I would eat at most 1,000 calories and although I lost weight but I binge ate very often leaving me looking the exact same. After some time my mindset remaimed the same always walking through the hallways comparing my self and if I had thedue sightest bit of discomfort my mind would say to itsself to end it and just kill yourself. I wanted releif from all the pain, this formed into starving myself and exercising, now instead of being called fat by family I was bring called a stick or twig. Now I had another issue and decided to eat normally again, I was back to normal weight and although I was a healthy weight I began excessivly exercising just so I would feel bad when I ate food. Here I am now suicidal and ready to end it all while still hating my body and barely being able to eat without breaking down into tears by myself. There so much more things I want to talk ab but I cant formulate it into words. Im just lost, confused and the only thing preventing me from ending it all is the prospect of leaving this whole community of people around me to go enjoy life by myself, maybe with a dog and cat too.",26May2020,1
41,"I’m at my wit’s end and need some advice. I have a 14 year old boy with severe ADHD who is so addicted to his PlayStation/computer games that is almost impossible to get him back to the real world. Online classes during lockdown and the permanent temptation to drift off to games or YouTube videos while he should actually be on his sessions with his teachers made it specifically hard to control himself. 

Rules don’t seem to help because he doesn’t stick to whatever gaming-homework-family life schedule we agree upon. When it’s time for him to quit he freaks out, cries big tears, gets angry, claims he wants to kill himself. He just explained to me that he’s only happy in his gaming world. 
He is incapable of finishing his homework/assignments while acing his quizzes and tests. 

He’s taking medication but he doesn’t have enough of a “normal “ state of mind to make it through the day.

 So it was like any other day, my hubby went for a hike and I stayed home. I don't like leaving my house. It causes me great upset when I think about leaving my house... I have been diagnose with severe anxiety boarding on agoraphobia and severe depressive disorder. In layman's terms I don't want to leave the house ... EVER!!! 
But today I remember all I did, except it don't. I remember taking a nap, but my husband tells me I did other things. He has these tubes that when you blow into them they turn colors and depending on the color they can tell you how much alcohol you had to drink, like a safety thing so people don't drive drunk. He got them because I have a habit of drinking. I thought I'd stopped drinking a long time ago, but I blew into one of those tubes and it turned pretty colors meaning I drank today. I have no recollection of doing this, I have no recollection of drinking or buying alcohol. I don't know what to do. I think the term is dissociative amnesia. I am autistic, only recently diagnosed. I don't know if this has any bearing on the amnesia part, but I need help figuring this out as I can't afford normal psychiatry. I cannot afford much of anything.

44,"Hey guys, I feel kinda stupid posting here, because my problems feel pretty small compared to everyone else’s in this thread, but here goes. 

In the past few months of quarantine, I (18M) feel like my personality is just dripping away. Nothing really makes me laugh or excited anymore. It doesn’t help that I’m losing most of my hometown friends (I only have like 2 or 3 friends I try to hang out with), and I don’t text any of my college friends. The only person I regularly talk to is my girlfriend (20F), but that in it of itself is a whole problem. Around her, I feel sorry that I’ve become so boring, and I feel jealous that she has more friends and fun than me. Of course I never let that change how I act, because that’s not fair to her.

Ok, let me get back on track. Sometimes I lie awake at night thinking about how boring my life is, and how I just want to feel something. Occasionally this leads to me crying out of sadness, occasionally this leads to me crying out of anger, but most of the time I just can’t feel anything. Rarely I think about self-harm, but I flush those thoughts away quickly, because I don’t want to go down that road.

It’s only now hitting me. I decided in order to help them to reach out and do things with them every week, and to talk to them more often about their feelings. 

I feel like the realization of everything is only now hitting me after a few hours of learning everything. And I’m really worried. I’m scared. I don’t know what to do. Thankfully I don’t think they are going to ever try again and I know they are not alone. I want to be there more for them. I worry now about them because I never thought they’d ever do something like this. And I don’t know how to be there for them and how to help them. Besides spend more time with them and talk about their feelings and be their friend. But I don’t know what to do. I feel helpless. I feel like I helped them and I want to be there for them. 

Because of my ptsd my feelings are always delayed so it’s only now that this is hitting me. And I feel guilty about it. I don’t know how to help this person that I love. How do I help them? What do I do? Is being supportive enough? I don’t know how to feel about it. 

I also learned that I was possibly molested as a young child today. I’ve always had weird memories from childhood and weird reactions to things but I never understood it. I was like younger than five so all I remember is that I was screaming and crying not to go to my neighbor’s house, and locked myself in the closet. I also remember thinking that the little baby they had was pulling my hair and hurting me but it hurt a lot and I couldn’t get away from the pain. I remember panicking not to go to the house and one thing I didn’t remember is that my sibling said that I said it was the man who was hurting me. Also as a kid I was thinking some fucked up things, even before being traumatized by a different experience later in life, and I know my thinking wasn’t normal but I never considered that I could’ve been abused. And now I don’t know if I was or if my sibling is wrong. I remember my mom said she worried when she noticed this man always asking me to sit on his lap. And my melt down when she was going to bring me there. 

But I don’t know if I was because I don’t remember anything and I don’t know what to do with this information. I don’t have any memory of abuse. But I was maybe 4 at the time so I just...don’t know but it makes sense when I think about the memories that don’t make sense to me.",26May2020,1

I'm able to hurt people emotionally because I'm so disconnected. But the pain I feel afterwards is unimaginable.

I never learn, I continue making the same mistakes over and over because it's the easiest way. My mind constantly beats me up internally all day. The small things, the big things. But of course as bad as I feel all the time I just can't stop myself. So my brain's internal beating up turns into external. 

There's good days and there's bad days, but how much I hate myself that day corresponds to how much unpleasantness I feel. I don't even want it to end.

I just happened to notice because I like looking at people’s music taste. And all the song titles recently have been about depression. Last night he posted a song with the title including suicide. Today he posted a song literally named I am depressed. 

I really don’t know what to do. I know back in freshman year of high school when I was really suffering, I really wanted someone to talk to. But since this person doesn’t know who I am would that make it too awkward? And what if I’m making a bigger deal about it??? Like he usually doesn’t post anything but song titles anyways. It’s just been recently that he has started posting the dark stuff. Like he’s an “emo” boi I guess. But emo doesn’t have to mean suicidal. Like I don’t want to make a big deal out of it. But I also don’t want to lose another middle school friend to depression. 

Like last week someone I knew in both elementary school and middle school killed herself. I don’t know if this like spurred him on, because again I’m not close to him, but at the same time. The song titles are literally about death and I want them to be ok. Like should I?? I’m worried. But I also know he has a really close group of friends so I don’t want to intrude on him or anything.

Since then I've been isolating myself from my friends, losing sleep, not reacting properly to things I see or hear, twitching, uncontrollably laughing at inappropriate times, self harming, you name it. I thought drugs would help but they seemed to push people away.

56,"Hello, so recently I've been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder. Depression runs in my family ( I have seasonal depression), so it wasn't much of a surprise to my mother that I struggled with these things. Anyways, I know getting advice from the internet isn't the best way to get assistance, but I want some form of advice from someone who doesn't know me.
I don't know if I want to accept treatment. I could do therapy, there might be some medications I could be taking (antidepressants, xanax possibly, etc.), or I could just self medicate. I've been dealing with my anxiety my whole life, so i really don't think therapy or pills are going to change anything.
If you have anxiety or depression, and you use any of those treatments,  lcan you tell me if they are beneficial or not? Please and thank you.",26May2020,1

After he told me that I should shave because it makes me look like as if I never took a shower (Ik it’s weird but bare with me), he looked at me and said something like “what?! Did I hurt your feelings?!?” Then later on he started saying “what?! Do you think life is perfect where no one can hurt you?! Is that what your therapist has been saying to you?! that no one should hurt your feelings?!”. Later on when we got back home I helped him with tasks and we got along and apologised and I forgave him but I still felt hurtful.

59,"TLDR: Mostly just needed to rant and let everything out. So dont read if you dont want to lol 

Let me preface this by saying I'm on antidepressants (pristiq 100mg) and have officially been diagnosed with depression and a whole lot of anxiety, mostly social. 

Lately I feel like everything doesnt matter. The world is going to shit and not getting any better because people wont stay home or listen to the rules when they do leave the house. And I work at an ""essential store"" and i've had to take a day off due to mental health being so bad but my supervisor probably wouldnt let me take the day off because of mental health so i lied and said i had the stomach flu because for some reason stomach problems are always valid but wanting to off yourself isnt. Anyways, my boyfriend has been snippy lately and i know its not my fault whenever he loses his temper and yells at me but i still feel like it is. And today i got an email that could turn into me getting expelled from school (probably wont happen but my anxiety is taking over) and i am just trying to get out of school asap so i can finally move on with my life but with covid i cant do most classes i need to graduate because labs are being cancelled. So i just feel fucking useless and that i'll never graduate and that my work doesnt care that the state the store is in is literally driving their employees insane and i just posted a post (i have deleted it since) on reddit and someone replied with ""dont ever post on the internet again"" and i just. Cant. I stream on twitch, i dont make much money from that and im trying to grow my channel and such but i cant even keep a consistent schedule when i feel like this. I had to cancel stream (again) today because of my mental health. I just feel like being dead would be easier than trying to get past this rough patch. I also dont have a therapist anymore and even if i did, we woulsnt be able to have sessions because of covid. And i want to go off of my meds because i find that my personality is better when I accidentally skip a day of them. Like i find pristiq realy dulls me out and makes me seem like a zombie waking. And idk i just feel like i have fucked up everything especially with the email i got today from my professor about me possibly cheating and im just in fucking shambles and no one seems to care but jm also not too open about stuff like this either cause i know no one wants to hear my sad shit when they're all dealing with their own. Im also hella broke and wont be able to afford school next year apparently because my student loan is cutting me off?? Idk, my mom usually deals with the financial stuff for school i dont really understand how that all works. Anyways i just mostly needed to rant and talk and hope someone will listen and not tell me that this isnt a place to rant or that i should never post on the internet again.

60,"It’s been about three years since my mental health took a significant turn and put me through serious treatment. The signs were always there that my mental health was shit through childhood, but 2017 I battled with multiple suicide attempts, an eating disorder, and really got a diagnosis. I was hospitalized multiple times, did a long term ED inpatient/residential stay and spent months in a PHP/IOP program. In the end I got a handle on my BPD and PTSD from childhood trauma and have been putting the skills I learned in treatment to good use. Since then, I’ve been stable. Like, really stable. No medication changes. No real need to see a therapist on the regular. Aside from meds at night, things felt normal. I was managing all my symptoms and really happy with how my life was doing.

Until the other night. I think I had my first real “flashback.” My husband was amazingly supportive through it, but it’s left me shaken. It’s a new one for me. It’s thrown off my confidence in my mental health. It’s sent my anxiety into overdrive cuz now I worry I could have another and because it’s new for me, I only know what triggered the one, but not what could trigger another.

I dunno, I felt like I needed to get it off my chest to help with my anxiety. My family seems to freak out if I so much as share mental health awareness posts on social media, so I didn’t wanna talk about suddenly having a flashback with them and I don’t have a lot of friends I really share in mental health struggles with.

I have been in a wierd state of mind for about 6 years, I was never able to speak about it freely exept to people on the internet because I am terrified of my dad finding out. For him I'm his happy child, but the truth is, I don't remember what it's like to be genuinely happy. I know I have some sort of trauma cause I heard that it's often accompanied by some sort of memory issue and I remember barely anything from my childhood especially with my mom. Anyways for a couple of months I've been kinda dull I've been feeling mostly numb and I have no idea how to feel something again and it's just been worse since I've seen my mom on mother's day. Her and my sister have the same kind of personnality so the both of them at the same time while trying to look happy was extremely exhausting and I've been feeling like ahit since I've been.


Idk where this is going but recently I've heard my stepmom say very clearly that I'm dissapointing because i don't have a job or a car yet (I'm 17) and I wanted to yell at her from my room that I applied but they're slow so I can't do anything until they employ me. Since then I just feel like such a dissapointment like I'm failing 5 or 6 oyt of 8 classes, I never leave my bed exept for diner cause if I don't eat diner my dad is gonna start asking questions and my room is constantly a mess cause well I have no energy or motivation to do anything. My life is shit and the only reason I'm staying is to not make my grandma live that I don't want her to live losing her grandchildren.

Oh and I can't get therapy cause first I have no idea where to find one and it costs a lot even in canada and I really don't want my family knowing. So i guess I'll just live my life like this.

I need some advice

Apology in advance cause I’m shit at writing.

So lately for the past year or so I’ve been feeling like shit all the time. I don’t know if it’s like depression or something like that cause my parents don’t really believe I could have any issues since I have a house and food and I’m not struggling. But idk I’ve been losing friends and I don’t really think I have any friends left, and I’m super socially awkward so it’s hard to make new ones.

So like I’ve tried stuff to feel better, not things I should do but I did them cause everyone talks about who they make you feel better, like drugs but they just made me feel worse. I started self harming and I think that led me to be suicidal. This was about around august last year and I think that’s what made me start losing friends, cause I was just being... different? Idk I’m just assuming.  

So yeah I’ve been thinking about making this post for a while cause idk what to do, I’m lost. I can’t tell my parents cause the only time I tried that my dad went mad and broke my Xbox 360 And my phone, and then told me that I was useless and he rather be wasting his money on my other siblings since I just complained about everything (which I didn’t, I’m always very grateful cause I know I’m way better off then most people in my country). And then I stared having anxiety attacks for a while and I don’t want to go back to that.

I’m lost. I don’t know what to do, and I’ve never told anyone about this cause I don’t really have anyone to tell, so maybe I’m just venting but I’m hoping maybe someone here has some advice on what I could do.",26May2020,1
67,"I had my first session and basically gave a run down on my life. I was diagnosed with major depression and generalized anxiety and PTSD in the past but those symptoms flared up again and was worse. I had a accident in my life where I was severely assaulted and got my car stolen. This assault left me with broken/loose teeth, fractured left jaw, and fractured chin. I had to get surgery and I was never the same after that incident, basically went into deep depression. I had hiccups in my school and job due to the accident. Constantly on edge and having panic attacks. Always becoming aggressive when stressed out. I explained this to my psychiatrist and he noted everything and decided to give me PTSD medications for the nightmares and see how I do. Second session comes around and i told him that my sleep is okay now and no nightmares but I have the feelings of depression/anxiety and just being angry still. He gets offended and tells me that my age is a factor and young adults like me shouldn't even feel depressed or anxious and I'm still young and have nothing to worry about. Not many young people go through a difficult time like getting assaulted.

Im lost in a world, a big world.
 i remember my friend who is also lost in this world. i wanted to tell her, you say the right questions! but you search them in all in the wrong places! dont worry about people. i dont wanna impress boring people! i wanna to impress the upbeat guy! impress your peers. i dont talk at work! never do i talk! i just say hi and stare into my fantasy and talk to myself. it helps me feel better about myself. i wanna be a comedian but im too weird. weird comedian with a sense of psychedelic madness and surreal questioning. yay.  i wanna talk for hours with no one. i dont care. i wanna express myself. i wanna a girlfriend as weird as me! but those exist in another timeline. maybe i dont either. maybe i do? maybe i dont? i dont know. well bye! or not! i feel alone, too alone.

Ever since I was a kid I’d get extremely scared of horror movies and anything “scary,” and it still affects me at the age of 18.

I will be sleeping with my lamps on tonight. 

 As stated earlier, this has always been a thing. In middle school it was Creepypastas, as a new-adult it is horror films and pictures. I know it’s fake (I LOVE the horror genre and often watch behind-the-scenes stuff), but it’s like my subconscious refuses to acknowledge that fact and I am terrified at night/alone/in the dark/etc.

80,"I have semi-recently been experiencing things that are abnormal, relative to myself; and I’m at a lost at this point. To get to the point, I think I started to slowly unravel from reality. At the beginning of the pandemic actively stopped communicating with my friends and blocked them on all messaging services, because I believed (and still kind of do at points) that they were all plotting against me. The details of this “plot” ranged from simply an organized coup to drop me from the friend group, all the way to government spies and robots and just wires and shit (more on that later). I then sort of started to experience sensations and for a bit a voice. Mainly the sensations were like bugs crawling all over me or sometimes like spiderwebs were being spun around me, this was nothing new, in times of high stress those sensations have occurred, it’s just now they were happening with no apparent trigger. The voice however, was entirely new. For reference I have an internal monologue and will, like most people, have imaginary conversations; but, I never actually “hear” the response, I mentally formulate the words, however they aren’t voiced in my head. This time though, it was a voice that invaded my internal monologue, when no “conversation” was occurring and I didn’t have say over what it was saying. This voice went in and out for a few days, I referred to it privately as a voice of a God or some other mystical power, and would beg for it to come back and talk to me at times. The big event though was when I went running. I had this grand idea that should go for a run, and use the trail behind my house at 12 am in non athletic gear and barefoot. I have gone on midnight runs before, but this time I had almost double the adrenaline and no control. To be honest I have shit endurance, but unlike any other time I have ran this trail I was able to clear it in what felt like 20 seconds. After I cleared the first hill, I, and I don’t know why, took off my pants and started running again. I’d equate it to blinking or breathing, I didn’t actively say to myself “time to run ass naked in your neighborhood,” I just did it. About half way through the run I started thinking about telling the “truth” to my friends and I began rapidly typing in the notes app stuff along the lines of government robots and how fake everyone is etc. The only thing that stopped me from sending it was that I thought I saw a person watching me. I started running back home, convinced people were after me. 

I have had some worries about my mental health before the pandemic and isolation, but I fear that what I’m experiencing is just me going stir crazy, which would invalidate almost all of it. I still haven’t talked to any of my friends, I still sometimes feel bugs, and I have continued to experience a lot of other odd behaviors. I don’t want to self diagnose because I feel as if my brain will take the symptoms that Dr. Google spurts out and as a result force me to “experience” them, like it’s all one big trick.

81,"Years ago, a man who I believed was my friend had just dumped his cheating girlfriend and I’d just been broken up with by an abuser so I was in this very vulnerable, lonely state.

He seemed so sweet and patient and always assured me I could trust him and would talk with me through all my hurt and doubt and we had a few intense months of just constantly being together, doing everything together, lots of sex, etc. and then he just suddenly went cold and disappeared. 

Come to find out, all that pretending to love me and care was all fake because he was pissed at his cheating ex and just wanted to get laid out of revenge and boredom. But he was so incredibly convincing in a way that I have never trusted anybody again. I’ve heard it all. Every nice thing, every reassuring thing, I’ve heard it all and it was a lie. I haven’t had a single healthy, lasting relationship since because I don’t know what to believe anymore.

82,"Howdy all. First time posting on Reddit, bear with me. I'll try to briefly describe my situation, but it's a lot.

I am an 18 yo college student, chemistry/physics, living at home with family. First of all, my college life is busy and stressful as I take close to the maximum number of units(and chemistry/other classes I have to take are difficult) and I work one(now actually two) part time jobs. I've managed to get better at handling stress(much better than in high school, when stress literally almost killed me) but it's still an issue. Second, my family is very difficult to be around(they're supportive but it actually can be very frustrating and stressful to spend time with them) and there is very little privacy in my life(very frustrating, especially for next few parts). Third, I am a closeted bisexual man(I've only ever talked about it with my best friend) and I don't know how my family would react(but I just feel in my gut like some of them wouldn't react well). Fourth, I truly do love my best friend as just that, but often think of them as more, and it hurts(and has been hurting more and more recently) because they already love someone else. They've been having issues/been upset with their SO a lot, but I know(from a conversation a long time ago) that they don't want to try dating again because it is tough(and they say they truly love their SO). Part of me knows they're in love and I've got no chance, but the issue is that part of me still believes I have a shot with them. Fifth, there is nobody I can talk to. I can't talk to my best friend about lots of it(because I can't tell them that I like them more than just as friends, and also don't feel like I can talk about some other stuff). My family wouldn't understand my issues or they'd say something that would make it worse(my brother casually brought up how my mother thought I was suicidal a few years ago, like it was no big deal and I will never talk about anything important with him again, he simply doesn't understand how to be sensitive/mindful).

I've done a pretty good job at holding my life together so far(despite every setback that comes my way, like a big surgery right before the start of last semester which I am still recovering from). However, I am beginning to lose control and slip up. I've had four or five panic attacks in the past month or two, which is extremely unnormal for me. I have also had an issue with things randomly making me feel bouts of extreme emotion(lately it's been a lot of anger/loneliness), like little explosive episodes where I can hardly control myself/my mind. I honestly don't think I can hold it all together anymore, and I am worried what will happen when it all comes crashing down. I know I won't hurt anyone, I'm just not that kind of person, but I'm afraid that I will never emotionally/mentally recover. Lately I have been feeling such intense self-hatred that it actually scares me. Like I said, I'm lost and I feel like I'm losing my control over anything and everything.

Please, if anybody has any advice they can share or tips for getting my life back on track, I'd be so grateful if you could share them. I'm feeling hopeless and I need to figure something out soon. (P.S. Therapy is not the answer for me, I went when I was a little kid and it was traumatizing/very harmful). Thanks in advance everybody.",26May2020,1
83,"Hello. So I work as a creative, the issue also overlays my life in general.

She situation is burning right now, I have a meeting to present my work in couple hours, but I'll not make it. It's bad, but not detrimental this time. I can move it one day.

It does not solve the issue though. I feel panicked, body is overburdened, heart is indescribable, but the worst part is the cloudy mind, panicked mind. 

My task is to create design guidelines and lead the team, it's the biggest scale project I had so far. Some visuals go through my mind, but they change every second, since the mind is denying all of them as not good enough and i freeze without being able to grab any. I spent couple of days trying, but the output is almost zero. Procrastination was heavily involved.

Now I'll be facing the moment of asking to postpone and already feel the shame and guilt. But then I'll be facing one more try and I'm terrified. I get to break down at times and get completely out of reality.

On the brighter note, even though I don't trust myself with this, deep down I know I can do it, the project is well suited for me, I am experienced, just not able to function in this panic mode.

What do I do, how?

I practice meditation, dance meditation and cold showers for a little while now, also tried the Wim Hof breathing. these things work, but it's very brief until I spiral down again. There is so much resistance and fear inside, I want to remove myself from the project, but it's a good opportunity for me, plus I don't want to lose the fight.",26May2020,1
84,"For the past 7 years I've been dealing with depression most of it appeared around the time that a friend took advantage of me. Most days I could hide it and it was easy to move on with my day but since being on both control it was become so much worse. In the past 6 years I've changed birth control from the pill, nuva ring, the depo, and now the patch and all have the same effect. I become so depressed that I've actually contimplated death even while working. I'm an LVN and sometimes I walk by a window with a big screen and I've touched it to see how weak it is. I'll be laughing and smiling and having a ""normal"" interaction with co workers and patients but deep down the whole time im just thinking of dying. I'm going to therapy and I have a supportive husband and a loving dog, a perfect life but I hate that I can't enjoy it. I wonder if the solution is to stop the birth control and continue therapy since I still have traumas I have never worked out till just this year, or if I stay on it or switch it to a new and continue therapy, but I'm actually scared. I feel like I might actually try to commit suicide. No one else knows besides my husband and my therapist but even some days I lie to them and say I am ok.",26May2020,1
85,"I'm not quite sure what's wrong with me. I feel like my mental health is deteriorating being around my family and no one else. During the mornings, I'm completely fine and happy even. But when the afternoon hits I feel a little less than great. By the time it's the evening I feel like I have this huge pit of despair. I'm not quite sure how to describe it other than that. It doesn't seem that bad, but I've noticed other things too.
     I feel constantly on end, just the other day my brother was over my shoulder and I don't know why, but I slapped him and I feel so horrible about it because I hit his eye. He's ok now, it wasn't that hard, but I don't get why my first response was violence. I keep remembering how my mom treated me as a child, locking me outside, even just for a little bit, when I was too scared to take a shower, hitting and slapping my hands, screaming at me whenever I did something wrong or lied because I didn't want to get in trouble, ignored my plea for help as a preteen when I was having what I assume was an anxiety attack, etc. It doesn't help that my mom slapped me in the face last week and called me basically a disappointment and has been yelling all week, which kind of trigger these memories. 
     My sister is also not helping at all. She use to be a lot worse, but I'm always so jumpy around her. She use to lock me out of our room, yell at me, and hit me, but she stopped. Now all she does is scoff and sneer at me, but it's really her problem and not mine at least. But when ever I don't expect her to be around the corner I jump so badly. The same is with my mom. 
     I did have a bit of a support system, who was my best friend, but I only ever told her about my sister. As well as the fact that my best friend feels so detached, but I can't tell her anything because she'll tell her mom and her mom will tell mine and it'll just be a disaster I feel like. Also, I feel like I'll just weigh her down because she has a lot of problems to deal with as well, but they're not as emotionally and mentally based.
     Another thing that I noticed is how I get so much anxiety just trying to ask a question to an adult. I already had a hard time talking to adults, but it's gotten worse to the point I'm sweating and my heart is racing. And finally to top off this mess of a person (me) is when I'm at the lowest of my day I have the urge to hurt myself in some way. I haven't let myself do any harm to me, but I'm afraid that I'm going to worse and worse. I can't reach out to any adults because of quarantine and my parents will just brush it off like the last time I asked for help. I don't know what to do. I know I'm not as bad as some of the people here because I have so many things going for me and I've should have been getting better because I'm at pretty much the best point of my life, but it's not. It's just getting worse.",26May2020,1
86,"I can’t figure out what’s wrong with me. I cycle through extremes of different moods really quickly.

I feel like most of the time my brain is on autopilot. I don’t really feel anything and I couldn’t really care less about anything but I just go through my regular cycle. Wake, go to school, come home, go to sleep. 

Then often I feel a sharp turn where I’m feeling euphoric. I feel like I can do anything and I’m super confident. I’m often very hyperactive in this stage and talk a million miles an hour.

Then I can often feel super depressed. I have this intense feeling of hatred for myself, my academic work, feel like I’m letting everyone down and shame for my sexuality. There’s a voice in the back of my head constantly telling myself, I’m worthless and I should kill myself and I fantasise about it because I’m sick of exisiting and want to do nothing but lay on my bed. I never actually tried to kill myself (I’m afraid of the physical pain) but I have experimented with using a noose out of bedsheets around my neck when I felt like this. But this made me cry really hard after doing this.

These extreme moods only last for a couple hours and after they’ve passed I’m usually back to normal. it makes me think that I’m overreacting and that asking for help is insulting to those who experience mental illness. 

These moods can happen for either no reason at all or can be related an event in my life that’s triggering. I fell into a depressive episode after watching a romantic movie and I have no idea why it set me off.

I’m just fucking done with this shit (either feeling super depressed or super energetic/happy) I hate both.

I have no idea what to do, because anytime I try to associate these symptoms with any kind of mental illness they don’t match anything. Which again makes me feel like shit because it makes me feel like I’m detracting from the real experience of those who suffer real mental illness.",26May2020,1
87,"Hello! I realized awhile ago how much people misunderstand mental wards at hospitals and how inpatients are treated within them, so I wanted to make a video answering questions and talking about misconceptions.

88,"So from what I know, I’m not happy in the situation I’m in. I have a history of mental illness but I feel like it’s only getting worse, My mom had to move in with my tia because she doesn’t have a house right now. And it’s cramped with 11 people including me, and I only feel comfortable at my dads house because there’s less people their. But everytime I cry (I’m 13 and male) my Tio HAS to record and laugh at me, he’s been doing it ever since I was little and I don’t know why he’s doing it if it’s not making me stop, it just makes me cry more. I know it’s unnatural for a 13 year old cry, but every bad thing I’ve done in my life keeps flashing back at me, I can’t focus on positive anymore, just negative. And with my cousin, we used to get along, but private stuff happened that make me regret a lot of things and make things awkward. I don’t like sharing a room, I don’t like it when people ignore my uncle teasing me. All I have over at my moms to make me happy is my cat and my phone. And my mom said that the earliest we could leave is in November because that’s when she graduates nursing school. Now I know she can’t do much because she only has little money, but I’m pretty sure we can find another way other than this. I’ve been taking all this stress and just storing it away or unleashing it on furries in Roblox. I want someone to talk to, like a therapist. I don’t really like saying it, but my love for my uncles family is just decreasing. I just like being alone, and I want my own space. It might just be puberty hormones or whatever but I just want something to take me away from this, this stupid virus isn’t helping at all either, also stress eating is something I do a lot even though I complain about my weight. I have so many insecurities that my mom doesn’t notice but I do. I just hate it there, I’m at my dads for a week so, at least it’s a break from them, I’ve taken piano for whatever reason, I don’t know if It helps though. I’m done venting, I’ll try to make the best of things here.",26May2020,1
89,"Okay so as long as I can remember I’ve always had these mood swings. I’ve been in therapy for a year or two but since quit after my suicide attempt I’m doing much better now but still not completely better. These mood swings are getting worse and I’m wondering if they are just bipolar or the like. 

I often experience very low lows and my mood will continue to change extremely quickly. There are triggers and each trigger seems to bring about a different kind of me I can become extremely narcissistic and cruel doing things I would never in some scenarios and doing things are just things I don’t enjoy usually. Each trigger seems to bring about a different sort of me like normally I don’t like music but for an hour or so I’ll like this or that music acting completely different from my normal self. I retain all memories and what seems to be sanity although this whole post makes me seem a bit odd and maybe a bit slow as this just seems like it might be bipolar.

I'm having major withdrawal symptoms
- unusual sleep patterns
- constant state of bleh (dizziness, tiredness, nausea, bowel issues, mood swings, hot and cold flashes, and just 0 motivation) 

How long would these usually last? My doctor said it could last from a week up until 3/4 months as I've been on such a high does for so long. 

Any advice?",26May2020,1
91,"Just to start this off, I have never used reddit before. I mean I’ve looked at posts on here because I feel like it’s an unbiased place where people give there honest opinion. I don’t know if this is the right place to post this, but I really just need to get shit off my chest. I feel so alone. There’s nothing I do that makes me feel better other than smoking, which usually only helps about 30% of the time, and the other 70% I just get more sad and in my own head when I’m high. I’m the middle child in my family, yet I’ve always taken the role as the leader. My father died when me and all my siblings were young. I’ve never realized it up until these last few years of my life (I’m 19) but it’s left a huge hole in my life. I constantly feel empty and alone because I always feel like I need to be perfect for my mother yet set an example for my siblings because I am the only one who seems to be doing well in life. I have amazing grades and internships in line. I have so many friends. So many people genuinely care about me and love me, yet I feel so alone. I don’t know why. I just want to be happy in life. I sit in my room and think about everything I have and wonder why I’m so sad. My mother has done nothing but be incredibly wonderful to us and has done the absolute best she can to raise us. She makes good money, and has provided us with everything we will need in life. I feel like I can never come to her with anything because why would I? She’s done nothing but work hard and care for us so why would I stress her out even more? And it sucks because I don’t even feel like I can talk to my brothers because of how immature they are. I’m constantly having to remind them (especially my older brother) to do things like clean the dishes, turn off the TV, do things our mother asked us to do, and just about every other basic house hold task most humans can do. I feel so pathetic for venting about something so trivial, but I feel like I have no safe space because I’m either trying to impress my mother/get her attention or trying to make sure my brothers do what the fuck their supposed to do. It’s been weighing on me for years, and it’s just all built up and I’m tired of it. I’m tired of trying to parent them because it’s not my job. The highlight of my week is getting fucked up with my friends and going to parties. The only thing I care about is forgetting my life and just absorbing my friends attention because it’s the only thing I have in my life that I know won’t fail me. The other day, my younger brother came to my room to give me something and as he was leaving, he accidentally said “thanks dad”. It sounds so minuscule, but why would he call me that? We don’t have a dad. We never have. Why would he suddenly decide to use that word. I love that I can be somebody that my brothers look up to, but the responsibility weighs on my shoulders like a truck, even though it shouldn’t. I know I should be grateful for my life, and I am extremely grateful, I just wished all the eyes weren’t on me to be doing my best. My mom had 5 siblings, so that means lots of cousins. I love them, a lot, but I know what they think of me. I am younger than most of them, and a lot of them look at me as just a drunk college kid who is too into himself. I don’t know how to describe it, but I constantly feel like I’m being judged around them. This doesn’t apply to all, there are a few who I genuinely feel 100% comfortable around and trust, I just wish I could feel that way about all of them. Again, I know how stupid that sounds but we were always with our cousins growing up because as siblings our parents were very close, so I just wished they wouldn’t look at me the way they usually do. I try so hard to be the best I can be for my mom. I really do. I make dinner most nights for our family. Again, I’m about to sound pathetic and stupid, but I hate it. I cook alone in the kitchen for usually 2 hours because I want them to like what I cook. It’s so important to me. But I hate being alone. Just cooking and knowing it’s only for them. I don’t know if just makes me feel even more alone. I know my brothers likely also struggle with similar feelings given that we all experienced the same losses and struggles, which makes me feel weak for complaining so much about it. I’ve just never said any of this stuff out loud so I just felt like I needed to put it somewhere. My youngest brother was born with a heart disease and had to get a heart transplant because of it, which occurred simultaneously with my dad getting cancer and dying, which made everything 1000x worse for my mother. It’s stuff like this that makes me never want to tell my mother anything, because I absolutely hate the idea of her worrying about me. It just doesn’t sit right after everything she’s done, she doesn’t deserve to stress more. I don’t know. Again, I’m sorry if this is not the right sub reddit. I genuinely just don’t know.

96," Ever seen pickle rick? that stuff is funny

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start properly.

Hello I'm Abdelrahman and I am 20 years old, I'm Egyptian with some Greek origins as I believe. I have several problems within my mentality and I think I have some chemical imbalances. So let's dig in the juicy stuff!

When I was being birthed my head got stuck so they had to do a c section which Is why the back of my skull looks weird (it'll be relevant later) growing up in a third world country where religion is interfereing with almost every aspect taught me that people are so gullible. And they cling on to it because they rely on high power. However growing up in my families I wasn't 100 percent abused but I was also abused, like they'd make me go to the barber and shave by head because they hate my hair and almost say comments like ""your hair is so shit and rough and doesn't even look good"" I have a hair rough curly hair texture. And stuff like that, I grew up never liking my own appearance, I'd still take care of myself because I'm not stupid.

The reason I don't think I'm a normal person is because even though I am having difficulty with almost everything especially having suicide thoughts I reason with it, I know the causes of my problems and I know why they're happening, I have the usual stuff you'd see people write on this reddit so you know the drill. My major problem is that I am never good enough and I mean it, my existence and my character and my looks and my behavior all of them combined, they aren't attracting enough for people to like me, I grew up hating people and wanting to be alone obviously I was a naive kid and now that I realize I'm a social creature it fucking sucks because let's be honest there's people out there who have friends but they say they don't because they want specific people not just normal friends, if I had one fateful capable friend who would do things like helping me and what not, I wouldn't be typing this here.

I am extremely analytical and I know the voice of my brain when it goes wrong, I have positive thoughts and they really help but I am tired of people telling me to keep holding on and give me sympathy, I am not a puppy who needs hugs.

When I gotten my results last year on my retake (I'm still doing them) I gotten the same grades, I blacked out and wanted to suicide, I know suicide isn't the answer and I know it's wrong but Im fair to myself, what impact have I made in this world, what did I do for others how many lives have I helped or even saved, ZERO, I have absolutely none of that, I'm lying to myself when I say I do or when I say that I'm going to be big or try again and again to be better because my subconscious tells me you're insane for trying again and again for the same result. You'd tell me to think about how others would feel, if I do die, I'd have the funeral and some relatives would be sad but move on and that's it, it's like as if I wasn't there in the first place, people on discord and games would ignore me and wouldn't really bother to text because I'd be offline, people on social media would message but then stop because I wouldn't be there. IT'S LIKE MY ABSENCE IS AS GOOD AS MY PRESENCE.

Like can you imagine every time you do something trying it again and again, and your brain tells you that you're insane because the term applies to it, so shit keeps fucking up, I'm not aiming to be perfect I just want to be comfortable

Obviously you'd wonder why I don't have a job at that age at least, it's because I'm living with my parents in Qatar, you'd think it's a rich country but no its shitty as fuck filled with snobby idiots. They have a modern slavery job system, where when you apply for a job you have to sign your own sponsorship to the company and they take you in their accommodation, obviously I can't do that shit because I'm with my parents, I wanted to work since 16, I went on multiple job interviews and I always try rejected because I refused to sign their shitty contract, they do this to millions of less fortunate migrants and laborers. So now you know why I'm kinda stuck.

So all of these problems combined, I try to distract myself by gaming and playing mmos and calculating my gear, or drawing artwork for my book that I'm writing or exercising daily which is hard because I have high metabolism and I'm not attractive. It all gets to me and my mother would've aborted me, all I'm having is misery and problems which I hide, I exist and I don't want to live long enough to be a failure 30 year old with nobody and a shitty job. My mother should have aborted me, I was never meant to live.

She doesn't care about me. That's it. That's my family. The friends I have are few and they don't know about my depression. The ones that knew before I wronged. I deserve to die.

I'm 24, I don't know how to drive. I've never been in love. I don't have real happy memories. That sounds really dramatic but it's true. I haven't really experienced anything because of how I grew up. I feel so behind on life. I don't need to be extraordinary. I just want to be content. 

I'm really scared. I want life and living so bad but I'm so scared of it. I've been so stagnant my entire adult life. And here I am. Stagnant again. With 49 people ahead of me in the suicide lifeline chat. I don't want to be here anymore. I don't want to be anymore. There's no reason for me

Hey guys

So I have a few problems in my life and I don't know how to get over these things.

1.. I don't know how to Express my feelings.

2. I can't tell my Mom that I love her and that I'm thankful for all the things she's done for me.

3. I hate the fact that I always have to act different when going to a family dinner or similar events.

4. I can't speak up for myself. If there is anything that's bothering me I'll always keep it to myself. ( scared of hurting other feelings )

5. I'm scared to talk to my boss at work. He's a really cool dude but still I don't know how to talk to him.

6. I always put other people over me. Everyone is always more important then me.

7. I don't want to buy things for myself. I bought my GF a iPhone and a Mac but when she bought me Tekken 7 and a headset I went to the shop to bring it back because it's to expensive.

8. I dont know what my passion is. I love doing a lot of things and my interest spreads on everything but I never really stick to something

9. I can't really talk to some people like my mom, strangers, my mother-in-law. My girlfriend always forces me to speak but I actually don't know how to.. This is one of my major problems that I have to change. When me and my GF are at my mom's house she's talking more then me and I don't think this is normal. My mom is definitely the best mom on earth but I actually never told her anything similar like this.. She deserves much more love from my side.

10. I can't talk with my girlfriend when we're fighting about things. My mind just turns off everything and turns on the ""noword"" mode. In these moments I just wanna give up on everything and die EVEN if it's a small fight about some stupid bullshit but everytime we fight it hurts me so much.

11. I don't really feel like going outside to my friends because I started to see the bad side of them and I'm happier sitting at home and playing computer with my younger brother.

12. I really don't have a problem with sitting at home doing nothing but my GF wants me to go outside and be social.

13. I can't have fun at parties or events! When I'm there I feel like everybody's watching me and judging me.

I have no problem with being alone at all. I actually love it because there is noone watching or talking to me. Just me and my mind.

I don't know how I got a girlfriend but I'm really happy with her. The problem is I really want to make her happy but I need to fix some things in my life..

I smoke weed and I think that's one of the factor of these problems.

When I was a kid and did some dumb shit my mom tried to speak with me but I never said something I think this behaviour lead to the things I do nowadays.

Hope you guys can give me some advice or recommend me a good book to help myself. If I could name the problem by myself It would be easier to get things done but the problem is I don't know what the problem is. Am I depressed, anxious or just introverted? idk...

I'm 22 btw and I'm sorry for my english grammar.",26May2020,1
103,"In conjunction with Mental Health Awareness Month, Sport England conducted a survey and found that 63% of people across the first six weeks of lockdown stayed active to look after their minds. This includes working out at home, running in the park and walking or cycling to the shops for essentials.  


Perhaps, exercise can be an option to improve mental health.

104,"My very close friend from when I was a few months old (we’re now both 15) has NPD and it is taking a toll on me. I’ve always been a sensitive guy and I easily get upset when people are mean to me. I’ve had some past trauma with bullying and it has made me a very nervous guy and I have since been diagnosed with GAD. My friend is very politically incorrect and he says whatever he’s thinking. You’re a retard, constantly calls our female friend a bitch and a whore (even though she tells him to stop). I understand that it’s not his fault, but I do not need to deal with him. I haven’t cried in years but the things he says to me and around me are breaking me down, because of his need to make him seem better than everyone else. (By the way me and all of my friends know he is an absolute jerk and agree on it, and that he has NPD.) Going into the manipulation, he knows I’ve been bullied and the extreme toll it’s taken on me and how I’m very sensitive and have the inability to be assertive and say no, and he uses it to make me write apology notes to all of his friends he’s been a dick to and get pissed about it, and I absolutely hate that I get too nervous to stand up to him because he walks over me and he knows it.

So, how the heck do I deal with him? If I stand up for myself and try to stand my ground, I immediately feel bad and get nervous he will ruin my life again like my life was like in middle school which is practically my worst fear. The fear of him making all of my friends leave me and spread negative comments on me is making me go insane, and I know all his friends don’t like him either but I just can’t stop worrying. I’ve heard that I should eliminate him, but that scares me even more. Him walking all over me isn’t gonna work and I don’t have the confidence to stand up to him, so what should I do to manage him yet stay sane?

105,"Recently I’ve been publicly shamed or “canceled” online for some things I have done literally months ago. Nothing offensive or derogatory, just manipulative and wrong, but yet personal information about me was still released and told in way to manipulate many people into thinking I’m a monster. So yes I was in the wrong but the other party definitely wasn’t innocent either. 

While people didn’t directly “attack” me my reputation was under fire because I had made a post that wasn’t even meant to cause harm just me ranting, and it was taken entirely out of context. I’m not an “influencer” or any non sense like that just an average social media user like everyone else. I can’t disclose the platform but let’s just say stan culture is very prevalent there, people group think, and no one can really think for themselves. 

I want to know how do I get over something so brutal? Of so many people judging me and acting as if they know me and just trying to paint me as a villain. No I’m not a victim but at the same time I don’t want to be known as a piece of shit because someone manipulated people into thinking that I am. And while this is true there’s nothing I can do on that platform to save myself anymore, I’ve already made apologies in the past (all of which were rejected) and I have moved on from the incident. At this point I just need to learn how to remove myself from this situation entirely. How does one just move on from being judged by 50-100 people?",26May2020,1

107,"16M. Apologies for any confusing grammar choices or mistakes. It's 5 AM, and I'm so tired.

Now, I know what you're thinking. It's probably something along the lines of, ""You can't say things like that! Have some respect."" Just hear me out.

My grandfather died last night after about a month of battling a terminal illness. I don't know what it was specifically; all I know is he'd been bedridden, semi-conscious, and delirious since mid-April. And yet, when I heard the news, I was barely fazed.

Hell, I'd even say I was kinda glad.

And if you knew this man like I did, you'd probably be thinking likewise.

Firstly, the guy was a bigot. He was one of those loons who think the only way of achieving world peace is to nuke the Middle East into oblivion. He had an especially low opinion on black people. He once said, to an 11-year old me, ""Lincoln was the worst president ever because he didn't ship the n1993rs back to Africa, where they belong."" I also distinctly remember him trying to pin the blame for the attack on Pearl Harbor on African Americans, because ""it's a n1993r nation."" And those are the ones I could think of off the top of my head. He's said much worse.

He was also an alcoholic. No matter when you saw him, he was drinking either lite beer or vodka. Quite the jump, I know, but the old man wasn't a rational person by any stretch. He had a habit of getting so wasted, he'd pass out or fall on what felt like a daily basis. His drinking was almost cartoonishly obsessive. Basically, think Barney from the Simpsons, but 40 years older.

Next, he was neglectful. I could go on about his health, but I think we all know how that story ends. What I will say is that he had (on multiple occasions) called my dad because my grandmother ""wouldn't wake up"". Each time, it was hypoglycemic shock, and each time, he fought tooth-and-nail to avoid calling 911.

Finally, he was verbally abusive. Even in his late 70s, he could shout, and it was about as pleasant as you can imagine. When Grandma finally confronted him on his drinking, he responded with a slurred, shouty tirade that included ""maybe I should just buy some crack from the blacks!"" and other stupid talking points.

Grandma was his favorite target, by the way. He never complimented her, just called her fat, lazy, dumb, and useless.

At first glance, you may think he was just going senile. That would explain his childish and erratic behavior, after all.

Well, he probably was going senile, but by all accounts he was ALWAYS like that. In fact, from what I've heard, this era in his life was nothing when compared to his middle years.

So, it's safe to say I... didn't like the man. And yet he was still family. I don't miss him, but the fact that I could think that way about someone so closely related to me is keeping me up.

TL;DR I feel bad for not feeling bad for a very bad person, and I don't know if that's okay.",26May2020,1
108,"I've been dealing with stuff for a few years I've tried to deal with things multiple ways like self harm, drinking and a suicide attempt or two.

I have drank more than I'd like and ended up hurting myself. Recently I've tried to meet new people but my least distructive coping mechanism is comedy and making jokes out of myself. I thought I'd finally found a good friend to spend time with and I might actually be happy for longer than 5 minutes but this morning they told me I must be looking for clout because of my jokes and they don't want anything to do with me anymore.

111,"This is a strange problem for me. I have a pretty good life, an awesome dad, a cool computer setup and some great friends. All of that makes me happy and brings me joy.

I guess this is more focused on problems I have with myself and not with an outside party or circumstance.

For most of my life, I've been overweight, and although it's not all my fault, I'm to blame for more recent years of it. I understand why I weigh what I weigh and how to change it, but I lack the self control   to do so. I think the struggle with knowing the solution, and yet not being able to make use of it is having a negative effect on me. 

Mostly because of the above, I am not exactly teeming with self confidence. Im constantly afraid of what a random , totally theoretical person I've never talked to or seen might think of something I do or how I look. I overanalyze, do a lot of thinking about the worst that can happen in any given situation and that prevents me from gaining the benefits of the more likely, not so bad scenario.

I have been a procrastinator for a lot of my life. My last few years of high school, I was doing homework the class period before it was due, or the hour before a deadline. That is very stressful. I knew full well that doing work early would make it easier later and avoid the guilt of doing something else less important like playing video games. Seems like another case of knowing the solution, but not implementing it. Despite All this, I'm about to graduate distinguished and with honors.

My guess is it's about motivation. But I don't know what else could motivate me to do work early. Or what could get me away from eating horrible food. 

There's other things il be incredibly motivated to do. I exercise almost daily, I played baseball last year for the first time in about 6 years (I sucked, but I showed up and worked to my capabilities at practices), I can sit for hours doing a boring thing in a game just to get a cool skin or an achievement.

I can't figure out why I am the way I am and how I can change that for the better. 

This emotion, or state of mind, or whatever it is, I guess feels most like a vast nothingness, not lonely, just, maybe disconnected? I'm not sure, and I can't describe it, it feels like the feeling of zoning out, when all that's left is blank thought without reference to stimulus.

But it’s become such a habit that I’ll daydream while someone is talking, completely miss with they say, but just continue the conversation based on the first thing I hear once I stop say daydreaming. I find this annoying or a problem because it’s not on purpose at all and I hate missing out on conversations nor do I want to ask the person to repeat themselves when they’re literally in my face. 

Of course I’ll day dream all through class even when it’s a classes based on my major that I’m extremely interested in.

I just don't feel any love towards anyone. It's not love I'm feeling, it's the fear of losing. I don't feel any affection towards my girlfriend, towards my friends. They're amazing people and I kinda enjoy spending time with them, but no love, no strong bonds. No mystery, no interest. All I've been doing is pretending to become a person's friend of loved one. I constantly pretend that I'm interested, I pretend that I'm turned on when I kiss my girlfriend. I pretend so realistically that I'm starting to believe in it. But it's not me. It's the image I've built. When I listen to people talking I'm not interested, all I do is finding cliche but not too much phases to reply so that a person would think that i'm interested. It's hard for me to give advices, but i support my friends or a girlfriend even when I'm totally wrecked. It feels like I'm not living my life. Like I'm in the wrong place with the wrong people. And I'll never talk to them about it because I know that it would push them away.

I used to feel real love, real desire to be friends with someone, but i felt it towards wrong people. My ex friends were two lying and manipulative people, my crushed and ex girlfriend never loved me and left be broken. And now I've met normal people, but I'm so afraid of losing them that I chose not to feel, so that if they'll leave me, I won't suffer like I used to. 

 Sometimes I want to dump everything and be alone again, but i would miss them. I would suffer 100%. I comfort myself with thoughts that I'll move after school ends and meet new people with who I really want to be, but i know that I can change places, but I'll never change who I am.",26May2020,1

If at any point i dont remember what i did on hte way from the bathroom to my room, i repeat the whole process because then i have doubts that i touched something on the way. Side note: my hands are red from constant washing.

2-This one is pretty stupid and i dont even know why i do this, i just cant help it; when there is someone infront of me, depending on if i like them or not, i inhale or exhale. If i like and/or aprishiate that person(or a thing sometimes) i inhale a bunch of air and then slowly exhale it. If i dislike that person or a thing, i exhale as if id be absorbing their negative atributes if i didnt. It sounds so stupid and laughable but it really makes me uncomfortable in my classes at times.

3-If someone somes near me i need to cough through my nose and then wipe my lips with a hankerchief. Sometimes i repeat this multiple times.

4-This one may be something that just every tidy person does, but i NEED to have files on my computer organised. Side note(dont read if you dont care about videogames) It just makes me really anxious when i am playing a game with multiple save slots, for example Fallout 4, its a game that lets a player save multiple game progresses and if i have more than one saved it makes me incredibly anxious. Also when i play some games i get really anxious if a bug occurs and it stops me from enjoying it as much.

5-I can't stop taking showers, even in these times when i dont leave my home. I dont know why, but when i go make myself some food or something, if i accidentally rub myself against something i get extremely anxious until i take a shower. I also change my perfectly clean clothes every day or every other day and i cant help it. 

6-When i let my sister(or before the pandemic when my friend would come over) use my Oculus Rift(its like a vr headset that you put on your head and play games), after they would be done playing, most of the times, without any reason for it i would recalibrate the sensors which is really a tedious thing to do, and sometimes id just repeat calibrating them until it was perfect.

7-I am 16 and go to school for web development and while i do kinda love my school, i cant stand my schooolbag and books being in my room so i just keep all of the school stuff in a corner where it won't bother me, and now that we have online classes because of the virus, i dont use my books or notebooks, i just ask my friends to take a picture of what we need to read and write in Word on my computer or on blank sheets of paper that i keep in my drawer.

8- I have some really dumb ticks, for example winking or even caughing at times.

There are more but some are really uncomfortable to talk about and this is already a hefty post so ill leave it here, thanks for reading and ill really aprishiate your feedback(:",26May2020,1

137,"I know that I am one of the lucky ones as my geographical area has few cases and I am still able to work and earn my salary, yet I wake up every day at a high level of anxiety. Anxiety is something I have only started to address in myself recently, but I have dealt with it for much longer. Looking back I always classified it as depression but I now realize it was more anxiety that helped fuel my depression. 

My main question revolves around what triggers my anxiety. I know that there are certain actions made by others and myself that will trigger an increase in my anxiety, but as of late I cannot pinpoint where it is coming from. I know that many are facing an increase in mental health but logically I am not overly impacted by this crisis. Yes I am working from home more often, but I am still happily employed. Over the weekend I had what I can only assume was a panic attack based off my knowledge and ever since then I have felt very unbalanced. I am on Hydroxyzine as needed but as it makes me sleepy I tend not to take it during the day. 

Sorry for my rambling just trying to get a better grasp on this since it is slowly taking over my life.",26May2020,1
138,"My school has reopened due to my country being significantly less effected by the virus, since the virus became a problem I have been doing school online. 
I’ve been back at school for two days now and I’ve gotten home and just broken down, it was such a struggle for me socially. I said sentences that didn’t even make sense to people which I’ve been going over and over in my head since. 
I have many friends however they have specific leadership roles in the school which takes up majority of their time (along with their own school work) so I’m often left to go study independently or go attempt to hang out with another group of people ( which is kinda awkward since their not my close friends and they all are which makes me feel like I’m just bothering them) whenever recess or lunchtime comes around. However due to the virus there have been new restrictions around school, one being that nobody is allowed to go into the independent study space during lunch or recess which sucks for me.

Some anxious / stressful things that happen to me include: 
-When I’m in independent study/private study I feel like the people behind me are looking at me and every movement is being watched, so I sometimes feel like I can’t move but I literally can and there’s nobody looking  at me. 
-Often I won’t go to the bathroom during classes or independent study because of the fact that everyone has to see you get up ask to leave and then actually leaving and then coming back in the classroom when everyone silent. 
-I’ll text my mates asking if they’re free or where they are for lunchtime or recess and sometimes they don’t respond so I stick to my locker and weirdly organise it until I figure out my next move- which often includes doing a useless bathroom trip or linking with other people. I still just feel so anxious. 

I’m okay during actual classes because everyone has to do the same thing, but when I have private study, recess or lunchtime I become very anxious and stressed- I have no idea how to manage this, any suggestions would really help, I’m so down and upset about it as well as affected by the bad two anxious days I had that I feel nothing but the feeling of not wanting to go to school.",26May2020,1

It wasn't that bad before covid19 because I had access to the gym and weights but now I sort of feel powerless. Everyone treats me like there is something wrong with me and the more I stay out of the gym, the worse it gets. The gym was my way of escaping that reality.

143,"what the fuck is wrong with me?



since i was a little kid, i always knew that i was a tad bit different from my siblings when it came to handling and processing things. i had always been compared to the ""golden boy"" in the form of my older brother,(also the eldest). all throughout high school, it was my ultimate struggle. i always felt that i had to beg for people's attention, affection—love. it went almost the same with everyone, except the 'bEgGinG' required more when it came to my parents. i thought, maybe i'm depressed? the term scared me, and i was never clinically diagnosed, so i thought im probably just extremely emotive/dramatic. 

until one day, i was feeling down for some superficial reason i couldn't remember. i was at the mall with my siblings. we were having so much fun. while we were talking about childhood experiences over dinner, we were all surprised when i started crying. i didn't look like i was crying. i didn't know i was going to be crying. it didn't FEEL like iwas crying. tears just started streaming down from my blank face. and i asked my brother questions along the lines of ""what's wrong with me"" or ""why am i suddenly crying"". none of us knew the answer, and we went on with our lives. 

and then it would happen again.

i went into college, and had made lots of friends more than i thought i would. i became what was called a 'social butterfly'. i was proud of myself, because in my first year of college, i had made more friends than i ever had my entire high school life. i started having less 'episodes' of extreme-sadness-for-seemingly-no-reason(i really don't know what to call it haha).

but then there would come more moments when i felt just like i did back in high school. 

i am now in my third year of college. and i am starting to have these moments again. especially this week. i was constantly feeling sad. i felt like i had nothing to look forward to. nothing made me smile. i was around my family whom i loved dearly, and yet it didn't make-budge whatever i felt. 

present day. i am, once again, eating dinner with my family. we were laughing, talking about random anecdotes that somehow related to the last topic just to continue the fun. 

and i felt panicky all of a sudden; because for a split second i felt that i was about to cry again all of a sudden. 
i went upstairs because i knew that i would cry again for some god-knows-reason, and it was the last thing i wanted my family to see.

146,"A little backstory: I’ve(25f) suffered some addiction and mental health issues in my past, they’ve always felt manageable to me and I haven’t had any serious issues in a long time. Recently I’ve been under extra pressure at work and I’m suffering in my personal family life as well. Many people in my life keep commenting about me “getting help”. While that’s been frustrating I’ve just been brushing it off, surely I’m fine right?
.
This weekend put me over though...my husband and I got into an argument about something stupid, the dog was barking outside, and so I punched the window. Put my fist right through it, it felt so instantaneous, almost like it wasn’t me. I’ve suffered from NSSI in the past(been really fighting it for a couple months after suffering for about 10 years), so looking at the emotion leading up to the break was familiar. It was certainly a self harm action but I didn’t even give myself time to think about what I was doing. I couldn’t decide if that’s what I really wanted. I took the decision away from myself and that scared me. 
.
The remainder of my day was just numb, to bring any emotion back I partook in marijuana with friends. I sat on these emotions(or lack there of) for the rest of the weekend. Until today, I looked up available mental health appointments for my PCP. I haven’t talked to anyone about my mental health for about 5 years so the thought of going now is unnerving. 
.
I live in a big city so there’s a location that takes appointments well into the afternoon so I can pick my kid up from daycare, I could still get dinner going, trade off with the husband, and still have an appointment. But I can’t click confirm. I can’t let him know the problem is just that bad. I’m terrified to let anyone hear me say “living is too hard, I’d like to give up”.  I’m terrified someone will think I’m suicidal, which I’m really not. I fear an insatiable pull towards the idea of medication. I know I’ll abuse anything that they prescribe and for some reason I crave the feeling of addiction again but more so I just want to feel healthy. 
.
I guess at this point I just want to know how to precede. Has anyone else ever been in this spot, how did you get out of it? I want help but a history of self medicating certainly scares me away from an actual doctor",26May2020,1

It seems that if someone wants to die, he/she is mentally ill  (by defination).  So,  i was wondering if it's possible for such a person to have any rational arguments in support of his decision or his mental illness precludes him from having any  opinion.

It’s hard to put it into words, but for chunks of time I sort of fall into a place of over thinking about myself and the type of person I am, it ends up leaving me feeling quite isolated as in that period of time I seem to distance myself from people. 

It’s almost like I’m analysing myself, wondering if I’m a good person or if I act and behave in the right way. I then fall in to a rut of over thinking, which makes me not want to speak to people as I’m in a state of mind if I’m acting in the right way, or if I speak to people correctly.

We’ve tried psychiatrists, therapy, Medication, meditation, TMS, going into nature, moving to new environments... nothing works except on a very short term basis, sometimes. He’s always been depressed, but he used to be more social, for the last 6 years or so he’s withdrawn &amp; mostly likes to sleep, the past couple of years he has gotten worse, and more angry, and today he said he doesn’t want anything to do with me and isn’t going to live his life with me anymore.

My main concern is that now that I’m helping myself through philosophy, I like to practice what I am learning. On a journey in esotericism, I learned that it can be okay to be selfish when it comes to enlightening yourself. Unfortunately, one of my best friends has been having a lot of family/home problems, and has been for years and comes to me for help. I’ve always tried to talk it through with her, but the result has always been the same and it bothered me. Now that I know I can act on selfishness when it comes to helping myself (in this case it would be by avoid stubbornness and other negative energies) am I wrong to feel guilt? I want to continue going down the path that I have started, but it is difficult to do so when I’m not sure if I did the correct thing. It is an ethical dilemma of “help myself or help my friend.”

In all, just this experience has brought turbulence, but I know that working my way through this will aid me in the future, whether or not I continue to practice esoteric values that I learn.

So lately I've been slowly descending into a deeper and deeper depression. 

I have a diagnosed psychiatric condition (bipolar) but after many trials with mood stabilizers I'm now only taking an antidepressant (trazidone) with some degree of success, which leads me to believe I'm not actually bipolar just regular depressed. But I digress 

I had been managing my life pretty well prior to covid, going to the gym hanging with friends, I even got into a short relationship that ended last month. 

I live alone, I am capable of providing for myself, I have some semblance of plans for the future but as of lately I have been hit with crippling loneliness, it's becoming so bad that I'm becoming (more) suicidal.

I still talk to my ex, we work together. Well, I was still trying to be friends for the first few weeks. But now I've become pretty resigned and we just go through the motions talking about work and occasionally sharing poetry. I don't think she was right for me but damn it was good to just look forward to seeing someone.

All I'm doing these days is meticulously counting my calories so I can hit my goal weight because somehow I think that will make people like me.

I have plans to see my family in June so I cannot wait for that. It's the only thing I'm looking forward to because we've all been separated by borders for this whole pandemic and all.

It's okay if I don't have friends or a partner, as I'm fine with just having my own company. I don't need real life conversations or companionship to feel a sense of belonging: just talking to people over the internet is enough to keep me satisfied. No longer do I see the need to gain others' approval or validation: I am learning to be at peace with who I am.

While I find it irksome that people treat me like I'm incompetent due to my mental illness, I try not to let it get to me.

I hate when they ask what I'm doing, what I did or what I'm gonna do. I don't want to talk about it, they ask too many questions (they're not 'bad questions', just checking where, with whom, when and what I did).

I hate when they're proud of me, that's why I don't like telling them about my interests and hobbies or what I do in college. They don't even know I speak another language besides my first language and English.

I hate when they worry about me and my health. They have a lot to worry about, but I hate when they tell me what should I do. I know what I have to do. I don't even like when they ask me what the doctor told me. They always lecture me, saying they worry about me and 'it's for my health, because we love you!'

159,I wasn’t always like this but this is where I am. Whenever I feel sad/happy/angry it’s like to the extreme. If I’m angry I think homicidal thoughts. If I’m sad I think suicidal thoughts and cry my eyes out. When Im happy I am the center of attention and making everyone around me laugh and have a good time. These moods will come and go. But I’m almost never neutral unless I’m high off weed. I have been a heavy smoker for a few years because sometimes it helps my mood. But it isn’t cutting it anymore. I’m flipping out at work on co-workers. I’m flipping out on my girlfriend all the time about small shit. After I freak out and calm down I realize that I over reacted but in the moment it’s how I felt. It just sucks because usually a few hours after I freak out and cause a scene at work or at home I realize that I’m being an ass for no reason and I tell myself to try harder next time but next time comes and it keeps happening. I know I need to talk to a doctor about this but I cannot get myself out of bed to the appointments. And I’m (20M) and about to kicked out of the pediatric department. I don’t wanna talk to a new doctor about all my problems it just gives me so much anxiety. I’m telling myself ounce the pandemic settles down I’ll go to the doctor but I know it’s just another stalling technique I’m using because I know I don’t wanna go. It’s like I’m fighting against myself and I’m tired of fighting my own thoughts and feelings. My angry outbursts has either pushed everyone away or i pushed them away because in the moment I thought it was justified. I just wanna take a pill and be back to the way I was. I wish I could understand how I became this way because in my mind there is a reason for everything. I started drinking again and nobody knows. It’s terrible to do while on Prozac but it’s the only thing that numbs the pain of being myself. I truly feel like an alcoholic now because before I didn’t have to hide my alcohol and I could drink with my friends. But now I have hide the bottle and down some while no one is looking and brush my teeth afterwards and then I feel ok for a little bit. I try to express how I feel to others to lighten the load on myself but no one understands what I’m going through. My girlfriend tries to understand but it seems like she never will.

I would love to find an outlet to be able to use all of this because I have no idea what to do with it, but I'm very good at abstraction, and I need to make money. I have thought about computers many times, particularly Python, but it's so freaking boring unless I know exactly what I'm doing, so that kind of leaves me at the point of biting the bullet and getting through it until I can play, or finding another outlet even though I don't have a degree....

I basically go insane for a week or more. I also get both psychogenic conversion disorder seizures and neurological seizures due to traumatic brain injury of my left temporal lobe and my frontal lobe including my prefrontal cortex, so I end up having volleys of partial or tonic clonic seizures from lack of sleep. To add to this, I can't keep a job these days for more than 6 months as of 2017 when everything finally came to a head with the bipolar and Asperger's, not to mention the TBI that kicks the seizures off again, first time since 98. I managed to find a case study linking Asperger's and childhood epilepsy together, so that probably explains something... 

I'm likely to just throw caution to the wind and start selling drugs or something, because every single time I get hired, they always, always say, ""Oh, we get it. You have epilepsy, bipolar, Asperger's, and PTSD. Yeah, we will hire you and accommodate you. "" 

Next words out of their mouth as paraphrased for emphasis on what's really being said: ""We can't handle this because you are not an asset to this company. Your mental health issues are nothing more than excuses for skipping work....."" (yeah, that's why I've brought doctors notes and prescriptions galore for epilepsy and mood stabilization, for which I spend money that I don't have. Seems like a lot of effort to go through just to skip a day of work...) 

...Then there is the whole, ""You don't need to be taking all this medication, because that's the real problem with your health, and you can't be taking your Xanax here because we have a no drug policy, and I'm about to drug test you to see if you have it in your system."" (my name is on the bottle... pretty sure that is going to be in my system, and also you will be investigated by the EEOC if you try to fail me for my own medications...) not to mention, this is coming from the dude who won the genetic lottery, has millions of dollars, has a smoking hot wife and a picturesque little family going oh, and yet has people working for him that probably have pancake batter for blood while using every substance under the sun....but me taking a cocktail of medication so I'm not perpetually in a living hell or having seizures all day, is even worse apparently

He said that he doesn't know anything about medicine, and therefore since he doesn't, he blatantly said I don't. before all of this started with the head injury, I was a special operations trauma medic with a side plate of paramedicine, National Incident Management, incident command for mass triage in terrorist attacks, and I have been studying case studies on diagnostic medicine in specialized areas as well as just about anything else so I can get my hands on medically for almost 20 years, therefore I know nothing, and neither do my doctors because HE doesn't understand half of the words that I use, let alone taking the time to look at the case reports relating to my conditions, because that would just mean that he would have even less of an excuse.


This may be coming off as extremely arrogant, and I guess I can get that perspective, but I'm not trying to be. I have a defense mechanism built in from years and years of being bullied and treated like a dumbass, just because I often miss something REALLY basic because I'm busy noticing something that no one else is looking for. To boot, people on job sites always try and think for me, because as soon as I'm about to do/am in the middle of doing something, I have somebody telling me what to do which makes me second-guess myself, I therefore sometimes mess up due to that, and in turn, it causes them to think that I'm a f#cking moron.....repeat cycle. 


I was kept on initially because they found out I was the first in a long time who knew what I was doing with irrigation, but then they keep doubling back, saying that I don't, then yo-yoing again that if I go get my seizures sorted out, I can come back. Bullshit.

 All they did was fire me without getting into legal trouble. I have half a mind to fix that problem, though, because the last company that fucked me like this ended up paying $300,000 to the state (I wish it were to me) and being forced into posting that they violated labor laws...... They wouldn't be saying everything they are saying if they planned on bringing me back, but they will let people fail drug tests over and over, *AND* be high at work, but the guy that's got some mental and neurological issues? Screw that dude, because he doesn't fit in.



I read somewhere that almost 90% of people with Autism or Bipolar, (of which I have been blessed with both, and the inability to physically tolerate antipsychotics) are almost always unemployed, and it's usually not because of them, it's because the employer expects them to adapt to standards for which they are not equipped, and the opposite is supposed to be true: *They're* supposed to accommodate you, at least at a minimum of reasonability. I don't expect them to let me out of work anytime I want; I don't expect them to cut me slack on my job unless it is absolutely necessary, and I often overwork myself because I guess I have something to prove, and that is that I am not some useless piece of trash to be thrown under the bus because I don't function like everyone else. 

I come back with doctors notes, so I'm spending money I don't have so I can get medications to help with my problems, and somehow that means I'm skipping out on work just to do I don't know what?

  If there is anyone else on here who feels this way or has dealt with this crap, please give me some input. I don't know how to deal with people and their emotions very well, and I just don't know how to function in society. I have tried and I have tried, I'm just not getting anywhere, and I got turned down for disability because I made 5 grand last year. I guess that means I'm Scrooge McFreakingDuck....

167,"Hello, this will be a little long but I hope you guys can read until the end,

I am in a dilemma. I’m a 26 year old woman who is in the midst of picking up my life together. I have started to show signs of depression in 2015 (almost the end of senior year in college) which ultimately led to me being clinically diagnosed of it (along with anxiety and etc.) in 2016, and it is mostly because of my future obsessed mentality, fear of failure, fear of the uncertainty and the constant need to be perfect and have control over everything which ultimately lead to a lot of self-destructive behavior whenever things don’t go as planned. Also, I’m too dependent on my family and feel as if I’m having a really hard time transitioning to a capable and independent adult.

I finished a major that I wasn’t passionate about because of some circumstances and after graduation I wasn’t sure of what course of action to take next. I grew up in a very conservative and traditional family whose beliefs sometimes clash with mine. To be fair, a great majority of the people in the small town I live in are pretty conservative and traditional with their mentality and I feel suffocated sometimes by having to conform to these “old fashioned” beliefs and the pressures of the people around me (almost everyone knows each other in this small town). So I decided I would study and work abroad in order to be more independent (I’m very sheltered) and to also start a fresh in a city where no one knows me and expects anything from me.

And so I did exactly that. I went to Japan in 2018, studied Japanese language for about a year, but once again I fell into depression when I realized I’ll most likely work a physically demanding and menial job I have absolutely no interest and which I’ll most likely be doing the rest of my life as I lack the qualifications (I was only N3 level and my degree was fine arts) to actually get other jobs. I’m not from a native English speaking country, so I failed a couple of times when applying as an English teacher. My time was running out and I couldn’t really extend my studies (nor study my dream course in Japan) because I don’t have the financial means to. Once again, due to overthinking, I got depressed to the point that I couldn’t function normally anymore and I had to go home to be treated and give priority to my mental health before anything else.

In 2019, I worked a little bit part time as an English teacher until I was laid of because of the imbalance of the student-teacher ratio. I applied to a couple more jobs but I failed. Finally, I decided to pursue my dream to be a fashion designer (which I was unable to before due to circumstances) and so I went to a bigger city to study the course (because of the school’s good reputation). During the end of the first month I was there, I had several panic attacks and grew depressed once more. Once again, I had to go home to my hometown, not finishing my course. The rest of 2019, I spent focusing on my mental health and receiving therapy, and when everything was getting better for me, I planned to study fashion again, but this time, just in my hometown (first fashion course in my town which started in 2019) to avoid being away from my family because I’m incapable of being left alone for the time being.

Things were looking up. I was getting better everyday and looking forward to my future plans BUT everything changed because of the epidemic. My plans got delayed further until they announced schools would probably be closed until next year. I know this is pretty much inevitable and necessary for the safety of the community and that I am pretty selfish for having this mentality, but frankly speaking I feel so depressed, especially because I feel myself getting older (which is why I want to study and finish my 3-year degree as soon as possible) and most of my friends are getting married and have stable jobs. I know everyone has their own timeline but I can’t help but I feel myself feeling the way I did during those very dark times.

At the moment, I have stopped receiving therapy not only because of the epidemic but also because of financial means (each session is costly). Have you guys ever experienced anything similar? If so, how did were you able cope with this situation? Any advice would really help. Thank you and I hope everyone is staying safe!",26May2020,1

170,"My name is Meeko, I am 22, and just graduated from college. I have been in therapy for about 18 months now. Prior to therapy I went through 2 years of trying various medicines prescribed from a family doctor, with no mental health specialization. I have been off all meds for over a year besides Strattera for ADHD over the last 3 months. I currently have two psychologists and a psychiatrist. My insurance ends July 31 and any mental health work will have to end with that. 

My experience with meds is either they didn’t help at all or they turned me into an emotional zombie. I have not ruled them out, however, I am largely skeptical at this point. I believe that therapy helps. I was clinically diagnosed with a non-specified trauma disorder, general anxiety, OCD, combined presentation ADHD/ADD, and dysthymia. I know that I have made developments from therapy. However, there is a repeating cycle of me making great progress and then having it all being reverted and starting almost new. I do not try to do this as it is just as frustrating for me as it is my therapist. Today she told me that it has infuriated her and I do not blame her. She is a wonderful therapist and has said that I am the most difficult case she’s ever had. This may sound bad but I didn’t take it that way. I have been dealing with this shit my entire life and I don’t know how to change when this is all I know. 

I want to change. Sometimes my therapist will say it's like I don’t want to change. I do, it’s all I want. I know what needs to change but I do not know how to change. My therapist will tell me how and what needs to change but it seems completely impossible for me even though I try my hardest. I don’t know what to do at this point. This is why I am here. I can’t continue living this way. Honestly, the only reason I haven’t killed myself is because I am unsure as to if what's after death is going to be better or worse than life itself. I am exhausted and cannot keep living like this. 

I know this is long but I felt it was needed to adequately explain my story. I’d love to hear from anyone with similar experiences that have come out on the other side or those who are still stuck in the cycle. Also, any professionals that have dealt with similar cases, I am open to everyone and everything at this point. I have tried many holistic methods as well with little or no relief.

171,"Hello, I really need a kind voice and some word of advice... I've been perfectly healthy since that breakdown, as I was before. I was reassured by specialists that I don't have any personality disorder or mental illness, it was an extreme peak of anxiety caused by quitting a toxic environment into which I had invested just about all of my life, I pulled back after abuse involving a breech of my privacy and part of the issue is that I identified them with my abusive parent. The breakdown manifested with a strong irrational fear that the people from that environment were after me in every way, monitoring me, even if I was aware that there was no basis in reality for my strong fear (kind of like when you are terrified of spiders). I barely managed to take care of myself and work for about 6 months, then fully recovered.

I had to rebuild my life and projects at 30, when I thought I was just in the nick of time to ""make it in life"", and that is what made quitting so traumatic, even if it was actually getting out of abuse and out of a path that wasn't sincerely mine. Since then I have done a lot of inner work and moved on with life. And yet... can you help me with the following after-effects?

\- I am not comfortable with negative emotions anymore, before one of my most powerful emotional skills was the ability to be comfortable and let go through pain or negative emotions, because I accepted them as natural. Now I live as almost desperate to be always upbeat and sunny, with the result that I feel miserable... I'm just too scared that having negative emotions is like being in the breakdown

\- Shame. I have disappointed everyone, or so I think. I disappointed those abusive people and my abusive parent by quitting a path when I was already old for making it in life, and I was embarrassing myself by being ""crazy"" and ""a problem"" with my breakdown, I was a huge nuisance and I somewhat see them as ""respectable people"" and I was a troublemaker for having the breakdown

\- I don't know if I can trust my thoughts anymore, I didn't wanted to have that fear of being ""hounded"" back then but I had it even if I didn't wanted to, so I have lost the ability to embrace my thoughts and live naturally without keeping my mind at an arm's length, I want to go with the flow the way I did before

\- I can't put my full weight on any passion or project, as if everything is made of thin ice: I wanted to go full throttle and give it my all, and it all crushed badly, so now I am too fearful to embrace a passion and go for it, but that's not how I want to live life

Any suggestion?",26May2020,1
172,"I shouldn’t have gave it all when I still in high school. I accidentally set the bar so high that it made my mental health go into a downwards spiral. I made my parents expect as much as they did to my older sibling without realizing the toll it took on me on most of my life.

I’m sorry young me I had failed to maintain my healthy mental self throughout the 10 years of you pushing yourself too far just to maintain your grades. I’m sorry that you weren’t able to improve your speech, nor improve your rapport to your former friends and classmates, nor know how to take your own stand. **My childhood is  a regret on its own** and I can’t bear the fact that I’ll be heading for college, my mental health in it’s lowest, my hobbies down to near none, my expectations ever so high, my passion ceased to exist.

173,"This is going to be long and all over the place, but I just needed a age space to be able to get this out.

I was raised in a very abusive family environment, and I'm worried that it's damaged me irreparably. My parents were very religious and involved with the catholic church, often they would use religion as a platform for the heinous acts they'd force upon my siblings and I.
I won't go into detail of the abuse itself, but suffice to say that for all of my childhood I was belittled, humiliated, harshly beaten, severely punished at every opportunity and sexually assaulted by several family members. To this day the residual effects of that abuse manifests in PTSD, depression, fear of abandonment and hyper-sexual tendencies, which I've been coping with since I was about five years old.

The worst part being that because I was raised this way, I didn't understand the gravity of what I was living through until after I'd finally left. The abuse was so constant and we were kept so completely socially isolated that it was normalized and accepted as just a part of every day life.
One night when I was 15, I'd finally had enough and ran off, I've been on my own ever since.

I'm in my early 20's now and it's been a long road to recovery, I know that I'm still healing. But I've been disturbed to realize that aspects of my sexuality have been influenced by my childhood traumas and I can't help feeing betrayed by my own mind and body, and sometimes it just makes me feel sick to acknowledge it.

I'm been coming to terms with the reality that I'm a sexual sadist, meaning I derive sexual pleasure and satisfaction from the pain or humiliation of others. However, I don’t think of it as just enjoying seeing other people suffer- what I enjoy is when people consent for me to hurt them, either emotionally or physically (or often both).

While I have very limited experience in this as it's difficult for me to open up to others about this aspect of my life, for me it comes down to two aspects – control and connection. I very much enjoy being in control of another person, having both the ability to bring them pleasure and pain, and to manipulate their emotions, hopefully fulfilling fantasies of their own along the way, is intoxicating. In terms of connectivity, the trust that people place in me to hurt them is a very gratifying and secure feeling for me.

I'm so grateful that with the help of a therapist, I've become decent at compartmentalizing my sexual urges and my personal morality. Having been experiencing extreme sexual fantasies from a very young age without any understanding of what it meant, it helped when I first started learning about sadism and kink on the internet, though I never thought I’d consider – for example, degrading women as objects for male pleasure, engaging in gendered emotional sadism, forceful sex acts or to simulate abusive relationships. My fantasies of whipping a woman or forcing her to degrade herself while she cried upset me just as much as aroused me, and for a very long time left me emotionally confused and exhausted.

All of my life I swore that I would not grow up to be like my parents, and for the most part I've been successful. I'm able to control my anger, I find great joy in taking care of others, and I never lash out irrationally. But even so, the sexual trauma still left enough of an imprint on my developing psyche that my sexuality was forever influenced by their selfishness and evil acts.
While I’ve learned that participating in kink in a contained environment within a safe and consensual dynamic doesn’t challenge my ideals...On the other side of that coin, sadism is also part of the unhealthy and dark side of life, not the healthy and bright side of it. Being sadistic is not being nurturing, but destructive, it breaks the stability of society and isn't appropriate for a family environment. It would destroy me to know that a sadist was hurting my loved one, so how can I possibly put someone else in that same position?

I struggle with these feelings a lot as I'm generally peace-loving and do my best to be kind and considerate of others..and yet I can't shake these primal urges to consensually own, use and abuse another person.
Am I a monster? Am I evil? Is there a place in this world for someone like me? I don't even know.

I should mention that despite my attraction to abusive behaviors on a sexual level, I'm not at all that way in my personal life. I believe that no one is ""better"" than anyone else and we should all have equal opportunity to succeed in life. There should be fair treatment of all people, regardless of gender, race or creed and I'm an ally for social causes, particularly to areas where there is considered to be inequality and try to help rectify these issues if I can. 

I'm reaching a point in my life where because of my history and it's effect on me, I'm feeling completely alone and overwhelmed. I've lived with this secret shame so long, and for the life of me I don't know what to do with it.
 If you made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read about my screwed up life. If you have advice, incite or your own story to share that would be very welcome and appreciated.
I hope this finds you all safe, healthy and happy.

174,"We're 20 and have been together a year and a half. He treats me like gold, always puts me first, we rarely fight and he always says sorry first (even if I'm wrong), he happily talks about buying a house and marriage in a few years.  Last week he confessed that at 13, he went to a sleepover with several boys in his grade. He learned about dry humping and they all tried it out together. He enjoyed it. Shortly after this sleepover, he recalls tickle fighting his brother who is 5 years younger and then humping  him. He said he recalls feeling it was wrong on some level at the time and did not do it again as he immediately felt funny afterwards. I feel like he couldn't have been all that clueless though, as he started watching porn at 12. He said if the brother had been uncomfortable at all he would have stopped, it was a once off, it lasted a minute or so and he never touched him during it and would never ever have wanted to. He was crying hard as he told me as he said keeping this to himself has been killing him. 

 He apologised to his brother and his parents the day  after he told me. The brother can't remember and said it was ok. They are close and their relationship hasn't changed since he apologised. The brother mocks and bosses my bf around more than he even does to him.  He seems genuinely horrified by this event, saying he hopes this doesn't make him a molester or evil. This is totally at odds with the polite, shy guy he is now, who asked for permission to kiss me when we first started dating and continuously asked me if I was ok during our first few times having sex. What also scares me is he guiltily confessed to reading incest porn when he was 12-13, mostly about brother/sister stuff (he has no sisters) before getting disgusted by it at 14. He promised he never ever had an interest in his actual family, it was just he enjoyed reading the dynamic in other people at the time and what happened with his brother was just trying to relieve the sensation of what he did with his friends.

I want to believe it’s normal, as I am a teen, but in these last few months it’s changed. I’ve started hallucinating, multiple times a day I see people, animals, creatures that are not there. I’ve taken to drawing them, and they usually are not scary, but they are definitely there. As well as the increase in hallucinations, all of the sudden I have a fear of death so severe I can’t even play video games with death involved, it’s always on my mind, I have panic attacks regularly and I have no idea why. I’ve always had fears, I’ve been terrified of the ocean my whole life, but I’ve never had this before. I completely break down and I don’t know how to deal with this kind of fear. I’ve mentioned it to my mother, not going into full detail, just to see how she would react. She said it was normal, but I didn’t really go into detail. I said “I’ve been feeling pretty anxious about dying lately.” And she didn’t see very phased. I’d love to believe this is normal, but if everyone lives like this I don’t know how they function. I don’t know if the hallucinations and the thanatophobia are related. The hallucinations worsened and after that the death anxiety hit me like a bus. I just need someone to tell me if this is normal. I thought maybe it was because I was going to start my period soon when it first started, (I’m a 15yr female) but it hasn’t worsened or gotten any better (I don’t know how it could worsen), and it’s been months.",26May2020,1
176,"For as long as I remember, I was always an outlier. I was a quiet kid that kept to myself and didn't get involved in stuff that others were getting into. I couldn't relate to anyone.

The very nature of my family, relatives, and the society in general made me think that all this was some issue with my behavior that needed fixing. People(and me too) wanted me to talk to people, be more social. All this led to me growing up trying to change my behavior with no success. This hit my self-confidence very badly. It didn't help either that I had issues with being underweight as well, so my self-confidence has always been at rock bottom.

Years later, when I was almost 20 y/o, I finally came across a concept called ""Introverts"". I still remember I cried a lot when I read that. I was finally able to make peace with myself, to some extent.

\---------------

Fast forward to today. This Covid crisis has left me living alone, with zero human contact for months now. While this has it's negative side, it also has provided me with an opportunity to think about everything that I have always blamed myself for. Maybe, just maybe, it's all due to some underlying mental health issue, rather than behavioral issues.  

I have anxiety, which makes me anxious about even simple stuff like making a call, or giving status update during meetings. Events like outings or festivals like holi fill me with fear. I fumble while speaking, especially if it's an attractive women. I overthink simple situations and assume to worst possible outcome. I keep forgetting same trivial tasks again and again, like locking doors or switching off lights. I speak without thinking of the outcome and regret it later.

But now I plan to meet a psychiatrist when this crisis ends. I hope that in near future, I would have finally understood the issues I have, and will finally be able to make peace with myself. Maybe some medication could even help fix some of these issues.

There are damages that have been irrevocably made. I can't undo the educational/career opportunities that I lost. I can't go back in time and fix broken friendships. I don't have any hopes of ever finding love in my life.  But at least I'll make peace with myself.",26May2020,1
177,"So I've always been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. However, for as long as I can remember reading, learning or meeting someone with different mental health issues/symptoms always made me think I have what they have. I then compulsively research these things and go ""yeah this applies to me"" when in most cases it definitely does not but I 1000 percent believe It does. This isn't a case of ""woah is me I have all these things pay attention"" I genuinely believe I have it then mimic these things until I find something else ""wrong with me"" or I just no longer feel I have it. Rationally at the time of it happening I dont know I'm doing it. It usually lasts a couple weeks and I tend to keep it to myself but when it's over I feel guilty because real people suffer and Idk why I do this.  I just latch onto these fake diagnoses. I've never told anyone or my therapist when I had one. I dont have health insurance so I cant seek a professional for a quite a while. Has anyone ever experienced this ?

I feel like I'm waiting for a breakthrough, like an 'ah ha' moment, but what I read and am told is that doesn't exist. Or if it does, you're really lucky.

181,"Let me just start by saying I’m moody af and right now I’m frustrated as hell but in a few hours I’ll probably go back to my normal self.


I became good friends with a girl I’ll call Jen last year.  I’ve known her for ~10 months but she’s already one of my closest friends.  We went to school together back in the day and we just recently reconnected.   Jen’s has a tough life, she was sexually abused as a child, sexually harassed at work, and cheated on twice in relationships that were fairly long term.  She’s come out to me about these things over our friendship and honestly feel for her, these are honestly awful things to go through and I can’t imagine the hell she’s endured.  I try to be as supportive as I can whenever any of these topics come up.  I try to get her to do most of the talking and I understand that no one can really make these lingering pains go away but I also know that talking about things help a lot.  I’m not saying I’m perfect, but at least I try.

This morning I tried coming out to her with some of my mental health issues, which in fairness are nowhere near as bad as being cheated on multiple times by people you loved and being sexually assaulted.  I basically told her I feel alone, I have a job that I hate but can’t quit, and I honestly just want to die.  Her responses were just “Whoa” and “I hope it gets better for you.”

Now I get that I’m not owed anything by anyone and I don’t want to make my problems someone else’s, but this honestly pissed me off and made me feel even more alone.  Seriously??? “Hope it gets better for you”???? I was honestly hoping I could talk to someone, but this was such a conversation stopper from someone I thought I could maybe lean on a bit.  Of course she meant all the best but idk, is it wrong for me to expect some nominal amount of mental support from someone that I’ve been there for in the past?

Fuck this, someone please yeet me in front of a moving train or something ‘cause I don’t wanna hurt my family by committing suicide and then also go to hell for it, I don’t think that’d be any better.",26May2020,1
182,"So, I’m stuck in my thoughts of what ‘home’ is. I don’t know. 
I grew up in a house with parents and relatives and abuse by all of them. Being bullied at school and some children who lived nearby. I was always literally running away not to get hit. The running didn’t work in the house I lived in though.  The minute I could get away I did and it still is one of the best decisions I made in my life. I lived alone then and burried myself in work, being happy with being on my own. 
Later I had an abusive partner and that left only more scars on my soul, not to mention the ones who were ripped open all over again. 

I’m not in a too bad place now, seeing a psychologist, having a family. My anxiety and fears never left but they’re manageable, mostly. 

One of the things I really still struggle with is the concept home. In my mind it should be something trustworthy, in a good way. Where you can be yourself, whether you’re anry or not. 
Something like that. 
I just don’t know how to imagine that. I never knew it. I didn’t got to go to friends’ houses. Later on I learned a lot of ‘normal social skills and behaviour from tv.

193,"  

I am a liar. I have been lying, systematically, about big things and about small things, since I was a very young child. I do not like myself. I hate myself. Most of my misery has been caused by my own fucking self. Self-sabotage. I lie to people who love me. I lie to people whom I love. I lie to myself.

There is something seriously wrong with me. I see the path to taking actions that would be productive. I know what I have to do to slowly dig myself up. Do a bit of work. Clean the dishes. Sweep the floor. Accomplish a few things with my job. Take responsibility instead of sticking my head in the sand. Not even sure it’s sticking my head in the sand. I know the oncoming train is going to hit me and hit me hard. I just stand there, looking at it coming at me. And the closer it gets, the less I do to fix my life. 

I hate myself. My life is misery. I deserve this. It’s all my fault – my own actions, or lack of actions have led me where I am. The less I do, the harder it is to do anything.

Writing this feels like a whinge that I’ve done over and over, ad nauseam. 

I need help. Or am I beyond help? Medication and therapy haven’t really done a thing for me. 

I don’t want to keep going this way. Death seems like the easiest way out, and yet, I can’t even bring myself to \*that\*. 

What the fuck is wrong with me? Everything? People tell me that I’m intelligent, funny, artistic, that I’m good at many things. Lipstick on a pig. The foundations aren’t sound. What people see isn’t the darkness inside. My dog loves me. Surely I can’t be all bad? 

It hurts. It fucking hurts. Make. It. STOP.

But I’m responsible for all of it. My own fault. I do not like who I am. Only I have the power to change me. And… I am not. Not doing anything. Except whining.",26May2020,1
194,"Hello! I am a 19 year-old college student who is currently studying electrical engineering. I've struggled with negative thoughts and wild mood swings since becoming a teenager, and I've had a lot of trouble with my parents and their religion that has caused a lot of mental anguish. As you can imagine, it has been a rough few years for me. However, recently I have been doing a lot better! Since enrolling in college, I've been making strides to better myself through exercise and mentally training myself so that I get good grades. While I still struggle with a lot of anxiety and the aforementioned mood swings, these habits have helped to ease their ill side-effects. 

Today, however, I made a horrible decision. I had previously bought some weed from somebody I knew in high school since I thought that I might as well try it since we're all in quarantine. Today, I was feeling better than usual (one good thing about the mood swings is the elated moods) and decided to get it out and finally use it. The aftermath was horrible. I was more anxious than ever, and so paranoid that it made me sick. On top of that, if my family knew I did this, I would immediately be kicked out of the house and shunned due to the doctrines associated with their religious beliefs. I've already had to live a life full of lies and deception to try and develop a relatively normal social life, and having to cover things up constantly takes its toll on me mentally. This has made me feel absolutely horrible, and I wish I could tell them about my mistake and how I would never do it again, but it would completely ruin the progress I've made towards my education and mental well-being. What should I do in this situation? Do I continue to cover up my lies and just choose to make my own decision to better myself through not continuing to use the substance?

198,"Forgive me for the long post with multiple grammatical error, and the spiral-like story. I just want this to come out. I'm 18, from the Philippines. I've been suffering from mental illness since I was 9. That's when my little brother died. I was a jolly kid, I never paid any attention to bullies when I was that age, nor paid any attention to my relatives who thinks that I'm nothing but a headache. I didn't give any shit to what they say. 

I grew up in a toxic household, my father always beats my mother when he is upset, he's also always accusing my mother that she has affair with different men (eventhough she's faithful to him). When I was 4 years old, whenever he's leaving, my father would always ask me to guard my mother and report to him if she talks to other men.  He would starve us and lock the door from the outside, when he left. I always see my mother cry in front of me, that's when it all started, little by little, but I managed to be a jolly kid. My father always abuse us verbally, mentally, and physically, up to this day. I always get beaten, for littlest things, he would call us ""animals"" and curse us every single minute of the fucking day. He is responsible yet manipulative and abusive. My mother never stood up for herself, nor for us. But we somehow put up with it. I somehow managed. That's where I started having this ""daydreams"", and friends that I do not know about. My daydreams when I was that age was, me being an owner of an orphanage, and supporting elder people inside my head. I'm in the stage of talking to myself here. It went out until I was in 3rd grade. I finally thought that I'm being normal, even if I have no idea what the fuck was happening in my head. 

I was in 3rd grade when my little brother died, and that's when it gets out of hand. I experienced depression, I don't want to go out, to eat, to sleep,  I cry hard, and I ruined my childhood by isolating myself from the world. Things got blurry. And my depression went on unnoticed, even I didn't know what that is. I just know that there is something not right going on. It went on until grade 6, and I've been bullied because of my appearance. I started developing anxiety, and sometimes I feel like someone's whispering to me about things i dont like to hear.  And thats when my daydreaming tortured me until now. 

I daydreamed that I'm a rich girl, loved by everybody, including my multiple crushes. I often daydream about actors that I find attractive and talk to them in reality. I laugh at jokes that I made them tell me, I daydreamed that they are fighting for me. I talk to myself, laugh to myself, cry to myself. I'm going crazy. 


Now that I'm 18, its getting worse. I think that it rrached its peak, I daydream for 24/7. I'm loosing sleep, and starving myself. And i havent noticed it since earlier. I dont want to talk to a psychiatrist because im ashamed and afraid to tell my parents about what's happening to me.  

And now, I'm having thoughts of ending it all. So that I could free my mind, and soul. So that I could end the whispers and silence the voices inside my head. I want them to die, and i think they want me to accompany them.",26May2020,1
199,"I have PTSD, depression, anxiety, and I am on meds, occasional therapy. Last summer I became friends with people who I work with. I was invited to start playing d&amp;d with the group, and I’d thought I’d finally made this friendships thing that would last. Probably super naive. Anyway, there was a lot of heavy drinking, which really did not help me. 

I would get too emotional or personal during the drinking sessions and blab about my past. Apparently no one in the group liked it when I got too emotional or they just didn’t possess the mental fortitude to show some empathy after awhile. I get that some people can’t deal with other people’s emotional baggage all the time, but this wasn’t happening every meetup and I never expected/wanted them to fix me, I just thought they were friends, and I thought sharing some things might help me process the PTSD stuff. Maybe it was selfish of me, but fuck it, that’s what I did. 

Anyway, eventually one night I experienced a flashback, because the main ringleader of the group tossed something across the table and was displaying irritation/anger and I was triggered and reacted badly as a result. This ended up with the two of us going outside where things escalated into a verbal argument. I remember trying to explain why I’d reacted the way I had (because of the PTSD) and she wasn’t willing to hear me out. I was crying and she screamed at me to stop crying and that I’m crazy. I think we tried to patch things up after that but my memory is fuzzy. I started self isolating due to increased anxiety and depression, and it wasn’t long after that when something else happened where some stupid thing I said in group chat got taken out of context and they all used that as their excuse dump me. One of the nuggets of that convo was me being called an eternal victim and being told to get over myself. 

I’m not a part of that group anymore, which I believe is for the best. I know I could have handled things better, and I should not have been drinking. But two members of this group work at the same place I do, and I see them in passing almost every day. Initially I attempted to apologize in person for the last argument in the group chat, but was basically told to fuck off. Since then I do what I can to mind my own business, I don’t speak to them. However anytime I see them some of what they said plays through my head again every fucking day that I’m there. It’s beginning to affect me again and I don’t know how to just “get over myself.” They’ve made me feel like an absolute piece of shit, like I am a baby-killer or something. 

I do what I can to get through the day like listening to podcasts/music/books, but then the shitty thoughts come knocking again. Maybe I am fucked up, maybe I don’t deserve “real” friends and this is all immaturity, maybe I am too crazy for most people. But god do I wish I could make them eat their words.

My earliest suicide ""attempt"" was 13 and i havent done it since I was 18. I have had 8 overdoses and each time I took myself to hospital within an hour to get my stomach pumped or hooked up to reverse paracetomal. Each time I did that I had no intentions of dying, I just wanted the attention and to scare everyone. 

When I met my boyfriend at 18 (together until I was 23) I was really bad for wanting his attention. I would pretend I had sleeping problems and I would scream and cry and pretend I had nightmares if he fell asleep early and I would try strangle myself and rip out my nose piercings and i would cry for hours saying I just wanted to die. I went through some awful sexual abuse with him that I am just now going to councilors for. I ended this relationship a year ago. 

This isn't even the tip of it but this is the injuries I have gave myself over the years- 

Sliced my lip with a razor, right down to the lip line, 3 trips to A+E in 24 hours to get it stitched back together - said I bit it on the bus. 

Smashed my hand over and over again for hours with a hammer, broke my thumb in 2 places and in a cast for 6 weeks - went to work that day with my hand that bad and told them I tripped on the way. 

I've smashed my wrist up 4 separate times by just punching it over and over again for hours - never broke anything and was disappointed when I never. I did this when I was 14 and the last time i did it wasnt even a year ago.

On my 20th Birthday, I smashed a glass perfume bottle to my face and gave myself a cut eyebrow and black eye, I also sliced my lip again and battered my wrists and thighs, and I claimed my cat tripped me down the stairs.

Not once have I sat back and thought any of this was attention seeking, until last week.

I've started seeing a guy and we got into a pretty big fight. I went off to work (in an elderly home) and i had full intentions to drop an iron right onto my hand and give myself at least a 2nd degree burn, enough for medical attention. I was standing there for 10 minutes crying my eyes out holding this god damn iron inches above my hand and then I realised what I was doing. I didnt do it and ive came to the huge realisation that im seeking attention.

Im scared. Im embarrassed, I feel like such a horrible person and im terrified that a doctor isn't going to take me seriously. 

What is wrong with me? 

Where do I go from here? Any advice would be really appreciated, thank you.",26May2020,1

208,"I have a bit of a meta-question. In the past, I have seen posts online from individuals that seem to be suffering from mental illness. When I see these, I try to help the person as best I can. I am, however, not a therapist. I don't want to say anything that may cause more harm than good. When I see something, what should I do? Is there a place online where I can report people that need help? I've been told the best thing to do is to leave it behind, but I can't do this in good conscience. I've experienced severe mental illness in the past. I want to help others in anyway I can.",26May2020,1
209,"Hi, internet friends. This is my first ever Reddit post! 

I just found out this subreddit exists, and I'm so happy about it. These past few months have been incredibly difficult. I'm aware that it has been for everyone else, of course, but if I may, I would like to vent for a bit about my mental health journey. 

In January of 2019, I found myself with no friends after a small misunderstanding (a piece of advice, careful if you are going to be moving in with your friends, it might backfire). For the first time in years, I had to make new friends, which can be intimidating in your early thirties. In February, I got laid-off. Thankfully, I found a job by going freelance! At the same time, I started doing online therapy (more accessible and cheaper)—and it was the best decision of my life. So after a rocky start, I was back on track to get better and more hopeful and proud that I was taking care of my mental health. Despite the circumstances, I was feeling okay! 

But then life happened.

In December, I got a call from my Mother that she needs brain surgery. There was a small tumor that needs to be taken care of before it grows and complicates things. I was horrified, of course. My Mom is everything to me, and my only wish in life is to save enough money to buy her a house so she can be happy and at peace. After doing some research and talking to her Doctor, I was feeling optimistic since the chances of surviving were considerably high. Days before the surgery, I decided to back home (I live abroad in New York City, so I took the next flight back home to Puerto Rico so I can be by her side). Fortunately, the surgery went well, and after two days, my Mom left the hospital. I felt so relieved that I cried, hugged her, and told her how happy I was that she was doing great. 

Coincidentally, the day she left the hospital, it was the same day I had to travel back to N.Y. But I made sure everything was in order, and then told my Mom that I had to go back for work but promised her that I would be back in a month to be with her as long as it was necessary. That never happened. My Mother passed away when I was at the airport. Minutes before take-off, I received a call from my brother saying that nobody knew what happened. So like a classic movie scene, I stood up, grab my bags (which I got the wrong one, btw), and got off the plane. It seriously felt like if I was in a movie! After a few weeks of dealing with the funeral, I finally went back to New York. Then the pandemic happens. And not only that, now New York is the epicenter! Because of that, the agency I was working for had to lay off 25% of the staff. 

Months later, I'm still looking for a job. Grieving and trying to take care of my mental health.

**TL/DR**

It has been one of the toughest years of my life and, if I may, I would like to share some stuff I have learned about mental health that might help anyone who is feeling as scared, fragile, and depressed as I am:

1. Don't be afraid to seek help. It truly makes a difference.
2. Your real friends will always be there. Maybe they won't reach out every day, but those who will stop everything they're doing whenever you reach out and express that you are not doing okay are the ones you want by your side—those who don't judge and listen. 
3. Videogames are a great way to ease the pain. Playing Final Fantasy 7 (both the original and the remake) has been a great way to keep me sane, motivated, and immersed in such a beautiful story that helps me forget my current predicaments. Even if its for a couple of hours a day.
4. It's going to be okay. I know that sounds like such a cliché thing to say, but hear me out. My biggest fear in life was to lose my Mother. When that happened, I didn't die. Yes, it is tough, and I still have daily panic attacks because of it. But I'm still here. Sharing my story with my fellow online friends. 
5. Don't stress about stuff that hasn't even happened. It is not worth it. 
6. Share your story. It has been one of my biggest realization about all of this. There are people out there that are going through the same thing as you. It's nice to know you are not alone.

If you are grieving, suffering from panic attacks and/or depression, I want to tell you: you can do this. Take care of your mental health. Share your story. Sorry for the long post. I honestly didn't know where to start or even if I should even write this. But I'm happy that I did. 

I hope everyone is safe out there! :)",26May2020,1
210,"Over the course of most of my life I have dealt with quite severe mental health problems (manic depression and anxiety). I have only tried to seek help once, they basically told me to read a leaflet and they would be in touch when attending an appointment with my GP. I have been actively trying all lifestyle changes to get my head straight however a bad month comes and all my work gets set back to 0.

I have coping methods to deal with my depression but unfortunately in the last two years I have began to drift away from reality slowly loosing my grasp on what is real and what is not. I worry more as it gets worse and know I need a psychiatrist and / or medication but I am concerned about the implications to my worklife and career.

My pressing questions would be: what are peoples experience with drug treatments? What are the restrictions in the UK when you get put on the system as having a mental health problem? And lastly, What is the general process going through the mental health system in the UK?

Thank you in advance",26May2020,1
211,"I don’t feel love, and I’m not talking like just romantic or anything. I don’t have any attachments to my ‘friends’. To me their just people I hang out with sometimes. It doesn’t hurt when they leave or ignore me or anything like that. I don’t even feel love for my family or my pets. I don’t care for them the same way movies describe what loving your family is like. 


No one in my life means anything to me. I don’t outright say anything to them because I know it’s not normal but I don’t know what it could even be, or if it’s just part of depression and being a teenager",26May2020,1
212,"I used to feel there was no way social media could be impacting how I feel; I felt like I always had a healthy way of viewing and interpreting everything I was seeing. However, after looking at it less I’ve felt so much better about myself and my life. Without realising it, I was absolutely comparing myself to everything I was seeing, whether it was my face or my body, or feeling inadequate that my lifestyle wasn’t anything like all of there idealistic things I was seeing. Not to mention the hours I could spend on the explore page, making me feel like I’ve wasted so much time mindlessly browsing. Has anyone else had a similar experience? I know there’s a lot of talk about the dangers of consuming too much social media but I felt like I had a sort of immunity to it, like I had a good enough relationship with my body and mind and enough healthy thinking patterns that I couldn’t be really affected by anything I saw, and when I felt unhappy it must be symptomatic of something else, but I really didn’t realise how much it was contributing to aspects of my unhappiness until I stepped away from it.",26May2020,1
213,"&amp; he isn’t interested in talking about it. 

His job is very strict about mental health and if he goes to a doctor and is deemed unstable then he will lose his ability to work in this career possibly for the rest of his life (he has spent his entire life working towards building this career up in education and experience) so he is scared to even say out loud that he is depressed but we both know it. It’s due an excess time at home, lack of work and lower income..like many others in the world right now. Times are hard. 

**It is very mild.. and I am not concerned at all about him harming himself. Mostly just very tired all the time, lack of motivation to do anything, excess eating, irritability, starting to closing off emotionally etc** 


I was wondering if there were any tips anyone had that  as his partner and spouse, I could do to help him? Are there any actions I could take on a daily basis in an effort to keep him motivated so it doesn’t get worse until things get a little better and he sees some light at the end of the tunnel? 
I’ve been encouraging him to go for hikes with me when I go out with our dog and he likes to come, but then he will come right back inside, exhausted, and he can’t do much more during the day even though he has a long list of things he wants and needs to do. 

Please don’t suggest the doctor because he will not go.. in just looking for things I Can do for him at home right now to help light a fire under his bum if you will..

215,"I usually have dreams closer to when I wake up (or maybe I just remember those dreams more). They're usually not nightmares, maybe moreso just unpleasant or related to underlying fear/concerns/emotions. Regardless, they stir up a lot of emotions when I do wake up, and it will contribute to anxieties/depressive tendencies/decrease motivation in the moment and can carry over into the whole day. Even if my alarm is set to ring in 2 minutes, I will go back to sleep in an attempt to have a ""good"" or ""clean"" sleep before waking up. Of course, this rarely helps. This will turn into me continuously hitting the snooze, and having a crummy day. I *know* I should just wake up and do tangible things to make me feel better, but I just can't seem to do it in the moment. Any thoughts?

217,"I was angry earlier and I made a post on a smLl mental health subreddit until I discarded it when I was done writing it. I coped enough and I figured while I was in the sub, I would see if anyone elae has having similar problems. Turns out someone was having domestic violence issues where he wanted to hit his SO.

So I commented. I think it's helped me understand my own anger more and I find it helpful to think that I wrote this. Makes me feel like I still have my humanity. Side note real quick. I want to work as a psychologist one day and maybe therapy would be good for me to go into, even with the high turnover rate. 

This is what I said

&gt;Hey man, I just deleted my post about my own anger because I was too embarassed to keep it up. Read the next few paragraphs very carefully and fully understand what I am saying.

Can I tell you something? I haven't been doing too okay lately. I've been filled with rage lately. Like actual rage. When I'm angry, I want to keep being angry, and I want it to get worse and worse and worse. 

Imagine being mad about not finding something then destorying a shirt you have because you're so goddamn mad and nothing goes right. Then you're mad about the shirt. Fuck it, I'm going to do a line of ADHD medication. Now I'm thinking about my past. My tribulations with my parents, those who have hurt me. Now I want to cut myself, but I can't because I'm so goddamn mad and it's been years since I've done something like that. I'm actually shaking because I can't keep my hands still. I want to burn down cities, rob stores at gunpoint, take your money, and burn it in your face. Then beat your ass because I've beaten my ass for months to get big and workout. I could kill you, in fact, I want to kill you, because I am SO MAD. 

This is wrong. 

Anger causes irrationality and confusion. Especially within the individual, and then spreads that to those you hurt. Don't be the catalyst for what caused your hurt. We all get hurt one time or another and a lot of time, anger is that catalyst. Anger is this disease. It destorys, hurts others, it hurts you even more. It spreads to those who were hurt by someone else's anger. It festers and grows in the heart and mind. It hardens your heart. Much to the despair of those around you who will watch it happen. Through the years you will grow more and more bitter. Hate yourself and those around you more and more and more until something happens. 

Children get shot, innocent people die, wars are started, friendships forever broken. 

You know who you are. Please, let your anger out, but control it to a purposeful level. Find ways to help those around you. This is vital. The opposite of anger is compassion. The more compassionate you can be, the more your heart softens. It opens up to others. Not just to them, but for them. 

You find a woman with self harm scars on her legs. She doesn't hide them very well. They're fresh. You've been there. You know what that's like. Share your knowledge, share your heart. You don't have to confront her, but ask her what she did for the summer. How long has she been around? Being able to act appropriately and friendly, shows a level of compassion in you. They won't always be the most talkative, and that's okay. Be you, don't lose yourself trying to help someone else. They've been through a lot. and that ability to help, *that's compassion.*

Doing these things, no matter how small, softens your heart. Give to the homeless, don't become angry if you learn they panhandled you. Give to those you love, don't become bitter when they don't return it. Be nice to the weirdos and losers, don't lose it when people make fun of you in turn. 

You created an act of kindess and sometimes people will go behind your back. Realize this happens, and you will be okay regardless. Don't let people walk over you and keep your soft heart, you will be okay. 

You will be okay :)",26May2020,1

219,"I'm very sorry for the format of this it may be triggering. I have never ever gone through this before and am very confused. I am 17. I feel like a horrible person. Please help. Is this a panic attack? I looked up the symptoms but this lasted roughly an hour and a half. Its been two hours and i am still crying and cannot stop. A little bit of it is turkish because i forgot the english words. English is my first language but there are turkish words that i cant change to english like names.

Doccumenting everything that happened tonight as to not forget. Was feeling sad. Had dinner. Fulya abla said that wasting food was a spoiled thing to do. I felt very disconnected. Especially from myself. Had wine next to family because they let me. Became drunk. Hugged dad. Nearly choked. Went inside. Closed door and locked it. Started crying. Expected to feel better. Maya came. Started to talk to me. I Couldnt calm down. Continued to talk. Still half crying. Occassionally my dad would come and go. He did this twice. He came layed on the bed and told me to come. I did not want to. I continued to stay on the floor. Maya talked to me. Dad told me if im so happy why am i crying (i said im happy that i didnt have to see people from school while crying). I told him because i am very sad and unhappy about other things. He asked it in a very frustated manner. Then he left. Me and maya talked some more and i continued to cry. Then dad came back. Layed down. Me and maya continued to talk. Then he got up and got frustated. I got frustrated that he was frustrated. He said something that made me very very upset and i scream fuck you and slammed the door and ran. I openned the front door and saw people and quickly shut it. Dad grabbed my hair and pulled me back. I hit wall and fell. At one point i dont remember when i hit my head. My eyebrow. It is now very very swolen like a ball. Then i think he grabbed my arm and dragged me. I got very anxious and was having trpuble breathing. I curled up into a ball and started screaming that i was having a panic attack. I tried to get up. I think he grabbed my arm. I got free and ran to the side of the stairs. He hugged me. I started screaming. Just screaming no words. I dont know why. He was asking what i was doing. Maya got scared and ran upstairs. Dad said what are you doing your scaring maya youre scaring maya. At one point dad said that when life is normal you just have to ruin it (not with exactly those words because he said it in turkish. He said kıçına rahat batıyor in turkish). It hurt very much but i did not process it in the moment. Then he took me back to my room and told me to lay down. Then he hugged me. He called maya but i didnt want him to. I was still in hysterics. Maya came and layed next to me. They both hugged me as i cried hysterically for probably one hour. Maybe 30 minutes. He occasionally said to calm down. That its okay. That i can calm myself down. Maya got me water. I drank it. Then i felt better. Dad left. He went to the living room. After a few minutes next to my sister i said i was okay. I was feeling better and i was trying to stop crying. She said okay. I kept on saying sorry every five minutes during the whole thing. I got up and washed my face. Maya kept telling me to count to 10. I thought that i would stop crying in 5 minutes when i got to my room. That is usually what happens. But it didnt. Nothing happened to trigger it. I went to the living room my dad was sitting in the dark. I tried to hug him and tell him sorry. He said he was sorry for making me feel this way. I told him it wasnt his fault. He said okay. I went to the bathroom. Cried there too. Noticed the bug bump on my face. I look like somebody threw a hammer at my eyebrow. I am pretty sure my dad didnt do it. Went to my room. Started to clean to try and feel less crazy. Dad and maya came. I feel as though i ruined my relationship with both of them. I was normal until now. Why am i not normal right now. Maya hugged me. I feel like i have caused her trauma. She saw everything. She probably remembers it very vividly. Better than i remember it. I started to write this note. Then dad came downstairs. Said something i dont know how to phrase i can only remember how i felt. It felr bad. Hugged him. I tried to explain it but its hard to because i dont know how to explain it. I dont even know what it was. I dont know why i exploded. Before this everything was okay. I was okay. Everything was normal. I laughed i was happy i guess and everyone was okay. Now this happened and i have ruined everything. I dont know what this is. Please help me understand it. I am sorry for how bad this is written i just want to understand i do not have anyone to contact to talk to to ask about this. Please i just need help understanding whats wrong with me.",26May2020,1

221,"So my partners Grandmother ask them if I could come with them to Ohio sometime this summer. They said it’d be up to his parents. I asked my mom to see if I could go and she started saying how I’m “too clingy” to my partner’s family and how I’m “invading family time” with them. I said I was invited. She then proceeded to say “What is even in Ohio? Nothing! What am I supposed to do with Noah (little brother , 8Yrs.)?! And a WEEK!? Seriously! No!” I then just sighed and went back to my room and now I’m here.

Here’s some background;
- She doesn’t believe I have mental illnesses
- Treats me like I’m still 13 (I’m nearly 18) 
- Makes me watch my brother with out pay. (Understandable at this time rn, but before and after I want pay.) 
- She’s always away from home AT her BOYFRIEND’S house almost everyday. This man lives 30/40 minutes from where we live. She never invited him to OUR home. 
- Belittles / Degrades my emotions and covers it up with “you just don’t want to hear the truth.” 

I want to go to Ohio for: Adventure, Get to know my partner’s family better, Have fun and simply get out of my town. It’s been 4 years since I’ve been on a vacation that lasted more than 10-15 hours.

Our bodies are amazing - by focusing on what makes them great we can let go of negative views and enjoy simply being alive.

225,"Hello there, first of all, im french so sorry for my english. *(sorry for cliché excuses)*

I want to get directly to the subject : me. I want to know more about myself, about my mental illness, it's not therapeutic, i just want to know what i have in my head. I just want somes ideas or reflections.

When i was about 13/14 old, i asked myself ""why dont I have a emotionnal attachment for my family and my friends ? When some friends dont talk with me anymore, why don't I care ? Why dont I love unconditionally my family like most of people ? Why dont i have no one important to me ?"" So i tried to figure it out and i did some research on the internet, i found some articles about sociopaths and psychopaths but in the time, i said to myself that some signs dont correspond me *(but i know now that you know have to have all signs to have a mental ilness and im not saying that i am one of them, i've never been to a psychiatrist)* and i dont have much childhood' stories. Just a ""funny"" fact, a schoolteacher said, when i was in kindergarten, ""she is so mean with her classmates and she is a turbulent kid but she is very smart."" (*dont think im telling this for my ego .. well .. a little i guess)*, my parents dont remember when i walked or when i talked so (but it was very early, before average age in both cases) i dont have many clues from my past and i dont have many memories either. 

So, when i understood that i dont have any attachment for people or for thing in general then i tried to get some :

I started by creating me passions so .. I like drawing and im evolving in it since 3 years but if now someone tells me to stop drawing, i dont think that i'll mind. The same for reading and the same for writting (i have stopped many years ago and i didnt mind). 

In the same time, i tried to feel emotionnal attachment, empathy, sadness.. i wanted to learn them because i couldn't feel them naturally by myself. Because i found myself so weird, i was so empty and i knew that it wasn't normal, i've seen people cry for their friends they miss ""so much"" and i wasn't capable to love my own mother ? So i tried soo hard but now i know all things i tried to learn are lies to myself, i dont feel, im modeling. I explain myself : i do according to the norm, if someone tells me his problems, im going to tell ""i sympathize with you"" because its what people say and feel but me, i dont feel anything, just emptyness. It's just a dumb example but i think you see like this. But I never be able to lie to myself about being attached to people or just being able to be attached to people, so i have lived to this day without being attached to anyone. But i have friends, i dont love them but if i was capable, i would but i cant, its not really my fault, i cannot explain this to them because they love me and i dont want to hurt them because they are good people but you know... Im telling this but in fact, deep in the void, i dont care about them. 

I dont know if there is a common point between this and this but : i think i experience a permanent derealization so I constantly question reality, but I try to convince myself to be real and the world around me. 

I didn't have a traumatic episod in my life, i had a shitty and controlling father, a depressive mother, suicidal close friend for a long time, i take majijuana regurlarly only since 6 months *(1.5g/day +/-)*, i dont drink or take medicines. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading me, you can aks me questions if you want, i dont really know what else to say. I hope some of you will understand me because really, i tried to explain it to some people but im not going to tell all of this to one of my friends. Have a good day/night.",26May2020,1

The only job I’ve had has been at my dad’s small business, so I think I haven’t ever really grown up and it’s made me a bitter fuck. My dad said the industry we’re in has been a slow bleed for years and the business almost went bankrupt last summer and hasn’t been the same. I think I’m absolutely fucked if I lose my current job and have to find a job on my own. I don’t have a washer and dryer to do laundry so I go to my parents’ house once a week. I’m actively trying to find a toxic relationship to “get back at God” and rebel against mommy and daddy. A combination of skinny man syndrome and thinking my dad’s dick is still up my ass (figuratively, not literally) and that I’m a 28 year old incel has made me a bitter fuck.

228,"A little over a month ago my girlfriend broke up with me, it has been very rough for me and I honestly feel like I’m only getting worse. I am constantly thinking about it and get sick to my stomach, I also keep experiencing spurts of shaking uncontrollably at random times. As of late, I have also been having vivid and intense suicidal thoughts, and often feel very scared and out of breathe, seemingly out of nowhere.

Obviously I am in a bad place right now. I have always struggled with anxiety since I was in like middle school, and when we were dating my girlfriend told me she thinks I have depression (she didn’t really explain specifically why though, but she is a psychology major and has depression so there’s a good chance she’s right). I would love to do counseling/therapy, but that isn’t an option right now and will not be for some months time. 

Would it be stupid to go to a doctor to get diagnosed and receive something like Prozac? I don’t know anything about mental health medication, but I know a few people who take it and say that it helps them out. I am just scared that it would be dumb for me to get it because of a breakup, since a lot of these symptoms are obviously from the breakup and may fade overtime. Would I be, like, addicted to it? Would I have to rely on it even after the pain from the breakup has passed? Should I just go through this process without any kind of medicine? Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated, I am out of my domain here",26May2020,1
229,"Hello. I have a friend I've known for a few year and I always had a lot in common with him. Similar styles, interests, ideals, ect. We quickly became a pair instead of individual friends whenever we met someone knew. Another thing we both have in common is that we have mental health issues.  We have both been in the mental health system since our early 20s. His are more showing ptsd, depression, anxiety, and bpd like symptoms. Some are just things his therapist thinks he may have but is uncomfortable giving a full diagnosis. I have symptoms of bipolar, depression (maybe), anxiety, bpd, and psychosis along with insomnia. Overall one of the main differences between us is that he reacts far more emotionally where I never really show my feelings. This being the case I keep my issues hidden but recently opened up. And I've noticed something concerning. Each time I say something that is a bit more uncommon such as my hallucinations he starts off acting normally about it. But within a month I'll get a call or text about how he experienced whatever I mentioned earlier that day. Once even going as far as to try to make himself appear less empathetic after I tried to explain that I generally lack empathy for everyone but a select few. Note I've seen him react to others issues in a far more empathetic manner than I can even mimic. I just don't know what to do about this because I think it's really disturbing that this pattern has appeared and I know he won't listen if I try to bring it up. But he is one of the few people I'm close to and care for so I don't want to risk what we have.",26May2020,1

I have no idea what went wrong here. I thought we needed to be honest about our feelings in therapy! I feel so disappointed right now since I really wanted this to work out. 😞

 I know people say that ""looks dont matter to them"" ,but often times they do. I know that anyone doesnt accept you for who you are, appearance or otherwise, isn't worth having around. It doesnt matter, because I still hate myself. 

I know it's not all about attractiveness and a lot of it has to do with personality and such. I dont have that either, I'm socially stunted and uncharismatic. There's not much I can do to change my personality. I can try to fake being a likeable person, but 
in reality,that's not who I am. Often when I do this, I fail miserably anyways.

Sometimes I'm so embarrassed about my looks, I feel sorry for people who have to look at me. I have this urge to just rip my body appart. I feel like if I were dead, atleast no one would have the misfortune of looking at me. I've had panic attacks just looking in the mirror.

Yes, I do most of the things people reccomend. I wear nice clothes I like, practice good hygine, eat well and exercise. I've even tried find things I like about myself that dont involve appearance. I even realise that most people probably dont care about whether or not I'm ugly, it doesnt make a difference.",26May2020,1

I've always been able to talk people into doing what I want, and honestly I hate it.

I talked my ex-wife's best friend into sucking my dick once for example. I hated myself for it.

The thing about it that scares me is I don't feel like its me in control there. I look back at the things I did, the people I've hurt and I'm filed with so much guilt I can barely stand it. I don't mentally understand how I did these things. But I did, and they haunt me.

It's paticularly bad with sexual stuff. I've luckily hardly ever cheated, my ex-wife being the one example. But I can guilt-trip with the best of them and I don't get it. It's like somedays when I'm horny I'm such a fucking asshole, and I really dislike this about myself.

Maybe I'm addicted? Could that be it?

Further-more, I notice that when I'm with partners, I just feel almost... indifferent to them somedays? Like they could just go and it'd be fine. But weirdly under that I know that's insane, and that I love them so much, but it's like there's a layer of ice between my feelings just preventimg them from getting through.

240,"Background: I’m 35, and I’ve struggled with mental health for most of my life. That feeling of separation started early as a kid, and followed me into adolescence where I was hospitalized a few times for self-harm related to my depression and anxiety. I went through my twenties in a relationship and using drugs and alcohol and other people to cope with all of my problems. Due to a bunch of childhood trauma, I have a shit ton of trust issues that I’ve never really been able to work through with any therapist. I get uncomfortable when people feel sorry for me and feel like I should just be able to deal with it. 

A few years ago, I started the process of trying to live a life that I could feel proud of. I got a divorce and started going through 12 step programs, I’ve kicked opiates, tobacco, cocaine &amp; alcohol (almost 18 months without alcohol, longer for the other two) but held on to a small marijuana habit. I also got off mental health meds about 18 months ago. I was running a business doing hair with about 200 regular clients. I traveled a few times last year and my life finally felt full. Social engagements, friends, program, a career that I mostly enjoyed. I felt lucky. I gave up weed for two weeks even before this quarantine happened. 

The first couple weeks I was sad, but I was like I’m going back to work in 3 weeks so I’ll just let myself feel this and get through it. When the lockdown was extended I decided I needed to try to be of service and started making and selling masks (about 60 in two weeks and they were taking me 45 mins each to make) and three myself into baking, practicing piano, checking in with friends and preparing some changes for my business when things go back to normal. 

Then a few weeks ago I hit a wall. And it feels like things have always been this way, even though I know that’s not true. I’m simultaneously depressed and trapped in a glass case of anxiety. I can’t seem to bring myself to respond to most of my friends (I’ve kept in touch with two people and my roommate fairly consistently and I’m grateful for them). I left the place I was working at because I had such a vast different opinion with the owner about this COVID19 situation and a few other things I knew that regardless of what was next it was the right call. But now I feel trapped, unable to make a decision. I can’t decide if I even can go back to doing what I used to do. The long hours and close contact seem so unsafe. I’ve been waffling with making this decision and I feel like I’m gonna throw up from it. My pcp prescribed me some new meds and I’m waiting for the referral to psych to go through so I can see a dr again. 

I just want to get closer to feeling like myself again.",26May2020,1

In 2016, I was already dealing with overthinking about general stuff in life like social anxiety. I woke up one day and was even getting surprised that I can think normally like after I think about something I then think that wow I can think properly (like that was a very difficult thing to do). Yes, very weird. So I basically created this problem for me and the rest of the year I had this lingering depression feeling also with it, like I would constantly feel pain in my whole body. Tasks became difficult for me and life wasn't enjoyable. I have this habit of looking for problems to worry about in general. I don't understand why I make this problem for myself while actually there is nothing to worry about. I shouldn't be constantly overthinking about something that doesn't exist. 

Since then, I would have some normal periods of time as well where I would just worry about real problems only like grades, future etc. But whenever, things start to go good this memory comes back to me and I have the exact same episode again for 1-3 months. 

I really wanna fix this as I am just 18 and don't want to spend the rest of my life like this. I reside in a foreign country with my family and in quarantine right now so I can't afford and see a therapist. Please help me in some way.",26May2020,1
244,"Video game Addiction is a real thing people dont like to acknowledge or is something people dont care to believe ""is a thing"". It is, going everyday thinking about the game you're stuck on, ways to win, closing your eyes and seeing gameplay of it because that's all that's on your mind for hours and days on end. It's hard people just play it off as ""it's just a game"" or ""You shouldn't be bothered"". To some is a way to measure how you do as a person. It's not a very healthy way to measure yourself but it's always like a label, ""bad"" or ""failure"". I know games are meant to be fun but this is something I've struggled with my whole life since grade school, I just graduated college....

Growing up I used to play Halo like 12 hours a day from 7 to 16. I've grown out of halo but being with parents that never expressed care or if they were proud or not. Bullied almost everyday and treated like a failure or dirt. I measured how great I was as a person based on my ability to play video games. I never had friends and the friends I had were all through video games, online and In real life. Its all we talked about, all we did. My parents never liked it about me. I've been getting better but if I'm playing a game or something happens that one would consider ""stupid"" or ""dumb"". It hits me hard, because I see it as reversed progress or that I'm a failure, if I get annoyed at the game, I'm proud to say I can move past stuff but I just feel like a failure and it runs my day. 

The game I've been struggling with recently is Super Smash Brothers Ultimate. I've loved smash since the Melee or Nintendo Gamecube days. I've always felt proud of myself for how ""good"" I am. I dont feel like I can talk about my addiction issues because every adult i talk about with it just laughs or blows it off as childish and silly to be upset because the frustration I get sometimes across online play there. 

To simply explain it, you get a ""score"" you grow online as you win. A win can get you 150000 points or less, but a loss in a game gets you negative 300000 to a Million. With my issues in relation to self progress and growing, being a smash game I consider myself good at. It's easy for me to want to hurt or hate myself because it's easy to feel like a failure to lose hours and hours of progress to one loss. 

I'm not venting to make pity or try to fix the game or anything, I just want to say and vent my frustrations. Thanks for reading, sorry if this appears whiney or complainy.",26May2020,1
245,"Hey guys,

About 2 months ago my airway got blocked while using my computer and I couldn't breath for a few seconds and had to fast walk to my balcony to catch air the experience was terrifying I felt my heart racing, my body weak, I was completely freezing cold and could barely eat. I was stuck in bed the entire day and constantly felt like passing out, and then throughout the week each day I felt a little better and better.

Ever since I panic allot when I use my computer or when I play video games, and I was curious if anyone else has this issue? I remember before I used to feel my heart rate go up whenever I was in an intense moment in an online FPS or some other game types but it was never like this, it would just come and then disappear mere seconds later.

Just as I thought I was returning to normal, last Saturday I had a similar thing that happened 2 months ago but this time I could breath but my entire body was shaking, heart racing, sweating, body tingling and chest feeling a little tight, at some point I opened my mouth and my jaw literally made a cracking sound because it became so stiff. I spent the entire night feeling like puking at finally in the morning I fell asleep.

I went to the doctor for him to tell me my blood pressure, heart rate and pulse are fine and there is nothing for me to worry about. But then again, as I sat at my computer today I felt my heart slowly starting to pound faster and faster, my throat feeling tight and my body telling me to run away...

Ever since the first incident I have had stopped smoking, drinking fizzy drinks and I also don't workout anymore as my brain goes full panic mode whenever my heart rate goes up. 

I'm at a loss on what to do especially in these dire times. I am sharing my story to see if anyone has had similar circumstances and managed to overcome this mental issue.

When talking to friends or anyone, it’s often hard to give a response. Often i do not even care for what the person is saying or i don’t give a shit really, i don’t really like people. Not even peers or my parents anymore, they’re annoying, fake, plastic, basic and shallow. It feels like I’m trapped in my head and i don’t care about anything. 
Often i give the reponse ”i don’t know” cause I don’t and I couldn’t care less. My parents have asked what’s going on, and I couldn’t answer because I don’t know, so I told them I dont know. I don’t know if it’s depression or domething else. 
I have always been quiet, but not this quiet  i have been for a couple of months. I don’t want to talk. It’s very hard to talk, everytime i talk it’s painful and feels very forced.

I rarely get angry , but when i do, i want to slaughter the person who caused me rage. Most of the times, i want to harm children. When i am in that state , i am in a trance: i dont see in front of me, i dont hear around me. I just crave blood. I almost slipped once and hit a child, but my self control is very strong (hence why i am not a criminal). Physically , i am extremely weak, so i could be restrained effortlessly if it came to it, and i see that as an advantage. Also, blood and gore turns me on like nothing else does. I even get aroused when i self harm. I have masturbated to all kinds of snuff films, even animals getting killed. 

I also have bad suicidal toughts , not quite as bad as the homicidal ones however.

I'm very scared, I can't express how scared I am feeling at the moment. It's about 3:30am and I can't sleep because I'm really very worried and can't get weird thoughts out of my head.

I truly care for a couple people, apart from that I don't care about anything. I don't feel any sadness or happiness anymore, it's just a feeling of emptiness/numbness. 

The feeling of emptiness is stronger than usual at times.
I don't know what triggered me to be like this, I think it started at least 8 months ago and has only gotten stronger since then. 

I have lots of friends and am actually quite popular with most people but I still feel lonely most of the time. 

I don't care about my grades and most people (I don't want to harm anyone or make someone sad since I'll still feel bad and guilty, but I don't think I would cry for anyone's death at this point). 

I haven't cried in years, not because I hold it in, but because I can't, I've tried to cry at times, to try and let everything out but I just can't do it. 

I feel like a useless robot, I don't have a passion or any real interests or hobby's. I have no motivation to do anything, I complete my school work for my mother's sake, not mine. 
I'm tired 90% of the time even I have had sufficient sleep. 
I don't want to talk to anyone about it because I don't truly trust anyone and think people will treat me differently, especially my family.

my mental health has gotten worse. im more paranoid. i suffer from PTSD. i get panic attacks. i cant trust people. one minute im crying sad. like this rush of sadness and dispear and i start to get memories of that incident. then the next minute im okay and i asked myself why was i crying for when that happened a few years ago and i need to get over it. then im fine. but then it keeps happening. these weird episodes. one minute im crying the next minute i laugh at myself for crying for soething that happened a few years ago.  i dont know if im going crazy. i cant finish school or function because im still dealing with the after math affect of what happened. my life is put on hold because of this.

256,I already had pretty bad mental health to begin with but now its definitely getting worse because of my work schedule. I work anywhere between 7pm to no later than 8am and it’s physical. I have to work this shift or basically I won’t have a job plus it paying well with the overtime.,26May2020,1
257,"TLDR: Doctors couldn't find a reason for my weight loss after like 2 tests, told me I was anorexic even though I'm literally not doing it on purpose. Is that a thing?!

Long story short, I've completely lost my appetite over the past year. I have never had any issues with body image in my life, and was misdiagnosed as BPD at 13, put on a cocktail of antidepressants and antipsychotics that caused me multiple psychosis throughout my life to finally be diagnosed with ADHD at 18 (i am now 19, almost 20.)

I went into the hospital because I fainted 7 times over 2 days, and i was incredibly thin. They did bloodwork which all came back fine ish (apart from malnutrition, nothing weird) and a GI endoscopy which came back fine as well, so they just wrote me off as being anorexic and sent me to psychiatry.

I am NOT doing this on purpose. I do NOT want to look emaciated like I currently do, I'm just NEVER hungry. Eating makes me throw up, i always feel full and I get horrible stomach pain when I do eat. The doctors just said that it was subconscious anorexia, and that while I wasn't doing it on purpose, my brain was telling my body to not eat so I could lose weight...????

They stopped my ADHD medication and blocked me from being able to get anymore so I ""can't abuse it to lose weight"" (even though my problems started after I started taking Vyvanse and Vyvanse itself had never suppressed my appetite) and pretty much forced me to start taking antidepressants even though I was vehemently against taking them (they said that if i didn't take them, it would prove that i wasn't trying to help myself.)

Is that an actual thing? I cannot believe that I would be anorexic, thats just not possible. I've never, ever, ever had issues with how I looked, I was a perfectly healthy weight for my height all my life, always ate healthy food but never stopped myself from eating sweets either, and was incredibly athletic. I'm just at a loss right now.

Thank you",26May2020,1

When I was 15 I was hospitalized for 6 months after attempting to take my own life. It was after I was hospitalized that my family slowly started distancing themselves.

If I work late, she asks if I want her save me dinner. My imaginary dad is a social worker who teaches me to be strong. He is respectful, helps me work on my car, and encourages me to make my own decisions. My imaginary brother is loyal, always there to talk, and willing to kick any bully's ass.

261,"Backstory:
I’m diagnosed with comorbid depression and axiety disorder. I’ve been on 100mg of Zoloft for the past two years for my depression and it’s very much needed. The meds keep me from becoming severely depressed and generally stabilize my mood.
I’m being transferred to a new psychiatrist, my first session with them is in June.

So in the past couple months, honestly it probably started in January, I’ve had random spurs of excessive energy and thoughts. My attention span is worse than before and literally anything can inspire me, once I’m inspired my brain takes that idea and just runs in five different directions at the same time just finding more and more stuff to add onto that idea. 
I’ve always been told that I’m a creative person, but holy fucking shit I’ve never been this easily inspired. It’s like my brain constantly on speed or dangerous amounts of caffeine. 

I’ve also generally always been a chill person (borderline lazy) I’ve always been the friend you can just chill with, but now my energy will randomly touch the roof and my brain will just scream ideas and whatever fuckery it wants at me.
I find myself just lost in thought laughing to myself way more than I used to.

I thought maybe I’m just getting over my depression and starting to become ""normal"" again, but it just didn’t stop.

I’ve been tested for countless mental illness, none of my diagnoses explain any of the shit my brain’s doing.

I’m starting to wonder if I have undiagnosed ADD or bipolar (both of which run in my family).

Like bro are mentally healthy people like this? 
Am I parainoid?
Is this normal?
Am I just not used to feeling stuff?


Also I’ll mention this to my psychiatrist, I just need to vent.

262,"a friend of mine had a traumatic incident happen to him in his childhood. when he was 13, he convinced his crush to jump in the lake with him at night. unfortunately, the girl stepped on glass and was unable to swim, which led to her drowning and eventual death. it’s been about 6 years since the incident, and when my friend first told me about it last year he made it seem like an unfortunate happening of life. however, as we’ve gotten closer, i realize that he carries an immense amount of guilt on his shoulders and believes that he was the sole reason for her death. Now, he always relates every minor mistake or mishap in his life to his “rotten luck” and believes that he is a horrible person who doesn’t deserve to enjoy his life. after the incident happened, his parents and family swept it under the rug and believed that the best way to move on would be to never mention it again. 

in recent times i’ve noticed that this guilt has turned into a self hatred as well as a constant fear that he will always end up hurting the ones he loves. i believed that we had made some good progress, but every time he has an argument with his parents or faces a roadblock, he connects it back to his “sins.” i’ve tried suggesting therapy because this is clearly the result of unresolved trauma, but he is very against the idea, and won’t seem to budge. 

as i am someone he is close to and confides in during difficult times, what can i be doing to better help him manage or even resolve the guilt that he holds? it breaks my heart to see him struggle with his past and i wish i could help him see that his trauma doesn’t define him. please let me know if there’s anything at all that i can say or any thought patterns i can tell him to be using. i would really appreciate any help i am offered.",26May2020,1

264,"I’ve been diagnosed with severe depression, mild OCD, and borderline personality disorder. I also suspect that I may suffer from a bit of PTSD from a rocky childhood, as certain things trigger me to the point where I’m unable to move or breathe for minutes at a time. I recently stopped taking my meds and although I feel a bit better in some regards, I still feel like I’m drowning. Numbness has become my default and the only time I seem to feel anything is when I cry in my room. I cry multiple times a day, anything can set me off, and bad thoughts have been flooding back into my mind lately. I was hospitalized for a week in late March after a failed attempt and things were better for a few weeks, until everything shut down. Being alone with my thoughts most of the time has been incredibly volatile for me and I’ve been struggling to keep myself afloat. Inklings of disordered eating have begun to come back and I’m usually bedridden for days at a time; the only reasons I leave my house anymore are to babysit or drive around to pass time. Drugs have become a crutch that I lean on heavily, and therapy doesn’t make a dent in anything that troubles me. The person I care for most has recently began distancing themselves from me, which is understandable considering that I can’t seem to pull myself out of this rut, but it’s only made things harder. My self worth and confidence have completely crumbled and I don’t really know where to go from here, how to recover, anything at all. I’m only 18 years old and I already feel as though my life has ended. I don’t have dreams or hopes or anything, these days the only thing I look forward to is sleeping. Though that’s a bit of an uncommon occurrence as I normally have trouble sleeping. It’s been three days since I’ve slept right now, actually. I’ve really got no reason to be posting this, but with everything going on with my mental health things have been incredibly hard to handle.. not to mention the shit going on at home, being stuck here with my family is about the worst thing I can imagine. My mother is relentless in her verbal abuse, and she hasn’t been sober since the start of the quarantine. I feel trapped, and I feel like I’m losing my mind here.

267,"For 5 years of secondary school, I mostly didn’t fit in. I was a bit naive, I thought everyone was my friend, when I only had about 3/4 close friends. It’s come to my attention recently that some people said horrible things behind my back, and most people just didn’t like me. I was a bit loud, a bit different, and not everyone’s cup of tea.

For the past three years since I’ve left school I’ve been in college and I have flourished socially. I have lots of friends and I get on very well with most people I know. I have always been myself, but it’s like I’m now a totally new person.

Basically, although I am happy now and in a much better place, I am still struggling to come to terms with how I was perceived in school and the fact that as a result i feel unwelcome where I grew up. I hate being in my home town and feel like no one likes me. I know it’s irrational - these people don’t think about me anymore, and I shouldn’t dwell; I left school three years ago. But I still feel upset about it. I was never mean to anyone and did not deserve to be treated the way I did. Does anyone have any advice? Thank you!

I'm diagnosed with OCD, PTSD, ADD, depression. However the last two years was starting to obsess about going psychotic. It eventually went away as a fear but it's still sort of in the background. I also have been incredibly depressed since Covid too.

273,"My older brother (29) and I (20) live with our parents and younger sister.  I am currently in college about to enter my senior year and my older brother has been living with us at home for two years with no job/source of income, no friends, and continues to create stress for my parents.  To begin with, he has never always been this way.  He grew up as a very friendly person with plenty of friends and opportunities.  At around age 22, he moved out to another city with his girlfriend where they spent about four years together living their life.  Unfortunately, they ended breaking up and he was on his own living in the city by himself.  During this time, I didn't really communicate much with him as I was busy doing my own stuff with school and work, but I think it was pretty rough on him.  He quit his job and was job-hopping for some time, selling his personal possessions to pay rent, and I can't even imagine the other stuff he had to go through alone.  My parents were always there to support him though, we visited him as much as we could and they would even pay rent for him when he needed.  Eventually he would come back home to live with us as it would be best for him to get back onto his feet.  During the first month, he seemed fine, and it was nice having him back at home.  As time went on, things started to get worse.  He was involved in a DUI and crashed my fathers car and spent the night in prison; I believe his mental health started to get worse from there.  He was not, and still is, not looking for work.  My parents have provided him as much as they can while he is living here, money, clothes, food, access to a computer where he can apply for work.  For two years, he has spent majority of his time playing games, sleeping, watching Netflix, and or mindlessly scrolling through YouTube.  Luckily he does go out bike riding to get fresh air and goes to the gym sometimes too.  He continuously talks to himself out-loud as if he wants attention but most of the stuff he says is absurd.  For example, he says stuff such as how he has the cure for the current virus (which does not come off as a joke, he seems dead serious when he says it) and how he could be a university professor if he wanted to (yet only has a high school education).  He acts as if he knows everything which has made me neglect him even more as it is so difficult to talk to a grown man who only says nonsense.  It's creating a lot of stress for my parents and it worries me a lot as I plan on moving out next year and I'm positive he will still be living with them.   They've taken him to therapy multiple times but it hasn't really helped. When they try to talk to him about his future, he's always bringing up these hypotheticals about if he was their boss or best friends with the president or asking them if they've read some book (which I know he hasn't himself) as if he's smarter than all of us by using a metaphor to elaborate on some deeper meaning.  He denies he has a mental illness but yet still doesn't want to apply for work to better himself and move out.  I want the best for him and I wish he was out there living his life, but I don't know how I can help him when it seems he has lost all motivation to work/get a job and when it's difficult to talk to him.  Any help or advice would be appreciative.",26May2020,1

279,"Hi. Sorry. 

TW: ED, s\*\*ual trauma, SH.

Yeah, so, sorry. I bet you're all going to think I'm some stuck up brat but this really hurts me so I have to say it.

I've struggled with issues with weight for years on and off. I used to make myself throw up my food. I had a Tumblr for eating disorders multiple times. Last time I had a blog for my ED was around the start of the year I think? Luckily, I wasn't truly completely invested, yes I was largely triggered though I hadn't yet reached the point of obsession I had in my youth. I lost the password to that account and it saved me for the time. This will sound so selfish but... So, I have a lot of triggers for a lot of toxic behaviours and my worst trigger is food. I eat my emotions away and use food as a punishment too. My list of foods to eat is very low and I don't really have any safe foods in ED terms. I cut out a lot of the food I like or find to be a treat food because of my ED. Mostly comfort foods I used to deal with trauma and such. But the thing is whenever someone eats something that's a 'treat' or eats when I can't eat for any reason, say we're in school, my friends are all eating but I had no money to buy something at the time, I'd starve myself for days and self harm because to me, it's 'you fat greedy useless bitch it's your fault you're worthless, unloved and don't deserve to eat because nobody loves you, kill yourself.' I was triggered a lot in quarantine. I barely got out of it and now I'm right back in. I searched up an Ed tag on Tumblr which I won't name as a 'am I falling or can I get out of it' sort of deal. I don't know... I'm ready to ask anyone I can find the best ways to exercise at home and just go at it for hours but writing this is sort of calming me down away form that.

I have many reoccurring nightmares about violence. Murder and being killed. I've had them since I was a young child. Speaking of which, I used to be a very angry child. I never really acted on anything like have tantrums or such, I bottled it up and cussed everyone out to myself. I only had one friend for my younger life and we fell out a few times over typical jealousy when the other got a new friend. Anyway, I remember a few times where I just used to think of how I could kill people, I did it so often and to so much detail. That's all fine because I never would, I just daydreamed it all to cope with the anger. These days I take it out on myself, any bad word said to me, disagreement, anything not going exactly how I want to I start to self harm. I was addicted to self harm many years ago and ended up recovering. I would only relapse on anniversaries of traumatic events because everything was so overwhelming, mind you it was very small and completely controlled. As controlled as it could be I guess. I was clean from it for a long time except I started self harming again this year due to it all. A lot of things thoroughly piss me off and I don't know if I'm just bitchy or am overly angry. I told someone once that I only feel anger and sadness. At the time that was true. Since I got better int he past though, I thought the anger was over, it was just sadness causing me to be triggered and look for comfort in my ED but these days I'm so angry. Every little thing gets me so angry. To me the only way I feel as though I can go through a good amount of time without being overthrown by rage and taking it out on myself would be to kill myself. That's so dumb. It's just so much. I'm pissy every day and it's tiring. I turn sadness to anger as a coping mechanism and then take it out on myself so... I don't know.

Soon after a traumatic event, I had another. I said yes to the sexual things, we were both kids. Well, some things I said no to but he was stronger than me. I get flashbacks to him and the events every time anything physical happens, not even sexual. Someone puts their hand on my arm and their palms are warm? Him. Any mention of my body at all, him. He denied it all when he got confronted then apologized in private, so I went back to him a year later, still damaged and alone. He would grab my hand and put it on his crotch in public areas and I said no, stop, all of it, but it was momentary, he kept doing it. When I told people the first time, they didn't react at all and just brushed it off. I felt like I was being mocked. Nobody knows of the second time. Most of my life my family has commented on my body and I became self conscious quickly. I can't buy myself a treat for keeping myself alive without comments about how I should ration it, eat properly, all that. I get the blame for anything food related, have for years, and it completely destroyed my self esteem. Anyway, depending on the comment, it either triggers my ED or flashbacks to the activities with the unnamed guy.

I'm supposed to be seeing someone to get diagnosed and talk or whatever but I'm convinced they won't believe me for many reasons. I mentioned in my first post on this account that I feel dirty and want to cut off my skin. I struggle with that often. I don't know why I brought it up. I think I just want someone to tell me it's normal or something. I struggle to keep my train of thought often, sorry. Maybe I was going to say something about my problems not being substantial enough to tell anyone, like, 'when I don't get to eat with my friends, I want to kill myself' is as bland as 'I get sad when I fail a test' and I can't ever be diagnosed if I have anything at all. I bring up diagnosis because I haven't told anyone about my eating problems, trauma, or about what I mentioned in my post in r/Paranoia. As I mentioned there, I think I just convince myself things are happening a lot worse than there are, I tell myself they happen when they really don't because I'm in a vulnerable state.

I feel like I always come off as those dumb attention seeking bitches that have anything they slightly relate to. Say someone mentions how they have schizophrenia/psychosis and say that they see things when they turn their head or something, and a bunch of people suddenly go 'wAiT tHaT iSnT nOrMaL?' when yes it is, the person with the psychosis/schizophrenia is a different case. Yeah. So I feel nobody will take me seriously because of that. I don't self diagnose and I don't research the disorders that come up when I search for solutions to my problems because I don't want associated with those people. I'm fine just knowing I show the regular signs of the most common mental illnesses where people say 'aren't be all a bit \_\_\_\_\_?', but I take it as I only have the symptoms every other person has so if I have a true, real issue, like the post about my paranoia, I don't feel like I can be diagnosed because I'm surely making it up or something? I have no idea. I don't remember any of my points. I'm only posting this so that if anyone can make sense of this and maybe set me in my place or something. I don't proof read or anything. I just need advice if anyone has any, please. I think my intention was to get ideas on how to cope, though that was an hour ago, I've typed for a long time.

I'm certain everybody in this thread will hate my guts when reading this, so I'd like to apologize again. I really am sorry. I'm just confused and upset right now. I should find out how to deal with triggers before going on a ramble when it's happened, huh?",26May2020,1

*Breathing Exercise for Dealing with Panic Attacks*


""The great news is that panic attacks are a result of too much exhaling! That’s something you can easily learn to control. There is a very easy and inexpensive way:

Get a regular drinking straw. Place one end of it in your mouth. Practice breathing in through your nose without letting your shoulders raise, and with a relaxed belly. Then exhale through the straw — but silently. You will immediately become aware of how much force you are using to exhale. Make that gentle, so that the air just leaks out instead of being pushed out.

When you can do 7 breath cycles without hearing any exhalation noise, you will have the key to stopping panic. Control of exhaling will bring oxygen and carbon dioxide into the right balance in your bloodstream, which will allow the release of oxygen to all of your cells. Your brainstem will respond by moderating your heart rate, and by sending signals to the brain that you are well and doing fine. Some people report a feeling of peace and calm from this powerful breathing remedy.""

281,"I tend to rip my lips when I’m thinking about something very seriously, and other times picking at them if one of my hands isn’t doing anything. It’s become pretty serious to the point that my lips sometimes hurt or feel numb. Any tips?",26May2020,1
282,"I've always been kind of emotionally muted... I'm not sure the last time I felt an over whelming emotion. But lately I've noticed when I should feel something, I don't really.

First me and my girl friend went through 2 miscarriages within 3 years. I comforted her and looked after her because she became very ill after it... i only cried infront of her, when she cried. Never on my own... I cared but not as much as I think I should.

Fast forward another year or so and my first son is born. And I feel almost nothing towards him... I love do him but just don't feel anything towards him when I look at him or hold him.

I often have violent urges. I've never and would never act on them, I mean I've not even lost my temper once in my adult life. It boils inside but I've always managed to keep a lid on it to the point an outside viewer would never know. I have hurt animals in the past but I've always got rid of them because of it and its been years because I've made a conscious effort not to. Never killed anything.

I just want it to be made clear, I've never had violent urges against my son. If ever do I will be removing myself from the equation.

My sex life is pretty tame but the porn I watch and what I fantasise over tend to be pretty violent. Nothing I'd consider too extreme or illegal. Just more domination and such.

I mean I could just be a jaded bellend with some domination fetish... but I dunno... it feels wrong some times. I feel wong.",26May2020,1
