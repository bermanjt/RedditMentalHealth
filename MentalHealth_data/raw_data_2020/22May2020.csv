I’m a burden to my friends and my boyfriend and I don’t know where to go career wise, nor I have the motivation to do it. My boyfriend has stoped saying I love you, stopped hugging me back when I hug him, and just doesn’t seem to want to be around me anymore. Today has been my last straw of sorts. None of my medication has been helping, and I’m too scared to go to a therapist. I don’t know what to do anymore.",22May2020,1

I just.. don’t really know where to start so this post will probably be a novel, which is good in a way because I have nobody else to vent to 
Hello Kind Strangers of Reddit!
i’m 14/ non binary (have not come out to anyone)
Throughout this quarantine my mental health has deteriorated into a small abis of just anger, almost all the time over the stupidest things. 
Some days, I try to work on this anger, ie doing meditation, reading, running, and having some time for myself. It does not work, every single time I have the most minor inconvenience happens I get this huge wave of anger, I try i really do to compress this, I try to express it quietly and not bothering anyone. But sometimes my anger gets the best of me and I do regrettable thing like yell at my parents, brother and take out my frustrations on others. I used to be happy, I used to be nicknamed by my parents happy to go lucky, but today and for the last 7 weeks annoying things sets me over the edge. I know it comes with depression, I get terrible mood swings and they transition into fights.
I have a therapist that I don’t feel comfartable in actually talking to them, it’s not that I don’t trust them, I just had a couple of severely awkward times. Most of the things I want to say remain repressed. I really really really really regret asking my parents for a year for therapy, for some reason I feel even more sad anxious and angry constantly. For the past week(this is new) I’ve had a couple of suicidal thoughts and I’ve cried my eyes out more than I can count.
I try to think of the root cause of this, this angry stages, these emotional and crying stages, the anxious stages. But I can’t lay a finger. My mental health is just not bueno, I always have struggled with being underweight, some of my family has sort of made fun of me for it, some friends have made fun of me for it. I think at some point I just sort of spiraled very bad, and now I don’t know how to recover. 
I’ve struggled with depression for around 2 years for context and seen a therapist for maybe 6 weeks= 6 sessions 
I’ve been super self deprecating on things like my weight, my sexuality, my confidence etc etc 
Sorry I needed to get this off my chest because I don’t talk about this stuff often, thanks for reading this 
stay safe and well &lt;3

7,I am a relatively friendly and easy going person but all my problems stem from people’s selfish or idiotic actions. I can’t edit on Wookieepedia anymore because their is some psycho prick who just doesn’t like me and reverted all my work even when I promised to follow the guidelines. Both my therapists are irritating because they don’t know how to help me and refuse to put in effort. I emailed a few friends this week and they not just refused to help me but didn’t even respond back. I sent a friend an article I wrote and no response. I get screwed by employers who ask me to work but then don’t follow up when I follow up. I am supposed to speak to the Head of the Library Sciences program tomorrow but this jerk refuses to respond to my email asking for the Zoom invite. I’ve had enough. I hate everyone. The only thing I can count on from others is negative insults towards me or harassment. Now I know why people go crazy. I feel like going crazy with all this indifference and disrespect. All the things I want to do are blocked by other people. I can’t rely on anyone for help. I have to do everything myself even when I have no clue what to do. But yet I can count on people being dooshes. That they have no problem being that. I want to cut out all interaction with people but obviously that’s not how society works. What should I do?,22May2020,1

However, I then will get this insane sadness, hopelessness. I will quit all the extra curriculars I have. I have this feeling that everyone hates me or doesn't want me in their group, so I up and leave. I will eat. Then, I will cycle it around and start again. I will want to be crafty. 
I want to be important, so I will tell white lies to make myself more important than I am. 

I think I finally realize that it's affecting the world around me. My friends and family. I need help. I don't think my insurance covers mental health. I don't know where to start.",22May2020,1
10,Lately I’ve been having these little attacks where I think of something bad and I get the uncontrollable urge to hurt myself by hitting my head and pulling my hair really hard. But this time it was worse and I don’t know why. My mom said something about sleep and o don’t know or remember which part made me want to do it but for some reason I wanted to grab the butter knife I was holding and stab my arm with it multiple times I didn’t do it but I really really wanted to. I don’t know why I’m like this god I hate myself.,22May2020,1
11,"Ever since my contract (job) ended I cant seem to remember what happened today or yesterday or the day before, etc. Every day seems a blur. My anxiety has been through the roof, as well as depression, ocd and me freaking out about if I have schizophrenia (I know I dont but I cant get the stupid idea out of my head)

Why can I suddenly not remember what happened / everything is blurring together?",22May2020,1
12,Is there anybody who can talk to me. I think I might just give up. I can't call or text so I can't use the normal crisis things and I don't know where to turn for support so I'm just alone.,22May2020,1
13,"there’s this girl, who used to like my boyfriend. i was kinda jealous but i got over it. recently, everytime i’m reminded of her makes me lose all of my motivation. like her very existence hurts me - but here’s the thing, she’s done nothing wrong to me and i care so much about her an  hate seeing her hurt. what is this that i am feeling?",22May2020,1
14,"I dread going back to work and my original plan was to save and leave by June but then the recent pandemic hit, which meant that I have an extreme reduction in my income as my hospitality job heavily relies on tips. I need to pay bills so I really need an income so I don't know how I would leave, like this is the only reason i have stayed. Job application after application and a few interviews, I have not managed to get a new job related to my degree. When i'm at work I feel absolutely miserable and the fact that i'm not where I want to be and I see others who come into work moving up in their lives. I honestly feel like a loser, having graduated almost 2 years ago and not achieving much since, just more debt and increase of loneliness. 

Other factors such as never having had a boyfriend, never had sex, still living at home, slightly overweight, not remembering the last time I felt happy, all of this just adds to me feeling low. I just can't imagine feeling actual happiness like everyone is, meeting someone and actually loving them and they love me back, having children, moving out....it feels like something I can't touch like more of a dream, I don't see this happening for me at all and sometimes I feel like noone knows that i'm unhappy, no matter how hard i try to tell them....what can they do I guess. I just don't see the point of going on sometimes, I feel like laying in my bed all day, i'm 25 next month and I realised I started hating my birthdays at 21, nothing to look forward to. I've felt like this for soo long that I am just soo tired, I say i'm tired at work when others ask ""how are you?"" with the response of ""yeah ok just a bit tired"" but they think i'm just tired from working when well and truly i'm physically, mentally and physically drained from just being anywhere.

sorry you had to listen to that, but i'm just tired and..I don't really know anymore",22May2020,1
15,"Hi! I'm Kim Kupiainen a game producer student from Kajaani University of Applied sciences in Finland! I posted here several months ago about the idea to make a game that gives tools to cope with depression. Which we then started.  


The good news is that we're done with the project, but the bad news is that we're not sure if it is in the end as helpful as we hoped. We have done our best and hope that you enjoy this game.

 [https://kim-k1mpp4-kupiainen.itch.io/augur-of-light](https://kim-k1mpp4-kupiainen.itch.io/augur-of-light) 

We did 7,5 h days 3 days a week for 3 and a half months to get into this point. So I believe if we can find monetization through a publisher or the healthcare industry, we can actually finish this and make sure that the game is up to the par it's supposed to. The build of our game is given for free because we want to show you what we've done. 

It has been a rollercoaster of emotions, and with Covid-19 hitting Finland the development process became even harder, as we all had to keep on working from the safety of our own homes, instead of using the more powerful computers at school.

Here's the trailer, made by a team of 12 students, who care about your well being too.  
Be safe, take care and have a nice day :)

16,"So my grandpa died. I'm not sure how to feel about him dying. Since I was a kid I heard that he molested my aunts and I was never that close with them. Anyone on that side really. I don't know how to process this at all. I have memories from when I was a kid. We went camping and we went to an amusement park. It's sad how he went. His kidneys failed and all that fun stuff. I don't know if I can be sad for someone who did what he did, but at the same time I feel like if I'm not I'll lose my humanity and empathy. I don't know somebody tell me it's ok to feel the way I do or that it's ok to feel sad that he died despite the things he did. I feel like he set my family onto a course. I mean my dad molested my sister who in turn molested me. My sister terrorized my other sister growing up. I don't know how to feel about this man dying.

20,"I am the weirdest most fucked up person I'll ever know. I always end up hurting people for my own selfish ends. I'm fucked up and most probably insane. Don't believe me? No body does, that's cause I haven't told them about ALL my issues. I hear thoughts in my head from something that sometimes I can't even remember if its real or not. It makes me do just random as hell things cause if I don't I feel something really bad is gonna happen. Nothing too serious but just random super simple things like jumping onto a chair. No body knows about this because it only happens when I'm alone. I constantly live in fear of it. That's just ONE issue. I'm always looking behind my back or around me. Why? Cause I feel like something is watching me. Even right now I feel like it's watching me and getting more intent on doing whatever fucking bad things it wants to do as this is the first time I've ever talked about it. I always sleep with my light on cause without that light I feel like it can be right there in my room. I see things that could be it out of the corner of my eyes but when I look there is nothing there. Sometimes these feelings go away for a bit but they always return. Oh did I mention that I randomly gag at certain foods or just food on the side of a plate? Did I mention the instant sadness or more like depressive moods I get into so fucking often like now. I can't let anyone know so I just have to hide it and bottle it. I bottle everything. I pretend I'm all happy but inside I'm fucking dying.   
Now would you believe me when I say I'm a fucked up freak?? Yeah I am. Part of me just wants to kill myself and rid the world of such a monster but I'm too selfish to do so. If there is a chance of me carrying on my genes then I feel like all I am to society is a negative fucking weirdo who's only ever gonna make things worse. Oh and did I mention I'm only a teenager?

They will leave you like when you entered the group, devastated and with nothing but sadness. I cannot get help in real life because I live in the middle of nowhere, no money and no transportation. People don't get that and try to make me feel bad "" Well just change insurance , buy a car , go get a diagnostic you're not valid , you should just "" do what everybody does "", you don't really want to help yourself "" It hurts. I feel like every people and every groups that abandon me as a step back in my healing journey. I feel so lost but yet so close of something?

22,"I was just thinking, how much better would people's mental health and in turn, their lives be if seeing a mental health professional was as acceptable and non-taboo as seeing the doctor for any other physical illness. For example, at least here in Austalia it is recommended that EVERYONE sees the dentist once a year or to have general checkup with GP once a year, but what if society was also encouraged to see a mental health professional once a year also, regardles of apparent issues or not.

23,"This is what I sent:

“I’ve been meaning to say this to you for a while but I couldn’t get myself to do it, i was too scared, but I think I’m ready now. 
A while back you told me if I ever have suicidal thoughts to tell you. It was a long time, but I remember. I also remember you told me you’d attempted suicide a few times, which is why I’m comfortable telling you about this because I know you’ll understand and accept me. 
I don’t think I’m okay. Well, I know I’m not okay. I’ve not been okay for a while. It’s been a bit of a rollercoaster if I’m being honest, but I’m not okay. I think my mental health has just plummeted. I’ve been suicidal lately and thinking of self harm again. I struggled with it a few months ago, which is why I was so nervous about showing my legs if you didn’t notice. I’ve stopped and the scars aren’t even there but the urge has returned. I honestly think I may have depression and/or anxiety, maybe bipolar disorder too, but I’m not completely sure as it would require a medical diagnosis that I obviously haven’t been able to get. I want help, because I do think I can overcome this, I just don’t think I can if I’m hiding. It’s gotten progressively worse and honestly I’m scared and I know you can help me somehow.”

In response, this is what she sent me: 

“Oh honey. 

“All I can think right now is how I love thee. With all my heart my dearest girl. We will talk tomorrow before I go to work. Ok.

“I am here for you my dear. And I will get you help. Just give tonight to try and figure out a plan to better help you tackle this.”

24," Yesterday I had an appointment with a new psychiatrist and I told her I have problems falling asleep and I've had them since kindergarten and that I've been on 4 different medications for it (that didn't work). I had slept for 30 minutes the night before my appointment and I told her that I can stay up for days and that I've tried everything. She told me she can't do anything and that it's all about my attitude and that I just need to wake up earlier. I am absolutely devastated and I can't go on like this, I just want a normal sleep schedule. Is there anything I can do?",22May2020,1
25,"The best word I can use to describe my experience is overthinking, but I don't overthink in the sense that my mind jumps to the worst case scenario or runs scenarios over and over.

It's more like my mind constantly believes that I'm ""missing something"". That I am not safe here in this present moment because there is something else I have to think about in order to be okay. 

I feel almost threatened by new information. Every time I try to learn something new (related to things I'm interested in) my brain jumps to ""oh my gosh why didn't I know that before"" and I instantly become anxious that I'm missing other information too. Instead of appreciating the new thing I learned, I feel threatened and feel like I'm not at the right place in life because I didn't know this thing. Or, instead of actually learning something, my mind goes to thoughts of ""how WOULD I learn"" and thinks of all the possible information out there to learn, and then I never actually move forward. Sometimes when I learn about other people's work or see their creations, I feel threatened and feel like I'm at the wrong place in life because I should be doing what they do and I wonder ""how did they do that."" It feels like I've lost all creativity because I always feel like there's something else to think about besides the current moment - so I never feel free to create. 

It feels like I can't be present at all due to this constant feeling that there's something I need to be thinking about besides this present moment. I feel trapped in my head, rather than living out of freedom and flow. I feel like it prevents me from moving forward and being my truest self. 

I have tried meditation with headspace and it helped for a little while but only to a certain extent. For me, it feels like mindfulness can only do so much - some of these thoughts feel almost automatic and like they immediately make me anxious. If you have any other advice or even know what this is that I'm experiencing I'd appreciate it, but mostly I just want to know if any of you have experienced something similar to this.",22May2020,1

I've been living with a roommate who has still been working during all of this. He has grown increasingly more hostile with me as I just pretty much stay in my room and he doesn't take this Covid thing serious at all. We got into a pretty bad argument yesterday and I've made the decision to move-out. I don't really have any friends so I've made the decision to temporarily go live with parents (both retired) until I cam find a place to live, and save up money for what's ever is going to happen these next 6 months. I just don't know what the right thing to do right now is, and I don't know what jobs are going to be available in the future. I'm freaking out right now because of all this uncertainty.",22May2020,1
29,"So, I go to the bathroom a lot during the day, way more than my friends and family do. During a normal school/work day, I probably go to the bathroom around 20-35 times. I always go 3 times before leaving, one time just after I’ve arrived at school, 2-3 times before lunch, and 2-3 times after lunch. Sometimes I also go before heading home.

When I come home from school I get in the shower before doing anything else. After the shower I go once or twice. Before dinner (which is usually at 6 or 7) I have maybe gone to the bathroom 4 or 5 times. After dinner I usually go to the bathroom 5-10 times. Before going to sleep I go a lot, probably 5-10 times in less than 2 hours. 

Is this normal or too much? 

If it’s not normal, could this be because of an “accident” I had when I was 12/13? It didn’t happen in public or anything, but it still made me feel so humiliated and anxious. I’ve also had this problem since that “accident”.",22May2020,1
30,"So basically I'm epileptic, have ASD, anxiety now anxiety attacks and was bullied for it by my brothers, church, and school even the adults took part in the bullying. I was forced to isolate by my parents and gained weight because of it because they said exercise was too dangerous for me. When it wasnt up to my parents I basically isolated myself cause I was scared of socializing due to being alienated cause of the bullying making me think i was a demon. I started barking and acting like an animal in many ways and hated being around other people. OK so that's my background of but the reason my mind is in total chaos I due to a group called wrap around from CPS. They made me feel completely powerless and threatened to take me away from my home if I didnt accept the conditions in place and comply.
When I told them of a problem at home like how im made fun of for not being able to find a job easily they said "" we can find that by putting you in a foster home if you dont like it, if not shut up and take it"". 
I literally cant think of anything but this groups threats and what they told me when I get an anxiety attack. When i told the groups therapist that im simply standing up for myself he said ""Youre enforcing your morality and you can't enforce your morality in your moms house"". This quote keeps playing in my head whenever I try to tell my family to stop picking on me for my disabilities or anything else. When I told the group of not being to go outside they said "" OK you can go outside but don't complain about anything else or we'll put you in a foster home"". So I'm supposed to just take anything my family does to me and not complain cause trying to stop it is imposing on them. 
The facilitator asked me why im depressed and have anxiety which I answered ""cause of my stress and past"" and she just laughed in a condescending manner and said "" your past doesn't matter but imagine what your mom is going through"". So someones past justifies bad treatment of someone else. 
When we argued over why I'm me standijg up for myself she argued I dont have the right to stand up for myself and when then she smeared me over my disabilities like my family. I responded over trying to tell her how the economy and politics affects the family but she said ""we're not talking about that"" so there was no way for me to have a reasonable argument with her. When the program ended she said ""You see my dream is for you to respect your mom"" but its hard for to respect people who belittle me for arbitrary reasons. They were constantly looking for reasons to get involved in my life in different areas. They said "" This program wouldve been over in November if you didn't complain over our treatment of you"".

I know the programs over but my minds still paranoid that I'm being watched, that they're going to come back and my mind goes back to them when i get an anxiety attack. When I get anxiety attack I feel so paranoid and hopeless that I'm on the brick of committing suicide. I'm thinking of taking these people to court for violating various laws such as :

•California penal code 518 
•CA Mental health Law: Article 2 Unprofesional conduct Section.4982 subsection D, E, I, J, and L

• 1989 International Childrens right convention

•International Humans Rights

Everytime I even think of standing up for myself my mind says I'm imposing on someone else and that that's not correct so i should just let others impose on me but never say anything. So what I need is reassurance that this experience won't repeat itself and that standing up for myself isnt wrong.
I seriously need help I'm probably going to court over this to confront those who i feel wronged me cause I think that's the one way to get rid of this chaotic feeling.",22May2020,1

33,"Mental health became something I was aware of in August of last year when I drove across the country to without telling anyone in planning to hang myself. Ended up with me being hospitalized and spending some time in the psych ward. In February I went to jail for my first time on charges of Mischief under $5000 and holding a weapon. Could have been charged with lots more I guess but everyone seemed to be on my side. So since August I’ve been seeing psychiatrist and social workers and doing all that kind of stuff. I’m not the best at being honest with my Social worker and psychiatrist about what is going through my head so that probably doesn’t help a great deal. Most of the time when I decided to open up a bit about something and be more truthful I feel like I’m lying for some reason and usual kind of give up and move on.

To the point where it sometimes can become fantasies I regularly think about. This is something I have always kept to myself and have never planned about telling anyone this.

Usually the stalker in my dreams is a shadowy figure that I assumed was a man, but in the most recent one I saw it as an old woman. Before the nightmares started, I've had slowly increasing paranoia for about two months, and sometimes I get the unshakable feeling that there is some kind of being that I envision as the tall, shadowy man from my dreams in the room with me, hiding just out of view.

37,"So I'm a child of divorce and have stayed with my abusive dad for the last 10 years, while my mother decided to take my elder sister to stay with her.

My dad is a raging alcoholic, a smoker (and I suffer asthma), a druggie, and he has been accusing me for his broke wallet since I was 13. I get triggered anytime money is a topic in a conversation (whether its a serious topic or just for laughs) and I want cry and pull my hair off and scream. This drove me crazy and I constantly asked myself why I wasn't worthy enough for my mom to take me.

A few years ago, I was finally able to move out and live alone with my dog, my boyfriend offered to pay rent. They have been a huge help in taking me into safety, since I don't have any friends to begin with. I have trouble socializing. 

I have episodes at night when I can't sleep because I think of my dad. How much I want to punch him. I used to think of ways on how to discreetly kill him when I was younger, but I've moved on from that now that I'm in an age where I can get arrested.

It's only recently when the coronavirus happened and I had to move back with my dad because we couldn't afford my rent anymore. 

I kept begging my mom to take me in and I began filing the visa application on my own, and I only told her when I needed money for the medical check up. I finally opened up that I want to get checked because I'm getting heart palpitations from my episodes.

She doesn't want me to because it'll look bad on my record and she says that I might get declined. According to her, they wouldn't approve my residency if I'm going to end up consuming goverment healthcare.

I don't know what to do, I'm going crazy.

TLDR; My mom thinks being diagnosed with a mental illness will get me declined for a visa application. I'm going crazy that I might end up hurting myself.",22May2020,1

41,"tw suicide mention

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, the title. I've just finished university (after spending seven years on a four year BA due to my poor mental health), and I have no idea what's next. My mental health is so bad that I don't think I will ever be able to have a job. I definitely won't be able to manage a full time job. And most of the jobs in the industry in which I'm interested in working are short-term contract jobs – meaning I won't know year to year whether I'll even be able to keep my job. Layoffs and low pay are also huge problems. I can't handle that level of instability for the next 40+ years. I don't know I'm ever going to afford to live. The average home price where I live (and where my support system lives) has jumped to $1,000,000 in the last few years. The average rent is over $2,000 per month. Survival seems impossible unless I become wildly successful, which can't happen while my mental health is as poor as it has been for the last seven years. I dragged myself to the end of my degree and only got through it because my professors were willing to give me lengthy extensions on many of my assignments (for which I am extremely grateful). I barely got through. Now that it's over, I've lost the only thing left in my life I had any control over. Now everything is up in the air. I just feel like I'm done. I've completed the only thing in life I'm ever going to do. I've been in treatment for two years, and I still want to die. I don't want to fight with my brain every day for the rest of my life. I have no plans to harm myself, but I really don't want to do life anymore. I've made a reasonable attempt to figure out what steps I should take to improve my life and build a future with which I can be happy. But dying still feels like the best/only option. I don't have any motivation left to do anything that might help me. I feel like I never want to do anything ever again. I've honestly given up. I don't know what to do to motivate myself. I don't know if anything can... Part of me knows this is the illness talking. But it's winning and I don't care about stopping it. I'm too tired. What do I do?",22May2020,1
42,"The past few days I've had recurring nightmares, most of which involve me in my room while something/someone is in the room with me or is trying to force themselves in to kill me. Usually the stalker in my dreams is a shadowy figure that I assumed was a man, but in the most recent one I saw it as an old woman. Before the nightmares started, I've had slowly increasing paranoia for about two months, and sometimes I get the unshakable feeling that there is some kind of being that I envision as the tall, shadowy man from my dreams in the room with me, hiding just out of view. Sometimes this feeling gets so out of control that I panic and start seeing the shadowy figure in my room and sometimes following me outside of my room to other parts of the house, along with fever-dreamish kind of thoughts.

Your daughter is 19 and an only child, she lost her job in February. She has no friends and trouble keeping any she did have, she has mental disorders that prohibit her to perform the job to the best of her ability so she gets fired and you let it slide. Her mental disorders also affect her moods majorly and how she responds to people/environment. You are used to her not being able to keep a job for more than a month. She can’t get on disability because your house makes way too much money to qualify. You don’t really mind her staying at home for months on end because atleast you know she won’t end up dead or in jail because of a psychotic meltdown.

The daughter also takes two online college remediation classes (Gen Ed). She tries hard to maintain above a B average but it’s hard.

The daughter was seeking weekly therapy visits for about 4 months that were helping but they got postponed due to covid. Telemedicine visits aren't covered by health insurance. 

She received a stimulus check via mail at the end of April from last years tax file. 

You specifically told her not to cash it or if she decides to cash it to give you the money to keep incase she needs it for emergencies or something important down the road since she can’t be trusted with money. You want to go on family vacation in the future and would like the daughter to come but want her to pay for her own hotel room since everybody can’t sleep in the same room. 

Anyways, she just left it sit in a folder on the living room table. 
When you were at work, She deposited the check via mobile deposit but you have no idea she deposited it because the physical check is still sitting there and she lied saying that her bank app doesn’t have mobile deposit and you believed her. 

Due to her mental health disorder, she has bad impulsive  spending habits and can’t save money or really be trusted with it.

she recently, spent $570 on a few of her favorite singers rare merch and autographed items from a pop up site and she lied to you saying she won them in an Instagram contest. Again, you believed her. 

The clothes haven’t been shipped yet because his mom was on vacation for a week, she just got back today. Now she’s posting more of stuff. Nothing that the daughter wants to buy yet. 

The daughter transferred $200 from savings into checking account incase one of his really famous hats or jackets pop up. But the daughter swears that’s all she’s spending. No more. 

So if she does spend the $200 she will be left with $360. 

But you are also filing the daughters tax returns this weekend so she should get that money in a few weeks as well. So then she can go to the bank and deposit both checks. (Only the tax obv and throw out the stimulus somewhere else). 

The tax return is usually a little over a thousand. The daughter can’t spent any of that money because she has to save something or she knows the mom will find out because the mom wants to go on vacation. The daughter could say she doesn’t want to go but then the mom would think somethings up. Because the daughter loves to travel.",22May2020,1

I was there for two nights, but it felt like one long nightmare. People screaming, fighting, talking to themselves all around me. I was poked and prodded, still have bruises in my arms from the needles, from the nurses and doctors understandably trying to clear me from alcohol and drug abuse. I was clean.

54,"Im a 16 year old boy, and for years I've dealt with anxiety and perfectionism. They seemed to have leeched into every part of my life. I was taken out of school for having constant anxiety attacks while trying to complete tests or standard schoolwork. I had gone to counseling for a few years and was even put on medication, though it did not seem to ease my constant self-deprivation. 

Thankfully I am now homeschooled, and have been doing much better mentally. But even now, I still feel depressed and self loathing. But why? I have everything I want at my fingertips. My family is well off financially, and I usually get a lot of the things I want. My parents are loving and have never abused me in any way, shape or form. It's just that nothing seems good enough for me.

Im such a perfectionist that I could create something as magnificent as Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel and see it as garbage. I could gain third place in the Olympics and be pissed at myself because I did not gain first. Hell, I want to get a job though I feel that standard occupations for a person my age are ""below me"".

56,"A few months ago, my partner passed a kidney stone. He woke up one morning with an achey back, and within a couple hours of being awake he was screaming and crying out in pain, heaving into the toilet bowl and begging me to take him to the hospital. We spent the day in the emergency room where they gave him IV medicine and an CT scan that showed the stone. 

He screamed and cried the entire ride to the ER and up until the moment they pushed the pain medication through his IV. Then, he vomited all over me and slowly showed signs of relief. Then they pushed Dramamine into his IV, so within a matter of minutes he went from freaking out the way he was, to absolutely high as a kite and making jokes, ready to leave, asking if we could get McDonald’s on the way home. 

After they pushed the drugs, he was completely back to normal as if nothing had ever happened and napped for a couple hours, then talked with his friends on the phone until he was discharged.  For some reason though, I spent those last few hours in the ER a complete nervous wreck. I kept pacing around, then would need to sit because I’d nearly faint from the stress. I was nauseated and sweating and felt like I was watching a horror movie. 

While his relief was obviously a relief to me, I was almost frustrated by the fact that he was sitting there high and fine, joking around while I sat there covered in his vomit, completely in shock, trying to process having just seen my grown man of a boyfriend crying like that. 

We left the ER with a prescription for pain medications and instructions to drink water to flush out the stone.  I didn’t sleep a wink that night and called my doctor the next morning asking for anxiety medication. The stone passed a couple of days later and he’s been completely fine since. He drinks more water now, but only because I force him to, and he overall doesn’t seem changed or effected by the experience. 

I, however, honest to god believe I may be traumatized. 

It’s been months and still, every single day, not an hour goes by that I don’t think about that day and feel debilitatingly anxious.  I sit there zoning out and thinking about it constantly, picturing my boyfriend screaming and crying, begging me for help, vomiting all over the place. I also picture the moment that they pushed the drugs and he was suddenly okay.  Every time he eats anything, I feel anxious. Was it too salty? Was it too high in oxalate? We have had real fights about me bugging him to drink water too often. 

Not only do I think about that day constantly, but I am now paranoid about every aspect surrounding my boyfriends health. I worry constantly that he is developing severe health issues and I always think his normal bodily functions are symptoms of some serious underlying issue. 

He caught a common cold a month or so after the kidney stone, and I was an absolute wreck until he finally got better. I slept maybe an hour max every night, because I was so worried he would wake up really sick. I would watch his chest and breathing. Every time he coughed or groaned I felt like I was about to have an anxiety attack. My anxiety about his health has even been so severe that I even get nervous about him taking medications. When he had that cold I was terrified the entire time that he would take too many pills, or they would cause other health issues somehow from the side effects. I worry every time he wants to take acetaminophen because I don’t want him to damage his liver. I’m just paranoid constantly.  

The anxiety I feel when thinking or talking about this is so severe that I almost faint if I think too hard about certain moments. Random memories from that day will pop into my head and I’ll feel like I’m about to throw up. My heart rate feels like it goes nuts and I just feel pure terror come over me any time I think about it. I can not bare the thought of ever going through it again and genuinely believe I’d rather experience the stone myself instead of him, because at least he was completely fine after they gave him the meds. The thought of him ever having another stone fills me with so much dread that I can’t even think about it. The thought just overwhelms my brain so bad that when I start to think about what I would do if it ever happened again, I honestly start feeling suicidal. Why? 

I talked to my boyfriend about this the other day and he was really confused. He said he barely thinks about that day and probably wouldn’t have thought about it for months if it weren’t for me mentioning it once in a while. While he agreed that it was a terrible day, and the most painful thing he’s been though, he really doesn’t recall it as a traumatic event for himself and couldn’t understand why it has scarred me so much he almost seemed annoyed that I was trying to make it about me, taking away from his experience I guess, which made me feel really bad. I don’t understand why i feel so traumatized by this and I really wish I could stop thinking about it and move on cause it’s really taking a huge toll on my life and has really effected my mental health. 

If anyone could give me some insight as to why this was such a traumatic event for me I would love to know. I don’t want to seem like I’m “stealing the spotlight” and making the whole thing about me when it was clearly much worse for my boyfriend, but I genuinely think it effected me much worse and just can’t understand why.",22May2020,1
57,"I was diagnosed with clinical depression at the age of 12. I would be on and off of medication and never really gave it a chance to settle in. They tell you that you need to give it a month or two too settle and work properly. I would always make it to about a month and I would be conscious of the fact that the medication would make me feel nothing. It scared me and I thought that I would rather feel bad emotions then no emotions at all.  well of course my depression didn't go away because it's not circumstantial. I did not get depressed over a situation necessarily but the worst part about clinical depression is that everything can be perfectly fine and you are still sad. Not sad, miserable. I would list off all of these things in my head. Pinpointed an excuse to my sadness.
 Like okay once I get financially stable and I get my own house my own car and be able to provide for my family without living paycheck-to-paycheck that I wouldn't be sad anymore. One day I'm stuck in bed and I'm thinking okay what can I do to make this feeling stop why am I sad. At that moment I realized I didn't have anything to blame my sadness on. I had already accomplished all of the things I had previously blamed my depression on.. So I'm sitting here miserably depressed, begging to not wake up in the morning begging for just a tragic accident to happen to me for I am too much of a coward to kill myself.
 Yet I have everything that I needed. Everything that i thought i wanted. It became a terrifying feeling of misery that I figured I would never be happy because I didn't know what I wanted to make me happy. I already had it all. I found it hard to be even grateful for the things that I did have. Why would I want to live a life where I felt happiness was unachievable.
So meds became a final cry for help because I felt my only other route was suicide cuz I just couldn't stand the feeling of Eternal sadness. 
Well here I am now about two months in to my medication which is the longest amount of time I have actually given it a chance. I fought through the feelings of nothingness and just tried to remember that feeling nothingness was better at this point than feeling Eternal Doom. 
Well I do feel as though the medication is finally settling because I was sitting in my living room the other day and all of a sudden I thought of an idea. I felt inspiration and motivation to accomplish something and it may seem small but I did feel a spark of happiness. The simple fact that I was able to form an idea and think about it made me realize that it has been years since I've even been able to do that. 
I didn't even realise that I couldn't do it until I did it. I'm like... holly shit. I knew my head was fucked up but I didn't realise exactly how much that affected my train of thought. Before the meds... my brain would literally block out the ability to think clearly. Or to even work at a capacity capable of formulating an idea and feeling inspired enough to put that idea into action. My mind was simply on auto pilot. Functioning (barely) enough to do what I needed to do to get me through the day. Not happily. Everything I did, I did only because I had to. It took everything in me just to do that. I found negativity in everything I did and down right refused (subconsciously) to find positivity in anything. 
I'm not gonna say that im where I want to be, but It has been weeks since I felt depressed. 
I'm still trying to get used to being able to think more clearly and being capable to get out of bed even. But at least now I have the ability to be conscious of my negative attitude and figure out a way to change my view on things. Find the positivity in things instead of solely focusing on the negatives. 
I am not happy. Yet. But I think I'm making progress to getting there. 
My whole point I guess was to share that... I'm proud of my self for feeling inspired to accomplish an idea that I though of all on my own. To someone that is not mentally ill... this is a silly thing to get excited about because normal people do this kind of thing with ease everyday. I wanted to express my excitement to a group of people who would recognise this as a break through. Maybe someone will read this and realise that they forgot they couldn't feel this emotion either because it's been buried. 
Depression does not allow positive emotions. Depression does not allow you to feel anything but misery no matter what. Depression buries gratitude, positivity, joy, inspiration, everything! Depression makes you believe that you are good for nothing, that you're  a burden, that you would be better off dead so don't waste your time with hope. 
To those of you making excuses for not taking your meds, or those of you putting it off because your simply crippled by self pity and misery... I'm telling you. Take that step. Get those meds and give them a chance to work. Take them every day and don't give up on them even if you think it's pointless. 
If I knew months, or even years ago that my meds would guide me to this point I would have saved myself so much pain. Even if this is as far as they will take me... Even if I don't reach a point of pure happiness... the clarity and relief I have now makes it all worth it .

58,"Hey!

This may be triggering for some people. 

A while back I was talking to someone about my messed up sexuality (e.g. I don’t like being touched that much, I never had an orgasm with a partner, when having sex with a man I am getting stiff and don’t put any effort in at all, I can’t say no, anytime someone would approach me (even a stranger on a street) and begin to touch me I would let it happen, because I don’t want to upset them by saying no, I am fantasizing to real hardcore stuff like getting abused, raped, humiliated etc by multiple men although I identify as a lesbian) and she asked me if I was abused as child which I denied. I was physically abused but not sexually.  

But since then I was wondering if this is actually true or if I just „forgot“ it. I mean I know I have some serious problems in my sex life but I don’t know if sexual abuse may be the reason. on the other hand, a friend of mine told me that I was partying a few years ago and she remembers me having drunk sex with strangers without protection in some alley because I called her and told her. I don’t recall any of that and am worried I may have forgotten even more. Does anyone of you know how to find out?",22May2020,1

I'm not sure if this just stems from an extreme fear of abandonment or I should possibly explore the realm of BPD. I love my boyfriend so much and I'm so afraid to lose him, but it's like the second I hear something potentially negative my mind switches over to irrationality and I become a completely different person. I disrespect him, I say mean and hurtful things, I cross lines. When I'm not in that frame of mind, everything between us is amazing and we have so much fun spending time together. It's like I become a completely different person during those kind of arguments. But the frequency of my being defensive has seemed to pick up since we've been spending so much time together in quarantine and I almost feel like I can't control it.

Has anyone else had a similar experience? I want to marry this guy but I know that if I keep up this behavior, we may not even survive the summer. I don't want him to have to keep living in fear that something is going to set me off. And I want to become a better, less reactionary and hurtful person.

My current strategies are: try to research and understand as much as I can at least about the patterns behind my fear of abandonment and other people experiencing the same thing, looking into seeing a therapist (which may be a little difficult with my health insurance but it's worth a shot), and taking zoloft 25mg (got an rx a few days ago from my GP so I'm not sure how it's effecting me yet) for my anxiety which has also spiked recently and may be a contributing factor to my worries about my boyfriend leaving me over insignificant things.

Besides what I've outlined above, I'm at a bit of a loss. I definitely don't want to be this way, and I don't want to lose my partner. But once the switch flips in my mind to being defensive and angry and my irrational self, it seems like there's nothing I can do to stop it. I don't even realize it's a problem in the moment.",22May2020,1

63,"Throwaway account cus I mainly need to vent.. 

There are a great number of questions I ask myself seemingly daily..

Am I good enough? 
Good enough to get the career I want? 
Good enough of a boyfriend to deserve my girl? 
Good enough of a son to make my mom and dad proud?
Am I wasting my life? 
Why have I done nothing for the past 12 months? 
Will I ever ammount to anything?
Am I blinding myself so much with the idea of what I want to do for a career, that I've forgotten what I actually have to do?
Why can't I sleep at night?
Why do I remind myself that one day I will die... And there will be nothing left of me? Why does that shake me to the very core of my being?
Am I afraid of change?
Am I afraid of choice?
Am I afraid of consequence?
Do I have anxiety?
Do I have depression?
Am I scared to see a shrink?
Am I scared that they will tell me I'm dying?
Am I destroying myself because of the way I eat?
Am I destroying myself because I'm scared to talk about anything?
Will I ever marry?
Will my girl leave me with no reason like the last one?
Am I the problem?
Should I remove the problem?
How much damage am I doing to people by not confronting anything?
Do people hate me?
Do people judge me?
Is there something in my head that's going to be the end of me?
Is there something that I'm doing that's going to be the end of me?
Why am I not strong?
I should be strong?
I should support people?
How can I do that without being able to figure my own life out?
Am I a fraud for giving advice?
Am I hurting people with my advice?
Am I toxic?
Am I broken?

All of these questions flooding my head, every hour of every day.. and there's no answer... And I'm so crippled by fear at approaching any of them that I don't think I'll get any sorted.

I had to walk past endless tables of people I knew and no one would tell me who it was or what I did.

67,"Hi everyone. I’m on 50mg zoloft currently on 6 weeks of Zoloft ( 1 week started at 25mg, 5 weeks at 50mg). I was wondering if anyone else experienced anxiety at a certain time? I don’t think it’s Zoloft related I just wanted to put it out there that I’m on it because of what I recently starting going through. When I first got anxiety attacks every day, it would always be between 7pm-8pm. Without fail. Every day. Thankfully it’s easing up and I don’t have full blown attacks but I still get that anxious feeling. Does anyone else experience anything similar? Getting anxiety at a certain time every day? Another thing, I work on a trauma unit. I know my job is stressful, but I don’t feel like I’m overwhelmed with stress. But without fail, the night before I have to work I start to get anxious. I’ve been feeling fine the past few days (I’ve been off) but I work in the morning and I’m starting to get that anxious pit in my stomach. I just don’t feel like my job is causing me enough stress to make me anxious, but I don’t know why else I’d be feeling like this. Im still at a point of my medication where I feel very on edge and I’m just a ball of fear to do anything/go anywhere due to a fear of having a panic attack. I get anxious just thinking about going back to life before anxiety. I hope the medicine will make that feeling go away eventually. (Pls let me know if it did for you) Srry this is so long.

68,"Hello, my name is Cam, I am a 16-year-old boy and an only child. I've just been frustrated lately and I guess this was the only place I feel I could post anything and explain my situation, maybe find someone out there who relates, who knows.

First off, my parents, aren't bad people just kinda fucked up lmao. My mom, when I was a kid was active, healthy physically and mentally and so was my dad for the most part.

As a kid, my parents were together and it was just us three, we lived in a nice neighborhood and I had lots of good friends. Then about 7 years back we decided to move to another end of the city, this is where everything went downhill.

My mom within about 2 years of moving stopped going on her normal walks, and eventually never left her room, didn't even go to the store, she pretty much lived in her bedroom. Occasionally she would come out and scream and yell, kick shit around, then go back to her room and sulk.

 At the time, of course, I had no idea what was happening everything seemed fine beforehand, naturally, I was confused but I never really blamed myself because I know I didn't do anything wrong. 

skip forward to 2017, my mom moved out of the house as she and my dad had been having arguments, yelling, just the typical bad relationship jazz, she had moved into an apartment not far from our house, so I can go back and forth between my mom and dad with ease on my bike.

This did not help at all, her place quickly became a mess, her not being able to function properly made it so that, there was stuff piled everywhere, just a horrible mess, clutter everywhere, she couldn't bathe herself, and the fact that she's alone in the apartment made her mental state worse.

All this had a serious impact on my dad as well, for the past 2 or 3 years, my dad has changed, he's become really cold and doesn't really show any emotion except anger with me. For the past two years I've been cooking all the meals for both my parents, cook at my dad's, bring it to my mom, then come back to dads and eat. At my Dads I also clean, I clean the kitchen, my room, his room, vacuum, cook, everything under the sun, I do it.

My Dad only sits on the couch nowadays, and every night he drinks a full 750mL bottle of Smirnoff vodka, he starts at around 11 am if he's not working that day. When he does this it's hard to do anything to not make him angry with me. I cook dinner, clean and I don't even get a thank you, just nothing, and I'm not asking for praise, I just want my dad to be happier again, and I'm doing everything I can.

So because of my dad's bad mood, I would spend a lot of time at my mom's, this proved not to be the best decision, because of my mom's lack of motivation, and since she stopped telling me what to do, I wouldn't cook the meals or anything. But since she became depressed she started eating badly and became quite unhealthy physically, she would buy a bunch of junk food, and stupid me would eat it. Because of this I became quite overweight at my age.

Around the same time with all this going on between my mom and dad I began failing school and became extremely anxious, every day I would panic over trivial things, I developed severe anxiety and feel like I couldn't breathe, I would definitely have at least one panic attack a day, somedays, more than one. To the point where you feel suffocated.

My mother realizing there was a problem decided to take sign me up for therapy. It was good, the therapists were nice and it felt good being able to talk to them about stuff and they would understand. I would take their advice and it still helps to this day, but it never really helped solve any real issues. At the therapist's I took a test to determine if I had any mental illnesses. The two that I turned out to have are depression and severe anxiety and I guess self-consciousness? although I'm not sure if that's exactly mental illness per se either way, had that too. 

Upon hearing this, my mom absolutely lost it, she was so mad. The drive home from the hospital was very scary, she wasn't talking and she was so angry. When we got home she started yelling and kicking so I just went to my dad's.

After about 4 months of therapy, my parents suddenly stopped taking me, I still don't know why, and how could they have forgotten? Either way I still don't have a definitive answer, maybe finances? I still am not sure.

At this point the only people I can talk to are my close friends, and my close friends' parents, they know a lot about mental health and are very good people, they even took me with them on vacation a few years back, they're like my other parents and I love them dearly. I am so grateful to have them, without them I wouldn't know a lot of the things I know today. And my Uncle, he takes me in most summers and gave me a job, and life was just really great for a while until I had to come back home to the same... shit.

Around last November I realized that I gotta change my life around, I decided to change what I have the power to change. So I stopped eating like crap, started swimming every Friday for around 2-4hrs at a time with friends or alone. I started to try and have a better outlook on life, and it worked for a while. I lost around 40 pounds and I feel much better about my personal image now. I'm trying to eat regularly although still difficult I don't often eat breakfast or lunch, I only eat dinner, well because I cook it. Despite my parents, I'm feeling better than I did even a year ago.

But still not feeling too good about this whole thing. I don't know if this is weird or not, but I have a really hard time going to my friend's houses, their places are so clean and well kept, their parents are put together, and they don't smoke or drink or abuse medication. There are laughs and it's not constantly tense and quiet. They eat meals at the dinner table and they all help around the house to get chores done.

Their lives just seem so happy, and I'm happy for them but I just have such a hard time going to their houses, my friends' parents have made me more meals in the past year than my own parents have. And I like going to visit them, but a part of me doesn't because every time I do I am reminded about my situation and I typically get really depressed for a few days afterward. But that doesn't mean I am not grateful.

I know that 90% of you aren't even going to read all of this, but for those who do, I genuinely do appreciate it. I am trying every day to not become the same way my parents are and get through this situation. It's just really hard when you're an only child, with no family nearby and only friends to keep you sane, and now quarantine has hit and I can't even see them. I'm stuck in this toxic environment until the social distance rule lifts.

Well anyways, there is so much more to the story that I haven't covered and many life experiences that I haven't shared, but I am going to wrap this up for now. You're on this subreddit for a reason and I want you to know that there is more to life than just the bad parts. Try to focus on right now and be grateful for everything you have and make this difficult time as a lesson to become a stronger, healthier person. I hope you have a fantastic day and no matter what your circumstance, it always gets better.

Goodnight.",22May2020,1

74,"My 13 year old brother is totally regressing in age behavior. As of late he's been acting like a toddler, throwing tantrums, crying, using baby talk, not using his words when he's upset and just making sounds, screaming and cursing at everyone, playing in the mud and with toys, and he's total slob as of late. He's always been a sensitive kid and still cries sometimes but for normal things like pain or sadness. He throws a massive fit crying and screaming histaricly nearly every night because our mom told him to go take bed because it's like 2am. 

Me and my mom had just noticed how far he's been taking this. We asked him why and he said quarantine is stressful and being a baby was easiest part in his life. Nobody's here to judge him and he's doing what he wants. So he's all stressed out about being stuck inside and getting into constant fights with our dad over dumb stuff. My dad has brain damage from a skiing accident when he was 17 and has ADD. My dad thinks that when sombody disagrees with him of if you try to defend yourself your disrespecting and attacking him. My brother wants to be a lawyer when he's older. Not good. My brother talks to me and my mom about it whenever it bothers him though. It must be really stressful for him.  

The obvious problem is that this behavior is getting kinda inappropriate and annoying. He says he's doing this to help him and I heard that regressing is your body trying to make things easier for you when your stressed but I'm not sure if this is good for him. Just on Christmas he was dressing nicer and more mature than ever before and using overly complicated longer words. He was even trying to make his voice sound deeper and be seen as a grownup. He hasn't acted like this since he was like 5.

Every time I’m out with my friends it always seems they’ll wind up talking to someone they know and I’ll get phased out of the conversation and just be the third wheel standing there. My friends have told me before they love me or that I’m one of their best friends but I still feel so worthless and uncool and left out like they don’t even really like me like I’m just a straggler riding their coattails as they go out and get girls and just walk up to them without any fear of failure at all. I wish I could be like that but I don’t know why but there’s just always something in my mind that gives me what can only be compared to stage fright in these settings. I’m tall I’ve been told I’m generally good looking by most people and I work out all the time so it’s not for lacking confidence in my appearance as cocky as that may sound. I just don’t know why I always feel so worthless and awkward and like I can’t even say one word to new people or more importantly new girls when I’m around my friends and pledge brothers. We had one of our pledge brothers pass away in a car accident last semester and sure everyone was heartbroken for a week about it but now not a single one of us thinks about him when we go out and that’s how I feel they would be if I just up and died tomorrow.

77,"Hi everyone, I’m a 22 yr old guy that just recently got out of an 8 yr relationship last year. I’ve been living on my own for about a year and noticed a small case of night terrors would come up around 10 months ago where I would wake up breathing heavy or just have very weird random dreams in general. It started with just heavy breathing then turned into me waking up sweating, sitting up on the end of my bed and saying random words that didn’t make any sense, like I could subconsciously feel myself talking but it always takes a couple seconds to come to my senses and take back control. This harmless sleep talking eventually turned into me jumping out of bed and trying to open my front door saying help. I know I’m saying help I can hear myself calling out for help, but again, I don’t know why I’m saying it or trying to open my front door,  I always take around 10 seconds to collect myself then go back to bed. It seems to be almost everyday these past two months that these episodes have gotten more aggressive and violent. Last week I randomly shot out of bed and punched my window repeatedly, again I seemed to have no control of my body or my actions but knew what I was doing at the time. I’m writing this right now at 1 am because I just got done calming myself down after randomly waking up and literally screaming help me at the top of my lungs.

I'm an 18 year old highschool junior (holdback for sports related reasons) who plays 3 varsity sports and has a 4.1 GPA. Youd think im living the dream, but in reality, as soon as I see myself wether in a mirror or in a picture or a selfie or whatever, it completely ruins my day.

I choose to like those things though, what I didn't choose is how I look. I'm not ugly by any means (atleast I don't think so at this point maybe I am lmao), but I know im not the most attractive person ever. For some reason, no matter how much my significant other tells me she thinks im ""handsome"" or ""gorgeous"" or ""stunning"", it never registers for me. I feel so negatively about my appearance that it bleeds into other things and morphs into things like jealousy because I cannot process why a girl would be with me. This causes me to be in utter fear any time a girl im talking to brings up another guy. Like, crippling anxiety to the point where I can't function unless she gives me some sort of comfort. This is fucking T O X I C and its toxic to be around but I don't know how to control it. Every day I try to make it the focus of my day, but I end up failing miserably. Both of my previous ""relationships"" ended not directly because of this but I garuntee it played a massive part. I wanna fix this so bad because I just want to be a loving partner and be the best I can be for whoever I'm with. Do you guys have any tips in helping find self acceptance?

I've had generalised anxiety disorder since I was a teenager, and it got worse with time. It started with general sadness and self isolation. At some pont I couldn't even go outside alone, walking down the street felt horrible, like everyone was watching and judging me. I couldn't talk to strangers, buying something at a shop or even asking someone for the time was impossible. 

Around 4 years ago I finally told my mom, and I got diagnosed by our doctor (not a psychologist). I've been taking pills since then.

100mg Sertraline in the morning, and 1mg Lorazepam at night.

They definitely helped with the anxiety, and I could get the strength to socialize again and do stuff I was uncapable of doing on my own before. Right now I could consider myself a normal person again.

There's something that didn't get better tho, and I just can't take it anymore. The emotional numbness.

I've been numb for so long. I can't feel sad, angry or happy about anything. I just feel worry. The only thing I achieve when I do stuff like sports, listening to music, drawing, or hanging out with friends, is distract myself. They don't bring me joy anymore. I can't remember the last time I felt excited about something.

Finishing any project has become extremely hard. As an artist, a work, be it a painting or a craft, can take hours to days. The longer it takes, the harder it is for me to finish it. I've left many gifts for loved ones unfinished, and in the end I just feel frustrated and more anxious. It's hard to start anything new because I know I will quit at some point, and If I actually manage to finish it, I won't feel any accomplishment.

It's come to a point where I can't feel anything towards my friends or family either, and this is what scares me the most. I don't want to hurt them. They have been there for me all this time, and still are, and I can't give them even gratitude. Their presence is neutral for me, and sometimes I even feel annoyed and just want to be alone. I can't focus on what they talk me about, I make an effort but it's not interesting, I want them to finish talking and just keep doing whatever I was doing. I feel horrible just by writing it.

I don't want to be like this. Apart from the anxiety of course, I miss the sensitive person I used to be so much. I want to feel again. I want to enjoy every minute of a drawing I'm working on, like I used to. I want to be excited by my friend's good news. I want to feel empathy for their feelings. I want to care about them and love them like they love me. I want to deserve it, because right now I feel like I don't.

Please, any advice would be highly appreciated. I have no idea what steps to take from here. Thank you in advance.",22May2020,1
89,"I’m probably bipolar because I think my family has a history in that along with other mental issues. I can’t trust myself anymore. I don’t know how I’m feeling or what im thinking because there are just so many thoughts and it’s like I can’t hear any I’m just *thinking*. It’s like I have a constant headache. Over the years I’ve convinced myself that I am bi, lesbian, straight, schizophrenic, an insomniac, overdramatic, that there’s nothing actually different about me and I’m making a big deal out of nothing, that I’m non binary, and that I’m trans. I don’t know what is true. I can’t even tell if I’m mad at myself, my family, friends, or if I am even mad in the first place. Anyone else feel this way?",22May2020,1
90,"My mom passed away from cancer on the 8th October and my mind has been restless ever since. I'm 22 and I still live at home so I went from seeing her every day to this. 

Everything in the house reminds me of her. Every time I leave my room, I see her paintings on the walls, her jacket is still in the hallway and in general everything just has memories of her associated with it. And every time I'm reminded of her, I remember that she's gone forever. 

I get vivid flashbacks to the day that we went to the hospital and sat by her death bed. She wasn't ready to die. When we entered her room, she was shouting ""I don't want to die, I don't want to die."" 

Her kidneys were failing which meant that her brain was flooded with toxins and she was slipping in and out of consciousness for most of the time. I can't get this image out of my head of her lying there with her eyes staring into the ceiling, seemingly unable to process what was happening. 

For a few minutes, she was back, talking to us, sounding like she usually did. She said goodbye to us, telling my brother and me how proud she was of us and that I should go on and eventually start a family with my girlfriend. She was holding my dad's hand. She told my aunt not to cry. They had already been injecting her with morphine and shortly after she fell asleep, never to wake up again. I'm thankful that we had this moment, I suppose.

So it's been more than half a year but I barely feel any better than the day after she died. I'm still unable to function properly. My anxiety and depression (undiagnosed) which I've always had and which had already been impairing my life is worse than it ever was. I just feel numb for most of the day, sometimes I cry. I don't feel like I'll ever be at peace with what happened. I haven't even visited her grave in a very long time because it just hurts too damn much.

She was diagnosed in 2016 and I suppose we all feared this would happen eventually. Seeing her fight this disease and go through all these different treatments with their side effects had already been chipping away at my mental health. And those three years have not prepared me at all. 

I'm finally building up the courage to try to get into therapy. I had been meaning to do this even before she died. However, in my country it's most likely going to take months until there's a slot available for me, and then, to be honest, I don't even see it helping me that much. Is there anyone with similar experiences and if so how did you overcome it? Did you overcome it?",22May2020,1
91,Feels like it. Im to the point where I almost want to be put in a care unit or something just so I HAVE to get better because I just can’t where I am right now for whatever reason. I want to feel not crazy and I know it sounds stupid but being I feel like I’d actually be understood in care with others like me. I don’t need it and it is selfish. I know someone who would have needed it more than me. I just want to be helped and when I’ve told my mom i need therapy she has asked me if I would *actually* talk to the therapist and makes me doubt myself. I don’t want to cost my family money even if we’re well off. I don’t think I’d even belong in a care unit because I haven’t scarred myself or tried to hurt others recently.

93,"I really do not get how people can dismiss the fact that men can also be depressed and suicidal. I always get so depressed whenever people say bad sh\*t about men and invalidate them and their experiences and mental illnesses. It really makes me hate this world even more, to know there are people who think that men cannot suffer from those illnesses. 

It's like telling an obvious depressed 6 year old they cannot be depressed because they are 6. Like??? where is the compassion? where is the empathy? i just wish the world would be nicer and more understanding of how men are suffering, and they shouldn't be excluded just because they are men. 

My partner is depressed i have witnessed him trying to take his life, i have witnessed him harming himself. Anyone can suffer from a serious mental illness no matter what skin color, gender, sexual preference or age you are, mental illness always will chose anyone and everyone. 

I hope, that any man who suffers gets the help they need and get the support they deserve. You aren't alone and you will get through this, we all will, it takes tiny steps to improvement but its a big step to deciding to become better. You're all loved by everyone, and no matter what you might go through, you will be helped and supported through it.

I constantly feel dazed, weak, and emotionless among other things. And I absolutely love it. However this is probably because when ever I eat I feel anxious, paranoid, and I feel like everyone is staring/judging me. I know this isn’t healthy, but honestly, I don’t want to change. I would rather feel numb than feel the panic that comes with eating.

97,"Hello reddit. I'm here because I need actual advice and the best way to get that without any consequences is to be on here. I'm Anon a 16 year old male. I'm starting to have some major problems that are getting exponentially worse. For some backstory I grew up in a household with my father, mother,  and sister with the occasional visit from my half brother. We lived out in the suburbs surrounded by forest with a few neighbors about 600 yards away from our house in any given direction except for directly across the street where there was our closest neighbor. This is sortve important to know. From as far back as I can remember my dad has always been an alcoholic. I can remember back to when I was 5 or 6. I remember waking up in the middle of the night to screaming and the noise of slamming against the walls and stomping on the floor. That's the first memory I have of walking in on my dad beating the shit out of my mom. My sister is about 2 years younger than me and at the time it was my job as the big brother to wake her up and have her get her shoes on so when my mom stops getting hit, kicked and threatened with a knife we can leave. This wasnt always this rough but I remember it being most nights of the week where my dad and my mom would argue and he would abuse her. Not every night this happened would we leave to spend the night at a close friends house or my grandfathers house. This went on for years with alot of insane fights that I cant fully go into detail with for each one because we would be here all day. Just for example though there was one fight I remember where my dad was beating my mom because she was apparently a slut. I wokeup my sister like the usual and ended up getting ready to leave for the night and while we waited for her to come up the stairs from the basement me and my sister would put our ears to the air vent to hear their conversation and the sounds of our mother getting beat. When she came up the stairs we got into the only car our family had and we were getting ready to pull out when my father started choking our pet dog while he was on the running line outside. This was a really messed up experience that went on for years. When I was around 10 my parents started the divorce process. I dont remember much from this time besides living in the house with my mother and sister while my father lived with his sister in the neighboring town. Our father was the only one with a job and with our house not being fully payed off it was getting foreclosed upon while we were still living in it. This ended up making my mother homeless for a short while and giving my dad the legal boost he needed to get custody of us. For some reason he fought to keep me and my sister even though he had never made an effort to even talk to us before the divorce. My only guess is that it was his final fuck you to my mother. We ended up living with our father for about 5 years until this January where he got hammered, tried to beat my half brother up. ( half brother is in twenties and stayed with us when we moved in with father to make sure we were okay.) With this CPS moved us in with our mother and all seemed to be well for awhile. When things started to calm down and my living situation was made stable by my mother there wasnt really anything to worry about. I started noticing things about myself I hadn't really had an issue with until recently. I realized I automatically lie to people almost everytime I talk to anyone without even thinking about it. Not even small lies but really big irrational ones. Ive gotten so good at lying I'm able to lie to myself and not realize it. Like emotions. I can't even tell if I'm really feeling something or if I'm lying to myself. I realized all of my friends arent really my friends and it seems like I'm just subconsciously using them for my own gain. I realized I'm not really happy and that I havent been in a long time. I have major trust issues and anxiety and cant function in any relationship. Every relationship I've built in the last couple years has been a sham and I never really had any feelings for anyone. People are almost like objects to me. I'm always tired and I just feel empty. I think about suicide everyday. I know this must be a bunch of rambling but I dont really know what's real when it comes to what I feel say or think. Living almost feels like a dream. I really need help but I'm scared I'm not actually gonna reach out and get it. Can you all help in any way that can. Whether it be trying to tell me what I have or just forcing me to see a therapist somehow. I feel like I'm losing it and nobody knows. I dont want to tell anyone and I definitely wont if it's my choice.",22May2020,1

first of all I have to say that I am usually very kind, peaceful and against all sorts of violence.
That's why I'm really disturbed by this fantasy which occurs to me in different situations and many times a day.

As the title says, I fantasize about having intercourse with my psychotherapist, eventually without protection against her will. 

I'm seeing my psychotherapist since a few weeks and she is a very nice person and incredibly helpful. She is only a few years older and quite pretty but there's nothing connecting us beside a good basis for our conversations.

I don't know if I should go see her and act like these thoughts aren't existing? Or should I tell her?
Maybe I should cancel all future appointments without explanation and never show up again?

I dread losing her as she was my only way out of some stuck situations and problems for a long time.

102,"I have this feeling that I want to do something inspiring, so that my pain was not for nothing and I don't remain in this socially isolated life I have been living. I talk to people on tge internet and they are saving me now, but I also want connections outside of the computer. What do I do with all this pain I have suffered? What do I learn? Ik have family who support me, but they don't understand my mental health issues. 

I've had a psychosis twice, in 2015 and 2019, it were confusing and scary times. Especially with the second psychosis, which I think was triggered by emotional stress after I had to end a work relationship because I started to get attached more than I should, I felt depressed, I had suicidal thoughts, I felt like nothing would be okay again. I have been told to live in the present and forget about the past. But because it hurt so much, I can't just forget. The guy had something I was missing in my life, he made me feel appreciated and understood. But I know we couldn't be friends and that thought had hurt so much, it was an emotiomal trauma for me. 

And when I am not lucid, am manic, have a psychosis I send weird messages and all my thoughts come out, delusions, paranoia. I have lost friends because of my psychoses. I have feelings of shame. I am not in control of my own brain when I have a psychosis, it's scary. 

I also find it difficult to trust people, but I am trying again. I also try to be aware of the privileges I have and the privileges I don't have so I don't crawl into a victim role. 

I want to create a platform about psychosis, mental health, emotional trauma. Have a open discussion, I think we should inspire each other. 

In 2018 I also did my research on emotional abuse/narcissistic abuse and I had that feeling of wanting to help people.

103,"I (19 M) don’t really know where to start this, so I guess I’ll just say this:
For the past 3 to 4 months I haven’t felt sad. Not just that, I haven’t been ABLE to feel sad. 
I suffered through a solid amount of neglect in my childhood, along with a small bit of abuse. That has led to fairly often bouts of depression and a tendency to distance myself from others.  I’ve been aware of these issues and have made progress to solve them. 
However, around mid February I seemed to have just hit this point where I don’t feel sad anymore. And it definitely isn’t for lack of tragedy. Over this time, my family has had to put down both of our 2 dogs. I had grown up with these dogs since I was 6 years old and I certainly loved them. Yet, on both occasions I never felt grief or sadness about their passing. Following both of these, I received news yesterday that my grandmother had passed. I was never particularly close to this grandmother but I had spent a large amount of time with her and I loved her. But again, no sadness, no grief. 
As you may expect this has given me some concern. I know this isn’t normal. Although, my depression seems to have faded, I fear that this is a new issue. Most of all, I fear the fact that I don’t know if it’s an issue I want fixed. I don’t necessarily feel happy but I finally feel okay, and it’s nice to feel like that.

He brought us to a place in the lake that was covered by trees so no one could see us, and he pulled me towards him and wrapped his legs around mine and held them closed. He was holding my wrists before he reached down and started touching/grabbing me through my swim trunks which were just soccer shorts. I don’t know how many times he touched me, I just remember him touching me and me thinking it was an accident, so I kind of stuck my butt out and crouched over so he couldn’t “accidentally” touch me again. But then he did touch me again and that’s when I saw him smiling at me. I was trying to escape and I was saying stop. It didn’t last very long I don’t think and he didn’t really do anything but touch and grab me. It was all really shocking and confusing. Was it molestation? I don’t know anymore.

110,"To start, I'm a 22 year old. I never thought I had clinical depression because I never really had suicidal thoughts or anything along those lines.

I've been in a state the past couple years where I'm just not that happy. Like I can experience joy and have fun while going out/gaming with friends but over the past couple years I've become a lot more introverted, anxious and severely lack motivation. Im not very happy when Im just alone and usually just feel bored or a bit anxious (I don't have anxiety attacks that cause trouble breathing or anything like that but there are times where I'm very anxious and it can happen somewhat randomly)

I was an extremely good student through elementary school, freshman and sophomore year. Then in junior year I started having more issues with my sleep patterns and started missing more classes. In senior year I actually dropped out of my very first classes of the day (both semesters) and often missed or showed up late to 2nd period. Honestly I still did well in class and understood all the material (I honestly found it very boring if anything. I won't pretend I was a genius or something but most things came pretty easily to me and I wasn't being stimulated at all) -- however my grades slipped a lot because for whatever reason attendance and homework get marked heavily even if I theoretically got 99 on every test/essay/assignment/exam.

I took a gap year and never went to post secondary. I'd work a job for a while, take a small break then start a new job. That was the pattern until 2019 where I didn't work at all (started working again early 2020). I didn't work most of 2019 partly due to being self conscious. I went from being pretty fit/attractive to putting on some weight during my first few months off and none of my clothes fit that well and I generally just didn't wanna be seen in public.

I feel like I'm failing in life but I somehow have no motivation to fix it (this is mainly why I think I'm depressed or have some other mental health issue). I know what some of my goals are but don't have the motivation to go for them. A big part of the problem is that I don't know what I want to do as a career and the thought of wasting all that time/money kinda stresses me out.

I've also noticed that in the last year or so I've become a lot more paranoid. I check the doors to my rooms several times before leaving the house (to make sure the cats can't get in and jump all over my stuff), sometimes I check that the door to my house is locked several times (sometimes even walking away for 30 seconds just to turn back and check again even if I'm just taking a short walk to the store or something). I'll pat down my pockets occasionally to make sure I still have my headphones/phone/keys etc. And even before the pandemic started I found that I was washing my hands more and even rinsing off cans/drinks that I bought at the store (I don't even know what sparked this)

I think checking all my doors so often is partly money related. I'm not super broke or anything but if something valuable were broken or stolen I wouldn't have a very easy time replacing it.

I have ADHD (diagnosed since I was very young) and maybe even some kind of sleep disorder (I've been borderline nocturnal the past few years) but idk if I should be seeking professional help or anything like that because idk if there's anything to actually diagnose.

Also idk if this is related in ANY way but I'm not a *super* sleepy person by any means but something about cuddling just knocks me out. Maybe this is completely normal but I could sleep 12 hours, my girlfriend would come over 2 hours after I woke up and I'd just pass the fuck out.

I'm not expected a clinical diagnosis on Reddit but I'd really appreciate guidance/opinions..",22May2020,1

I cant talk to new people without panicking, I cant look people in the eyes, and I overthink everything. An example of this was today when I was supposed to call a possible job offer. All my family members were out of the house and I was alone for a bit, it took me an hour to press the call button on my phone. During this hour I was panicking, thinking of all the ways I can mess up, I was planning what I was going to say, my hands got really sweaty and it doesnt help that I have hyperhidrosis (also one of the reasons why I avoid touching people bc they get grossed out), it felt like my chest was slowly being compressed. The phone call lasted less than a minute as she told me the job offer was not available.

Anyways how do I tell my parents? They've always been supportive of me by supporting my passions like sports, sneakers, fashion, and video games but being immigrants I dont know they're thoughts on mental health as I know some people think it's a joke, but my parents are pretty young and accepting.

This is going to be a long story, and I’ll leave a TLDR below, but to preface everything I’m a 19M. Basically, I lived your completely stereotypical American life up until a year ago. Great family, great friends, loved life, and was someone people generally looked up to by those at my high school. I’d gotten accepted to a great school for my degree, and things were looking great. 

However, there was one thing I just wanted to fix, and it had always been embarrassing to address. Basically I had pretty severe phimosis (penis condition where foreskin is tight), and a tight frenulum, so my local doctor recommended a small procedure called a frenulectomy, or removal of the frenulum. He advertised it was a tiny procedure, would fix my problems, and it seemed like a no brainer for me. I was actually excited to get it done, and relived that this problem, which had caused some embarrassing sexual experiences, would be no more. So June 5th, 2019, I underwent the procedure at my local hospital.

Recovery was definitely harder than I expected, scar was quite bad, and I believe it was done quite poorly. Decent amount of pain the first month, loss of good feeling in that area, and residual pain in the scar. The first 3 months I completely ignored it. Thought it would get better, that things would be all good, and there was nothing to worry about. Queue my first sexual encounter after the surgery. I realized I couldn’t “get it up”, even though the girl was definitely attractive, and it was a bad experience. This is where the panic started to set in. Unfortunately, it was RIGHT at the time I started college, so I tried not to think about it as much as possible to focus on making friends. 

One month later, the panic really started to set in. It still hurt. The month of October was just absolute hell. I had absolutely zero sex drive, was constantly questioning everything, and spent huge amounts of time analyzing sex drive before and after the surgery, how erection function differed, how arousal differed, and so on. Basically all the sexual shit no one my age even thinks about at all. I was constantly thinking how I’d ever be able to have a relationship, who would love me, how I’d made the greatest mistake of my life, how all hopes of a family were gone, and how I was just going to live a life in solitude. Mental state absolutely plummeted to levels I didn’t even know possible, I lost sense of who I was, and every waking moment was filled with mental anguish. I spent hundreds of hours researching my problem, finding no one who had experienced the same thing. This went on for 2 months where I spiraled into suicidal thoughts and came close to doing it, so I checked myself into the hospital. Spent the weekend psych ward, all the doctors said it isn’t possible, and I was just further confused. 

This is where my parents got involved, I leveraged my support system hard, got connected with therapists and such. Put my head down and just tried to ignore the way I was feeling, but I was still constantly suicidal. The past 6 months has just been a constant cycle of feeling a little better, and then getting dragged down by my thoughts. I’ve been “getting help”, but I still feel like shit. Nothing makes sense. It’s mostly healed now and the scar doesn’t hurt at all, in fact it feels decent to touch and stuff, when aroused, but still sex drive is at 0. Spontaneous arousal is near impossible to achieve. I have zero sexual thoughts, and in fact I’m starting to forget what they even feel like. However that stuff is supposed to be controlled all in the brain, not the penis? I’ve gained 30 pounds, spend all my time arguing with people on twitter and Reddit for some reason about politics and other bs, go to bed at 7am and wake up at 4pm (it’s 5:45am rn), gotten involved in some very toxic Reddit communities, and spend a lot of time wondering why I’m still here. It’s like all the substance from my life has been removed, like the stuff you never even think about that you probably don’t even know is there unless it’s gone. It’s like I’m just an empty being complying to the rules of modern society. 

Here’s where things get even weirder. No one other than my family knows any of this. I look like the ideal person from the outside. In college I got a 3.8 GPA as a STEM major, joined a frat, made a ton of friends, while partying a lot. I’m still well connected with all my other high school friends as well. Like it doesn’t make any sense, I spent 95% of my time spiraled in terrible thoughts but somehow I pulled it together when I absolutely needed to. But I don’t know who I am anymore. Me a year ago is like a whole different person. I’m a scrap of who I once was. Now I’m extremely cynical, angry, frustrated, and sad 24/7. I’ve probably spent upwards of 2000 hours just researching my problems and come to the conclusion there’s literally no one else that has experienced this. I’ve spent so much time spent crying, so many nightmares experienced about the surgery, and just a beyond cynical outlook on life. I don’t know if it triggered some kind of mental illness, if my brain is just fucked beyond repair, or if I even have a personality anymore. I’m so lost in just my life, but no one knows it. 1 year ago feels like an eternity ago, everything in my life has changed. 

Like I just don’t get any of this, hell, half of the US gets that part of their dick removed at birth, and they don’t seem to have any problems. I don’t even know why I’m posting this, but I’ll probably just cross post it to a bunch of communities because I’m sick of not being able to share any of this with anyone.

TLDR: Life great. Surgery on dick. Life bad. Nothing makes sense and I don’t even know who I am anymore.",22May2020,1

115,"Hey guys. I’ve noticed that I don’t think I ever fully recovered from my year long daily use of sativas. I used to love getting high until I had a really bad trip. Scared the living shit out of me. I never want to go back on but spraying water sounds like whispering or screaming sometimes. I still see things moving fast in the corner of my eye, bugs or something alive. I get pretty extreme paradoilia/apophenia where weird delusions start coming into my head from seeing these things around me. I have been fighting off a lot of delusions and they just seem to keep coming. Some of them are very difficult to reject and others, easily.

116,"Hearing my boyfriend and his best friend reminisce about all the good ol times they had in their teen and uni days just made me feel so sorry for myself.

About how my mum left at 16, how I got into hard drugs with bad company and dropped out of school at 17, how my relationship with dad got so bad I had to move out at 19 and suffer a horribly abusive relationship just for a roof over my head. No chance for further education, just working menial jobs with barely any friends and zero life because of said abusive ex’s controlling.

I eventually picked myself up at 22 (am 28 now), living a good life now, good relationship with parents, a future with my bf I’m absolutely looking forward to. I understand that whatever happened has shaped me into what I am today, I’m still young with better things to look forward to and etc. But just listening to and looking at pictures of countless good normal fun times my bf had with all his friends just made all the resentment towards my parents resurface and made me feel so fucking sorry for myself over those years I can never get back. I have nothing of my youth except dark and depressing memories. I’m so jealous.

117,"I was just wondering if anyone could give me advice? My brother is 25 years old, extremely intelligent and gifted at languages. On paper, he is the ideal employee, but in reality he really struggles. I adore him and I just want to help him. He has a fascination with Eastern Europe, and languages, and knows more about them than anyone I know. He has serious issues with time-keeping, to the extent where Im convinced his brain isn't wired the same way 'normal' people are. Another reason I think this is because he spends an awful lots of time thinking about humanity, goodwill, life and the meaning of life, and can't understand how everyone else can get on with their day without thinking about these things. He has rock-bottom self-worth, and is cripplingly insecure. He gets tied up in his head thinking about himself and his past, and his future, and small things like how people 5/6 years ago treated him, almost like he can't get over it. As a result of all this he suffers with depression &amp; bad anxiety. Its hard to tell what stems from what. The main problem this is causing him is his career. He currently works in finance at a fairy relaxed company with a good work environment. To anyone else, this job would not be considered strenuous. But for him, its tortute. He hates the idea of office jobs where people are competing against each other and seeking out promotions and managerial positions. He just wants a relaxed job, with no pressure, and to help people. There is no problem with that, apart from he has a degree in Russian &amp; German, and is extremely gifted at these, so I think he should use them. He says he wants to become a physio, and I support him, Im just worried because he's 25, and training to be a physio will take him to 28, and thats just the start of his career.

118,"So about a year ago I saw an episode of a TV show where an actress I liked was killed in a really brutal, sad way. 

I haven't been able to go a single day without it in my head, and last night I dreamed about it, which undid a lot of the work I've tried to do over the past ten months.

This isn't the first time this has happened. In 2009 when I saw the movie Defendor, I had a huge crush on Kat Dennings and a scene where she got slapped had the exact same effect as this. The rape scene from Masters of Horror, s1e1 also had this effect.

Has anyone else out there experienced anything like this? I take it day by day but I'm really scared right now.

119,"I need to start this off by saying I have not been professionally diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, but I'm pretty sure I have one. It's not been easy to get help because the NHS mental health service is honestly so difficult to navigate and my referral was denied just before Covid so nothing can be done for the next few months.

To continue with the title narrative, I have a badly damaged voice. My throat hurts all the time, it feels tight and clogged and it has been like this for approximately two years, so around about the time my anxiety began to completely ruin my life. 

My voice is very high pitched when I go to speak, it always surprises me because it used to be a lot lower. Additionally I can no longer sing at all in my normal voice(not even happy birthday) because it's too painful. 

It bothers me a lot. I'm closeted trans, and it makes my dysphoria so much worse. I also like doing voices, accents etc. and it's harder to maintain and practice them although, for some reason, it is easier to sing whilst using one.

I doubt the issue would go away simply from my anxiety being treated/controlled because the issue persists even when I'm not worried.

I'm not sure what to do about it. I'm certain healthcare won't be of much use, I'll likely be put on a 6 month waiting list. Moreover, going private is not in the table for financial and other reasons.

Anyways, I'm so confused about myself and my ""condition"" that I'm not even able to explain it with words. I don't even know if I have something. I'm in high school, I'm not a loner sitting in the back of the class and I usually roam in the corridor with the only friend I have. Point is, when school is over, I suddenly feel the need to shut myself. I rarely hang out, I'm always insecure of my acne to the point I can't even look at a mirror without breaking up. I hate my body. I  guess I'm good looking but I can't bring myself to accept it. I'm always tired, my body aches because I'm on acne medication, I don't ever feel like doing anything besides stay on my phone. I don't even enjoy it, but I don't have anything else to do. I do well in school, but I'm slowly losing concentration, I don't study constantly anymore, especially during this awful lockdown. I'm starting to give up on piano, I don't even wanna leave the house anymore because I feel so uncomfortable.

Now that the flow of thought is over, the thing that stresses me out the most is the fact that my mom disregards my feelings, telling me that it's just a phase and I shouldn't care about my looks or what other people think. It makes me wonder whether I really feel like this or I'm seriously depressed.
I just don't feel like living. What's the point of living? To feed a capitalistic society? Making rich people even richer? Struggling to get to the end of the month? I often think about suicide (not suicidal tendecies tho, I would never take my life) and it makes me feel like I'd relieve everyone of a burden.

125,"I've been working on myself for close to four years. Realizing who I am and what problems i have and where i got them. And I feel fucking shitty that they all seem to come from my family. For everyone else family is a good word. And I'm genuinely happy for other people when they have a good family. But mine was just emotionally and verbally abusive to me. I can't trust people easily because of them because for my entire life the people I loved would just make me cry everyday or just be absent emotionally. I only ever felt like a dog to them. Even today when people are nice to me I think ""what do they really want"". 

And its fucking shitty. My parents would tell me ""they loved me"" and never showed it. I need to vent, they criticize me and tell me to fix it. I'm not doing well in school and tried to have a social life. I'm told I'm a failure who will never graduate high school. I study and work hard, I'm told why don't i have friends. Fuck, even when I was a kid apparently doctors said i might be on the autistic spectrum (asperger's maybe? Still don't know) my mom ignored them and refused to believe them because ""I was perfect"" Ive never been diagnosed for what's probably ADHD and they refused to accept I have mental health issues. Because then I ""won't be perfect"". Even when my cibling had to go to a mental health hospital twice for attempted suicide. They refused to accept what mental health is. They think it's something you can cure.

Now I'm in my 20's. I remember when I confided in them I was suicidal. My mom said ""stop thinking about it"" my dad pushed me harder thinking it would help. That was 3 years ago. I still live with them because I can't afford an apartment and pay for school at the same time. (I'm from the U.S. in California. Rent is impossibly expensive)

Hell, sometimes I think I've been through just about everything. Was sexually molested in middle school, saw a bunch of friends get dragged down because of hard drugs In high school. There was a five year period where I lived in the middle of nowhere with no neighbors. My only interaction with people was at school. After that, nothing and nobody. Had some friends steal from me or just abandon me. I basically taught myself everything.

Despite that, despite growing up basically socially isolated for a few years (this quarantine is starting to feel like when I was 13-17 again) I've been working on myself. I don't have a family that supports me. My friends when I confided in them about how I'm depressed basically just left me. I truly am alone. And I continue walking because I want to have be free. But its fucking hard. Trying to study when you probably have undiagnosed ADHD and only the memories of my own mother screaming at the top of her lungs at me for asking for help. The apathy and anxiety to trying to read. A dad who only acted or helped if it benefitted him and his ego. 

My only assurance is that if 8 year old me saw me today, he'd be impressed as I grew up into some one fights back now. I just wish that 8 year kid wouldn't suffer. No matter how I see it now, an 8 year old scared of his parents, crying every day in a closet wasn't normal.(i hid in a closet because I felt safe on small corners. And so people won't hear me cry) It was abuse. Probably the worst thing is that people won't understand how much it hurt because there was no physical scars. I've tried to explain. People don't really understand. It feels like all that pain I suffered, was to them some exaggerated memory. 

There's really nothing that can be done or magical solution to my life. Just proper maintenance and the goal of leaving my home to literally anywhere else. I just hope when I leave I don't have to throw away the culture and background I grew up with because being adopted into a culture (really hard to explain so I'll make it brief, the community or people who aren't my immediate family that I grew up with bit wasn't born into by blood) while my native culture dismisses me not being a ""Real Mexican"" because I don't speak Spanish. I don't want to throw away whatever roots I have left just to be free. I love those roots and are my only good memories as a child.

But now I'm losing him.

She is having hallucinations that people are breaking into the house and stealing her paperwork/valuables (nothing missing), thinks that there are people watching thru the windows, that her food/clothes/bedding are poisoned, etc. 


I have no idea what to do about this behavior. We recently had a struggle where she said we need to cut up her clothing to test for poison and refused to take her medicine. When this is happening she is saying nasty things to me and claims that me and the family are holding her hostage and preventing her freedom. I do not know how to handle these moments. I attempt to stay calm, ask her ""why"" types of questions, refocus her on positive things. I eventually got her to take her medicine and she apologized and said ""don't forget I love you."" 


Does anybody have advice on how to handle these types of episodes? I am truly at a loss for what to do in these moments and I'm just guessing. She is seeing a psychiatrist but it's not helping. The COVID situation is making it more difficult and fueling her paranoia too.


Also, are there options for long-term professional help? She was committed once in December and apparently the experience was pretty awful and similar to jail. Are there alternatives where she will get personal, attentive, catered care where I can see her daily?


I apologize for the lack of knowledge but this is new to me as I have just recently moved back home from across the country to help my family handle this and they seem really checked-out with trying and don't have all the answers to these questions. I will ask the doctors when I am able to go, but getting her to show up is a struggle.

142,"Hello, I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to ask this. I'm already diagnosed with depression and OCD, if it helps.  
I've done this all my life, but never really told anyone because it's too embarrassing. For example, when I was little I'd constantly run around imagining I had super powers and all that, and it wasn't just normal playing, it gave me this huge excitement and I could spend hours doing it. It still happens now in my 20s, but with more “realistic” stuff (like I'm president and do all kinds of stuff and make my country greener, or that I work at Apple and I create awesome, impossible technology). Other stuff includes, for example, feeling that excitement when the microwave is cooking (I image all the atoms moving and heating up), when I'm defragmenting my disk (kind of all the data being moved around), updating stuff (apps, software), and more, and I start shaking my arms or jumping. It dosn't happen 24/7; just sometimes. Whatever it is, it's not normal and I don't want to waste my life daydreaming and having these unrealistic thoughts and expectations about life.  
I've thought about ADHD but my psychiatrist ruled it out. However, I only expressed concern over not being able to concentrate when it comes to studying for college (when studying theory, which means reading long texts; I can focus when it comes to practical exercises like math, programming or drawing in CAD). I do well at school, but I started struggling now that I have these subjects. The shrink said I passed all subjets so no way I have ADHD. I never told them about what I just told you.

I've been furloughed for a while now, my husband is still working so I have most of every day just me and my two cats.

I've struggled with depression and anxiety for years, always up and down. At the start of ""all this"" my anxiety spiked like crazy (as you'd expect) but then isolation was an absolute dream for me (I'm THE most introverted person I know) the first couple of weeks being alone really helped me charge my batteries.

Then during week 3 I think it hit me that eventually life would go back to normal and I spiralled into a depression pit, I hated everything and everyone and didn't see the point yada yada all the usual goodies. 

Because I've got the time I'm really big on self-care atm and every day is a mental health day so I found I was able to sort myself out pretty quick, and I've since realised.... I notice immediately now if anything is ""off""... Like usually I'd be spiralling for a couple of weeks before I'd realise what was happening, but now? Within like, an hour, I can pick up ""woah hang on... No... No no we ain't having thoughts like that! Get your butt up! Go exercise! Now face massage! Now eat some fruit! Get that glass of water down your neck!"" And I can ""correct"" my behaviour so much quicker

154,"dream report 5/22/2020
I had a dream it started good me and my boyfriend were hanging out with 2 other girls that I did not know, and I learned that he was cheating on me with the one girl, and she was pregnant. I wanted to take my anger out on her, but since she was pregnant, it was not her to blame, but him. So I ran away and went home to cry. I could literally FEEL the depression in my chest in my dream. I was crying, I heard a knock at the door, I saw a few kids that I did not know, asking ""wheres the weed??"" they wanted to purchase some from me, but I was angry they were even there. I asked where they heard that I sold at, they said ""everyone is talking about it"" so I told them to leave now and stop bothering me, that the rumors were untrue, and I was going through a lot and didn't wanna be bothered. They were kind about it, but then I heard my boyfriend's father yelling out his house (who does not live by me, but was suddenly present on my street) and I saw my boyfriend running down the street. I was so angry and ran towards him ready to pounce and punch him right in the face, but when I got close, he swung at me with open hand, and I recoiled and flinched out of fear, yet he did not touch me. He walked away from me without saying a word. I felt so defeated so weak I let out a war scream towards the full moon shining over my house. The moon caught on fire and I got in my car and drove. For some reason I ended up on top of the Homewood high rise bridge. I was standing by the railing, crying and thinking about life, staring at the moon. A man walked up to me, I could tell he was very wise, all he said was ""You have come to a crossroads, and you must decide your own destiny"". At that moment I got on top of the railing and stood on the railing and screamed once again. I jumped and was falling until I hit the concrete below me. But I did not die. The next thing I know, I'm in a martial arts-type facility, fighting and learning combat forms. I'm happy and with people that are similar to me. However I'm looking at myself in 3rd person. The real me is a spirit, watching my physical self progress in ways if I had not jumped the bridge. The man from the bridge is also a spirit sitting next to me, but I was unaware until he said ""Look what the fork in the road could have brought you: peace, prosperity, and self-protection"". I looked over at him and he was a faint blue color, see-through. He smiled at me. Then I woke up.

My questions are, is this man a spirit guide? I've read about spirit guides coming to your dreams in time of great sorrow and stress, to guide you in the right direction. I have a feeling this has to do with my previous suicidal thoughts and attempts on my life. I've never even been to that bridge before but saw it so vividly and clearly. Can anyone give me any insight? And what should I do tonight if I see the man again?",22May2020,2

156,"Yesterday, I (22F) was reading through some of my journal entries from the previous weeks. I had just taken an edible (this may be important info later) and had finished my entry for the day. I’m not sure what compelled me to do this, but I flipped to my very first entry (written about a month ago) and read from there. 

As I continued to read on, I felt a sick feeling growing in my stomach, and I began to hyperventilate. The entries I was reading were VASTLY different from page to page.

For example, on one page, I discuss my rage with my family and how I get so angry I could hurt someone. On the very next page, my attitude is completely different. I discuss how I feel like I’m really evolving and how I’m the happiest I’ve been in awhile. 

At this point I felt as if I was floating away from my body. The journal entries started to feel very far away, and I felt as though I was reading the journal of a stranger. Some of the entries I don’t even remember writing. I continued to feel like I was outside of my body for a good ten minutes after, until I stood up and did something else to take my mind off it.

I told her that anxiety ins't stress and it wouldn't do nothing. She told me that in her opinion, it's exactly the same stuff. I tried to make her understand that it was not the same and she said something that really hurt me. 
""I will lock you up in a cage. No food. No money. Nothing. After a while you'll beg to come back at your old live saying it was better.""
I don't know why but the fact she could say something so horrible with such a calm tone destroyed me. I wantes to tell her that It was not like this. It was more than this. It makes me feel guilty.

She thinks about that more than about her daughter's well being.

* Social situations
* Small Talk
* Maintaining family relationships and friendships
* Chewing my hair (I can't seem to stop!)

The things that soothe me are:

* Being alone
* Animals
* Jigsaws
* Studying (mainly because it feels familiar!)

My grand mother having a stroke and nearly died, abuse and slander toward my family from my aunt , Me having diabetes and the coronavirus make 2020 a absolute shitshow. I'm araid to talk about this with anyone.

My mother, sisters, grandmother and step-father are supportive of me but when I try to talk to them about my problem I panicked about how they gonna react and play it down so they think its not that bad.

Sometime my anxiety transform into anger and I'm so afraid at what i can do when i am like this.

I did see a psychologist whan i was young. I thoguht she was nice at frist but then she told my mother that i was just weak minded and jsut making this up for attention. I was Fucking 8 or 9 at th time. I never felt more betrayed in my life and since then I developped a fear of psychologist and never speak to one after that.

180,"Over the past three weeks we’ve covered:

* [Emotional Debt](https://heem.substack.com/p/introducing-heem-publication-and).
* [How to Identify Emotion.](https://heem.substack.com/p/how-to-identify-your-emotions)
* [How to Explore the Emotion Iceberg.](https://heem.substack.com/p/how-to-explore-the-emotion-iceberg)

This week, we’ll dive into how to pay down Emotional Debt.

## Measuring the Debt

The first key to paying down the debt is to measure it. 

Remember, Emotional Debt is unresolved emotion. The more it builds up, the harder it becomes to address. Measuring it will help you know what kind of help you need.

There are three ways you can measure where your Emotional Debt lies.

First is to figure out how much the debt is impacting your life:

* Not bothered at all = low debt.
* Harder to do something you normally do = medium debt.
* Unable to function = high debt.

Second is to measure how difficult it would be to pay it down:

* Fairly easy = low debt.
* Decent amount of effort = medium debt.
* Really hard = high debt.

Third is to go through the exercises of identifying and exploring the emotions that I introduced in the past couple of weeks. This will give you a good idea of just how much debt needs to be addressed, especially after you explore the Emotion Iceberg. It will also help focus your plan when creating a strategy using PAALP.

## Paying Down the Debt with PAALP

PAALP is an iterative approach to paying down Emotional Debt. It stands for:

* Plan - Plan a strategy by making an informed decision on how to address the underlying factors that are fueling the Emotion Iceberg.
* Act - Act on the plan.
* Assess - Assess how successful the plan was.
* Learn - Learn from your assessment and iterate. Incorporate it into the next cycle to improve your next approach. If it’s working, keep doing it. If it’s not, go back to the drawing board.
* Prevent - Once you identify what caused the debt, take proactive measures to prevent it from building up again.

## What Does “Iterative” Mean?

The iterative approach is a way to reach a desired result by repeating and improving the same process. It’s when you experiment with a strategy to see if it will solve a problem. If it doesn’t work, you learn from it and try again. The goal is to keep doing this and learning from it until you reach your goal.

There are three advantages to taking this kind of approach to your mental health.

First: Paying down emotional debt can be complex. For example, I would not pay down Fear in the same way I would Shame. Those are two very different emotions that require different strategies. Also, there can be multiple factors fueling each of these emotions and parsing through them can be tricky.

Second: It teaches us that failure is a part of the process. When you first explore paying down Emotional Debt, your strategies may not work the first time and that’s okay. Learn from it, get better, and try again.

Third: We learn about ourselves. We learn what works and doesn’t work. We start to understand what makes us tick. This helps us pay down Emotional Debt faster.

This last point is important because everyone is different.. We all have different families, cultures, relationships, personalities, and bodies. It’s impossible to recommend a cure-all technique because **context matters**. That’s why in the very first newsletter, I made sure to mention that what worked for me may not work for you. As human beings, we are all unique and come from different backgrounds.

That’s why I recommend you work with a therapist, especially if you have high Emotional Debt. These wonderful individuals train for several years, dedicate their lives to helping people, and are well equipped to guide you through this (or an even better) process. You deserve to be heard and understood in your own way.

Here are some basic strategies that you can try plugging into PAALP.

## Basic Strategies to Pay Down Debt

* See a therapist - I know. I’m beating a dead horse. But I highly recommend it if you can afford it. I saw a therapist for a year and he helped me grow significantly over that period of time. But the trick is, you have to find the right one for you. If you don’t know how to seek out a therapist, don’t worry. I’ll send you a guide on how to do that later.
* Journaling - Journaling does a lot of things. It makes our emotions concrete because we write them down. It’s also a cool way to track our progress and see how much has changed over the years. This strategy is perfect for exploring the Emotion Iceberg and going through PAALP.
* Self care - Self care is any intentional action we take to care for ourselves. This can be physically, mentally, spiritually, and emotionally. Examples of self care are exercising, taking a break, meditation, prayer, reading a good book, dancing, talking to a friend, playing a game, or eating a pizookie (my personal favorite).
* “Life be like that sometimes” - Accepting the fact that there are somethings that happen to us that are simply out of our control can be a powerful step of freedom.
* Focus on what we *can* control - Just because there are things we can’t control doesn’t mean we’re powerless. Focusing on things we can control empowers us to take ownership, responsibility, and builds our self-esteem.
* Reframe - Reframing is looking at a person, event, or relationship in a different way to change its meaning. We may not realize it, but we can cause ourselves a lot of pain and stress because of the way we choose to view things. For example, last week I talked about how I had unrealistic expectations of myself. By reframing and changing the way I look at basketball, I am able to break the cycle of self-criticism.
* Challenge false narratives - Sometimes we grow up believing certain lies about ourselves. For example, I was a pretty terrible driver in High School. I got a lot of tickets. My dad, out of frustration, would say that I’m **always** a bad driver and that I’ll **never** learn from my mistakes. I learned to challenge this narrative everytime that thought entered my head. Yes I was a bad driver, but only **sometimes**. Not always. Today I’m proud to say I haven’t gotten a ticket in several years. Haha. Go me!

181,"I hate being on bad terms with my co workers and everything's been fine until last night. My manager asked me to go do register, which when I was hired I was told that not doing it at all was perfectly fine because it's a trigger for panic attacks for me. Since then that manager has left and the two new ones don't seem to believe me. It's making me fe extremely bad and have thoughts like, ""well maybe I am just faking it all for attention"" and the suicidal thoughts come back because if no one believes me then I just can't deal with it. Has anyone else had this happen? Any kind words or ideas would be appreciated.",22May2020,1
182,"For starters, I am 14 years old and I am a identical twin. 

But I have no empathy, I felt it once for a bird I think, but other then that none. I just cannot feel another's pain no matter how hard I try. My brother, I think lacks this empathy too.

I did feel an emotional connection and loved my family when I was younger. And I am pretty sure I felt grief when my great-grandmother and one of my dogs died. I don't fit any of the dark triad. I am not violent. I do show affection towards my pets. I did feel miserable when I was bullied. I do show worry over my brother and I did worry about my mom recently despite me not liking her that much. I do volunteer and enjoy walking the dogs at my grandparents house. I am a pescetarian. I think I might have compassion. I did regret some of the choices in my life and I think I felt guilt. I am pretty sure I felt remorse when I yelled at my bird for biting me once, though I'm not sure if that is a false memory or not. I don't hunt for sport and I tried to avoid running over ants on my bike once. I considered suicide and self harm before. I do try to cuddle with my brother at bed. 

I am a pathological liar, but I cut down on my lying. I don't think I am impulsive as now I think about whether to this or that. I was a bully(not physical though) when I was 9 years old but I made up with the kid I bullied out of fear of being caught, but I really don't think I hated him since then and I even considered him as a member of my dream band and until 2019 I talked behind people's backs. I get violent thoughts about becoming a serial killer and animals which I do want gone. I am a lazy person. I did try to get my parents to get me stuff I wanted or to let me do stuff and I made my brother do stuff, but that's the only manipulation I think I ever did. When I was mad I used to punch my brother in the arm, he also did the same to me. I was a member of various darknet forums and downloaded some teen porn. I used to use a shock collar on my dog, but stopped that. I had school shooting fantasies(but they weren't about killing anyone, just bringing a gun to school and shooting in the ceiling), but they were only on bad days. I did threaten to shoot my pap once when I was 6, but that was empty and I just was mad at that time and it never happened again.

My brain tries to make me want to be a psychopath or serial killer, but I want to be normal. I want to feel other's emotions.

Considering i'm 14, is there a way I could get treated and become a normal person? Like can I develop empathy while I still have the time? I don't want to be unempathetic or a murderer. Or is there no hope for me, no cure, and i'm stuck like this forever?",22May2020,1

184,"Posting anon incase anyone irl knows my usual account. 

I 31F seem to be really struggling with what it is that I want in life. I have no sense of direction or any goals, no hobbies, work is a non skilled job even though I have a degree. Due to the current health situation I am furloughed so not even going to work.  

To add to this, I have just entered my second trimester of pregnancy and not even sure I want this baby. Whilst work had to know I havent told anyone else except my midwife to ensure I am getting the correct healthcare. 

I spend most of my days asleep, I am an incredibly active dreamer so I feel like I never actually get any sleep anyway and constantly feel exhusted. When I was at work I could barely go more then a coupke of weeks of being up and functioning like an actual adult and would spend this week in a foggy haze, incredibly sleepy and barely able to do the minimum such as basic housework. Near the end of the week I would improve and could do more until I was able to get up, get ready for work, do housework etc and not have that sleepy haze going on. 

I dont feel very feminine and struggle with how I look on a daily basis. I also dream I am a decade younger then I actually am and envision myself younger, prettier, more energetic etc but I really struggle with the reality of my looks. 

I feel that I should have more in life, a better career, hobbies, a good solid relationship, own my own home etc but I really am paralized with my current situation. Docs have said I have depression and anxiety, and yes I do believe that is part of what is going on with me but I feel that there is more to this. I am on two lots of anti depressants but feel they only really help with the anxiety, not the depression. 

I just wish I could be different, have goals and hobbies and actually appear phyiscally more feminine and just be happy.",22May2020,1
185,"Just a quick and brief introduction to get started. Mental health became something I was aware of in August of last year when I drove across the country to without telling anyone in planning to hang myself. Ended up with me being hospitalized and spending some time in the psych ward. In February I went to jail for my first time on charges of Mischief under $5000 and holding a weapon. Could have been charged with lots more I guess but everyone seemed to be on my side. So since August I’ve been seeing psychiatrist and social workers and doing all that kind of stuff. I’m not the best at being honest with my Social worker and psychiatrist about what is going through my head so that probably doesn’t help a great deal. Most of the time when I decided to open up a bit about something and be more truthful I feel like I’m lying for some reason and usual kind of give up and move on. Now for the title “Intrusive thoughts” I made for this post, For years now I have had pretty extreme and violent intrusive thoughts regularly. To the point where it sometimes can become fantasies I regularly think about. This is something I have always kept to myself and have never planned about telling anyone this. I am convinced that telling my psychiatrist I have these thoughts will bring nothing good to me and there’s nothing that can be done about it and I’m ok with that. Is this something that I should fill my psychiatrist in on?",22May2020,3
186,"Hi ! im pretty new here so im a little nervous posting here. 

Ive long suffered from depression , anxiety and ptsd. As a nice bonus i also am autistic. I have been noticing lately that even tho i dont have much problems with lockdown itself ( i like staying at home) i have become increasingly irritated and aggitated at almost everything. What especially bugs me is people who are planning to go back to normal life after everything is over. I understand that they want that but for me personally i dont know if i can do that. I feel so different now.

So i got an email from my school ( i go to a non profit school for people with special needs like mental health issues or physical disabilities) , saying they want to soon return back to normal. And it just completely rubbed me the wrong way. I dont even know how to go back to before. 

Does anyone else recognize this? and if so, how are you dealing with it? i am feeling quite lost 😭

thank you all in advance.

188,"So with me people either love me or hate me. And alot of the time people will love me until they experience my ticks and the parts of my illnesses shine through even when I don't realize they do. 

One thing is that I'm very lonely so I go on online groups alot but I'm also severely socially anxious so I'm constantly worried that people will get mad at me for stupid stuff. I mean it happens ocassionally where I'll start breaking down and someone will start insulting me cuz they don't realize what I'm doing is part of my panick attack and yeah...

I have a weird thing where in some cases when I have a panick attack I can start laughing so hard I'm crying which happens most of the time in social settings and I wont be able to stop and I'll keep saying one word or phrase over and over like stop it or I'm sorry and it pisses off some people cuz they don't realize that when I'm on the spot I will say the same thing over and over. 

Ugh
....I also talk in circles alot and don't know how to change that..people legitimately just think I'm stupid and it sucks more cuz I pride myself in knowing different things and being smart (OCD where I literally research everything because I'm obsessed with knowing every little detail and will continue searching for days or months about one particular subject which gets in the way of many things) 

Some days I think I'm managing well...but then I realize that I have such a hard time making friends because people just don't understand my ticks. And it's not that I'm trying to make people conform to how I am or just deal with it cuz I know it's super annoying but...fuck it's hard. I'm 21 and married with two kids that are toddlers and that in itself throws issues on trying to make friends cuz I can't be fun and go out partying and stuff so most of my friends are online.

190,"
Some days I just wanna kill myself. I wake up to dark thoughts. I wake up heartbroken. I wake up feeling lonely. I go through 3 shirts a night I sweat so much. I don’t know what it means, but sometimes I think maybe I’ll be better off getting a terminal disease. I smoke and smoke and smoke. I have to get high to escape my negative thoughts. I wish I had someone to call mine. I’ve experienced love. It’s great. They accept you no matter what it’s the best feeling ever. Heartbreak is the negative equivalent of love. I know I shouldn’t be thinking of suicide. I never would do it. But I find myself thinking about it every now and then. I wish I felt loved. I feel as though everything is my fault. I live my life with constant regrets. I’m at my worst when I’m alone though. Waking up is particularly the worst part of my day. That’s when my head is fucked at its best. I have secrets. Deep, dark secrets. Secrets that would warrant death if they somehow came to light. There are times I feel super inspired. I want to go out and take over the world, but that only lasts as long as my high does. I’m addicted to weed. I’m addicted to cigarettes. But I’m also addicted to pain. To loneliness. I’m addicted to depression I think. Idk where it all went wrong. My dad says I’ve changed. Everytime he says that I wanna curl up into a ball and die. I know he’s right, I have changed. I was happy at one point. Yeah I was super happy all throughout high school. I had someone I loved. I was a loner that was no longer alone that’s why I was happy. And then I went and ruined it all by my own accord. I deserve all this that’s what really eats away at me. I did all this to myself. Now I have no one. Not even a best friend. There is not one person that would truthfully call me their best friend. Idk why I wrote this. I thought it might make me feel better. But nope. I’ll continue today as I do everyday. I’ll finally build the courage to leave my bed, at 1:34 pm, even though I woke up at 10. I’ll go smoke by myself later and come back and pass the time high. Then eat and repeat. This ain’t life. Fuck this life.",22May2020,1
191,"It's a scary but refreshing feeling. It's nice to know I'll never amount to nothing because that's all I was ever intended to be. A bastard child who came from two mentally ill, incompetent parents, filled with lies at birth about how he could be anything. It's a shame how if I find anything I enjoy that I'll never get to experience it in full because I'm just going to kill myself, but it is what it is. I'm really close to ending it at this point. I've been blowing off responsibility one after another hoping that one day I'll fuck my life up so bad I'll just kill myself out of a panic response. There's no one in my life who I've felt truly gets me. There isn't anyone who understands. My screams against the injustices of the world come out as whimpers, and the insignificance takes its toll. I've prayed that life will change, but it never will. It's simply not worth living this cycle to me anymore. To those I love, thanks for sticking around but I can't take it anymore.",22May2020,2
192,"Throughout my life, the number of things that have turned into emotional triggers have magnified more and more each year. Everything from sounds to smells to food to people. Anything that reminds me of the past makes me cringe and anxious. It’s not even just about traumatic memories. It’s every day mundane stuff like embarrassing moments or little mistakes that I get triggered about. There are too many things in every day life that trigger a bad memory for me. It’s just getting too much and brings me so much anxiety throughout the day. How do you reclaim these triggers so that they don’t bring you back to a bad memory?",22May2020,1
193,"I suffer from depression, I'm mostly functional enough to maintain a job and relationships. My relationships with friends and family are going better, especially with friends. I'm more emotionally open than ever before and I've been seeing a therapist for 5 months who's helped me spot my negative patterns and issues that fuel my depression.

But there's one thing that therapy is not helping with, and that's my general feelings towards life and existence. I feel like I can rationalanize a ""meaning of life"" in the sense that I think we make our meaning by doing what makes us happy. But I don't feel that way, I feel an emptiness and hopelessness towards my future and existence. It's a void that feels unfillable, there's nothing I can imagine that would make me feel comfortable with living which in turn makes me sad and dreary all the time. 

Its like I'm looking for something that will fulfill me and make me happy but there is nothing. I used to imagine that making music could fulfill that, but I don't feel that way anymore. I still want and like to do it, but the hopeless void makes any goal I can imagine achieving pointless. Why have a grander goal when it won't fill the void? And I truly believe it won't fill the void. I have a job, I own an apartment, I have great friends but nothing does it. I can be happier because of these things, the void is always there. Sounds silly but that's how it feels. 

Having kids is the most ""natural"" goal a human could have, at least the one that makes most sense evolutionarily, but I'm beginning to believe it's wrong for someone to have the power to decide for someone else to exist. I have a sex drive, but I don't want children at the moment and my thoughts around the subject make me think I won't want kids in the future. I can imagine having a kid would awaken some sense of purpose in me but I would feel its wrong to have a kid just to give myself meaning. Seems insane to me.

So I feel like an outsider to the world. I don't understand how the average person is content with living. I feel existential dread literally all the time. I relate to very few people in my everyday life, with the exception of my friends. The difference between them and me is that they can be comfortable with leading a normal life while pondering the same things I do. I'm affected by it every day. I feel disconnected from the world. I'm weirded out by the fact that every person I interact with doesn't know why they exist and most of them manage to act ""normal"" in despite or that. I find it bizarre that it's expected of me to care about everyday things when I literally don't what I am on an existential level. Our world crazy and I just can't be comfortable with existing. These thoughts are intrusive and it's just a part of who I am.

I have no idea what I can do to make myself self feel better. Nothing helps at the moment.",22May2020,1
194,"So I was admitted into the hospital a few weeks ago, just got discharged, and while in here, one of the patients, gave me some advice that really stuck out to me and I'd like to share. This guy was schizophrenic and had lots of hallucinations, but what he said really made sense and it's helped me give a better outlook on life. Basically what he said, was to take everything with half of expectations. Ex. ""hey I'll be there at 6"". Half expect then not to be there at that time. Obviously that's not an extreme example so I'll give a better. I have a best friend, and we always call now, all day, because she's no longer in work for now. But now, she's starting to work. I always ask to call, and she will say yes, but then suddenly she gets called in. Now this would really upset me because I was really hoping to call, I love to call her, it's always the best part of my day. So when we suddenly can't, it's upsetting. It's not her fault, and I know that, but it's still dissapointing. But now, after I've gotten the advice, I've really been trying to use it. So when I do ask her, and she says yes, I always think to myself that it might not happen, and honestly it really helps. When she can't call, I'm not as upset, because I half expected her to not be able to call. So please, try to take this advice, it all really help you. :)",22May2020,1

I'm only doing positive stuff lately and I'm following my passion and putting my work for it. But whenever I see a celebrity picture in the social media my mind automatically brings up the names of those people who I met in the past. 

I didn't care much but as the days passed those names started to show up in my mind frequently. Whenever I think about something that makes me happy my mind brings up the name. I thought to myself that these thoughts are stupid and I decided not to pay much attention to it.

But now the thoughts grew up to the objects around me. Whenever I see or touch the objects around me the names show up. I thought I could recover from these thoughts by myself but I was wrong. I'm losing focus and I'm getting tired.

202,"I have been in in quarantine since March 23rd. I am immuno-compromised and can not leave the house. I have been very occupied with my last semester of college classes and they have been extremely demanding and my daily life has been eat/barely sleep/get work done for about 3 months now. Before all of this happened, I was at school and had access to my friends and had a daily routine. But even with this best case scenario I was struggling. Now everything feels amplified to 100. I feel like everyday is an unpredictable rollercoaster of emotions. Stress is for sure a trigger, and I've had some stressful things happen in my life this week (grandfather was in hospital, was not sure if he was going to make it home, cat needs to go to the vet, etc.). Even with a daily routine I am struggling. I get up at 8:30 every morning and try to get to sleep by 11pm. I had a sleep study done last year and they found nothing wrong with me, but honestly I probably only get 4 hours of actual sleep a night because of my chronic pain and my mind is just racing all the time I can not turn off my brain. 

Last night was a low point for me. I was really frustrated with how my stressful day went with school and just went of the rails. I threw my glass of water on the ground, not really processing what was going to happen next. I then had to clean up the glass and water next to some wires which was pretty risky but nothing happened. I went up to my room and turned off the lights because I just needed to be alone, and then my cat started throwing up all over the floor. I was already in an aggressive/irritable mood and felt like I wasn't able to control my emotions. I cleaned up the cat throwup and gave my cat some pets and told him that everything is okay, but then my sister came in the room and I LOST it. I had a spray bottle that was in my hand and I just kind of weirdly aggresively gestured towards her and said something hurtful like ""get the fuck out of my room I don't need your help"" I don't really remember. I then went downstairs to follow my cat because I wanted to see how he was feeling, sure enough he was not feeling well and I told my mom we should take him to the vet because he has been having so many issues in the last week. Once we started talking about the vet I went from aggresive/shut down I don't want to talk to anyone mode to intense crying, like sobbing. And I couldn't stop sobbing I just went to my room and basically cried myself to sleep. This morning I mentioned taking the cat to the vet to my dad and he basically said it's not worth taking the cat to the vet because it is so expensive. I just went to the bathroom and cried for an hour this morning on the toilet. I just shut down. I then took a shower and pretended like nothing happened. Now I'm back on the school work grind but I just can't focus. I'm just in a constant crying fit or super shut down/blunt with people around me or super irritable/aggressive there is no neutral middle ground here. I don't know if it is the quarantine that is aggravating all of this but these are all feelings I've had pre-quarantine just not to this elevated level before. I am just in a constant state of stress/anxiety, chronic pain and no predictable mood. I've texted the suicide hotline many times this year, not with a plan but just because I needed someone to talk to. No one in my family really knows the extent of what is going on with me and to be honest I don't really trust them anymore. I just need to get out of here but I have no where to go.",22May2020,2

Sometimes it works ok and other times there is not anything in the world to help him in that moment. He has also expressed that he wants to kill himself (a plan is not in place). When we get into arguments, he says very shocking things that trigger my own depression. I don’t know how to help anymore. I’m not trying to “fix” him or change who he is, I just want to make this more manageable for him. 

Does anyone have any advice specific to men? What helped you or your loved one? Any small tips are appreciated!",22May2020,2

She stays up all night and just records things she sees with her iPhone and then tries to show everyone what she sees.

207,"My mom seemed really upset yesterday when I got home from work. I laid in bed with her and talked to her for what felt like the first real conversation we’ve had in a while. We talked about why she got upset, and she said she had a disagreement with a coworker/close friend over how to handle the fifth grade moving up ceremony. Schools are closed until the end of the year in the state I live in due to the pandemic, so the fifth grade moving up ceremony has to be virtual. I guess her coworker, who also happens to be a close friend of hers, said some really nasty things that hurt my mom’s feelings. My mom has already been struggling with depression/anxiety for years, and this must have pushed her over the edge. I talked with her for a while, and she told me that she went on a walk with the dog that day, and tried to hang herself in the woods. And I can’t stop replaying that image in my head and it makes me sick to think that she even wanted to try to kill herself. I cant believe that she was that close to committing suicide, and I didn’t even know. I know that she hasn’t been in a good place mentally because she has been stuck at home while my dad and I are at work all day. I’ve been preoccupied with my own life, working full time, taking online classes, and applying to PA school, so I feel like I haven’t been there for her like I should have been. I feel like I’ve distanced myself so much from my mother because she has a drinking problem, and I see so much of her anxiety and depression in myself that being around her too much brings me down. I feel like I’ve been selfish and avoided being home when I’m not working because being around my mother affects my mood. And I haven’t talked to her enough in the past couple of months to really know where she is mentally. I feel like such a shitty daughter right now, and I’m scared to leave her on her own because clearly she is not safe. I want to help her but ive tried to help her with her addiction for years, and dealing with the lying and manipulation got the best of me, and since then, I’ve sort of distanced myself to protect my own mental health. I dont even know where I’m going with this post-I just feel so guilty for being emotionally unavailable, and I’m scared what she’ll do if she’s alone. I guess I just needed someone to vent to, and I dont really feel comfortable telling this to anyone else right now besides my dad. I don’t know what to do",22May2020,3

210,"I’m pretty sure I’ve struggled with depression for a while now. For the past 2 1/2 years, not a single day has gone by that I haven’t considered suicide. Ultimately, what’s kept me going I a fear of the pain and unknown. What if I shot myself and I didn’t die? Drinking bleach is incredible you painful! Slitting my wrists would take forever, and might not even work.

The problem stems from bullying and a strained relationship with both of my parents (mostly the latter). It’s gotten to the point that it’s easier to be emotionally detached than to feel pain. I’m pretty sure this has also lead to moderate sociopathic tendencies. Things have gotten so bad that a friend has noticed I have problems. He has noticed things that I didn’t even notice that are signs of depression. I want help and I know I probably need it, but I just don’t know how to address the problem. 

My problem is I don’t feel comfortable talking to either of my parent about this. The last time we talked about our very strained relationship it resulted in my dad blaming me for being a rebellious teen, like nothing he did to make me feel the way I did was his fault and my feelings didn’t matter. My mom probably suffers from anxiety problems, and I’m often on the receiving end of her frustration. As the only parent I felt I could got to, this has had a huge emotional toll on me. Everything I read said to talk to a friend. I did, and immediately regretted letting someone in. What if they told my parents and my parents were angry for me having these thoughts, not telling them, and feeling like it was their fault that their isn’t an escape for me? If I talk to a teacher or school counselor my parents will still find out. What do I do? Do I wait for 2 years until I’m old enough to seek help on my own as an adult? Do I try to talk to my parents, even though I know they won’t understand? Do I talk to a trusted adult?",22May2020,1

I'm only doing positive stuff lately and I'm following my passion and putting my work for it. But whenever I see a celebrity picture in the social media my mind automatically brings up the names of those people who I met in the past. 

I didn't care much but as the days passed those names started to show up in my mind frequently. Whenever I think about something that makes me happy my mind brings up the name. I thought to myself that these thoughts are stupid and I decided not to pay much attention to it.

But now the thoughts grew up to the objects around me. Whenever I see or touch the objects around me the names show up. I thought I could recover from these thoughts by myself but I was wrong. I'm losing focus and I'm getting tired. 

I never thought about harming myself. I carry on doing my day to day work but these thoughts won't stop. I know I can't forget something permanently and but I'm struggling to slow them down.

214,"I have a small handful of things I’ve been dealing with since the loss of my home, friends, my accustomed way of life and my Dad just a decade ago.

Now I know I have a lot of things that many people are less fortunate and I count my blessing daily, but I am without a viable outlet to vent.

I am dealing with a mild case of PTSD which was worsened further from other emotional abuse/emotional difficulties. “Severe” Anxiety which I was diagnosed with under Generalized Anxiety disorder which is accompanied with Manic Depression which has been worsening over the past decade, each high being more extreme and short lived, whole the lows being as low as we can get. 

I’ve developed a Dissociative, Depersonalization Disorder which only numbs me out when my anxiety gets to the point where I am crippled, unable to focus on what’s present and unable to reconnect for a while after it begins. It is something that is always present at this point, the only times I am not in that state are very limited.

I am on two medications, Mirtazapine help with my mood, and Methylphenid to help with my focus and attentiveness throughout the day (to actually be able to function) These medications helped me at first, around 8 months ago when I started but they seem to be losing their effectiveness, I am still easily distracted, not by external factors but by what’s going on in my head. Constantly. 

I struggle with my perception of reality to the point where I am always disconnected from what’s around me nearly entirely, I am able to complete basic tasks but most times when there’s problem solving involved I take the backseat until I am left by myself.

I am able to override most situations like the one above, but I am still 95% not with it.

I have never abused any type of drug, or struggled with alcoholism because I consider myself strong willed. I am fighting myself today though. I want to buy cigarettes and whisky, I want to find some type of drug that can help me with my anxiety but I know I won’t, I can’t bring myself to sabotage myself like that. 

I was prescribed an anti-anxiety two months ago which was only meant to help me throughout the day for one month. After taking half of them in the first three days I had to flush the rest, you have no idea how badly I wanted to abuse them, I had to let them go because they were too good.

The best part about depersonalization/derealization/dissociate disorders is that it takes you aside from yourself for the time being until those feelings go away. The issue is that these feelings come back nearly instantaneously due to overthinking and anxiety where it becomes an endless cycle until I finally get to lay back in my bed  and distract myself on my phone until I am exhausted enough to fall asleep, avoiding as much thinking as possible.

I am working out of my home province, for the floods that struck Alberta, Canada and I was distracted enough for the first week, but now it’s beginning to consume me again. 

It doesn’t matter where I am, or what I’m doing, I never feel alive, I never feel like a real being in this universe. I’m simply watching “myself” complete tasks monotonously day in and day out. 

Physical forms are changing around me constantly, but I am merely spectating from another world.

I’m in a small room with nothing but a TV, The only channel is what troubles me mentally, while my real life is simply the commercials in between.

216,"Backstory

-Almost two years ago my partner walked out on me. We’d lived together for three years and had been planning to get engaged so hen he left it broke me in a way I didn’t think anything could. I was a mess, I didn’t eat for weeks, became really weak and had to go on short-term leave to deal with my mental health, and my work terminated me shortly after I returned because having to take time to deal with mental health issues after working for a company for 8 years is apparently a no-go? I could no longer afford my apartment and had to move back in with my parents. And, because that’s the trajectory my life was on, a few months after that my family dog had to put down because of health issues. -



It took me the bulk of the last year and a ton of therapy to finally get to a place where I have some feeling of normalcy again. Now, thanks to covid and the possibility of not having a job to go back to (I work in travel) I’m spiraling. My parents’ home is extremely chaotic, very messy and over-cluttered, and since I am in no position to move out as was my initial plan for the summer, I tried to talk to them about how the clutter is affecting my mental health and offered to help them clean it up. My father started screaming at me that it’s not my house and if I want to deciliter I can throw away all my stuff in storage in our basement; That stuff is all I have left of my home and I can’t get rid of it because I need it for when I move again. 

I don’t know what to do, I’m back to hiding in my room because I feel like I have no way out. I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m suffocating and it’s not like I can just go out or something.

Edit: I have OCD and chronic depression, while I usually manage it pretty well, I am struggling very hard to stay above the proverbial waters of my life right now.",22May2020,2
217,"First a little background. I am located in the United States. Most of the people I know qualify as essential workers. I worry about their health on a daily basis. My only comfort was (big emphasis on WAS) that we did our best to protect those people by staying at home. We are supposed to have ""phased"" openings, but I'm seeing a lot of businesses in my state open regardless of the guidelines and laws. 

Looking at the data and news of other states reopening and having increased COVID19 cases, 
is anyone else having extreme anxiety over the reopening of businesses? 

Or anxiety when even just seeing the news of potential reopening? 

How are you coping?",22May2020,3
218,"When listening to certain music you like, you might get chills down your back or goosebumps. The reason this happens is because a compound called dopamine is released into your body. Dopamine makes you feel happy and pleasureful. Some drugs, like cocaine, increase your dopamine levels anywhere from 2–10 times the amount that would occur naturally. So, when a person uses drugs, dopamine is produced much more than normal and gives the user a feeling of euphoria. This is much the reason why drug addicts love the feeling of their drug of choice.Now, obviously, music isn't a substance you are putting into your body, but it still makes your body produce this fun feeling compound. When die hard music listeners can't listen to music, they might be a bit irritable until they can hear their favorite beats again. I would say that the brain starts to expect the release of dopamine and becomes slightly addicted to it. So, people might not literally be addicted to listening to music, but the dopamine release they get from the way it makes them feel.
If you want evidence of how music affects the brain, it makes sense to look at the brains of people who play a lot of music — professional musicians. Brain scans show that their brains are different from the rest of ours.Their brains are noticeably more symmetrical.Areas of the brain responsible for motor control, auditory processing, and spatial coordination are larger.They also have a larger corpus callosum.This is the band of nerve fibers that enables the two hemispheres of the brain to communicate with each other.",22May2020,1
219,"When someone has control issues that get worse as their stress level increases? And instead of focusing on what they can control to mitigate the stress, they choose to fixate on what others are doing around them and try to fix trivial issues that are honestly non-issues. I have someone in my life who has a mile long to do list himself (small business owner affected my COVID19), but wastes time and energy messing with his wife’s iPhone settings (screwed them up so bad the phone had to be restored, nothing was wrong with the phone he just thought all of her settings should be like his, she’s had the phone for a year and never had a problem until he toyed with it). He thinks theres “only one way to do things” and wants everyone to do it his way. When things aren’t stressful, I think he is able to curb a lot of these behaviors (because he has a control problem and the reputation that follows) but this is honestly the worst I’ve ever seen him. He insists that his wife should have a garmin GPS device in her car and charge the phone through a cigarette lighter adapter, instead of directly plugging the phone into the car and using Apple Car Play. When she tried to show him, he said he would order more cigarette lighter adapters because he thought she just lost it. Not that the phone and car have more features her way. He just picks the smallest things to fixate and things that don’t personally affect him. He is more worried about what others do with their time then what he does with his, and it’s causes him a lot of hardship through life. When people who care about him try to talk about it, he says we “degrade him” and everyone picks on him. We’re only trying to help him.

I have nothing to feel guilty about but it just comes over me at any time and lasts for so many hours.

228,"This is a throwaway account 

Context:

My parents got divorced last year during September and I only found out about it a week after my birthday in December. They both still live together though things are vastly different, such as the fridge being split in half and then sleeping in different bedrooms. Since the house is big family from my mothers side are currently residing in the house and with the virus around nobody is going outside. My parents got divorced due to my father paying for nothing but the house utilities even though he gets paid at least 50k+ more. He actually made more money but switched to a different job so he could make more progress in his career. This to contributed to the divorce.

Problems:

-My mom and her family talk horribly about my dad

-My dad talks horribly about my mom and her family 

-My parents always said they would pay for my university, but with paying the lawyers they lost a lot of money and now I have to take a loan (I wouldn’t have minded working a job, but they always reassured me that it was not needed and now I have no money)

-Just before graduating I changed schools from a private school that I was there since primary to a public school. ( I did meet a lot of really nice and cool people at the high school but it was just not the same)

-My parents use me to get back at one another( for example my mom would tell me to ask my dad to my for running shoes that she bought for me, this makes me incredibly uncomfortable and I didn’t even have a choice since my other running shoes were ripped )

- If I spend to much time with my dad, my
Mom get mad and vice versa

- both my mom and dad tell me that the other never loved me

I also never told my friends, even the ones that I knew for over 10 years that my parents are divorced and I don’t know if or how I should.

I deal with anxiety and depression as well as some family issues, but have managed to cope with it fairly well this past year.

Throughout my childhood, my parents and teachers would always comment that one day I’d “come out of my shell” but I’m literally 21 years old and nothing has changed. New environments and new people make me extremely uncomfortable and sometimes send me into a panic. I have friends but no acquaintances because even the idea of introducing myself to someone I don’t know in my classes puts me in a panic. If I know I need to present something to an audience, I panic about it for a ridiculously long time and I usually am able to get through the presentation but its often a horrifying experience. I never participate in class because I’m too scared to ask questions. I’ve always known that this part of me has been holding me back in every single aspect of my life, and because I’m a rising senior in college I seriously need to be considering what career I want to pursue (I’m a bio major). I realize that there are so many careers that just seem off limits to me. I’m interested in genetic counseling because I like genetics and the science behind it but I realize the job entails a lot of difficult conversations with patients. I’m not great at interacting with people and the thought of doing that terrifies me because the last thing I want is to say the wrong thing and make things worse for them. I don’t think I’d know how to act. Especially now that we’re in quarantine, my anxiety has gotten really bad since I don’t need to interact with strangers at all. I feel pathetic and I hate myself for being like this. I wouldn’t wish this on anyone. 

If anyone has any advice on how I can work to get over this or any ways I can make use of my bio degree where I could circumvent large amounts of patient interaction but still have a decent pay, that would be greatly appreciated.

Suicide doesn't feel like an escape from life but the next step to whatever's next and after having these feelings when reality hits me and I realize how crazy this was feeling this way and I'd break down in tears with a black cloud of dark thoughts filling me.

I reach the girls at the front of the bus and I start dancing, and they start looking at me crazy and whispering to each other. That’s when I realize that none of it was real, and that I have been sitting in my seat the entire time doing nothing.

It feels so incredibly real that I have to take a breath and relax afterwards, and repeatedly tell myself that it didn’t really happen.

He has been with me through some of the worst parts of my life, and he without a doubt helped me through them. He is so sweet and cuddly, and he can always tell when I needed some love. Taking care of him and having him there with me has made me a better person, too. He made me want to take care of myself so that I could be there for him, and (weirdly) so that he could be proud of me. He was always with me - he's one of those cats that would run to the door when you got home, and would glomp onto you indefinitely whenever he had the chance - we've even traveled the country together. He is just the best boy and I spoil him endlessly.

I don't even know how he got outside. Neither my mom nor I saw him get out, and I was around all day. He was there in the morning, I know that. During work hours he does his own thing, then at night I call him and we go to bed. But he didn't come when I called. I looked everywhere inside and outside, I woke my mom up, my dad even came over to help us look. He just vanished. I've spent the past two weeks plastering signs everywhere, calling vet offices and shelters, and I even called animal control in case they pick him up as a stray. I paid for local Facebook ads, automated phone alerts to local homes, newspaper ads; I posted to Nextdoor, the neighborhood Facebook page, and Craigslist. Nothing but scams and reports of cats who turn out not to be mine have come from it.

I'm at the point where I want to give up hope. Of all of the things I've experienced, this is honestly the worst. Objectively I know it shouldn't be, but without him here to comfort me I feel so helpless and vulnerable. He made all of those traumas bearable. Of course I knew he wouldn't be around forever, but I didn't think I'd have to worry about that for many more years. And in this case, not knowing if he's alive or not is eating me up. I feel like I failed him, like I'm a terrible owner for not noticing he was gone sooner. I also failed my other cat, who walks around the house every day crying for him, because he doesn't understand that his big brother is gone.

Sorry for the rant. I feel like I'm taking this way harder than I should. I just miss my boy so much. I wish I knew what happened.

Tl;dr: my cat disappeared, I have no clue what happened to him. He means the world to me and has helped me through so much trauma, and I don't know if I can handle this without him. I feel like I failed him.",22May2020,1
236,"I posted a thing on a game called ""Kind Words"" just to vent a little. I avoided reddit because of previous negative reactions digging me deeper into the self-loathing hole. Here's the message I posted, as well as one of the responses I got back.

[https://imgur.com/a/s4RlSrh](https://imgur.com/a/s4RlSrh)

As the game is supposed to be 100 percent anonymous, and I can't reply to this individual directly...

It's important to track down what's wrong with me because I want to have a few people to spend time with me for an extended period of time. I don't want to die friendless, single, without family, and forever a virgin.

It's not about labels. I hate labels. It's about figuring out what steps I need to take so I stop yelling and freaking out while alone in my car because doing it in my apartment or out in broad public leads to the police getting called, and when I don't let off that steam, my mind wanders and I accidentally run red lights, leading to the police being called on me as I enter the parking lot of the retail store I work at, making me 20 minutes late for my shift, in a career field far below my usual paygrade, over 1,000 miles away from everyone else I know, because the only friends I had back home willing to let me live with them and move out of my grandparent's house at age 26, either didn't have a car, an education, or a job, which I had all three, just my grandparents would guilt trip me saying I could never make it living on my own. And I just so happened to move TWO DAYS before the COVID-19 shutdown. So the only friends of mine who fit those three criterea with the least likelyhood of my own failure or taking advantage of me, were 6 states away.

So it really makes me upset that even though I've almost always had a job for the past 10 years of my life, thus usually having insurance, and plenty of money if I don't, never having any unpaid debts, perfect credit, etc, something unexpected seems to go wrong, such as a job firing me for accepting their benefits they offered after already working for almost 2 years, and every single doctor or therapist I try to see makes me wait over an hour, talks to me for maybe 5 minutes, tells me I'm normal and no tests are necessary, and bills me for their services. Rinse and repeat. Over and over and over.

And I'm not blaming anyone else here. I'm ranting, sure. But the truth is, over my entire life of trying to get help, getting none from professionals, and being bullied and harrassed by everyone else... I do 100 percent honestly believe I AM everyone else's problem. I just want to figure out what's wrong with me so I can STOP being everyone's problem. And so I won't die alone.",22May2020,1

238,"24M here, always have had issues with depression and anxiety from how I grew up. I should be seeing a psychologist but they are all doing video only and I cannot seem to benefit from that. The face to face is a vital part of the interaction for me. It used to be I  could just ignore it all by working all the time. That isn't an option anymore. The only people I can see currently are my family, and that is usually counterproductive. I see my siblings growing up the same way and I want to help them, but doing so takes a huge mental toll on me. To top it all off, I have a constant headache, literally wake up with it every day, and the doctors cannot figure out why. No medication has been able to help. Alcohol takes my mind off of it, and I'm afraid I may become dependent on it for that very reason. I've had many ups and downs over the years, but this is definitely the lowest low. I'm sorry to bother you all with this, but hopefully someone will have some advice or encouragement. Thanks in advance.",22May2020,1
239,"Our brains like to think about anything that could potentially cause problems. They like to examine problems from every angle until they can resolve the issue and won’t rest until they do. Usually, this is a very handy feature. When dealing with a global crisis it’s highly unlikely your brain will be able to resolve the issue. Unless you are currently hard at work on a vaccine, in which case keep up the good work, Britain stands behind you. 


For the rest of us, we might have to accept that while there isn’t a lot we can do on the grand scheme of things, we can completely change the way we deal with our anxiety and improve our own life. The first thing I would like to make clear, is that being anxious is completely natural. If someone wasn’t emotionally affected by the virus on any level whatsoever, that’s more concerning. The only person I can think of who’s completely unaffected is my cat, and it’s widely accepted that cats are dicks.


1.Write your worries down


Worries are often vague, negative little shits, floating about in the corners of your mind, popping to the front when they think you might have been about to relax. By being so vague, they can keep their mystery and continue to lurk. When you write down your worries, you are forcing them to become concrete and this means you can look at them objectively. By doing this you take away some of their power.


You don’t need to buy a special thoughts journal for this, although to be perfectly honest I am a firm believer that you can never have too many notebooks. You can write them down on a scrap piece of paper, a post it note or literally anywhere.


2.Challenge thoughts


When you write your thoughts down and make them more concrete, you can begin to challenge them. I will use the example of my cat being an arsehole. 


Firstly, what is my evidence to support this thought?
Well, she stood right on my chest yesterday with her pointy little feet, she upended a pint glass of water on me while I slept last night, she screams for food when she has food in her bowl and sometimes she walks over my lap to go sit on someone else’s, which hurts my feelings.


Secondly, we move on to evidence against this thought. This can be a bit trickier, ask yourself what someone else would say in this situation. Maybe literally ask them. 


My evidence would be that I’m not really sure if cats have the thinking power to maliciously tip a glass of water over anyone. It looked like it scared her more than me. When she stood on me she was actually choosing to lie down on me for a cuddle. I think it’s just a general cat thing to scream for food when they already have food. I suppose she can love more than just the one person and want to spend time with more than just me.


When we take our thoughts and scrutinise them we are making them more clear, and we give them a chance to be tested. Often, our worries fail under testing. Sometimes they wont, and we need to examine what we can learn from the thought, or what we need to do. An example of this might be if I had the thought I was going to catch Corona and die. This might stem from the fact that I forget to wash my hands when I come back from the shops. This is a useful thought, as it is warning me about something I can change, I might decide to put up a reminder notice when I come in the door to wash my hands.


3.Worry Time
I would like you to not think about a pink elephant now. You can think about whatever you want as long as it is absolutely under no circumstances a pink elephant. Definitely do not thank about a pink elephant sitting beside you with its little pink trunk.


How well did that go?


When we tell our brains to not think about something, it very rarely works. To try to counteract this, we do not tell our brains that we will not worry, but we can tell our brains that we can worry during our ‘worry time.’ This is 10 minutes at a certain time of day where you set a timer and really just focus on everything you are worrying about. Properly wallow in it. When the timer goes off, you continue with your day. When your brain wants to worry about something outside of worry time, make a note if it and think about it during your worry time.


4.Gratitude


Gratitude is a skill, and like any other skill you will need to practice. A useful way to do this is to write down three things you are grateful for every night before you go to bed. This might be quite difficult at first, but over time you will find it easier and easier.
5. Give yourself a break


Maslow’s hierarchy of needs has five levels, this is easier to explain if you have a picture of the triangle in front of you but I don’t know how to get a picture and put it on this post without infringing on copyright so I’ll try to explain. There are five levels of needs, the bottom two levels are food and water and things we need so we don’t die, the next level is security so we feel safe. The next two levels are social needs and self esteem needs (like relationships and a sense of achievement). Level number five is self actualisation which is where a person fulfils all the other levels and is able to be creative and fulfil their potential. 


Because we are in the midst of a global pandemic we don’t feel safe and so we can’t get past level the second level, or past the basic needs phase. This is why you might be struggling to do things that before you found easy. Security needs do not consist of learning a new language, creating a side hustle or doing a 30 day bikini body fitness challenge. (If I get one more targeted weight loss advert I’m throwing my phone at the wall, but that’s beside the point). 


It feels so difficult to survive because survival is bloody difficult at the minute. If you feel like all you’re doing is existing, then please understand that that in itself can be a challenge. 


Dear reader, whoever you are, please understand that I probably don’t care enough about you to lie about this. You’re doing a great job. 


6. Acceptance 


If you feel anxious about the current state of affairs I regret to inform you that you are currently suffering from an incurable affliction called ‘being human.’ The side effects include raised heart rate, increased irritability, occasional eye leakage and a feeling of impending doom. 


There is a theory of thought (Relational Frame Theory for anyone interested) that humans experience mental health problems through the complexity of language and relating to objects outside of the self. The best way I can think to describe this is that my cat doesn’t understand or care about my opinion of her, what she will do tomorrow nor does she feel regret (or glee) that I woke up by being drenched with a pint glass of water last night. This is because she doesn’t understand a language complex enough to explain these concepts. Humans do. Humans are often usually very good at solving problems and when we find we can’t we get a bit stuck. 


We are unable to solve many of the problems we currently face and if we are able to accept this, and focus on the things we can change we can feel more in control.

240,"(Terrible typing because I can't pay attention and my language is very broken and weak; was checked 3x.)

   This isn't by far the weirdest of things that has happened to me, but it is just so odd either way. There are plenty of more things that just straight out make me think, ""What the fuck is wrong with me?"".
   If I ever wanted to meet someone new, I just can't help but think about what IF I would've harmed them. This is very typical after I cringe very hard when someone does something nice for me; the thoughts always happen when I exactly meet someone knew.
   There's just no way of escaping it. It's so bad that I have tried to stopped talking to new people and other people (but I still persisted to have chats with them).
   I would also get scared of saying or doing something stupid that'll make them hate me, paranoid about their intentions (even my friends), crave for their attention, the desire to take advantage of that person, be left alone, run away, and just other unexplainable bullshit that I have. There's just mixed feelings and other things when I interact with things or with people.
   What I would do is just either space out and escape from reality, cringe forever, try to just to talk that person, run away and never talk to them, etc.

247,"I've had on ongoing battle with my mental health for years. First diagnosed with depression, got medication, got better. When I started relapsing my doctor said it was anxiety causing exhaustion and depression. Over the last two years or so I've gone through a bunch of medications, finally landing on a combination that made me feel like I was actually getting better.

The last few months have been a roller-coaster though. On one hand I'm better than I've been in years, but Im still exhausted and I have depressive episodes. I'm employed full time, but my workload is maybe around 80%, I work in a small family company and they have been very supportive. But lately my performance has dipped. Over the course of the last few months I have been able to do less every week. As it is now I can barely handle my work, even though I've been at the offer practically every weekend to finish what should have been done during the week. 

My partner brought up the possibility of adhd, and I have an assessment coming up this week. 

Today was a day off in my country, but I spent all day at the office. Trying to force myself to work. 

When I got home I think I snapped. I hid in the bedroom, telling my partner I wanted to be alone, crying for an hour. I've had been thinking about self harm for a long time, but never actually done anything. I locked myself in the bathroom and took one of my partners razor blade. I cut several small cuts in my thigh, not deep, but bleeding. 

My partner was worried and came knocking on the door, when I couldn't answer he panicked and somehow unlocked the door from the outside with his finger nails. For the first 15 minutes or so all I could do was keep saying sorry for bothering him. After that is was like waking up from a nightmare. 

My partner is scared to leave me alone, even though I feel fine now. I'm worried about him, he keeps shrugging when I ask how he feels. 

I'm worried about myself, I'm scared that I took that step. And that it feels like I was almost another person when it happened. 

I will see my doctor for a planned visit on Tuesday, I might be able to move it to Monday. But other than telling him, I have absolutely no idea what to do after this.

250,"hey peeps, wondering if you can help me figure out if I need to go to therapy. I’m not entirely sure how to explain this, so I’m going to ramble and hope that it comes out somewhat coherently. I consider myself casually suicidal. I don’t want to die, I just don’t really care if I die. I don’t particularly give a shit about anything, as a matter of fact. I never really feel anything, pain, sadness, happiness. It’s not an overwhelming urge, it’s just kinda there all the time, and it always had been since I was really little. 

The same goes for my self-injury. I’ve always sorta felt this weird urge to hurt myself. When i was really young it was little things, but it’s gotten more and more intense as I’ve gotten older. Because I don’t really get overwhelmed by emotion, I don’t feel like I’m using it as a coping mechanism. I just like it. I like the way it feels, and the way it looks, and I like taking care of myself after I’ve been hurt. At this point I’m starting to think I’m a masochist with no better outlet for that trait.

Also, I’ve gotten really lazy with schoolwork this year and I’m probably going to fail a few classes. I just can’t be bothered to do it. I’d rather just stare at the ceiling and think. Do I have a problem, or am I just a lethargic asshole who needs to get their shit together and stop whining? I used to be so on top of things...

Ultimately, am I just a bit disconnected, or have I gone so far off the deep end that I can’t recognize that I have a problem? I would really appreciate some opinions.

I don’t know who to talk to so I am talking to reddit instead, I might not get a response but it feels good to open the bottle that’s been closed for so long.

I have been struggling a lot with anxiety recently. My older brother has been suffering with frequent psychotic episodes for the past couple of years, which likely came from drug use as an adolescent, and it is really beginning to take its toll on myself and my family.

Roughly two years ago, the episodes of psychosis and delusions became very difficult and our home environment was a very negative and stressful one, so myself and my partner moved out of my mum’s house and into our own place. 

My mental health has been great ever since, up until fairly recently. It began when my brother had one of his worst episodes and I ended up calling an ambulance while racing to my mum’s house to make sure that her and my little sister were safe. It was traumatic, scary and I just remember feeling so helpless.

After the air cleared and things cooled off, a few days later, I experienced one of the worst panic attacks of my life, almost completely out of nowhere. Since then I have had episodical periods of anxiety, some worse than others, and it is now becoming a more regular mindset.

I have visited my mum a few times over the past couple of weeks and she seems tired, baggy-eyed and generally stressed and run-down. It is now triggering my anxiety every time I think of this, as I am becoming more concerned that this is beginning to have a badly detrimental effect on my mum’s wellbeing.

My mum has always been a positive, confident, outgoing person, so it is very alarming seeing her in this stressed and fatigued state. It is consuming my thoughts daily. The worst part is that my brother’s delusions cause him to blame my mum and speak to her in a regular derogatory manor, sometimes aggressively, which frustrates me and causes a significant amount of stress to me as well, so I can’t imagine what it’s doing to her.

I am 21 years old and happy with my life, but it is becoming overshadowed by this lurking anxiety and regular panic attacks. As you can imagine, I can’t speak to any of my family about my struggles as they are already dealing with enough with my brother without needing my problems burdening them as well.

My apologies, I was only supposed to write a few sentences, but I find it hard to explain with little detail, due to the complexity of the situation.

I feel that there is no solution, he will not help himself as he feels as if everyone is against him and I am struggling to see any positive, damage-free way out of the situation. I just want to help and make it all stop, but I can’t even speak with the people I love about my stresses and regular anxious state.

I also feel that one of the main factors fuelling my anxiety is the stomach-wrenching fear of ever becoming like my brother. It is a known fact that anxiety often makes you feel like you are going crazy. After seeing my brother lose touch with reality first hand, the anxiety of the situation causes me to tell myself that I am going to end up like him as I am ‘mentally unwell’  with anxiety which, in turn, leads me to feel more anxious, and the cycle continues. It is becoming a self perpetuating cycle of worry, and I am struggling to get on with normal life while the aforementioned issues are playing in the back of my mind.

Thank you for reading this long-winded message and I would be very grateful for some advice from anyone who has been in a remotely similar situation (I don’t think many people are in this sort of situation), or if anyone could maybe shine some positive light on what feels like a very dark situation.

Thank you.",22May2020,1
262,"There’s something seriously wrong with me. I want to stop taking my antidepressants because I think they make me evil and hear voices sometimes. I’m not schizophrenic or anything. About an hour ago I was walking along the road at night. My body was walking towards the nearest bridge. Whether I would have actually jumped, not really sure. But you could probably tell by talking to me that I’m not well mentally. My Mum had to come and get me. I was scared and crying. I didn’t want to live anymore. This has happened before-I know it will happen again. But I’ve never been locked up even after going to the hospital after a suicide threat.",22May2020,3
263,"I have a friend who had a spontaneous mental breakdown today. He was sending a lot of concerning messages to our discord saying that he tried to kill himself but opted out at the last second. The weirdest part is that I saw him the day before and he seemed completely fine. The way he was typing made it seem like he was in a manic state. A few hours later, he said that he felt fine. If anyone could tell me what mental illness this is, I would appreciate it because I need to know how to approach this. (Also, the reason I don’t call a hotline or something is because I’m afraid it would cause him to take drastic action; if anyone has advice regarding this, I’d like to hear it).",22May2020,0

265,"My relationship is pretty much over and he keeps being rude to me, saying im fat and my teeth are too yellow and i smell bad. I moved into this hotel with him because it was way cheaper than my apartment and he said we wouldnt be here long. I am honestly bad with money. Its hard for me to save if i dont have a clear goal. I keep trying to show him places within our budget but ""I'm not that interested"" and he wont even look, so i haven't been saving because it seems he doesnt want to leave. He talks and laughs to himself and rips his body hair out like a crazy person and its driving me fucking crazy I get so mad when I hear his voice. He left for a week and it was a godsend. He said I could get a dog if I saved enough and found one and I did, but i had the shelter call his number and he got pissed when I asked him to answer it because I dont like answering other peoples phones. I said please answer its important and he said sorry but its not that fucking important to me. I really want to leave but I owe him like 2000 in rent, which I havent been paying him because I've been paying off my other debts. I either ghost him or kms I think idk what to do",22May2020,1
266,I already have ocd and gad. And for some reason I experience emotional connections with inanimate objects. Like my headphones or a pencil. Does anyone know why this might be?,22May2020,1
267,"the past few weeks all i’ve done is cry, go on my computer, and sometimes eat. i can’t bring myself to talking about it because i’m just a white kid in a suburb, what could i possibly go through that others aren’t? the only thing that is stopping me from killing myself is that i don’t have the balls to follow through with it. none of my friends seem to care about me and i’m not saying that as some cliche. they literally have no interest in my wellbeing and see me as nothing more than a joke spewing machine. i don’t want to be here anymore, life has just been miserable. i told my mom about this once and she promised she would get me some help but nothing has changed. i don’t want to go outside anymore i don’t even find gaming fun anymore. i’ve found myself disassociating from everyone and spending all day in my room  i just want to feel loved but i only feel empty",22May2020,1
268,"I'm just not good enough. This feeling has haunted me all of my life.

Recent mistakes have made me realize that I need to start taking my mental health seriously, and I have my first appointment with a therapist this coming Monday.",22May2020,1
269,"I consider myself to be relatively in tune with my emotions and my mental health. I have diagnosed ADD and GAD (just telling in case this matters). I am in a pretty normal headspace most of the time, but occasionally experience periods where i feel as if no one loves me and my life itself is worthless and that if i died, no one would care. Is this normal? If not, what is wrong with me?",22May2020,1
