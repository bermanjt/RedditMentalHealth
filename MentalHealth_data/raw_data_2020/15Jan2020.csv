0,"Hi, I'm new to this so I'll make this as short and sweet as possible. I deal with trauma from past sexual abuse and last march I told my parents about it and have asked for help (mainly therapy). My sister is dealing with a lot as well and my parents focus on her and my brother ( who is dealing with a learning disability) more. I won't go into detail but she takes her feelings into action as with me I don't. It sucks because I feel like I have no one supporting me, I know my sister can be a handful, I mean I live with her but it still sucks never the less. 

Her issues and struggles are a lot but I feel like mine are too. When I come back home from my therapy appointments nobody asks how it went but it is obviously different from when my sister gets back home from hers. My appointments have been getting canceled lately and it's like pulling teeth trying to get them to reschedule them let alone remember I even have one. not only that since my therapist is on vacation my parents just threw me into group therapy even though I said I didn't want to go beforehand. 

Sometimes I feel like they would rather handle her issues because mine might be triggering for them or they might feel guilty about what happened to me. I feel like my problems are just put on the back burner and I told my doctor this yesterday during a check-up but all he said is that my parents love me and care about my situation but my sister's problems are more pressing (which I do agree with) and to just keep up with the group therapy until my therapist gets back and to try to open up about my problems with group. 

 At this point I'm trying to look for ways to deal with my problems myself, I will be 18 in 2 years and I will have to do things myself anyway, I can't lean on my parents forever. I'm hoping by sharing this I could get some advice and maybe meet people with the same issues as me.",15Jan2020,1
1,"I remember my mom would always point out how happy, silly and full of energy I used to have. My friends say I would bring so much joy and laughter into their lives. I used to be a fun, loving, lover of life.

Then it ended.

For the past 4 months now, I have been so empty. I feel so guilty. I let everyone down. I am not the sunshine anymore. A dark rain cloud has consumed me. I try to laugh but I put on this horrific mask. I am in shame. I want you back, happy girl. I miss all the fun we used to have.",15Jan2020,1
3,"I've been depressed for at least two weeks and I don't have any motivate to read any books, email professors or graduate students for research opportunities, conduct literature review for my remote internship, or do anything else. 

How can I get out of my depressive state besides taking my medications and keeping in touch with my support system? I don't go back to university till the 18th so I don't see my therapist or psychiatrist till then. 

Thanks.",15Jan2020,1
4,"I realize that this thread might not be as dire as some others on here but if you can read it, it'll help a little.  A bit about me, I'm a young freshman at uni.  Both my parents are breadwinners, working menial jobs with menial pay until they get injured. I live in a city that's going through a massive economic crisis, opioids and violence here is at an all time high while employment is at an all time low.  I moved here 13 years ago when the city was still alive and vibrant, now it's just dead. Stabbings, shootings and a drugged up homeless men passed out on every corner. I moved here from Asia because my dad's side of the family lived here and we were hoping they would support us in the transition period. Little did we known that in less than two years, they'd practically abandon us. 

I've never had a real ""job"" experience, my parents have always told me to stay focused on my education and when I major in something (anthropology), I'd apply for something in that field but who knows?  Honestly, there's no future for me here and I just feel so lost. I don't know where my life will go after I finished graduate school... and I'm kind of scared about it. My tuition and interests are going up while the chances of getting a job are going down drastically. I feel so lost and alone... sometimes I try to drown these feelings with weed but that often backfires. I just want to run away and start life anew. I just hope for better days and its that hope that I'm desperately clinging on to rn. 

I guess at the end of the day I should still be thankful that I do have a roof over my head and that I'm able to attend postsecondary.",15Jan2020,1
5,"So a little background on me. I had a rough childhood with both parent's and my one sister being abusive.  In my adult life, I've really struggled with relationships and dating in general due to a PTSD trigger that sends me into a dissociative state.

I've done lots of work with 4 different therapist's over the course of 15 years, but the issue has gotten worse - to the point where I've given up on the idea of dating and my dream of one day having a family of my own.

I've realized that each time I've gone to therapy my problem is never addressed. each therapist I've had zeroed in on my my family as the source of my problems. So naturally, over the years, my relationship with my family has gotten better, while my social life has gotten worse. 

At this point, I really feel like I've come to terms with my family past, and I've even changed the relationship with my Dad and it's actually pretty darn good. I look forward to seeing them, we enjoy each others company, and I can be open and honest with them. I recognize that there is more work to be done for sure, but I'm feeling good about us as a family.

I'm become convinced, that my relationship problems stem from my childhood friendships/relationships, but I've only ever been able to convince one therapist (my current therapist) to focus on that part of my life, and only for one session.

It's really frustrating.

Has anyone had this experience in therapy?

Has anyone else had Therapy that addressed issues similar to mine and if so, what kind of treatment helped?

This is the SECOND time today I have been reminded that not only am I a criminal, but a mentally ill one.

Then it says explain why applicant cannot work in any capacity without this medication:

Well...there it is. I know this sounds stupid, but now that I have heard it from the professionals...

10,"They tell you to be where you are, to feel your emotions. But this sadness is so soul crushing, it's almost a natural instinct to fight it. 

For me, I can be fine for a couple days, my depression is there but manageable, but then it just hits me. It can last a few hours, or a day. Then I feel fine again. I want to know, how do you deal when you feel that way.   

Do you give into it and just be soul crushingly sad until you're not anymore? 

Do you crawl into bed until you finally feel like you can get back up? 

Do you fake it and go through the motions until it's over? 

Do you let your kids see you be so fucking sad you cant even look them in the face?

6 years ago I was love struck and practically obessed over a girl I loved.  A year passes and we both just kinda vanish off the side of the earth separately and my feelings were left crushed.  I never thought that I'd be able to put aside my love for her and never thought I'd be able to talk about them.
Yesterday we talked on facebook out of the blue and decided to go get food today since she was leaving town.  6 hours pass and we've talked about everything from the past to our plans in 5 years.  Over this course of this day I realized that we had both changed and we weren't meant to be together.  All like that this weight of my pain and whatever I clung onto vanished and I cried a bit which was bittersweet for us both.

Is four years a long time? When I was in high school, I had an older boy use me. He used me for sex and for cheating. He also said a lot of mean things about my personality. I haven't seen him for almost five years. I moved states he still tries to contact me regularly even though I made it clear I'm not interested, deleted all social media, and blocked him.




I feel so alone I can't get over the mean stuff he said or how he tries to contact me not denying being mean then trying to sweet talk me( he even does this with a long term girlfriend) he told me long ago that I'm weird he feels no connection to me but ”ill find someone” he said. He still keeps photos of me years later. I feel like I can't put myself out there; I feel broken. I feel like an alien does weird I've given up on dating. Whenever men show interest, I think they want to use me. How can I get over this? Why has this taken so long? Am I stupid?


Yeah, he texts me regularly with a girlfriend till I respond. Before he moved in with her, he tried to face time me 36 times begging to talk to me saying it's the last time we can talk. He keeps photos of me and tries to send them to me. He denies doing anything wrong and says he's always kind to me. I blocked him, but he still tries emailing me, asking if we can be friends(blocking emails again show up in spam). If he thought I was weird, annoying, and no connection, why not leave me alone after four years?

I’m a 24 yo female living in the US. I suffer from sever anxiety and trichotillomania. 

My hair pulling and picking of split ends is ruining my life, and I truly can’t live like this anymore. It controls every aspect of my life. I’ve been trying various medications and seen 2 psychiatrists and 1 therapist. 

None of them had any familiarity with trichotillomania and couldn’t help me. One of the psychiatrists also misprescribed a benzo to me which caused a great deal of additional issues. 

I still haven’t technically ever received an official diagnosis and my other doctors dismiss the severity of the issues I deal with. Because of my history with medical professionals, I have additional anxiety around finding and trusting a therapist. 

Can anyone help me find one or at least give me advice on how to find one who knows what they’re doing and has dealt with trichotillomania? I just want to live a normal life. 

If you’ve made it all the way through this post, thank you. It means more to me than you know. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

TLDR; I suffer from trichotillomania and need to find a cognitive behavioral therapist to aid in my recovery.",15Jan2020,1

So I've been quite suicidal lately, nothing to the point where I've wanted to truly act on it. But sometimes if I'm really upset these thoughts run through my head and I sometimes express it out loud and once the feeling has come and pass and I've calmed down I get an overwhelming anxiety that ive betrayed God and I will get an automatic sentence to hell for being so ungrateful of the life he provided for me. I then start to hate myself for being so ungrateful and having these thoughts to begin with. I have an anxiety already surrounding death and where I will go (yes, quite ironic coming from a person who can have suicidal thoughts). It scares me alot and I feel so bad and I don't know where to start to fix it.

I don't know where I was going with this post. I guess I'm kind of seeking for advice but also just wanted to vent and put my anxiety in writing. 

P.s I'm not super religious. I believe in God and Jesus but I wouldn't say I'm super devout. I don't even go to church but I do believe in it and was diagnosed with OCD a few years ago. I'm not so much the cleaning time more of an obsessive thinker and ritualistic.

I was expecting her to probe into it more and tell me it wasn't ok, etc. Nope. She, said, ""That's it?"" I told her it was. She probed a little deeper. ""Pills? Infidelity? Excessive spending? Violence?"" After each one, I replied ""no"". She asked how much I was drinking and I told her. She asked if I was driving after. I told her no. Finally she tells me, ""That's not so bad.""

20,"Throwaway account. Sorry this is a bit jumbled. I don’t even know where to start. Backstory, my mother has struggled with severe depression, bipolar, and anxiety since before i was born. She always thinks the world is out to get her and that life isn’t fair. Shes threatened suicide countless times in my life for things i have no control over. She jumps from job to job because people are out to get her. She moves from house to house because landlords are out to get her. I recently found out shes only been medicated for two years of her entire life and that was for depression. She is very incapable of being financially responsible because she makes snap decisions that wind up costing a lot of money. Example, she quits jobs without lining up another and not being able to pay rent. Every time she has to move or loses a job i end up paying the costs to keep her off the street. So tens of thousands of dollars by this point. I try to hold my ground but ultimately she just threatens to commit suicide or be homeless if i don’t help.

Now, about six months ago i bought her a trailer to live in on my cousins property. The agreement was, all she had to do was keep her job and live rent free and pay down her debts. Well, about a month ago my cousin calls me and tells me he’s on his way to my house with my mom because she threatened to commit suicide after she got fired from her latest job and her employer appealed her unemployment, etc. Anyway, fast forward to now and shes staying with me and my family because she has no where else to go. I’ve taken (paid) for my mom to see a therapist and get depression meds and caught her up on her car payments so it doesn’t get repo’d (another thousand). Theres a lot more expenses she needs to get caught up on that i dont want to pay for, but thats a separate conversation.

The issue im having is, she is stressing out my family (wife and 3 yr old daughter) and really causing me anxiety and an inability to focus at work because of what i know I have to come home to and the financial mess i feel like i have to help her with. Now i could just not help her but if i do that shell be homeless or dead. I have no idea what to do. What i was planning to do is get her medicated and see if she can hold down a job and eventually move out. The problem is, i just really need her out of the house and not living here. The constant doom and gloom and threats of suicide is draining. I went through plenty of that in my childhood and don’t want to expose my daughter to it. So what do you do with a parent in their 50’s who cant hold a job, has severe mental illness, and has no where to go?

Other considerations, there are mental institution but they cost about $6k per week, which is crazy expensive. Also, she said if i ever put her in a home (old peoples home or mental institution) she’ll just end it right there.

I dont know what to do.",15Jan2020,1
21,"Remove if a post like this isn't allowed.

Also sorry for formatting, am on mobile.

I was always your classic happy kid, I would have a moments as most do, but nothing to call home about. Last fight I was in was in 2nd grade (8 years ago).

All this changed when I got into middle school, I went from an A average student to failing most of my classes, I was falling asleep in class, I gained ~70 lbs by 7th grade, I was suicidal. It's evident I was depressed. I finally got help after my vice principal flat out told my parents I wanted to kill myself. This was a first run in with mental health issues.

Come 8th grade, I was kicked out of my school (private) for managing to have a .5 GPA and dragging down the class average, so I moved back into public school. I got a haircut for the first time in ~2 years. I was doing great, minus the occasional days where depression decided to rear it's ugly head again. I got my first and 2nd girlfriends, I was surrounded by friends, and it felt great. I ended up taking on a ""protector"" role. I felt the need to protect and help my friends. If I'm honest, the attention I felt with all the praise felt great.

The summer after 8th grade, came my presumed 2nd run in with mental health. I just flat out felt nothing. Not happy, sad, mad, nothing. I didn't feel empathy, and I would even watch gore videos just to feel a bit of *something*. I lied about getting a diagnosis of Antisocial personality disorder to my friends, and they all thought it was so cool so I just ran with it. During this time I had managed to memorize my parents debt card info, and would almost daily order food. This went on for a couple months, and I wouldn't be surprised if I ended up ordering over $2k during that time. My parents were understandably pissed, and my dad asked ""Do you feel bad about this?"" And honestly, I didn't. I still don't. I can see how what I did is wrong but I didn't feel any remorse.

9th grade rolls around, and I'm still going through my ""feeling nothing"" thing, and I meet a ray of sunshine in my nothingness. I ended up being madly in love with this girl, going so far as to fantasize about us being married and having a salmon dinner prepared for us when she got home. I confess, and she says no. Almost immediately I'm back in my nothingness state. Pretty much just ""well that happened."". About a month later the familiar feeling of depression creeps back, and I honestly welcome it. Feeling nothing for ~6 months is boring. The rest of 9th grade continues, switching between being happy and normal and depressed.

Summer of 9th rolls around, and I'm feeling stressed. I signed up for a summer geometry course, that alongside a summer job with insane hours brought me to the edge. I was honestly suicidal a couple times due to it. I became indulgent in sex, and food. My youth group and I go down to Oklahoma for a Christian youth camp, and I have the realization I feel nothing again. My brain is also blank, I can't really visualize anymore, and I can only think if I intentionally try to. But at the same time I'm also confident, it's easier to talk to people. It was weird.

10th grade (this year) comes, and I'm excited to see my friends again. I ended up failing the 2nd semester of geometry due to me not doing the work, but I still ended up in Algebra 2 which was fine by me. My confidence was being to wane though, and comments people made would suddenly cut really deep even if they wouldn't before. I'm stuck searching for a purpose, but can't find it. I have gotten involved with some groups I probably shouldn't be with. 

Towards Christmas, a similar feeling comes over me not unlike the previous two summers. But this time I wanted power. For whatever reason I became obsessed with the idea of becoming a dictator, invading Canada, and caring for the American and Canadian people. All of it seems a bit laughable in retrospect. Following this came a deep depression but ended up only lasting a few days.

Cut to now. It's 2nd semester of sophomore year, and I still can't form an image in my mind, it's a fog. I've grown a stronger affinity for math as I'm pretty good at it. I'm exhausted, but at the same time confident. I know that if I actually tried in school I could easily beat everyone. People have begun to accuse me of being narcissist. It seems even little blows to my ego piss me off, today being a great example of someone saying I'd just be pitty fuck. It just ruined my day. People aren't taking my advice anymore when I would have worked and it annoying.

Couple other bits I should add, but I'm too lazy to edit into the actual paragraphs. From middle school till now I was a compulsive liar and got extremely got at it. On July 13, 2017 I tried to kill myself.

I'm not looking for a diagnosis, but rather guidance. Is this just some weird depression? Am I really a narcissist? I just want a path that could lead me to being happy again.",15Jan2020,1
22,"The past month and a half have been really hard on me. I’ve never dealt with depression before and it’s hitting me in a major way. I opened up to my parents about it over when I came home from school for Christmas. 

I thought I was getting better but being back at school is extremely hard. Just the first week of classes has been almost unbearable. I’ve been keeping in frequent touch with my family, calling them every day, multiple times. 

The talk we had the other day just completely broke me in way I’ve never felt. I was talking about how it was hard for me to even interact with people the same way, and that I just didn’t even feel like myself anymore. My mother asked me if I was thinking of hurting myself and I took a pause and said it was something I thought about but I didn’t know if I was going to do it or not. 

My mother broke down into tears. I was on speaker and could hear my father in the background starting to cry as well. I’ve NEVER heard him cry before. I’ve seen him shed a few tears at my high school graduation and at funerals, but never in my life has he cried with so much pain. He said to me in a broken down tone “boy... I would lose my mind if something ever happened to you”. My mom started saying she wished they could fix me, and bring her old son back, but all they could really do was try to be there each step of the way. 

I felt like something died in me. I never pictured myself getting to this point. The depression is so bad it hurts me physically a lot of the time. There’s a constant pain in my chest and it feels like there’s a hole where my soul used to be. I feel so alone. I wished I could hug my mother and tell her everything will be fine but I don’t know if it will be.",15Jan2020,1

24,"My mood has sat at around 4/10 for months now. Often at 3/10, sometimes 5/10. I will get the occasional half day of my resting mood 5/10 with drops into 4/10. When I came to uni it would probably be a borderline 4/5, but after about a month, it was a hard 4, nearly a 3 and the lows were bad. Suicide has been a frequent thought. This is taking 5 to be neutrality.

This evening something changed in my mood. My mood is I would say 5/10 at rest if I had to guess. It feels different this time. I have revised for my exams over this past week. I left it until the latest possible, because my exams are this weeks as well, but things are going well. I have been able to absorb what I read. I have had a maths exam so far. I learnt way more than I needed to and I did it in 2 days. It went well. I have another exam upcoming, I am now hopeful for this one.

What has changed? Well I have been eating more vegetables for one. I have eaten sunflower seeds and walnuts daily, as well as various fruits. I have drank a lot, nearly 3 litres per day each day for about 4 days now. I have taken my fexofenadine daily. Out of all things, this has correlated with my ability to focus, despite what I have read online which claims it has no nootropic effect. I am rubbing my scalp less. I am taking steps to take better care of the skin on my face and it is working.

I do not know what of the above is coincidence, or maybe small changes have helped at least. I have had far less suicidal ideation. I am not happy, but I feel more normal recently at least. 

I feel more motivated. I think there may be some hope. I do not know if this will last. I have had some resolve, I will not be going back to the GP I do not think. I am ashamed of my weakness and I feel anger for my past actions. I have potentially identified some way to treat myself. It will be a combination of methods.

27,"So many people telling me “it is okay to just have a good cry, you will feel better,” and I’ve tried it. Apparently, most people feel lighter and less stressed after they cry.

My whole life, every time I cry, even for 2 minutes, I get flu-like symptoms for about 6 hours afterwards. Shivers, nausea, body aches, sweating a ton, feeling hot and cold, exhausted, emotionally short and not able to handle anything due to how tired I am. This is, apparently, not normal. Is it possible to have some sort of allergy? 

I also get a terrible headache for that time, and my face gets swollen as all hell (sometimes my eyes even swell entirely shut) but I think that’s normal as I’ve seen others talk about those symptoms. 

I have realized that I’ve been avoiding crying as much as possible because of this. I only realized it wasn’t normal when I asked my therapist why crying wasn’t considered self harm, because it literally makes the body ill. She said that does not happen to her or anyone else she has ever met.",15Jan2020,1
28,"I’m 18, I grew up being the outcast of my family, I wasn’t as social as the others were. I was the one they picked on for fun, I was the one my brother used to take all his anger out on. I can’t really blame him, he was only following our dad doing the same to both of us because we were “too weak” and he would “fucking knock us into next week”. To my mother we were just failures and every time we got bruised we would just be too much of princesses to deal with it. She would always blame herself though saying she had to have failed so much to have ended up with us.

My first depressive episode was when I was 6, when I was 8 I tried to escape the pain and suicide but I ultimately ended up just crying myself to sleep, waking up the next day with all the bruises from accidentally laughing over a tv ad and disturbing my dad. When I was 10 I was in like a state of constant panic because I didn’t want to deal with my home life and I was only ever bullied at school, so I basically just stopped eating breakfast because I would just end up throwing it up, if I threw up at home I was a “faking shit”, if I threw up at school it was just another one of my problems, eventually I was just getting yelled at because I “was going to end up ruining this family” that I “was going to make us have to split up because of my whining”. This was also the year my mother left a goodbye note and we thought for like 5 hours that she had probably killed herself, we tried calling and calling but my siblings and I just ended up mostly sitting there crying while my dad was passed out, she eventually came back like nothing happened so yeah. Later that year my dad also got really bad and had plans of killing all of us and himself, he called an army mate and told him, the army mate then secretly told us to run. Like we’re good no one was hurt so yep. After this point I kind of just started going numb and now I just don’t feel most things. I kind of stopped seeing suicide as way to release me from pain that would hurt others, I started just seeing it as peace, the light at the end of the tunnel.


Basically all throughout school I was an outsider I was basically just a socially awkward weirdo. I was bullied heavily all throughout school basically. Except this one class I had where they didn’t bully me, people in there weren’t always nice to me, but some were kind of nice, that class is probably the greatest people I have ever met not because they were my friends or anything but mostly because they just didn’t treat me like shit. 

I’ve liked two people, at the start all I could think was that if I asked them then they would be sick or embarrassed or like laugh, but I get close to them when I was 15 she stopped talking to me and avoided me. The second one I was 17 and she actually got to know me more, I actually kind of opened up to her, I then told her how I felt, she immediately stopped talking to me, she then used what I told her against me, and then screwed over my graduation a bit, she then spread some rumours and I lost another friend.

One time I had this friend she was two years younger one day she told me she was depressed, and I thought I could care about her how I always wanted someone to care about me, I tried helping her and trying to get her to a more comfortable position where she would open up more. But ultimately people started hating me for it and then she stopped talking to me.

I never fit in at uni and I didn’t care for the work, I don’t really care about anything anymore, most things tend to just annoy me to a point that I hate them. Like I hate most things. I’m so done. I hate being around people.


A part of me though just wants someone caring to like find me and just hug me saying everything is going to be okay, but it wouldn’t matter because if they’re real I would never trust them, they must be getting something from it maybe they’re just using me who knows. Sometimes I try and find ways to create a person in my head because if I could create like a nice hallucination maybe that would be good enough. Honestly though I just want peace, I’m so done.


Now you’re probably going to say “get a pillow” or “get a psychiatrist/psychologist” I’ve had plenty of both and they really don’t help. 

Honestly I just really want to go, I just really want that peace of nothingness, but even if I stay it will probably only ever get worse, and some where done the line I’m gonna want to make people hate me in order for me to just finally die, and have my peace without such an impact on them.

Some background: 
I am diagnosed with anxiety, depression, PTSD. I eat generally very healthy, sticking to organic things, fruits, veggies, water, etc. 

I just got through my first semester of nursing school. It was extremely hard. 
As soon as I got home I began to have stomach issues; a dull pain in my LUQ every time I ate and sometimes pain during BMs. The pain was sometimes severe. I prefer to not eat spicy foods since it causes more stomach upset. For a while I thought it was a stomach ulcer but I cannot go see a doctor until May due to insurance issues. 

Could you guys throw out some advice for management of my problems? I have a feeling it is anxiety related (I have had issues in the past with it) but it doesn’t make sense that I would have problems AFTER the difficult semester. 

Thanks :)",15Jan2020,1
34,"How can I ask my parents to get me therapy?

I've had troubles with my mental health for a while. It usually comes and goes in waves of sadness then neutrality over the course of a few weeks or so. I'm a teenager and I'm pretty sure I have some form of social anxiety, which complements my horribly nonconfrontational and unmotivated personality nicely. It makes it difficult for me to bring up anything serious with my parents. So, I've usually put off confrontation about my issues as much as possible, thinking ""It's not too bad right now, I can wait"" even though I know that's a flawed mindset. Lately, though, things *have* gotten worse. I haven't even been able to hang out with my friends for months because they're busy all the time, and I'm separated from them at school because of our schedules. That, among other things, is really starting to get to me mentally. I know I need help. My friends know I need help. But I struggle so much to try to get it.

I know a lot of people would say ""You just have to go in and do it,"" or something along those lines. And I understand, there's not much else I can do. But if I can just get any other advice on how to make it easier I could really use it. I've seen recommendations like texting a parent while you've already left for school, so it's not as direct and they can't just go talk to you in your room once you send it; though I worry about the stress that would put on me throughout the day. Anything like that, though; advice on when/how to say it, how to phrase the question/conversation, whatever. I just need some help.",15Jan2020,1
35,"I'm 22, F. 

Lately it seems like everything is piling up on me and I have nobody to help me deal with it. I've suffered with severe depression for 4 years, I've cut off all my friends because of it (and honestly I wasn't close with them anyway, so). I also don't speak to any of my family except my parents but I've always had a complicated relationship with them...I don't feel comfortable talking to them about anything. The few times I've even tried to open up to them about how bad I'm feeling and I've been met with either extremely bad basic advice (""go for a walk!!(:"" or they just straight up scuff and dismiss my worries altogether. 

Also, my dad is apart of some of my problems. He's always been controlling and kept me from getting a job after high school, and is still keeping me from getting one because he wants me to do what he wants. He wants me to go to college and nothing else, but I'm not currently in college because he hasn't given me the money to do so. 

So I spend most of the day at home doing nothing all the time. It's incredibly isolating and lonely and it's slowly taking its toll on me. In addition to mental problems I already had, I developed tinnitus a couple years ago, which I've been struggling with profusely. 

I have so much sadness bottled up inside me. I went to the doctor not long ago and she was so kind...the second she started asking me if I was depressed I almost started crying. Later when I went home I DID cry. It was the first time someone had acknowledged I was in pain. That wasn't even why I was at the doctors...she just told me I looked unhappy. She could tell just by looking at me that I was suffering and I ask myself everyday how this stranger could see it and not my own parents. Anyway, she tried to help me. She put me on antidepressants but I had to stop taking those because it made my tinnitus worse. I can't even seek help for my depression. 

And I don't have anyone to talk to. There's nothing I can do to help myself. Nothing. I'm trapped. 

And I don't have the energy to fight anymore. I'm only 22 and this life has taken so much out of me. What I wrote here isn't even the half of it. Nothing has ever gone right for me. I feel like one day I will end up taking my own life because it's the only option I have. I know that sounds so cliche but it's true. In my case, it's not just the depression talking. I truly have no options. No help.

It's a strange, internal feeling that I don't know how to describe.  On a really bad day, I will dwell on the smallest thing and start thinking that this person is out to make my life horrible.  For example (on a really bad day), if a friend or significant other speaks over me, I start to think they are just ignoring me.  I will keep thinking about this small moment and it just builds up inside of me where eventually, I lash out at the next small annoyance from them.  The problem is, I will realize the next day that there was no ill-will to begin with from the person and I legitimately overreacted for nothing.  I've lost many important people in my life because of these overreactions.  The weird thing is, I'm at a point where I'm able to logically argue with myself and tell myself that I'm overthinking it, but that feeling of frustration is still there.   I find myself having a hard time enjoying the presence of people I really care about.  How can I better manage this ""feeling""?

38,"So I've been dealing with my depression okay for the past year, with a few ups and downs, but the year before was really bad plus I had a heart surgery. I ended up gaining a ton of weight during that big down period, not to mention during the recovery time; I had been around 140 for years, and I jumped up to 200. My cardiologist also told me I should pick up exercise because of my heart, because I had a valve replacement and now I get winded really easily; I was never really active or in shape, but now it's even worse.

My big problem is every time I try to do even a little bit of regular exercise, that progress with my depression tanks. Hard. I know a lot of people and a lot of studies say that exercise helps with depression, but for some reason even something as simple as scheduling half an hour a day to hop on an elliptical makes me feel awful and I don't know why. When I go to gyms,  I feel like it's my anxiety comparing myself to other more fit people, and my low self esteem and terrible body image gets in the way, but when I'm just alone in my room I don't know why I still feel awful. I don't get that dopamine rush while exercising, or the feeling of success if I keep at it long enough, or anything. I used to walk places a lot, and I would just do that, but it's currently 0 degrees outside and getting colder and I feel like pacing circles around an indoor location would have the same effects.

And now, I realized I'm actually not that nice. I'm impatient and hotheaded, not as fun as I thought, don't like people as much as I used to and, basically, I didn't remember I was a bitter introvert.
It makes me anxious to think that maybe people like the person I was on meds but hate this version of me but hey, that's my business and I'm proud of me for doing so well and getting so far and you should too, no matter where you are now.


Accepting you need help doesn't make you weak. In fact, for some people, taking medication made a big difference in their journey to stop feeling like shit. It's not ""depending on drugs"", it might help you control your emotions so you can approach them more calmly and try to find a way to feel better that works for you. Then, if you're gonna stop taking them, please get help from a psychiatrist, don't just fuck up your doses like I did. 🗿

I particularly feel like taking them saved me from fucking it all up during one of my panic attacks and helped me feel more comfortable with the changes I needed to make in my life.
Do whatever you feel like you need to do but NEVER stop trying to heal yourself. NEVER give up on fighting because sometimes, that's the only thing we got left. There is a way out, it's just different for everyone.",15Jan2020,1
61," I started to hate myself when I was young, really young. I can honestly admit that I don’t remember a time when I was truly happy. Maybe happiness is not for everyone. I am trying honestly, I don’t want to be this way. I hate living this way, but I truly do not know what to do. A great example of what I mean is I currently am sitting at a fantastic Chinese restaurant eating one of my favorite meals as I wright this. Most people would sit here and enjoy their meal if they were alone they may even read a news article or watch the television that is currently playing. Then there is me I sit here and can not focus on anything, the people are really loud, the television won’t stop making repetitive noises as the wheel of fortune is on. There is no reason for it, but this is starting to make my blood boil, controlling my emotions is an ability that I have lost a long time ago and I currently am to the point that I just might start to cry. The voices in my head refuse to stop and I do not know how much longer that I could ignore them. I really want to get help but I do not know how, today I signed up for online counseling as I am just too scared to go see someone in person because my head fights against me. I do not want to feel this way, but I am too a point that I just don’t know what to do anymore. My life has always been this way it wasn’t until I lost her that things took a huge turn to the worst. That is when I Started to feel like I Was losing control of myself, to the point as of late I truly do not know when your taking control of me or its me. I am losing myself, im so scared that I cry at night because I just do not know what to do anymore. I used to drink so much so I could pass out and forget you where there but then that started getting even worse for me then having you there. You started out being nice to me you used to give me encouragement and I kind of started to trust you. I thought maybe this was the part of my head that I was missing. Then I started to see you and I thought I had a roommate until I introduced you to my friends and they could not see you. I was so confused and scared. I was 24 years old and living with an imaginary friend, I had no clue what was going on and I had no one to turn to for help. I started to get used to you and thought you where there for a reason you always where nice and you truly did help me. I miss the old you I was no where near as scared when you where nice to me. I do not know what I did to upset you but you started to get mean to me like really mean to me. You would not stop putting me down, you would even wake me up and make me feel like shit about myself. You where so real to me and I could not escape you.  I have become comfortable with the idea that you will always be there, but I am scared for my own safety, I cant get you to stop you never stop and I cant do this forever. I do not even know if I can do this for another year. I am constantly scared that you are a more then just my head playing tricks with me. I am worried that you are going to actually hurt me one day. I am scared that you are going to hurt the people that I love because you are jalousie of the affection that they show me. I really do not know what you are capable of but I do know that you are capable of controlling my life. I do know that you can have me so scared that I will not leave the house for days on end, I do know that you can convince me to kick people out of my life. I do know that I just cant take it any longer. I do know that I am scared of getting help because you keep t telling me that if I do seek help that they are just going to lock me into a facility. The worst part is I believe you, I let you control me because I hope it gets you to stop, stop being mean to me, stop reminding me that I am useless trust me I already know. I just want you gone I really do, I just want to not hear your voice anymore. I just want to have myself back, I am starting to feel like you are learning to control my body. I feel as if your slowly starting to take over who I am I feel lost and disconnected and I really do not know what to do. The only thing I know is that I am stronger than you and I will beat you. Trust me I have no clue how I am going to and I am terrified I truly am but I will win this. I will defeat you and I will take control of myself once again.  I might not be able to tell you who I need to talk to or what I need to do but I am becoming more and more aware of what your doing to me I really am.",15Jan2020,1

63,"Title pretty much explains it all. I apologize if it makes no sense. 

These past few weeks I’ve had a lot of built up anger, I let it out about a week ago. Not in the healthiest way but letting go of built up frustration really took a huge weight off of my shoulders. Anyway, in the middle of my volleyball practice I just had this sudden/short wave of complete anger and frustration just take over me? I tried deep breathing, relaxing, and telling myself to calm down and that everything would be alright but it didn’t seem to help at all. Not sure if this is normal but I struggle with finding a healthy way to cope with my emotions as I feel my emotions VERY deeply. 

When I get these short bursts of anger I tend to push my loved ones away, I isolate myself, and I sort of develop this short temper? Which results in me taking out my anger on people. I am aware that it’s not right but I snap quite easily when this happens. 

I also get random short bursts of happiness where I feel like everything is perfect and I get very giggly and excited about everything. When this happens, I feel very generous and I kinda just wanna hug everyone. (Which I don’t complain about. Feeling happy feels amazing lol.) Sometimes I tend to get very sad afterwards and therefore confused as I was just happy a few moments ago. 

Is this normal and is there any advice I can consider when this happens to me? Anything is appreciated! Thanks. I am open to answer any questions to clarify things. 

TL;DR: Sudden waves of mainly frustration (and happiness) often take over my body and I have no idea how to control it. I feel emotions deeply and struggle with coping on feeling these deep emotions.",15Jan2020,1

69,"25M My whole life I’ve been depressed and was diagnosed at 11yo. I’ve been on a few different antidepressants all seem to make it worse so I’m a bit reluctant to try something new. The past few years I’ve been dealing with multiple health problems. It started with kidney stones and that may be my worst health problem. Not only is the pain the worst I’ve ever felt in my life but it’s also brought on an anxiety I don’t know I’ll ever get past. Every little pain I get in my back or side (and there’s a lot of them) I can’t help but think “here we go again, another stone” and the panic sets in fast and hard. On top of that, the last 8 months or so I’ve be dealing with severe abdominal and pelvic pain (I have another long post on that) and can’t seem to get it diagnosed. I’ve had a colonoscopy, xrays, ultrasound and nothing. This also comes with anxiety. And now the latest news; last week I was diagnosed with skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma) and was treated yesterday, I think it’s call Mohs surgery. Of course it’s on my face and the scar is about two inches long. I already have practically no self esteem and I understand it’s just a scar and my health is more important but I just can’t help but feel disgusted by myself. I know there are plenty who have it much worse than me but I’m 25 and dealing with all these health problems and I just know the future isn’t looking good. I feel I should also say that I have suicidal thoughts on a daily basis but I haven’t ever tried anything and definitely don’t think I ever could; it’s just something I think about and kind of enjoy thinking about if I’m being honest. I don’t know exactly what I’m looking for, maybe advice if you have some. I’ve felt this way for quite awhile and am usually pretty good at dealing with it but lately, especially with my latest news, I’m beginning to feel I’m about to break.",15Jan2020,1
70,"so i’ve never been professionally diagnosed but i want to know some opinions of what you guys think and what i should do. i’m not sure if it anything serious but it’s been weighing me down lately as a whole bunch of stuff related to depression has resurfaced around me concerning friends and their mental health. we all have our problems and here’s mine. 

i’ve never known what to call it so I figured it was probably nothing. sometimes I get really worked up over nothing for awhile but then im fine for a while and then it happens again. I think nobody would really care if I just suddenly disappear, I mean when I’m gone for a day or two at school nobody seems to notice and just go on with their daily lives. sometimes i cry a bit and other times a lot so it’s kinda just happens on a random basis. i’ve tried self harm but with flimsy and really thin blades it doesn’t really do much, they only been like paper-cuts really. it doesn’t really scare me even with the thoughts of a bigger better blade. feelings of sadness and loneliness kinda just spring upon me at random and I’m not sure why most of the times. I’ve been thinking of trying to get into self harm to see if it helps anything but to do that I’d have to go to the store and buy a proper blade and I really don’t feel like doing much anymore. after school I have little to no energy and just want to sleep and I know for a fact that I’ve been getting my recommended amount of sleep and sometimes even more, and these naps can last multiple hours. I don’t want to say I have mental issues because I don’t know if I do but even if I did I would feel like a copy cat since some of my friends do.

so what do you guys think? what should I do?",15Jan2020,1
71,"I dont know where to start. I've been living overseas for almost 4 years (english is not my native language and pardon me for any mistakes that I make) and have been trying my luck to apply permanent residence (PR). the process is getting more and more demanding, and doors are closed one by one, to the point that its not possible for me to get PR. this burdens me a lot for the past 2 years. going back to my home country is the last thing I wanna do, because being a minority in a country where the conservatives are growing bigger is not ideal. religion and race tolerance is something that they have chucked out to some extent. I'm currently considering to migrate to another country with a chance of PR. I've spent a fortune for PR, and sacrifice everything at all cost for it. 

Work also gets more demanding. the company has just been acquired by another company, thus new upper management employees are coming in, bringing new responsibilities for us. management wise, this company is not doing the best, so the old employees start to leave us. 

to put the cherry on top, I have a medical condition which barricades me from eating like a normal people do. it has been 4 years. I need to see functional medicine practitioner once in every fortnight and it costs an arm and a leg. I used to eat something that I like when in stress, but it seems impossible now because of this issue.

74,"My entire life I have had what I can only explain as ""silent thoughts,"" where I don't have any kind of words behind my thoughts. When I'm doing tasks I just do them without any internal dialogue. 

Recently, however, I began talking to myself gradually, and it's getting worse. I started with internal dialogue when doing things like math, telling myself each step in my head. I didn't really pay any attention to it because I know this is normal to most. But then I started speaking my internal thoughts. When doing the dishes, for example, I'd say things like ""white plate goes there, then the cup goes here"" or things like that. This is where I began to pay lots of attention to what I'm saying, because I have never really talked to myself or spoken out loud when I'm not in the presence of any people or animals. About a week ago, it got worse. I'm now narrating many of my internal thoughts. I was walking around my campus looking for a building, and almost every ten seconds it was ""no... That's not right"" ""I can't find this street, maybe I should pull up Google maps"" ""found it! Finally! Now to find the room."" When I drive I make up conversations like ""should I go to the grocery store?"" ""Yup, we need eggs, bread, and milk. Let's stop real quick.""

75,"So while I would generally describe myself as a relatively happy and healthy person, I have throughout my life struggled with self-harm; this has included major stuff like cutting and hitting, and minor stuff like wearing inadequate clothes for the weather, skipping meals despite hunger, and seeking out risky situations like by flirting with creeps (even when I was a minor, \*sigh\*). The thing is, other then stuff associated with gender dysphoria (I'm trans), I don't really have any symptoms associated with common mental disorders other then self-harm itself, like I still find enjoyment in my daily life, I am not at all anxious about normal things, I don't have compulsions, I haven't experienced any significant trauma (outside of the consequences of some of my self harm), like the only abnormal aspects of psychology seem to be my self-harm behavior and me being trans. What confuses is when researching self-harm all the information I found seems to view it as a the result of some more fundamental underlying problem, and when I have tried to get therapy for self-harm, my therapists have seemingly always tried to find the secret cause of my self-harm rather then just helping me end the behavior, but I don't think such a cause exists for me, like my problem has always simply been my desire to hurt myself (or sometimes just comfort with not caring for myself), it hasn't been more complicated then that.

77,"Hello, hoping to get some new perspectives on whatever the hell is wrong with me.

For 4 years I have dreamt every time I sleep, without fail, and it's never fun. Often quite stressful and disturbing most of the time. 

I have been to the doctors about this. Reddit is a last ditch effort. Every time I saw a GP it resulted in being sent to a cognitive behavioural therapist, who also doesn't have the foggiest clue what to do. At least I haven't had to pay! 🇬🇧

While some dreams have loose reoccurring themes, I highly doubt these are night terrors. My dreams aren't consistent in terms of narrative (if any) and can range from nonsensical grotesque imagery and sensations, to being highly convincing depictions of my real life. The more realistic dreams often give me false memories, which is a whole other pain in the ass.

I have no idea how to deconstruct something this complex cohesively, so have some disjointed paragraphs:

- I cannot lucid dream. I can be aware I'm dreaming but cannot control anything other than myself. I can wish all I like for something to happen, but it wont. 

- When I realise I'm dreaming, my brain does something I've named a ""jump-cut"" where the scenario suddenly changes and all memories before the cut are erased and replaced with new ones that give me a reason to believe whatever is happening in the new scenario is real.

- I can feel pain in my dreams. Boy do I feel it. Sensations that aren't physically possible as well. An example being your gums suddenly swelling so strongly that they shatter your teeth into bits you have to spit out to avoid cutting your mouth or swallowing them) 

- A reoccurring theme where family members molest or make inappropriate advances on me. This has never happened to me in real life and I know for a fact that none of them would ever do something like that. Makes me sick to my stomach.

- The only connection I can make between most dreams is that I usually have some form of responsibility that I'm desperately trying to fore-fill, but I lack control over the situation and I'm often subjected to lots of stressful things in the process. 

- Because the dreams are so bloody long and I spend a lot of time sleeping (I currently have 0 control over my sleep cycle thanks to horrid chronic pain that keeps me awake and also exhausts me at the same time) I experience more time in a world of fiction which has only a negative impact on me as a whole, than reality. I probably shouldn't have to tell y'all how shitty that is. 

I've tried lots of shit to try and get this to change, but nothing ever makes a difference. I do have physical health issues (getting checked out by multiple doctors for multiple things atm, so I can't confirm exactly what I have). If anyone can relate, or has any ideas I'd love to hear them. 

There's a ton of other intricacies and details I've left out, so I can go in to it a lot more if people want me to. Just trying to keep the original post short, or else I'd be writing a whole biography about it.

82,"Beware. Vent post incoming
So yesterday me and all of my class had a party because that day we did the first part for our finals. We had to write 15 pages on a specific theme and on that day we had to turn the paper in. So to celebrate it we decided as I said to throw a party.

I was excited for it all day long. I even went and bought new clothes and stuff to look good. I really hoped that maybe today's the day where I can maybe flirt with someone or make out with someone so I really prepared for the party.

But as usual. I talked a lot to people but I couldn't drink because I had to drive. So the party came to the point where everyone had danced and had fun while sober me was sitting there too sober to dance, browsing reddit. I don't even blame my friends why would I. Every now and then someone came up to me and grabbed my hand to dance but I was too afraid of it. I even declined the offer from the girl I like that's how uncomfortable dancing was for me. I then went to the bathroom and couldn't resist hitting myself in the face. I hated myself so bad. 

As you can probably already tell there was no flirting and also no making out so lonely ass me drove home late at night.  While driving I really thought about what I did today. I bought all that stuff spent an hour or two in the bathroom and was just simply hopeful that today is the day. all that for as usual nothing. And I found it funny. I apparently found it really funny that I was so hopeful cause I just laughed. I laughed really really hard until the laughing slowly transformed to crying then to laughing again and back to crying. After a while that cycle stopped and I just couldn't breathe anymore. I breathed really fast and unusual just like in a panic attack. But all of that stopped too suddenly. No crying, no laughing... Just plain emotionlessnes. I did not feel ANYTHING that moment. Everything was suddenly gone and away. So I held the steering wheel straight. I saw that there was a turn coming up but I held it straight, ready to smash into the tree that was there. I drove until I got In the opposite lane when I ""woke"" up again. That was the moment I realized what I was about to do and turned the steering wheel back over again. I was seriously shocked. I really was about to kill myself.

83,"I have like 1000 thoughts. I will be writing what I will be thinking as fast as it's possible, without analyzing anthing. I will not focus on grammar, and I will probably do 1000 mistakes, and I will be thinking later like, I have written so much crap, but.... What's more, english is my second language.

I think like I have discovered something very important about myself. My whole life I was thinking I have psychopathic traits, but actually manic episodes have symptoms of: inflated self-esteem or grandiosity, increase in goal-directed activity, charm, confidence, idealizing people, lack of empathy etc. I can just make fun of people when they are in need. I have like 1000 thoughts rn and plenty of ideas. I am writing so fast rn. Being kinda bipolar makes much more sense than being psychopathic. I've never thought I am psychopathic. I am feeling so great rn, I feel like I am awesome and super confident.

“Stimulants can trigger mania and should be avoided,” Fiedorowicz says. “Caffeine is an underappreciated trigger and can also impair sleep,” and sleep deprivation is a notorioustrigger for bipolar mood swings and mania, he says.

Omg yes, I realized distrubed sleeping patterns can induce this state. I was sleeping much less recently on purpose, and after some time I realized I was feeling much better. I didnt want to sleep, I started listening loud music and dancing. Generally speaking I am feeling much better when I sleep less. I realized that most of my life I was focused on trigger this state. I was calling this need for stimulation, I knew after certain things I could be extremely happy. My triggers: stressful situations, adrenaline rushes, strong interest in something, extremely good circumstances, and recently I discovered sleeping less can induce this state.

Yes, so it makes much more sense. I feel like I understand myself more. I feel like it's more like bipolar2, it's not so severe to induce depression or full blown mania. I thought, I dont have this, because I thought people with bipolar these states changeable without triggers. But I've found out they have triggers as well. And I always had some type of triggers too, I was not aware immediately what triggers these wonderful episodes.

I wonder what is so bad about manic episodes, it feels so good. They say, its better to avoid these things, but I am trying to induce them as often as it's possible. I can admit, there are bad things about this tho, for example I can't focus on things, I am dancing and I am unproductive. I've been ""sitting dancing"" for many hours. I am listening music on the full volume. I am writing so much, because I have so much energy to write these things. 

So yeah, there are negatives about it. Also I am overusing my body in these states, because I dont want to sleep, and it's kinda normal to stay awake for 24 hours+, I have a lot  motivation to do things. I know it's mumbling, but I am trying to write as much what come to my mind. It will be very interesting to see what I was writing about later. Now I am thinking, like I dont have much to write. 

I think, its awesome, because I realized I can trigger this state more often by disturbed sleeping patterns. I know sleeping less is unhealthy to my body, but I just feel awesome. I think in addition with coffee, it will be very cool. Of course I will not be constantly like that, so sooner or later, I will be too tired, and my body will want to rest. So I will be sleeping then.

Omg, I have found so cool music rn, I will be listening for hours rn. Omg I fucking love thatm, sdFsdfsdsdffsdsdffsdsdf. I want to write much faster, than I am able to. 

 am feeling so good right now. I am drinking 3rd coffee after a long break, and it's so awesome. I am sure I will be awake for 24h+. Fuck this stupid sleep, I will not think about it, because I am feeling sooo good rn. I will never go sleep again haha, of course I am kidding. Ok time to dance. I dont care if I have bipolar 2 or something. I just know I have figured out how to induce better mood more often. I know, I am unproductive and I am wasting my time for listening loud music and dancing, but I am so fucking happy and I fuck this shit.

I have found new tracks. I want to listen them for hours. I was never writing so fast in my whole life. What's more, english is my second language, so it's not easy to express everything that fast. I want to hear music more louder, but it's on full volume already, and I cant listen louder. I am happy, everythings seems to be good. So yeah, I think, I expressed myself. But writing gives me so much pleasure, so I want to write more and more. Thinking is very cool. Breathing is cool.

I feel like I can write total crap, but I dont care. Even if I will write one sentence that can change my life, its worth it. But I don't care at this point, because I just want to write something, in meantime I enjoy listen good, cool music. I have so much thoughts going through my mind, I feel like I can write for hours. 

Most of the time, I was not serious, when I was saying my ""manic episodes"", but from wikipedia: Hypnomania:

* [pressured speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressured_speech)
* inflated [self-esteem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-esteem) or [grandiosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandiosity)
* decreased need for sleep
* [flight of ideas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_psychiatry#F) or the subjective experience that thoughts are racing
* easily distracted
* increase in goal-directed activity (e.g., social activity, at work, or [hypersexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersexuality)), or [psychomotor agitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychomotor_agitation)
* involvement in pleasurable activities that may have a high potential for negative psycho-social or physical consequences (e.g., the person engages in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, reckless driving, physical and verbal conflicts, foolish business investments, quitting a job to pursue some grandiose goal, etc)

I have all symptoms for 100%, maybe - the last one. So clearly I can have the hypmnomanic episode. But I dont know, maybe its simple euphoria, because recently everything seems to be good for me. So I am not sure about this all. But whatever. I just know I like these things. 

But maybe I have full blown mania, lets see symptoms. 

""To be classed as a manic episode, while the disturbed mood and an increase in goal directed activity or energy is present at least three (or four if only irritability is present) of the following must have been consistently present:

1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.
2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after 3 hours of sleep).
3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.
4. [Flights of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_thoughts).
5. Increase in goal directed activity, or psychomotor acceleration.
6. Distractibility (too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli).
7. Excessive involvement in activities with a high likelihood of painful consequences.(e.g., extravagant shopping, improbable commercial schemes, [hypersexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersexuality)).[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mania#cite_note-DSMIV-15)

I have all symptoms. It's sick, so it means I have this for real??? WTF, it's impossible. I dont have depression, maybe I am too apathetic at times, but everyone is apathetic from time to time. But tbh, hm...  I dont know. 

I dont care about this shit, I've never had depression. I can only feel good thanks to euphoria from time to time, and that's it. Euphoric state can be very similar to that. Also in the past I was thinking, I had NPD, but inflated self-esteem, it's a sign of this state. I always knew, I am not NPD. I don't care about some stupid supply.

Making breaks from coffee is very good. It triggers these plesant vibes. Okay, I got bored. Enough of writing. I want to focus on music and other things. I dont even care what I was writing. I doubt I have some type of bipolar, because my episodes dont last so long. I am tired a bit of dancing that much.",15Jan2020,1
84,"a couple years off i tried to commit not alive, and got treatment, some pills and eventually my depression stopped being constant and transformed into something that comes and go during the day but even now, with a good place, gf and friends i have the thought of offing myself. i dont need to be in my depression attack (that's what i call them) like i could be laughing or cooking and id just go into suicidal mode, and its not a what if i drive into a wall sorta thing, its a ""i really want to die and nothing will remember me"" i reilize people will remember me and miss me but i always have those thoughts, and sometimes even casually looking at things will provoke thoughts of killing myself and idek if thats ok anymore.

85," 

I'm a 21 yr old Male who has pretty bad self esteem when it comes to my looks and when it comes to things i'm not good at. I have many things I consider problems and i'm going to address them below.

**1.** I get depressed after a certain amount of time when I start to feel like I can't become good enough. I have a thing for wanting to be in the top 1% of whatever I'm currently doing. For example, I play a lot of video games competitively and when I reach the top 1% of the ranking latter in those games I feel a little better about myself. For a while... that happiness fades usually.

Another example of my competitive drive that sometimes drives me to be depressed is when I used to play sports. When I was 15 just entering high school, I've never played a sport seriously before. I played baseball and I had fun at first but as I was playing everyday I had unrealistic expectations out of myself which drove me to break down mentally and just never play the sport again because I feared I would never become a MLB player or play in the minors so I just dropped the sport completely. I don't necessarily regret it but it just annoys me that I can't have fun at most things besides watching T.V/Movies. It makes me pretty sad that I can't connect with a lot of people. There's a few I connect with but the problem is there like me which I don't believe is a good thing.

The only things I have fun at is when I know i'm one the best at the curtain activity that i'm doing. Which I believe is a terrible way to live if the only way you can have true fun is being the best at whatever you're trying to do. I also almost always envy the people that are better than me at whatever I'm doing. This for me goes for everything in life, such as there better looking than me (Or if I think they are), better than me at a sport, better than me at cooking, and the list goes on. Now I don't necessarily always envy people who are better than me at everything. It depends on the activity or subject I'm trying to be the best at. Right now i'm trying to improve my looks to become great looking. So whenever I see people I believe are hotter than me I just get annoyed/sad/almost an anger because I know there better than me. This goes for guys and girls, doesn't matter. If I think a girl is better looking than me I just get annoyed, I don't get attracted, horny, or pleased by the aesthetics which I find abnormal for me.

Now I understand that you can improve your looks to a point but I realized that I can become great looking by:

1. Getting to a body fat percentage between 8-13% body fat with the sufficient muscle mass. I also believe my insertions are good enough to be aesthetically pleasing (At least I hope). I made my own plan to gain muscle mass by following my routine to go to the gym on a Push/Pull/Leg split. Also by eating enough protein for my body weight and doing every exercise I can at great intensity while also having correct form.
2. Skin care, I have pretty decent skin but I'm improving it everyday with the proper materials.
3. Getting clothes that are stylish + fit my body very well.
4. Whitening my teeth to a point where there white like the fitness models/models for males.
5. Just having great hygiene in general.

I also am only trying to become hot so I can get laid a lot more easier on apps such as tinder/bumble. I did tests on what kind of numbers (Matches with responses) models can pull and the numbers are staggering so I don't want anyone telling me looks don't matter if your just trying to get laid with the hottest women available on those apps.

Honestly I just want to feel like I can wake up in the morning and not have to think about how I'm going to fuck hot women and how I'm going to be the best at something. I also have a sex addiction to wanting to bang hot girls consistently off of only tinder/bumble. I don't blame the women/girls that are very hot for not wanting to bang me yet because I know for a fact I don't have the muscle mass nor the right pictures for tinder/bumble yet to be considered hot on the app. As for real life goes, I see girls/guys that I think are hot but I envy them because that have what I want which is to be hot.

It just sucks that I go through this cycle a lot of trying to be the best and trying to be great looking so I can get sex a lot easier. I'm not going to go through the hassle of getting rejected by hot girls consistently to only fuck one once a month if I can even do that! I don't believe in changing my personality because I believe people who change there personality to only fuck hot girls are disgusting. I'd rather improve my aesthetics to do that because I believe it's more morally acceptable to me.

These are my main issues and I have no idea how to go about them. I'm just hoping someone knows the disorder that I have. I'm not sure if I'm just a sociopath which I don't think I am because I still have somee feelings for people. I just want to feel better in the mornings and not feel like shit when I see hot girls/guys. I'm a guy and hot girls make me feel even worse than hot guys. It just makes me feel bad because I'm not sure if I even will accomplish this goal of being hot. It's possible I still won't be hot with the added muscle mass/other things combined.

I also feel like a terrible person because of my view points. I just wish I could be more normal. How do I let go of my competitive drive? Or just let go of wanting to fuck every hot girl I see on tinder or in real life, I mean In the back of my head I envy them a lot but I would still want to do them. How do I not feel bad about myself for other people just being better? I think about how I'm going to improve my workout every morning and every night. I just want to think of other things beside my goals because it makes me pretty depressed thinking about not being able to live up to the standards that I have.

If someone has experienced this behavior before please share it. I've looked over the internet and haven't found anyone with similar qualities to this. Sorry if some of you think these qualities are disgusting, but I have no one else I want to share it with.",15Jan2020,1
86,"Ok so this is so extremely wierd and I don't know what is going on. I find that sometimes I find a diary entry of mine (I don't have a real diary, I just sometimes write down my thoughts) or a text message to a friend or something like that. I recall writing them. I recall the emotion. But for some reason it seems like complete nonsense to me. Even right now I am having this sensation. Monday I had a talk with a friend of mine. I told him that I felt as though I was made of lead and no matter how much strength I put into it, I cannot do anything. Today I think back and I think ""Why did I say that, this isn't true. I feel pretty normal right now."". I have scars on my thighs and forearm and I think ""why would I cut myself, I'm not that anxious."" I know the immeasurable amount of anxiety, self hate or dispair I felt while I did it, but it doesn't make sense. Yesterday was split in twain as one half of the day I recall being numb. I didn't interact with anyone properly I was too invested in my own thoughts. But that doesn't make sense since I am very talkative. I remember craving the numbness and clarity that alcohol provides yet I am not addicted. I have been to one therapist and they told me that they where utterly shocked at what I had to say and another told me that it's all part of growing up. That especially made me question everything. I am at such a loss. I am feeling genuinely okay right now. Just another day. But I know that I have said and done these nonsensical things. So I guess I will just keep telling anonymous people about this until something happenes. Because apparently they are just as useful as ""professionals"". Or maybe I'm just that nut that tries to excuse himself with muh mental health idk.",15Jan2020,1

89,"I had a huge wake up call. Me and my bf had a long discussion about how negative and mentally exhausting I am to travel with, even just day trips. I very diligently work on my mental health, practice mindfulness, etc. I grew up in a toxic household and have depression, severe anxiety,  basically nonexistent self esteem and I suspect a small degree of narcissism. This has always been true, but I used to enjoy and love travel so much. My mental health took a sharp decline 3 years ago (for reasons I still haven't been able to identify, because my living situation and everything all-in-all got massively better than it has ever been). I've been with my bf for the past 2.5. We're engaged. 

I used to love traveling.  I would find any way possible to get myself on a trip, and greatly enjoyed them with no negativity. Now I find myself just having a horrible time. My bf backpacked across the world not long before we met and has been to 35\~40 something countries. He obviously loves travel, it's his life.

We've been on a number of trips together, both domestic and abroad and he sat me down and was very honest with me - said he hasn't enjoyed a single trip with me, every single one has been a negative experience for him which I wasn't surprised to hear.

Nowadays when I travel I chronically complain, I get physically exhausted so quickly/easily and can't really do much (literally I'm ready to turn in within 3 hours of being out), I get stressed out by small things and overall it's just a horrible time. Even if it's a destination I dreamed of going to for years. I'm baffled by this because I wasn't like this before and I can't identify what would suddenly make me like this.

I really try to be mindful, in the moment, practice gratitude and remain aware of how I'm reacting to things, at least out loud, but nothing seems to really work. 

I'm so sick of this. If anyone has any input or has been through a similar thing and found ways to improve it, I'd love to hear below. Thanks ahead of time for your comments.",15Jan2020,1

I've heard this can happen due to testosterone but I'm female so that doesn't make sense. I guess it makes sense that as everyone gets older they find it more difficult to cry because that's why children cry all the time and adults dont. 

But this inability to cry is making it really hard to deal with things. Often when I find I cant cry, I'll start writing about my feelings and after doing that I'll cry and after crying it feels much much better. But sometimes I just can't make myself cry.

109,"In the last few years I've noticed my gf's personality changing. She's starting to have blowups out of nowhere, like we are laughing and talking about random stuff and she will get triggered and go into a bout of anger or depression, followed by her doing what I call 'ramping herself up'. When ramping, regardless of whether I respond or stay silent, she will start to get this strange creepy look/smile on her face, then get more and more aggressive and angry, talking herself into a frenzy. Once she hits a peak she will start saying incredibly hurtful things, saying I don't love her, bringing random past things up, saying nasty stuff about friends and family etc. It's like she flips a switch into another person I don't know.

Queue present day. She had an episode that culminated with me being silent and her ramping up to telling me she hates me, then launching into verbal attacks aimed at what I'd call my triggers (actions and words she knows will get under my skin to hurt me). She kept at it until I finally snapped, and told her I'd had enough. I wanted to end things bc I didn't want to continue being treated like this. Then I started repeating to her the things she had just said to me. I could see her expression and body language melt away as I was talking, like changing from one person into another. 

On to the reason I think she might have MPD. She started denying each thing I told her she'd said. After a few minutes of this, she started to break down crying. Then she told me (she's never said this before and we've been together for 8 years) that over the last few years she has been more and more unable to remember things that happen when she's angry when she's happy, and can't remember happy things when she's angry, and has been unable to remember lots of things like what she's had for breakfast etc. She told me that she honestly thinks what I tell her she's just said to me is a lie, and that she really can't remember anything that she was screaming at me half an hour before, like it's a total blank in her memory. 

I don't know if she's saying all that to excuse her actions, or if she's really going crazy and has something like MPD that needs to be treated. I told her I wanted to record everything said between us for a couple days to play things back to her so she can hear them herself, and that I want to go with her to see professional help later this week when I can get her an appointment.

Where should I go from here? The way I see it, I'm looking at two outcomes: One, my gf is making it all up which is kinda crazy, OR Two, my gf is telling the truth which means she has legit mental issues that require professional treatment. Either way, I put a pin in processing my emotions about last night and whether I'm ending things until I can see a professional about it and go from there.

tl;dr My gf told me that she has no memory of times that's she angry, or many other things she's done, and that it's been happening more and more frequently.",15Jan2020,1

I have this picture in my head whenever it happens of whatever it is just stopping, falling without a sound, maybe they fall apart, but it would probably be like a switch that just turns off.

Here is a list of what I do everyday and on a weekly basis that has helped me limit my mental health to near enough inexistent. 

Disclosure, these are not cures. They are things that can help, mental health needs constant work and consistency, the journey doesn’t ever end. It’s a constant battle. 

I also want to add, I know a lot of people dealing with mental health and you try to help them and they come back saying what you said didn’t work. They act victorious! Deep down they don’t want to find something that’s truly works. 

You have to give everything your best and actually want to change. That’s the most important thing. 

This is not in any sort of order. They are all equally important and valuable. 


1, Vega-Test Therapy (Bach Remedies) 
2, Cold Showers 
3, Daily meditation 
4, Psychedelic micro-dosing &amp; CBD (not THC) 
5, Healthy diet 
6, Running/exercise 2/3 times a week 
7, NoFap
8, Being honest with people about how you feel. 
9, Journaling/daily diary 
10, Schedule each day 
11, 8 hours minimum of sleep. 
12, Cutting down on social media use. 


You will still have bad days but this is how I cut those days down from 20 - 25 days a month to 2/3 

Some on this list might be controversial but I’m not encouraging I’m providing information. Go do your research. There’s a lot of science behind everything I’ve listed that goes hand in hand with mental health.

114,"I’m writing a book based off of someone deciding since I fall in the millennial category that I’m unable to handle things, and that since I have no military experience can’t have ptsd. Literally had a therapy session, the first ever I was so excited 13 year to late. Like 12 hours before and. I felt peace? Idk how to describe it but when I clocked in yeah. 14 hours away, over 165 miles. Atlanta traffic. Definitely not “I’ll make absolutely sure you make the appointment no worries.” 
If I told y’all a positive to the easy way is, blank, I’m not saying it because I’m not holding responsibility if your going through a bad time instead comment. Message me. 
Realizing this scared me. What made me leave the company all together is I understood the evil. What drives someone to become an active shooter in school, it never got that bad but at 25. The best company ever like really the managers are the only negative. If This didn’t happen I’d be there. But being there and their discrimination man. They have no idea what happened. I told the only person today I actually admitted I had been molested, but I don’t know how many times. I know one yeah. But I just know I felt uncomfortable in another with someone else. It is who you don’t expect sadly. 2 out of the acceptable zero is science. 
I’ll tell anyone who reads this today, there’s so much guilt because I feel responsible at 12 years old for two people deaths. Broken back in someone I had to help move, I wasn’t very strong just fat. And the other, had the look on the face like he had given up. I replaced their son, who drunk driving stole. But when it came to the end I can’t recall the last time I saw my dad alive. And the state alone I found him in for some reason despite the ambulance and fire trucks, my grandma whom was chief of police, I felt like he could wake up. And well it didn’t help me and gran stood not even 5 feet from him. And they didn’t cover him up. And yeah y’all 

Please understand I still haven’t talked to anyone at the time of writing this. I’m not going to regret hurting those I care about by me making a rash decision. But I was so close to me not hurting myself with all this shit I have not been able to answer, or come up with a reason and accept it. I want to move on. Stop being freaked out when I’m suppose to freak out and show compassion I literally just said my mental health is not okay. 3 years I’ve tried. And now I feel farther than ever and it’s literally another job with insurance. Not hard for a truck driver. But I’m . Taking a breath. Because this was by meant to be this long. 


IF YOU SKIPPED HERE
The books topic is from an active shooters perspective, which the happy ending is the pain he’s been dealing with ending for the second time since he was 12 hours from it. AND the person truly responsible is face to face, the last one. He hears what he went through, how his family never asked about if he’s okay. The time he lost control and cried reentering the home and his mother Yells and bitches at him “why you crying like that damn attention seekin your embarrassing me crying like that.” 

Parents, NO, bad. Don’t do this, ever. Okay? Okay.
No more of the book because spoilers. 

Anyway, it’s exactly the opposite of how I reacted. I’m not evil, I’m the nicest most pushover  guy alive. So if I say I can understand what would drive it, the way I paint imagery when I actually try and write, pulling emotion from using the correct synonym, and resonating tone. I can really have the reader understanding that they’re not crazy, they’re driven crazy in atleast most cases. Compassion is humanity, but humanity is so afraid to show compassion. Yet it’s so simple. In many cases that’s all it takes. I’ve been thrust through many moments, I don’t know why I’m attracting them but they won’t beat me.

Instead I want to use them to try and get some good. Eventually I’ll get a therapist. Eventually I know. If I can save someone who may be put in that situation, or forced into that situation of hurting others, then I will be able to say I’m okay with anything in life. Because this wasn’t school. I’m 25 and was bullied into this at a great job, by practically the whole warehouse and I did what I was told, and made my money and went home. No extra because I was fixed on therapy and insurance. Then my great granddad beat alshymers and I can’t do math very well. 10 days, not 33. Lol insurance right there. But nope bad math is over a month away and I couldn’t even simply tell my boss I needed another grievance day. I had to panic attack it to him.

I’ll keep y’all posted on the book, I feel like if I do it right maybe it will do something. Stop ignoring how you feel, it will build up. I promise. You can’t keep it down forever. I tried. Now I’m making it or nahhhhh YEEEEET",15Jan2020,1

Last night, during an hour-long completely one-sided tirade, my mother screamed that when I kill myself, not to do it in the house, because she didn't want to deal with the mess.

I was already building the resolve to commit suicide throughout her rant. I got hit with the typical ""you're not depressed, you're lazy"", and all the related tropes about how my situation is all my fault and anything she's doing is just in response to me ""hurting"" her by existing.

I've posted about my situation here before, and to be honest I'm extremely surprised I made it this long. But when my own mother's response to knowing I am suicidal is to tell me not to get the carpets dirty, I'm feeling like it's time to cash out.",15Jan2020,1
117,"I’m 17F and live in the UK. For as long as I can remember I (mostly) haven’t felt anything. Sometimes I get feelings of sadness and oddly enough despair and a few hours later I’ll be happy, only for things to fall back in place to feeling nothing (It’s nothing extreme like how bipolar is described, so that’s ruled out). 

The last time I really felt something was when I first got with my current boyfriend of over a year ago but sadly enough that excitement and love died down and now I just don’t know how to feel. I do want to feel like that again and be happy and have my sad times and to actually have variation in my life. 

I can’t be pretty reckless sometimes too such as this most recent New Years. I went to a family friends house for a party and I got extremely drunk (more than anyone else) and this has happened before on multiple occasions but that could just be underage me taking advantage of the holidays. 

I do get pretty anxious and irritable sometimes and I’ve noticed that it causes a lot of arguments. I don’t really go outside of the house (or even my room) that often unless it’s for college or maybe if I’m included in a planned meet-up with my friends so I guess I do isolate myself quite a bit. 

I feel like whatever it is clouds the way I think; I seemingly can’t think straight all the time or make decisions for myself and end up just mindlessly scrolling through reddit or staring at a wall. Even now I’m struggling to come up with how to describe what’s going on so any questions to point me in the right direction are welcome. 

I know someone is going to tell me to see a doctor but my local GP will only refer me off to someplace I can’t get to without asking for a ride from my parents (I can’t drive yet and I still live with my parents) and that includes telling them which I’d prefer not to; I’ve never had that close of a relationship with them so it’s best to avoid the awkwardness. 
In fact I’m very awkward anyway. I did once go to the doctors and got referred to camhs (during a pretty bad time and my family found out) but I got dismissed almost instantly because I just can’t seem to talk about myself as if it’s serious. I’m very good at hiding and masking things so anyone I know probably has no clue about me.

Another point to add is that I used to self harm (to be specific it was cutting my arms) a few years back and haven’t done it for 3 years now. The point is that I’ve never really been emotionally stable (even in childhood I remember having disturbed thoughts and I guess things were always pretty unstable in the household; things are better now) but now I don’t even have that because I don’t have any emotions to be unstable. 

I do miss having a variety of emotions even though strangely enough I can’t really remember what that feels like. 

Sorry if I’ve been really vague and haven’t given enough details but I’m always open to give more if needed.",15Jan2020,1
118,"Good morning, Reddit!

Not quite sure how to start this so I'm going to provide a summary of my relatively recent medical history and go from there. I've always been overweight, except for a brief period in my early teens -- I think that's probably significant and should be mentioned. Entered the realm of obesity in college, fought my way back to overweight, and have been oscillating back and forth between the two ever since. About five years ago, I started to experience symptoms of major depressive disorder. This went undiagnosed for about another two years -- I figured at the time it was SAD or similar. In March of 2016 I had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery due to severe gall stones. I've had recurring stomach attacks since then -- Possibly due to Sphincter of Oddi disorder, but it's undiagnosed. Had several bloodwork panels and MRI's to diagnose the problem, and nothing was coming up. Had a doctor specializing in lower abdomen pain suggest Sphincter of Oddi as a fairly common disorder occurring after the removal of the gallbladder. Haven't been able to afford to follow up any further as of now. In the summer of 2017, I started seeing a psychologist who diagnosed me with major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder (unspecified), morbid obesity, binge eating disorder (Man, this is fun to write.), and of course, chronic abdominal pain. After working with the psychologist for about three months with little to no progress, I moved in to the medication side of depression management. Started with SSRI's -- Fluoxetine, moved to Trazodone, then had a prescription for an SNRI that I can't remember the name of for a while, did some mixed dosages between another SSRI and Bupropion, moved to just Bupropion, and as of now have discontinued all antidepressants. They have so far served to amplify the oscillation of my mood, without alleviating the problem in any way. The one medication I've found that has helped to some degree is Vyvanse -- Not an antidepressant, but a stimulant has helped to some extent with binge eating and helped a great deal with focusing at work and having the energy to get moving in the morning. I don't have the money to continue with ineffective treatments at the moment -- I know the process is slow and it's all about finding the right combination for my body, but I've been working at it for over two years now and I'm more depressed than I was when I started. Today is one of those rare days where I woke up with the energy to at least reach out for help, so I figured I'd start here.

A couple of things to note -- I'm 29 years old, turning 30 this year. I have a steady job, and have had one for the last two years. Prior to that I was in college. I've dropped out of college in the short term, as my mental health was having a serious impact on my grades. I'm nearly finished with my degree and intend to return once I have this under control enough to be able to function. (I was a physics major in my last year, if that's relevant.) I come from a family that was upper lower class -- We always had food, but sometimes it was the same soup for a week. Some history of emotional abuse, nothing that was all that terrible compared to what some people go through. I've got a stable and fairly happy relationship with both parents and my sibling at this point. I'm in a long term relationship, been dating the same person for about two and a half years now. She's the one who encouraged me to see a psychologist originally, and has been an absolute pillar of support.

I know losing weight would have a significant impact on my mental health. I've been absolutely unable to make myself go to the gym, or even do exercises at home. This hasn't always been true -- I ran daily for years (1-2 miles, occasionally a 10k) and two years ago, a friend and I went to the gym three times a week every week for six months and were making substantial progress. He and I were roommates at the time, and when he moved in with his wife (And my dog died at around the same time) our gym habit fell apart. So I'm not unfamiliar with exercising, or routine. I just can't summon up the energy or effort to start. I'm aware that my current path is very self destructive -- My job is sedentary (I work in IT providing remote support) and the only time I leave my house these days is when I absolutely have to for groceries or once a week to hang out with the same friend from before. I'm obese, and approaching an age where that will start to have a compound effect on my health. I can't bring myself to care, however -- I'm not actively suicidal, but the thought of no longer existing is relieving rather than worrying.

A part of my issue right now I believe is an absolute sense of isolation. I have one friend whom I still see with any regularity, and every other friend I made in college moved away and fell out of contact. I see my partner on weekends, but she works nights and I work days, so we're on opposite sleeping schedules. I have the same issue summoning the energy to go out and form new friend groups that I do with going to the gym -- I'm introverted by nature and that requires a fairly large investment of energy that I don't know how to bring to bear at the moment.

This has been a fairly rambling and wandering post to get around to this: Do you have any advice on where to go next for help? I don't WANT to hate my life. I want to be happy again. I just can't seem to figure out how to get there. If there are any medications you would recommend, or specialists, I'd be happy to look into anything I can. I just can't afford to continue with a therapy path that hasn't provided any results in two years. I looked through the FAQ and didn't see much outside of what I've looked into when I first started down the clinical path, so I figured a post might help.

Thanks for your time, and sorry again for the state of the post. Having a devil of a time organizing all of this into something coherent.",15Jan2020,1
119,"I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder by my psychiatrist about 12 years ago after being referred to him by my therapist I was seeing for a few months first. I had started going to therapy because I felt isolated and depressed after moving back home with my parents after living with friends, so that I could afford pre-Med courses. I was also having mild suicidal thoughts due to my constant low grade anxiety which caused depression. 

I ended up taking generic Zoloft and I remember the feeling on the first day of taking it was like the sun had come out for the first time in months and I was able to breathe without a weight on my chest. It was honestly a great feeling and the medication REALLY worked for me. That year I made a lot of new friends, met my future wife, and excelled at work. After about a year my doctor and I decided to wean me off of the pills because we had originally discussed not wanting to be on them forever. 

I’m now a decade older, a father of a 1 year old, and happily married with more responsibilities at work. It’s hard to tell if my anxiety has built back up over the years or my new responsibilities are just more stressful. I don’t really have suicidal thoughts anymore (unless I have a really bad day like once a year) but I always wonder if I should be back on Zoloft to improve my quality of life. 

Obviously this is more of a discussion to have with a medical professional, but I wanted to get third party impressions first (I’ve talked to my wife but she’s obviously biased and just wants the best for me). The anxiety isn’t exactly preventing me from doing ok in life, but I get the feeling sometimes that being on Zoloft could greatly improve my enjoyment and fulfillment in life. Sometimes things feel a bit blunted and unemotional I suppose and I don’t know the last time I’ve really been super happy other than the birth of my daughter. How do I know if I should be on medication or not?

124,"I'm scared to keep living. I feel like I'm trapped. I'm 18 years old and I graduated high school last June. I've always struggled with my mental health throughout my life but this is different. To start this off, I was living with my grandmother for a few years. My friend since elementary (A) and a close friend I had made two years prior (B) had been staying with me for a month or so there. We all decided that it'd be a good idea to all get jobs and try to get our own place together. B and I started working construction but I ended up getting fired for being sick and B kept calling out because he would stay up all night and party. A and I found a what seemed to be a really good marketing job. A couple weeks go by and since B doesn't have a job so he got removed from the lease. My grandmother co-signed the lease to help us get it which we did. A's old co-worker said that he could move in so we let him take B's spot. Let's call him C. So we are living here now and it's been a month or so. The marketing job falls through. It's a complete bust and we get paid far less than what we were told to expect. The turnover rate was terrible as well. After this, I somehow fell into a spiral. I could barely get out of bed. Weeks went by and I didn't work. I doordashed on occasion but I just couldn't bring myself to work. I decided to try to get a job at food Lion and I got hired that day. They were going to have me work night shift which was exciting to me. I thought maybe this was supposed to be what I did with my life for a while. I went in the next day in the afternoon to fill out paperwork and do online tests and such. I loved the people who worked there during the day so I though the same would happen when I was scheduled to work. When I got in there, I was a little put off. I felt weird. My coworkers seemed a little odd but I thought they must just be tired. I ended up having to leave after 30 minutes because I had a panic attack in their bathroom. I don't know why that happened. I then fell into an even deeper state of depression. I lied to my grandmother about continuing to work there. I didn't know what to do. I relied on my Christmas money to get me through the month. Now, let's fast forward to about a week from now and I started working at a restaurant as a waiter. I'm working as much as I can but I'm not going to be able to make ends meet. I'm not getting all the hours I need but I can't work anywhere else because I don't have a phone number anymore. Onto of that, A left and my grandmother had to cover his rent for that month. Luckily my friend from a another state moved in at the beginning of this month and he's settled in. They both give me 700 a month for everything but I used all of it and only $130 of my money to pay rent because I couldn't afford it. Now, the electricity is due and the internet is coming up in a week or so. I'm working, but not enough to make ends meet and I can't live off of my grandmother, it isn't fair. I feel like a terrible person and I don't know how to get myself out of this situation and it's destroying me. I've started hurting myself occasionally and I'm miserable. I try to tell myself ""You're working all the hours you can right now and that's what matters"" but I feel so much guilt. I finally have a job I can hold but I hate that I've been lying to my grandmother. If I told her the truth, I have no clue how she'd react. I should've kept working at Food Lion like I told her but instead all I did was lay in bed and stare at the walls. I feel like a disappointment and I cry almost everyday. Killing myself would only make things worse but living makes me feels like a burden.

So yesterday me and all of my class had a party because that day we did the first part for our finals. We had to write 15 pages on a specific theme and on that day we had to turn the paper in. So to celebrate it we decided as I said to throw a party.

I was excited for it all day long. I even went and bought new clothes and stuff to look good. I really hoped that maybe today's the day where I can maybe flirt with someone or make out with someone so I really prepared for the party.

But as usual. I talked a lot to people but I couldn't drink because I had to drive. So the party came to the point where everyone had danced and had fun while sober me was sitting there too sober to dance, browsing reddit. I don't even blame my friends why would I. Every now and then someone came up to me and grabbed my hand to dance but I was too afraid of it. I even declined the offer from the girl I like that's how uncomfortable dancing was for me. I then went to the bathroom and couldn't resist hitting myself in the face. I hated myself so bad. 

As you can probably already tell there was no flirting and also no making out so lonely ass me drove home late at night.  While driving I really thought about what I did today. I bought all that stuff spent an hour or two in the bathroom and was just simply hopeful that today is the day. all that for as usual nothing. And I found it funny. I apparently found it really funny that I was so hopeful cause I just laughed. I laughed really really hard until the laughing slowly transformed to crying then to laughing again and back to crying. After a while that cycle stopped and I just couldn't breathe anymore. I breathed really fast and unusual just like in a panic attack. But all of that stopped too suddenly. No crying, no laughing... Just plain emotionlessnes. I did not feel ANYTHING that moment. Everything was suddenly gone and away. So I held the steering wheel straight. I saw that there was a turn coming up but I held it straight, ready to smash into the tree that was there. I drove until I got In the opposite lane when I ""woke"" up again. That was the moment I realized what I was about to do and turned the steering wheel back over again. I was seriously shocked. I really was about to kill myself. That's what all has been coming to

127,"I just wanted to give a little positive story about my experience with mental health and meds.

I had a traumatic adolescence, and I've had OCD and BDD since I was 19. I was severely unwell until my mid-twenties, when things started to turn around. I learned some management techniques, improved my self-esteem, got a girlfriend, got a good job, etc. But the OCD, BDD, and anxiety NEVER went away. I just learned to live with it without wanting to constantly kill myself. I saw therapists on and off but never one I liked. I never considered meds because I was just so adverse to the idea of it and I had stolen random stuff from my dad's assortment of anti-anxiety meds when I was a teen and they messed me up to the point where I couldn't feel anything and put my hand through a window.

In any case I had developed great coping skills over the years and learned how to mitigate many of my symptoms through working out, diet management, meditation, limiting coffee, getting enough sleep and a bunch of other stuff. But the symptoms were still there, just minimized. I would still hit a mind-shattering low usually once a month and just had to wait it out.

Finally I started with another therapist about a year ago and slowly, slowly, she convinced me to try an SSRI. She also had severe anxiety and OCD and finally decided to take one and it worked for her, so very slowly she convinced me to try it. 

I started with a crazily low dose, and slowly built my way up to a normal dose. It did nothing at first. But as time went on the periods between when I was fine and when I would hit the mind-shattering BDD episodes got longer and longer. And then after some time passed I realized I hadn't had an episode in months. I am 33 now and I have not gone this long without an episode since before I first developed symptoms as a teenager. 

I have had zero side effects from the pill, and it was the first one I tried, which I realize may not be realistic for everyone. But for me this is a miracle. All of my life's problems are still there, all of my normal human feelings are still there, but I just don't have the brutal anxiety, OCD, and BDD alongside it. The relief is immeasurable. I can drink coffee whenever I want, I don't have to run marathons to stay alive anymore, I can sleep six hours instead of eight if I feel like it, all these things that normal people get to not worry about that I've had to govern so strictly for so long, I can now be flexible with.

I really don't know where to begin or how to even explain what I'm going through. I have been diagnosed with MDD, PTSD, and Anxiety since I was 12 years old. I have been on and off of medication since then however always stop due to feeling numb and emotionless. I have a strong history of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse from the time i was 6 years old. I am a mother of a 4 year old.

I was previously living with my husband (now separating) who was 10 years older than me. It was my first relationship and i got with him when I was 16. I ended up coming to terms with the fact that we weren't compatible and that i was blind to the red flags that were present in the relationship. So we had been in the process if separation for over a year and I've been on my own now since October.

I am not happy. At all. I have moments of happiness that ate fleeting but overall, i am so unhappy. This has been going on my entire life but especially since adulthood. I started working when I was 15 to pay bills for my mom and help support my 4 sisters but i honestly hate working. I've had several jobs that i enjoyed but the more i work, the more depressed i get. The more depressed I am (whether it be from situations in my life currently or just randomly), the harder it is to work. I will often call into work because my depression is so dibillitating that i literally can't drag myself to work. I even dropped out of college because i couldn't handle all the added stress.

I know people have to work and its normal but i can't come to terms with the fact. I'm so busy between working (weird schedule), being a mom, and keeping up a house that it leaves no time for myself to focus on my mental health. I see a therapist every other week but i don't feel like i get much than the opportunity to vent. I just feel like my life has no purpose. 

I feel so overwhelmed and like there's not enough time in a day to get what i need done. I don't know how to juggle my emotions. I don't know how to come to terms working and never having time. I don't know how to manage my depression at all. I don't have hobbies or even know what i like to do. I am not secure in who I am. I never really had friends and now that I have a couple of friends, i never even have time to see them or maintain those friendships. 

I know this post is all over the place and there is no real question, i suppose. I just needed somewhere to vent and maybe seek opinions or advice on how to help myself.",15Jan2020,1
129,"I am 20 years old and I have been crippled by my anxiety since I was 5-6. I watched my mom die and get resuscitated when I was 7 and have PTSD from that and the years after of her being sick, and a couple events that happened in between and after. She passed when I was 13 after being up and down in the hospital for about a month. I've been severely depressed since at least the age of 10 and hardly went to school, and I couldn't face it again for many years after my mom died. I tried to kill myself a few times but then I just became numb. After many attempts at the charter high school my mom would have wanted me to attend, would have wanted me to take advantage of the college preparatory aspects and build a future for myself, I had to go to a credit recovery program but I did end up getting all my credits and graduating high school! Ever since then, I have had nothing going on in my life. I go to therapy once a week, maybe go get some food or a Walmart trip here and there but I have agoraphobia and its just getting worse. I have had a boyfriend the past two years but we have broken up and he doesn't reply to me so its officially over this time. I love him and can't imagine my life without him but I know breakups happen and it is probably for the best if he doesn't feel the same, so it would be fine if I really had anything left to live for. He made me laugh and feel something, he cuddled me every night, gave me something to wake up to. I have no one really. My dad is really it. I have one friend. She lives very far from me and I don't have the energy to keep up with her. I would have gone to college if I didn't have a debt that I can't pay from concurrent classes I took for one week. But now I don't think I could ever face the workload and the people and the leaving my house. Like I said, I really haven't felt energy to do anything in at least 4 years and my agoraphobia really has paralyzed me. I just feel so stuck. I've never even heard a story about someone who missed out everything including their developmental years, absolutely incapable of everything and then ever be able to jump up and have a life. The only future I  even see being a possibility is me moping around my dad's house until he dies and I'm forced to live alone, on disability just sleeping with my dog all day, or getting married and taking care of kids all day. I don't want to even witness either. I don't even want to ever witness anything besides my bed. I really have put so much thought into it and I don't see any reason to live through this misery one more day. I literally wake up every morning, think about all this and just cry. I don't know. I could have written this a lot better but I 'm so bad with words nowadays. I guess I am posting this in hopes someone will read it and tell me they went through the same thing and how they got to the other side, but every particle of me doesn't believe it is possible or even worth it for me.

131,"To keep it brief I have a friend that I strongly suspect has schizophrenia for lots of reasons. Whatever it is it's really serious -severe wild all-consuming delusions, sudden abandonment of hygiene, nonsensical speech. 

The thing is my friend refuses help bc of severe paranoia and isolating and spiraling rapidly. Idk what to do as a friend, what should I be doing? I'm at a loss. I'm worried they're going to end up homeless or dead or something. Idk how much longer they're going to be able to keep a job. No family. 

Anyone here have experience with schizophrenia?? I know it can't be cured but what does help look like?

Does medication really stop the incoherent rambly speech stuff? And delusions? Is any return to normalcy even possible?",15Jan2020,1
132,"This is an anecdote of something that happened during all my life. Already solved, but I never quite understood why or what was it.
I never had trouble reading people, they seemed simple, kids and adults. They all functioned the same, talked the same, found funny the same things.   Doesn't matter if they thought they were different, all fell by the same tricks. Been trough so many moves from city to city. It always been the same.
Everyone loved me, but I loved nobody, I just couldn't, nor my family, nor my friends and couples. They just seemed like sand in the desert, and I was alone. 

The only thing I could ever loved was ""Shaco"", my dog, there was no cheat or trick for his true love. I gotta say, he is and was a true companion.
I wasn't sad or happy. I just wasn't. The only moment I truly felt alive was playing skyrim with shaco sleeping besides me, the days I skipped school.

Im not a 10/10 but i could get any girl I wanted, but that got old, what's the point?. I just didn't see the point in anything. During a time I couldn't relate myself in the mirror, get mad with people and react weird at everything, i really thought that all existance revolved around me, because people was so simple, and life so structured. I couldn't understand why anyone was like me.

Once someone knew how I was, thought I was a bad person. How could someone who has 10y long friendship with someone don't care for them. A year long relasionship where 1 never loved. A caring family that would have been exchanged for a dog.
The people that at least got where I was coming from, stayed with me(they are now my closest friends).

The girls were charmed when I told them my Oh so sad scarred past full of family dissapointments, the death of my grandpa, ""oh I have been trough so much, I'm a suffered little thing, but I'm gonna make it"" just a cool sasuke kinda past and a ""progression"" in my oh so hard to get trust. Was effective, but that made the relasionship very boring.

Yes, I went to the psychologist and was refreshing to take off the shell, and talk about my mind. It helped, but wasn't the thing that saved me.
It all ended when I decided to start over, didn't knew were to start. Months later I started dating my girlfriend, a big step because I really cared about her and im glad and proud that I still do. It was a slow process, but Im happy now, I think that I have trully good friends and I enjoy the sentiment of love, I have a nice job overall and everything is marching upfront and nice. I can't forget the tricks and shortcuts to people, but I only use it at job with clients and else. I take the longer and more ME way to people.

I always enjoyed little things, but all that; drinking, playing videogames, eating, making jokes, became so much better with people that you like and care. Life became to be.

But i never quite knew why all happened in the first place, I enjoy life so much now, but the feeling of being missunderstood is still there. I just wish that never happened.

134,"My (40F) SO (36M) has always had issues with letting the past go. We were together for nearly a decade and he would still bring up things that happen within the first month of dating. I ended up breaking up with him because he a. Did not treat me well and b. Had the above issues. We got back together this past year and he promised he had changed. Which seemed to be true for awhile. He asked me to marry him and I accepted. It seems however that he has been casually stalking the guys I dated while we were broken up. This is causing me a lot of anxiety. I don’t think that what either of us did during our time apart has any bearing on our relationship now. He keeps comparing himself to these guys and asking why I broke up with him just to date these ‘losers’.  The stalking bothers me (honestly though we all look up our SO exes at some point out of curiosity, but we don’t dig up personal details of their financial and career lives), the comparing and questioning about why I dated them after leaving him is emotionally distressing to me. To me it’s like he is still holding a grudge about the breakup (he does know he treated me terribly and has apologized for that) and needs to know that I wasn’t serious about these guys - which I wasn’t. I left a stagnant relationship that I tried very hard for a long time to move forward I wasn’t about to get trapped like that again. Besides I loved him.... even though we weren’t together, but at that point with someone who holds grudges and won’t agree to move forward in the relationship what’s the point of the relationship??

136,"I've been wanting to ask about mental health for awhile but I don't really know how to bring these things up in person.

I've only ever seriously spoke about it with my brother but I always keep this boarder up.

He told me that there's something wrong with my conscience. Im not sure what to do and it's damaged a lot of my relationships and even myself (although I dont think I care enough for either of those things, but I'm willing to try to ""improve"") . I keep making the same mistakes and I think it's because I dont know how to recognize what a good thing to do is and what a ""bad"" or unhealthy thing to do is.

From what I understand at the moment, I'm apathetic towards other people and myself (I dont really take care of myself and It's been a part of me since I was growing), I dont really understand the gravity of most things (if there is any). I grew up as loner, I only ever hung out with other kids when they'd approach me and I don't often participate. I dont really get attached to other people but I try to enjoy their company when theyre there. I tend to lie and manipulate (with no cruel intentions, its mostly in a small instinctive manner) but I try not to but it ends up happening anyway. I think ive ever felt like ive belonged. Even within my family and close friends. It always feels like nothing. Like its just a bunch of things happening in front of me that don't mean anything.

I want to get out of this cycle. I got close to a friend and he made me feel seen and heard. And I've only ever felt that with one other person (She left) and im afraid im losing him as well. My habits have been very unhealthy for the both of us. Although we'd talk about it, when a dilemma occurs I can't seem to point out whats okay and what's not and end up thinking that whichever choice Id make wouldnt matter. I ended up betraying his trust. I didnt really care and was ultimately fine with him away from me (I thought it be better for him anyway but I remember now that he'd tell me that he'd never truly want to be away from me, its just that its come to a very unhealthy part for the both of us). The more I thought of it, the more miserable things started appearing. If I keep wasting good friendships like this, then life will always be gray. I'm tempted to just not care and go back to doing my own thing. I know that it wouldnt matter if I had them in my life or not, and that it would simplify everything but all of my references say otherwise.",15Jan2020,1
137,"Most people on the outside looking in would think I’m a normal/healthy late 20s/female. I can be very charismatic, intelligent, witty and funny. I am highly insightful and a deep thinker so I naturally attract people when I first initially meet them. I’ve modeled for a lingerie brand and my social media would give you the impression life is great. But it’s so far from that. 

I had a very traumatic childhood. My mom had a breakdown mentality right after I was born due to sudden flashbacks of her being raped by her father. So she took it out on me. There was no bonding or little. My dad avoids emotion and doesn’t like to get involved. After they divorced, my dad remarried and started a new family. I hardly hear from him although he supported me very well financially until 18. I was mercilessly bullied in middle school and early high school and with little stable or emotional support at home. I still tried to carry on and pretend I was normal. 

I was misdiagnosed with just general anxiety. Possible bipolar II in my early 20s but I personally didn’t feel like it fit. Finally being diagnosed with complex trauma as my therapist likes to call it but admitted it isn’t recognized in the DSM. She said If it’s a label in the DSM, it would be borderline personality disorder albeit “quiet” (acting inward) or higher functioning. 

I am highly insightful into my behavior and disorder but to me it actually makes it worse. My intellectual brain is watching me suffer &amp; choosing thoughts/behaviors that continue to feed the cycle. Jordan Peterson said that borderlines can often be quite intelligent and can tell you exactly why they do what they do &amp; what they need to do to fix it/change yet they can’t seem to implement or the implementation doesn’t last long. This hit home. My overwhelming fear of people, intense self hatred, need to belong &amp; feel safe/loved overrides every once of logic. Yes, I practice DBT and yes outwardly it’s controlled. Inward is a very different story. 

I go between being the life of the party to self induced periods of isolation (except work.) The isolation is because I know my thoughts are not quite normal &amp; isolation feels safer at times. I obsess about improving my appearance as a way to be “worthy” but nothing will ever satisfy me. I only seem to be attracted to damaged narcissistic playboys who feed into that cycle of unworthiness. I get emotionally exhausted from just performing adult responsibilities and daily life. Sometimes that’s why I sleep all weekend. I get bored so easily. People so happy their with the 9-5 white picket fence life seem absolutely foreign to me. I frequently overuse sleeping pills to sedate myself when I’m feeling sad and lonely. I socially binge drink with friends as a way to seem fun &amp; comfortable. I don’t feel like a woman in her late 20s but rather a young girl. Intellectually I like to talk about globally politics &amp; economics yet I could never finish my degree. I ghost friends after an ordinary conflict. I flee. I’m terrified of conflict or somebody getting to close to see the “real” me. Those who have jokingly say “you’re like an alien from another planet.” Or “you gave so much wasted potential” So I avoid people getting to close. I just want them to see the mask I wear. 

I have been through years of therapy on and off. I know all the tools yet I do think I’m condemned to a life on the outside looking in. Changing ones “personality” and that intense self hatred for a sustained period of time feels like an impossibility. 

Sorry for the venting. I just wanted to say living with a “quiet” distorted personality just really sucks.",15Jan2020,1

Thanks, I’ve pasted from my notes below.


Feel drained most of the time, but not like I actually need to sleep just want to lie down and not do anything. At least once a day I feel like I can’t be bothered to do anything for the rest of the day and wish I just could just do nothing at home. Absolutely no motivation to do schoolwork even though I am intelligent and can definitely get very good grades if I put even just a decent bit of effort in. I know I’m wasting potential but feel pretty apathetic about it. General feelings of apathy in all areas of life. I struggle to stick to a task because I get easily distracted and often have an idea of something to do that I think I’ll enjoy but give up very quickly even if it’s not something difficult (even things like doing something on a video game). I think about my mental health on a daily basis and feel like something isn’t right, but usually end up convincing myself I’m overthinking it. I also often imagine bad situations happening to me but sort of wish they would happen. Even though I know they would actually be quite horrible to endure, I still sort of feel they would at least be something interesting. I also feel maybe this is because I want something that takes responsibility away. A bit like having an excuse to not function properly for a while without having to take the blame myself for it. I get tired of social situations and quite frequently don’t feel I’m properly involving myself even in situations with my best friends. I struggle to talk to new people and never actively go out of my way to open up and make new friends. This isn’t a massive problem as I have a good amount of close friends but I do feel awkward in a lot of situations with less known people because of this, especially at school. I delay doing simple tasks for no real reason, I think it’s like I hope they’ll go away even if it’s something easy like just taking the bins out which takes 2 minutes.

141,"As the title says, this question has distressed me for couple of years now, almost obsessively.

Little background: I spend my first years in a stressful hospital environment due to difficulties at birth, and was later verbally / psychologically abused by my people very close to me (either directly or by denying my pain) and bullied and/or ""bossed around"" throughout my school years *by pretty much everyone* (bullies and friends).

Not knowing about my abuse, the doctors gave a diagnosis of (mild) autism spectrum disorder to me in my teenage years, a diagnosis I (aversely) grew to accept over the years after reading about it on my own (no one ever explained anything).

**However**, after I couple years back realised the extent of my traumas, I've started to question everything, more or less. *Not only* have my ""ASD symptoms"" become almost non-existent after having spent time with supporting people since the beginning of the university, *but also* it seems more and more that nearly all of my ""ASD issues"" might originate from the intense trauma (including neglect and feelings of abandonment) suffered throughout my childhood.

I've spent many years dealing with mental illness, depression, anxiety, anger issues and various other things that go hand in hand with this. I feel I've done ok with my life and have the support of friends and family although I appear as an extrovert I'm not very good at networking or maintaining friends due to a short fuse.

I've have various careers and jobs, dropped out of college and fell from one job or girl to another. I ended up meeting someone, bought a house, had a son and lost it all and got divorced. 

This has really shaken me to my core as it wasnt a great divorce and I didnt have a great lawyer. I lost the house, $28k in owed money, most of my access to my son, another $20k in lawyers fees and still not fully divorced yet. After all this I have the $15k of debt left by my ex wife so I'm maxed out on loans and credit cards. All my money every month goes to paying all this off. I have a well paid job but it's not enough to cover it all so month to month I get hand outs from my family. 

Yesterday after a therapy session which I need to pay $120 for excess I got 2 emails from lawyers saying in total I owe them $2 in fees with the divorce.

Well that just broke me, I couldn't really focus or concentrate after that I fell into a black pit and went numb. I cant do anything right, I cant take my son to do anything, I can barely afford the gas for my car to collect him from school at nights, I cant get groceries from the stops so my partner pays for all the food, I hate my job and last night I just loaded my pockets with medication and kissed my partner goodbye and made an excuse I was going to the shops.

I drove around for a while just to find somewhere to park at the river or park to just to OD but I just sat there and let everything flood in and just cried and cried until my eyes and throat was sore. I wouldve screamed if I had the energy but all energy had left me.

I couldn't do it and sat numb for hours and must've fell asleep. I woke up an hour later and drove home and didnr say anything more about it.

I know eventually that this will get the better of me and I will die by suicide. I cant see a 5year or 10year plan or future and this will be how it ends for me and I've made my peace with myself and i can accept this. Once everyone else leaves or cant stand me then it will be my time.",15Jan2020,1

I am a Registered Nurse, I help clients advocate for better mental heath but yet I cannot address my own issues.   I champion to help reduce the stigma that surrounds mental health issues but am plagued by it myself. This is frustrating for a number of reasons. I often ask myself how good of a job can I be doing when I cannot even do the right thing for myself. I know what I need to do, I can identify that what’s going on is not healthy, I know that I need help. I just can’t.  So I turn to maladaptive coping strategies, overeating, close myself off, and then after a little bit of that everything will calm down in my head and life goes back to normal until the next time. 

I’m concerned I’m ruining relationships when I “go quiet,” yet no one has said anything about that yet. I’ve had the invite to talk about things, but I shrug it off as “being okay,” or “feeling under the weather.”  

Health services in my area are already shaky at best, let alone mental health services. I know I need the help, I just can’t bother to bring myself to actually starting it off.  I’ve tried a ton of self-non-pharmaceutical options to help manage anxiety, and stress, but nothing tends to stick for me.

I am scared that this will happen again even if I know for a fact that nothing is wrong anymore, but I get this intense feeling in my stomach. It feels like if I eat one more bite I have to throw up. I get cold hands and become very nervous. I tried bringing myself to eat a bit even with the intense feeling and it worked a little but it was still very hard and I couldn´t finish most of my food.

In addition I get this feeling even thinking about a situation where I have to eat out again and then I get angry at myself that I am scared of eating anywhere besides home.

152,"I don't quite know how to explain it properly. But whenever I'm in a social situation, whether it's a classroom, among family or just with one other person, I sort of just acting out my behaviour. Acting the best way I know how and appropriately conducting myself. It's never really 'me' it's more like I'm acting out in a play or something. 

The thing is I sort of have to act in a situation among people because I'll be doing nothing if I don't. If I'm not acting, I'm just standing around doing nothing and ignoring people. I don't quite know how to explain it as much but it's exhausting. Like saying things, having conversations with people just because it's socially necessary. Even when I'm among people I like, it's much the same really. I behave in the best way I know what's socially acceptable.

Sometimes when I don't know how to behave, I do nothing because I have nothing to really do. I can't really be 'myself' because there isn't a 'myself' to be. I certainly have set beliefs, likes and dislikes but not a set 'me'. Unless standing aimlessly is 'me'.  People say to be yourself and you'll make friends and stuff, but I don't feel like I have a 'myself' I either act appropriately or I do nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been sort of like this forever. And I really only began thinking about it when the idea of having a job came up. People with jobs have to act social among their pairs and act friendly when doing costumer service. Things I don't like doing but I'm very capable of acting them just fine. But of course, when I'm thinking about how to behave in the workplace, I'm realizing I'm acting everywhere else. Even among family, I'm not really being a 'me' I'm mostly just behaving in a way that's most appropriate.

Of course, I don't really like acting, it's exhausting and frustrating especially when there are much better things to do. So I usually try to limit as many social interactions as possible, not feeding into the conversation while remaining appropriate. So I'm essentially dreading just being among people because I have to put in the effort.

&amp;#x200B;

158,"Hi all, I’m a sophomore in college feeling very lost and on the verge of mental breakdown. I applied to transfer to 1 school in the fall (should have applied to more) and then turned it down when I got in because I didn’t feel ready emotionally/mentally (panic attacks before I was supposed to leave) and wasn’t 100% sure about going because it’s across the country in a state I have never visited, doesn’t have a traditional campus, and I’ve heard from many people that it is difficult socially. Now I’m back at my original school feeling miserable as ever. I’m so scared that my mental health is just going to deteriorate throughout the semester. What should I do?

1) call the school I got into and ask if there’s any way they can re-enroll me 
2) ask the school I got into to defer to fall and then go home for a semester 
3) ride it out where i am right now and then reapply to transfer to more schools in the Spring
4) go home and do CC for a semester while also reapplying to transfer schools (this would save a TON of money which is great especially because if i had to take an extra semester at a new school it would be fine, and I could go back to the old school if I didn’t get in anywhere).

Currently, what is making me take the plunge is that I'm feeling lost in life, unsure what I should do regarding my life, location, family, relationship, etc. I have no diagnoses (due to never getting into therapy) but I do struggle with anxiety/depression, and I suspect something a bit more sinister like bipolar or BPD as well (I am **not** self-diagnosing, I am just giving an idea on what I *think* could potentially be going on under the surface). My main reason for seeking it out, though, is my general confusion about where my life is going. I need a third party sounding board who will help me come to my own conclusions about the next steps.


I was looking at providers my insurance covers and I'm unsure what level of professional I should see. Should I start with a mental health counselor, psychologist, psychiatrist, etc.? I know the higher the qualifications, the pricier it will be. I did get a callback from one psychologist who said, with my insurance, I'm looking at $85+ for a 45 min session. It's not exactly unaffordable for me, but it's pushing it if it isn't really necessary. I do have an appointment with my PCP in a couple of weeks so I can ask what their opinion is as well, but I'm wondering what this community has for input.

161,"Recent years had their great moments and awful moments.

It all started with PTSD. Got treated for it and now the condition doesn't give me problems anymore.

Then I started self-harming due to low self-esteem. I wasn't really diagnosed with a mental illness, but I still felt mentally ill, had suicidal thoughts. Got treated for it and now I don't want to self harm or kill myself anymore.

But life just doesn't want me to lead a happy life. 

Now I am starting to develop an eating disorder?

It just feels like when one problem is treated, another problem emerges. It can take half a year, or a year. But feeling mentally ill just comes back to kick me in the face each time.

I feel so fake due to this. No way it is possible that all this happens one after another, right? Isn't it more logical if all of the above just emerge at the same time, without ""breaks"" of feeling well?

163,"\*\*Disclaimer: I'm using a brand-new Reddit account for this post, I and don't want to share too many details that might identify me. Please bear with me in this regard. I'm desperate for advice - even (especially?) from strangers - since none of the in-person ""wisdom"" I've received (including that from my therapist, who I see 3-4 times a month) is helpful beyond ""you need to do something about this"".\*\*

I'm a 30-something female who has 3 jobs and lives/struggles with manic depression (otherwise known as bipolar disorder). My depressive states involve crying jags, calling in sick to work, fantasizing about how I might die, failing to follow basic hygiene, and other unpleasant behaviors. My manic states range from cocaine-like highs and wonderful creativity/productivity to agitation/aggression to impulsive/dangerous behavior that causes me to lose friends, money, health, and sleep. For both depression and mania, my biggest triggers are departure from routine and sensing major changes in the near future.

I've tried five different psychiatric drugs over the years (Trileptal, Zoloft, Cymbalta, Effexor XR, and Latuda - in that order). The difficult-to-terrifying side effects these medications produced within me - along with the debilitating withdrawal symptoms I experienced from the Effexor XR - are only slightly outweighed by the fact that they either did nothing to help me with my depression and mania or instead ""flattened me out"" so much that I was fake and emotionless. As a result of my experiences, I've been unmedicated for nearly five years now (with the exception of one horrifying day on Latuda in 2018). None of the psychiatrists I've seen have taken psychiatric medication themselves, and my despair over hellish side effects and withdrawal has historically been ignored or disbelieved by them. They all seemed to be throwing darts instead of making conscientious decisions about my medication. 

After a series of panic attacks and breakdowns (including a three-hour one at an international airport in November), I decided in December that I needed to re-consider medication. But now I'm regretting my decision to schedule my psychiatric evaluation (which happens a week from today and will take place with the same shrink who prescribed me Latuda). What's the point in going to this evaluation, I ask myself? I'm a religious person, and I believe that God made me this way. Why fight my identity with chemicals? It's no different to me than injecting chemicals into my eyes to change their color. It's spitting in God's face, really. Why should I hate myself so much that I drug it out of existence? Life with manic depression is painful enough without having to take expensive pills that dull who I am every day.

I just have no clue how to approach this situation. I think of suicide on a regular basis, and my entire life has spun out of control. I seem to have no command over my libido, organization and neatness, health, or moods. And it's well-understood that if I tell the wrong person about how I'm feeling (like I did a few times in the past), I'll get imprisoned against my will in a mental institution..causing me to lose my employment/income/sense of hope, get saddled with a massive hospital bill that will send me further back into the crushing debt I'm currently clawing my way out of, and get worse due to being surrounded by people who are even crazier than I am. 

I know I'm unwell, but I've got all these reservations about trying drugs again. Please advise me with reason and compassion. I'm willing to answer questions that don't reveal my identity. Thanks in advance.",15Jan2020,1
164,"Recently (it's been 4  months), I had a rather unfortunate incident with two friends: a girl I liked and a long-time male friend. It's a little complicated, but basically she refused to give me an answer as to whether she liked me or not (she did but she wouldn't admit it to me because of later obvious reasons). The problem arose from the fact that they started dating and gaslighted me into thinking they aren't. Lots of lies and deception that just didn't need to be there.

After finding out, I had a pretty serious breakdown and there's been a lot of weird things that resulted from that. For example, I'm not as much as a clean freak as I used to be, and I'm suddenly no longer scared of spiders. The bad thing is that I seem to have also developed a weird form of gynophobia. I'm okay with being around her and any woman I knew BEFORE the incident, but any new person immediately triggers anxious feelings. I have trouble speaking and I'm extremely anxious about being around unfamiliar women.

Fortunately, I don't really have to interact with unknown women at work but I'm becoming more worried since this is the polar opposite of how I used to be. I grew up with mostly female friends so I never really had issues of this sort. Something similar happened after my ex-gf broke up with me, but it kinda went away quickly.

Is this a normal (ish) thing to happen for some time, or is it worrisome to the point where I should look into some counselling? Has anyone heard of something similar to this? I've been meaning to go to therapy for a while due to various circumstances, but I've been putting it off until I have adequate finances.

If it's 90's music, I need 90's movies and books set in that time period. 80's the same way. Maybe even go as far as to dress in a certain way. maybe not full blown, but just inspired by it. That is just an example, there can be a lot of different areas. And, I may jump quickly between different areas, even as quickly as in the same day. This is starting to strain my life. I can't just like what I like. I can't mix anything together without feeling like it's not right. I have no idea what it would be. Someone suggested OCD or maybe a lack of identity.

169,"I have been experiencing what I believe to be depression since grade 11, maybe even grade 10. I am in my third year of university now. When I tried to tell my dad back in high school that I thought I might be depressed he brushed it off as ""teenage angst."" I knew that teenage angst didn't make you want to kill yourself, but I felt so let down by the person I could usually turn to that I didn't pursue it further. After some horrible mental breakdowns in my first year of university I reached out to the campus counselors. While helpful, they of course couldn't diagnose me with anything and that has always been my issue. I don't think that people should rely on a self-diagnosis, but my opinion started to change the more people would refuse to help me and provide me with answers. I told my doctor before I started my second year at uni about the depression and he prescribed me anti-depressants. This was a fantastic step, and they help me a lot, but still having never been diagnosed I still felt like I had no answers. Being prescribed those meds, while a blessing, also seemed to be my curse as anytime I then tried to reach out to someone to try and get a diagnosis they would turn me away because I was already on meds. Apparently they had already done their due diligence and I would be a waste of their resources. At a check up I mentioned to the physician that I wanted a diagnosis and she told me I shouldn't bother.  It took crying on the phone with mental health services in my city to crying in my doctor's office to even get a referral. But it worked. I just got a call from a psychiatrists office and have an appointment with them next Tuesday for an assessment. 

I feel so much lighter all of a sudden, it's the only way I can describe it. There are certain services at my university and in my community that I can only access with an official diagnosis and I have managed to overcome every person who told me that it was a waste of time to get one. Yes, my medication helps me, but I have so many underlying issues that require more attention. Not to mention that I might also have something other than depression, or along side depression. Only a professional can tell me and by God I am so ready to find out.

170,"So I took a major step this morning. after being abruptly fired from a job I worked for ten years, with no prior disciplinary action, my mental health began to decline. actually it started with my last boss there who was batshit crazy. I started smoking a lot of weed at that time because she was driving me up a wall every single day. She was only there for a few months, everybody complained about her, but in the end they accepted her decision to get rid of me even though I'd been there for ten years and never had a write up.


so anyway, back to the original story. Fast forward less than 2 months and I found a job. more money, more responsibility. it was okay at first, but it was a management position which I had no experience in. I did my best for as long as I could but with shitty employees constantly not showing up or not doing their work I no longer felt I had the patience to be there. At the end of 4 months, I suffered from the biggest mental breakdown. I use that phrase bc I'm not officially diagnosed by a psych, only my PCPs who say I'm depressed and anxious. I don't know if these things are panic attacks, anxiety attacks, or something completely different altogether. 


Fast forward another 2 months, and I confide in my immediate supervisor that im having trouble coping with physical and mental illnesses and that I'm not sure if management was right for me, (also due to an allergy of something that was common I  the workplace) and that I'd be looking to leave soon...but I needed time because I didn't want to get fired not did I wish to quit without anything lined up. the next day that I come in, a random employee says ""hey, I heard you were quitting!"" .... ok..... so that's what we're doing now? telling private convos to regular employees? ok. strike 1. 


Strike 2 was when a rent-a-manager who was only slightly above me in the chain of command, yet had been there less time than I, had sent me home after I told him I wouldn't scrub a bunch of trashcans..... look, I'm all for gender equality, but as a female, I'm not climbing into industrial sized trash cans to clean them out, ESPECIALLY when there's more than a half dozen young men who's legit job it is to clean the trashcans when they're done their shift, and when HE KNOWS I suffered from chronic pain (back surgery 2 years ago) and Illness (nausea related, if you can't tell by my username). I said plus ""I heard [boss' name] gave that list TO YOU to do"". he sent me home. 



And strike 3 was yesterday. Monday night I was texted by my boss telling me it was my ""lucky day"" and that I was being sent to work at another facility the next day, for the week. 20 miles/1hr away.  She said that many of the managers in training from the district have been helping out at the facility while the new Manager's hiring process was being completed. I have an anxiety attack that night. But remembered that I had been looking at a paper with the time/date/name given to me, that was up on the bulletin board at work the past few days. she knew this whole time and decided to tell me a few hours before I was about to go to bed for my next shift. I wake up, make my way up those 20 miles. The work is actually not too bad, there was another manager there, they just needed somebody to help out. cool. I can do this for the week even though the drive sucks. then as the hours go by, we get to talking.... she tells me that NOBODY has been there, I'm the first person. EXCUSE ME WHAT. sooooo..... who lied to who? the district manager to my boss? or my boss to me? interesting.... the manager also proceeds to tell me how she was supposed to be there for a few weeks and ended up there for 9 months so far. WHAT?! no. nope. then I ended up being there for 10+ hours. And the lady tells me she's taking off tomorrow. soooo.... you just expect me to run this building after only being here one day???


I got there at 8am, though my day started at 230am bc I woke up with an anxiety attack for the days events. it was now 5:30pm. I had done nothing for the past hour. the mgr hadn't told me I could go yet, and I started getting anxious.... So I stood up and said, to myself, you know what? I'm a fuckin manager I can leave if I fuckin want to, I'm not waiting around for her!!! so I hold back tears as I tell her I'll be in at the discussed time the next day (which was today). When I get outside it's foggy and raining. I do not have the best night vision with driving. I wear glasses it's just way too much glare in combination with the wet roads, all I saw was shining lights from every direction, I started panicking immediately cause I couldn't even get out of the parking lot. I spent the next 30 minutes a wreck... just completely sobbing til my eyes were puffy n burning and my voice was hoarse.  I was scared to drive because of the state I was in. I was literally screaming crying and shaking. I've been having more fucked up thoughts lately of suicide, not that I would ever do that to those I love, but those visions kept flashing in my head and I was literally scared of and for myself. 


For the past month or two, especially last night,  Id get visions of getting into a car crash on the way to or from work so that I don't have to go.  I've been spacing out and disassociating while driving to/from work the past few weeks. while I was in the shower last night I wished that I could just run away from everyone and everything and start over new. 


I woke up this morning crying. My fiance asked if I didn't feel like going into work. I shook my head. he was about to leave and I couldn't not get some kind of answer/closure to what I could do. so I went up to him and I just stared cause it wouldn't come out of my mouth and he asked if I could just make it through the week...I shook my head and he said ""you can't just quit your job like that""  and I just bowed my head in defeat, my face frowned up started to cry and walked back to the room. he continues to leave and just said ""do what you're gonna do. just do what you're gonna do."" 


So I did. I wrote an email of immediate resignation. Uploaded my picture onto Uber, and started driving within the hour. I had already set up my account after that first talk with my boss, but didn't plan on starting til after the new year anyway cause I didn't want to claim like 3 days of driving on this year's taxes.

I can’t stand selfies, am not looking primarily for likes/upvotes, and don’t get super jealous about what people are doing with their lives which they describe in posts. I think that I gravitate toward it for self-expression and also just kind of feel like it is an artistic performance of sorts (I’m also a musician). I also have a guilty pleasure for debating people who have strongly opposing views to mine.

However, it feels unproductive to do this too much. I have tried volunteering for various organizations and blogging with little success. I have also visited a couple of writing Meetups which I didn’t quite gel with and used to get in trouble from time to time taking creative writing in school based on what I wrote. I don’t think that journaling is helpful for me unless someone eventually reads it, and it has been a good therapy exercise, as well as useful for giving a psychiatrist insight into my behavior and way of thinking. I am a still thinking of maybe trying to get some sort of book out there at some point. I have been told that I shouldn’t debate and argue too much offline.

I’m 20. I just got back from a 10 day vacation to Orlando, FL. With an friend who is not my friend anymore. 

We weren’t exactly all that compatible to begin with and had prior fallouts and set up boundaries and kept trying to make it work over the years but I’m kinda over it. 

I thought the trip went well apparently she thought otherwise and sent me nasty messages and blocked me after the trip. 

Oh well not much money was lost on my part. It was pretty much a gift paid by her parents and all I had to do was bring spending money. 

And that was also my only “friend” who wasn’t really a friend because we would rarely hangout. I guess we are in different parts in our lives. She’s newly engaged, has a job, getting ready to move out, almost done with therapy, weaning off meds, has other friends, has her own car, looking to start going to college...me on the other hand, going to start seeing a doctor and going to therapy soon, no job and can’t keep a job, can’t keep friends, emotional/mental roller coaster, pretty much my parents Maid (they make me clean a lot around house and yell when I do things wrong), no saved up money, no car, never had a boyfriend, no other friends (I bullied a lot of people in high school and no I’m not proud of it)

Anyways, now that I am back at home I am back  to sitting in my house day in and day out. I haven’t had a job since I got fired in October. I’ve had 4 jobs this year and got fired from every single one due to low performance, bad moods and fallouts with coworkers. My parents drop me off/pick me up from jobs but now they are suggesting I focus on myself and getting the mental help I need (medication, therapy, raise my self esteem etc). Because I’m just going to get fired again and my resume is already trash. Both of my parents have masters degrees and work constantly. We live in a fairly nice house. 

I go through phases where I’m up and happy and must spend spend spend or must do something and have a high sex drive (masturbate a lot to put it bluntly) appetite goes up and I engage in abnormal/risk taking behavior become childish/obnoxious/attention seeking, don’t follow rules and I also go through periods where I’m very irritated, all I want to do is sleep, barely eat, lash out on everyone, cry randomly and say mean and nasty things (become super defensive)

I do not have a car to drive at the moment, and I’m not on any insurance. I have like $7 in my bank account. Parents just put me on their health insurance and want to me to seek mental treatment, they think I might be bipolar/borderline but I always have hard times getting along with others/ I’m very rebellious and stubborn/ I guess I do have age regression sometimes when I’m down and I can’t keep a job or go to school. My grades were terrible in high school no matter what help I received. I don’t know what I want to do with my life and I can’t think about it, I’ve never been able too, I get very frustrated and overwhelmed. 

My doctors appointment is an initial intake appointment at the psychiatrist on Jan 24th. But what I usually do is watch movies/YouTube , play mario kart, sleep (a lot), play with my dogs/cats, if it’s warm go for a walk around neighborhood, broadcasting apps, or clean whatever my parents want me to clean. Designated cleaning days are Tuesday and Friday and my parents give me an entire list. They don’t pay me either. They say you live here free of rent, I’m paying for your food/health insurance and phone bill, the least you could do is work on yourself and clean my house. You are irresponsible and my room constantly looks like a hoarders room (I always struggle with keeping things clean) so maybe this is their way of trying to get me to be responsible?

I don’t think it’s just seasonal either. I could make a case for every single season, but summer is the one where it hurts the most.",15Jan2020,1
176,"I’ve been feeling incredibly overwhelmed at work recently. I am in my 5th year here and genuinely enjoyed my job the first 4 1/2 but recent structural changes have given me a ton more responsibilities (with a pay raise). This increase in work however has caused me to make a lot more mistakes and I have hard time dealing with disappointing people. I feel like I’m so overwhelmed all the time that my brain gets overloaded with thinking about multiple things simultaneously. While this is happening it causes me to get anxious and I can feel my heart rate go up and chest get tight. This makes me get impulses to distract myself with something like my phone because only then can I keep myself from thinking about stress triggers. Sometimes I can’t fall asleep because I don’t have any distractions available and my mind is left to wonder. I try to think about relaxing stuff but stressful things keep popping in and I dwell on them. All of this causes difficulty concentrating, to the point where I have to write everything down because my brain can’t remember things like it used to. Has anyone dealt with something like this? Thank you in advance.",15Jan2020,1
177,"So over the last like 2 years I'd say, since I started college, I haven't felt the same. My mind always feels blank, like I barely have any thoughts.  I feel like my memory has just gotten worse, forgetting what I'm going to say in a conversation, forgetting words, and just general things. It feels like I'm just becoming more impulsive and stupid. My brain just feels like a space of nothingness, my mind suddenly making me slower and holding me back. I just don't know what to do.",15Jan2020,1

I have an amazing child and partner but I can't get out of this space. On the outside it looks like I really have it together. Inside I'm a wreak. 

My dad recently died. I cared for him in the final stages of his illness and I don't have my mum anymore either.

179,"Hi everyone,

I don't know exactly how to start, but I've been really sad. I'm an 18 y/o male who graduated high school in 2019, and went to a community college for a month before dropping out due to my mental health. After dropping out, I began speaking through video chat to a therapist, who diagnosed me with anxiety and said that while I didn't seem to be fully depressed, I should be happier with my life. However, her treatments didn't help very much and I haven't been to talk to a professional in around 2 months now. Recently, I've had some good news in my life too. I've gotten into a school that I think will be a much better fit for me and I've met a girl who really cares about me that I've taken a liking to as well. But in the past week or so, I've been very unhappy for no discernible reason. I've been unable to think about a positive future for myself, and I feel like a complete failure. My parents are very well off and have invested a lot of time and resources into making sure I can get the future I want for myself. And I've done just about nothing with it. I am not suicidal and I have never once been suicidal, but recently there have been many instances where I've thought that it wouldn't matter or change the world badly if I were to die. My mother's side of the family (which I take after) has a long line of serious depression and I'm concerned not that I've started experiencing it, but that I haven't yet and that somehow I can get worse. I also had a fight with one of my good friends a few months ago, which led to some serious trust issues on my side, and I now have difficulties talking to people I trust about things like this, because I feel like everyone will betray me. So I came here to vent, and I really needed it. Thanks for letting me vent.",15Jan2020,1

181,"TW

The very first day of school I noticed that something was off with my teacher. She seemed uninterested in teaching, which is common, but uncommon in teachers her age. Also she went to school with greasy hair. She was always pale and had very deep eye bags. I noticed she had scars on her arms that seemed from self-harm. Last day she came to class and started crying because some kids were being mean. She was paler than usual and had much deeper eye bags.

I know that her mental health is not my business but I think she needs help and some other classmates think that too. I don’t know who should we talk to in this situation. The head teacher, the principal, the teachers on her same department? If she gets help she’ll be able to stop working and keep receiving payment while recovering so I don’t think she’s not getting help because of money, you can get free therapy as a teacher in my country. I don’t know, it seems like she could commit suicide and I think about her parents and stuff, I get uncomfortable, I am a sensitive person. Should we, as students, do something about it?",15Jan2020,1
184,"Be warned, this is very long. TL;DR at the end.

For context, I’m an 18 year-old girl and in my last year of highschool.

Lately I’ve been feeling a whole range of negative emotions, from anger and frustration, to sadness and numbness, and I feel like I have no way to get rid of them. I’m usually a very optimistic person, happy-go-lucky, and able to make the best out of any situation, no matter how shitty it is, so this descent into a spiral of negativity really doesn’t fit my personality at all. And I hate it.

Now, these feelings didn’t just wash over me for no reason. Being a senior in highschool, I’m at that time in my life when I have to figure out what I want to do with my future and I feel like, no matter what I choose, it’s gonna amount to nothing. I’m not stupid by any means and I’ve always had good grades but I hate studying with my entire heart and soul. I hate having to stare at a book for hours just to pass exams that don’t have any real impact on my life other than giving me a diploma, a piece of paper that also won’t really help in the field of work that I’m thinking of pursuing. Regardless, I still want to go to college, mainly because the one I chose will require me to move somewhere else and I see it as an opportunity to start anew. My real problem here is that I don’t know how to make studying easier and more efficient. For my whole life I was able to understand the material in class so I never really had to sit down and go over lessons a hundred times to pass tests, but now there is just so much to learn that I simply can’t do that anymore. This leads to me feeling like I’m bound to fail my exams and not get into college, which, in turn, only adds to my hopelessness.

Not only am I incredibly stressed and anxious about school and my future, but I’m having some issues with my friendships and family life that I can’t seem to solve. I’m not very close with people at school, but there are a few kids that I usually hang out with. Most of them don’t cause me any trouble but my two closest friends have been hurting me severely for the past few months. My best friend, let’s call her Rose, and my other friend, who I’ll call Poppy, are completely disregarding my presence and treating me like a third wheel. Here’s a little backstory: Rose and I are (or were) very close. I felt really safe talking to her about anything and I genuinely believed she had my best interest at heart, and I’d like to think she felt the same way about me. Poppy was a good friend of ours but Rose and I have always been the BFFs. However, in the past couple of years Poppy did some very shitty and manipulative things to Rose, which entirely changed our opinions of her and prompted both of us to severely distance ourselves from her. Rose chewed my ear off about how much of a huge piece of shit Poppy is, how much she hates her, and how she never wants to talk to her again. Well, guess what? Poppy apologized to Rose and cried a few times in front of her. This made Rose forgive her and decide to give her another chance. Obviously, I tried to question her decision, considering how much she seemed to despise Poppy before, but she told me that she wants to be forgiving and not hold grudges against anyone. I personally think there is a big difference between letting go of grudges and going back to someone who emotionally abused you. The two of them started getting even closer than they were before the fight, and I seem to completely have lost my friendship badge. This is taking a toll on my mental health because I considered Rose to be my sister, even my family accepted her just as if she was one of ours. Now I barely talk to her anymore and at school she is almost always talking to Poppy, with her back turned to me. I lost some friends over the years but very few of them have hurt me on this level, mostly because I’ve always had someone else to fall back on. Besides Rose, I don’t have any other close friends, so I don’t know what to do. I tried telling her that I feel ignored and that it bothers me to see her so close with someone who made her feel so used, but she told me that it wasn’t her intention to make me feel left out and she hung out with me for a few days before going back to Poppy.

Something else that bothers me about Rose, no matter how much I love her, is the fact that she is a huge hypocrite. I ended a friendship a couple years ago and she supported me through the “break-up”, always making sure to talk me out of trying to mend it back together, saying that this person hurt me and they don’t deserve me. Rose takes pride in “how loving and forgiving she is”, and she sees herself as this kind of benevolent angel that senses when people suffer and drops everything to help them. I used to see her like that too, and I really think that, deep down, that’s exactly who she is. However, I’ve been suffering for months, because of her, and literally standing next to her everyday, and she doesn’t even seem to notice.

I told my mom about this entire situation and her advice is to ignore them and fall back on my family. I know she means well by saying this, but it’s not helpful at all and only adds to my feeling of isolation. I feel trapped in my family. My parents were very strict as I was growing up, and although they loosened up over the years, I still hate how much of my childhood I missed out on because of them. I’m sorry if this sounds mean, but they are boring people. I understand that after you work 8 hours a day you don’t really feel like jumping up and down, but they never do anything other than laying on the couch either watching TV or being on their phones. I don’t have anything against them doing that, but, damn. I want to do stupid teenager activities, not watch the weather. Whenever I try to sit with them, they somehow end up either insulting me, or scolding me about my life decisions. This is why I can’t follow my mom’s advice. I’m already upset; how am I gonna get better by allowing them to add even more to that? Besides that, my relationship with my dad isn’t the greatest and I try to avoid conversation with him as much as possible, so making a best friend out of him is just impossible. I’m an only child, so no help from any siblings either.

The issues I have with my parents bleed into the financial aspect of life. My mom’s parents are both sick and can’t really take care of themselves, so she has to cook for them and clean their house every weekend. All of that out of our own budget. I always hear my parents complain about how much money it costs to repair stuff around my grandparents’ house, to drive back and forth every week, and to buy their medicine. I’m not very close to my grandparents but we get along; either way, I’d never make my mom choose between me of them, but this bothers me. I’ve had my laptop for a few years and it’s having some problems. I’ll need a better one for college anyway, so I asked her if she could help me buy one. She yelled at me. Later she told my dad, and he also yelled at me. I tried to explain that the laptop I have right now won’t last very long anyway and they blamed me for not taking care of it. I hate to say this, but this makes me feel somewhat neglected, since it happened multiple times. The situation made me cry and I guess that softened my mom’s heart a bit since she agreed to get me a new one in the spring. I really understand where they’re coming from with this whole money thing, but I can’t help but think that I don’t deserve to be put on the backburner like this. I’d understand if they sat me down and calmly explained the situation to me. I’m completely fine with saving money on my own, but I hate the fact that they yell at me whenever I ask for help, and then act like they want to be my friends. Am I a bad person for feeling this way?

This laptop thing matters more than you might think. Since I seem to not have friends anymore, I’ve been spending a lot more time online and fell into the videogames rabbit hole. I also consider video editing to be my favorite hobby and perhaps even a talent. With my laptop breaking down, these two activities that made me happy are becoming impossible to take part in until I get a new setup. Typically, I’d be perfectly fine ditching my computer for a couple months, but now I feel like an amputee with no crutches in sight. I don’t know what to do. I don’t have any other hobbies and I really don’t like going out by myself, so I feel like I’m imprisoned in my house.

My physical health is suffering because of all this stuff, too. I’m getting headaches and mild chest pain and I’m having a lot of trouble sleeping. Last night I had a dream so vivid and real that I’m afraid it might have actually been a hallucination, but I’m not sure. I had panic attacks in the past and when I’m under immense stress I tend to have full-blown mental breakdowns.

I have a history of self harm, but I’m proud to say I’ve been clean for such a long time that I lost count of the days. I don’t want to fall back into that habit, but I fear that if these feelings of hopelessness persist, I will end up there again. I know suicide won’t make anything better and there are a lot of future events that I wouldn’t want to miss, but I’d prefer to be on autopilot for a while.

I’m assuming your first piece of advice would be to either talk to my parents of to a school counselor. My parents are out of the question since my dad doesn’t care and my mom’s only advice is “ignore it”. About the school counselor: she is a nice and welcoming person, but whenever I went to her for mental health advice, she always made me feel like my issues were not a very big deal. For example, I told her that I’m showing symptoms of ADD and she said I just need to spend less time on my phone, which I rarely use anyway. I don’t want her to discredit my issues since my current state is the lowest point I’ve ever been at and the last thing I need is someone to tell me that I’m overreacting. A psychologist/psychiatrist/therapist outside of my school is also unlikely, since mental health treatments are expensive and don’t fall under my health insurance; also my parents wouldn’t take me seriously if I told them I need to see a psychiatrist.

I don’t know what do to. I feel like I’m stuck in a horrible cycle with no way out. No matter what I do, it seems like I always end up in a bad place. I know it gets better, I’ve experienced that on my own skin. I just don’t know how to kickstart that process and diminish this feeling of hopelessness that I can’t seem to shake.

TL;DR: My entire life is falling apart (school, friends, family) and it makes me feel extremely hopeless. It’s starting to make me physically sick. Besides talking to my parents and a counselor, what can I do to make this better?",15Jan2020,1
185,"Ok, so, im going to start this of by saying that I dont think im suicidal.. I dont care enough to do it, what keeps me from doing it is that I would want to see the reactions of the people that wronged me, the suprise of the people I know...

I think im incapable of feeling motivation, I can fake but I dont feel real motivation, I know i could feel it when i was a kid but now i could die and I wouldn't care.. everything is a bother and id rather do nothing than anything at all, the reason I do things is because thats what is socially acceptable and people will give you an earfull if you don't.

I have hobbies but i absolutely detest them i would honestly rather be hit by a car than doing them, i only do them because thats what is expected of me.

I don't care what happens to people around me and my opinion can completely make a 180 degree turn, example: i can wish death on a person because im annoyed at them, i dont say or do anything because that is what is expected of me. What should I do... what is wrong with me?",15Jan2020,1
186,"I am a 19 year old male, freshman in college at a university. I don’t exactly come from a poor family, but my parents aren’t the best with money. Nevertheless, I’ve never done without something I’ve needed. So I am lucky I’m that sense.

I’m currently within the first two weeks of my second semester at college. So far my entire time here has been a fucking mental battle. I have one good friend whom I love, and a couple acquaintances. I do enjoy college sometimes, but the average day consists of forcing myself to get out of bed around 9-10 am, going to lectures, getting coffee around 12, and everything is fine. 

But by 3-4 pm every day I slip into this kind of sad, exhausted, depressing and anxious state where all I do is overthink and reminisce in the past.

Now get ready, because I’m about to tell an arguably embarrassing story, but it is the truth.

I have generalized anxiety, major depression, and ADHD. Sometimes I feel like the only time I enjoy is either when I’m comfortably buzzed from alcohol or weed, off Ritalin, or the 30 minutes of caffeine high after some good coffee with my friend.

I may be only 19, but I swear I peaked in high school. This is fucking dumber to think about when you take into account I was homeschooled and an introvert.

However, my years from 12-18 consisted mostly of swimming for my club team. As my career progressed I become popular and loved by everyone because I was good looking, ripped, funny, hard working and respectable, and moderately good at the sport. The girls all loved me, the younger kids looked up to me, my coach called me his self-proclaimed “best friend,” and the guys my age and I were all one tight great friend group. Like brothers.

Now even though I suffered moderate depression and anxiety during my high school years, I gotta say they seem like they were, and probably will be, the best years of my life.

But here I am in college. I can’t tell the whole story but not only do I miss high school, swimming, home, my friends and family,  and the massively lower pressures of high school, but I also miss two things that really make me feel like a dumbass.

1. I miss the social hierarchy of high school. Yes. I miss it. I miss being at the top of it. I miss girls who actually put effort into their grooming and physical shape. I miss the clout I got for good grades and being an athlete. I miss bonding with friends over the overly emphasized competition of sports.  

2. There is a girl. She’s a fucking junior right now. I had a crush on her for years but she and I never dated because we were both shy and dumb. I miss the shit out of her. We tried dating summer of my senior year but we both realized it wouldn’t work because I was going to college. But I’m not over her and this is causing me terrible heart break because we both like each other but the different stages of life we’re in make it hopeless.

So here I am. My happiness is fragile as all hell, my expectations for life are unrealistic if I even know what they are anymore. I’m always fucking exhausted. I can’t sleep at night... probably because my ADHD/anxiety combination makes me live in a constant state of overthinking. I can’t ever be happy bc all I do is reminisce in nostalgia and miss my friends and family back home and my old life and think about this fucking girl. 

I guess I function ok because my grades aren’t terrible and I’m managing to pull off moderately good performance in my club swimming, even without a coach. 

But by around 3 pm everyday I feel like this and it doesn’t end until I manage to fall asleep by 2-4 am.

I feel fucking miserable.

TL:DR:
I’m depressed, anxious, have bad ADHD, am overly sentimental, heartbroken, and basically feel miserable and hopeless for arguably no good reason.

Is this normal? Is there help for me?

I’m on symbalta but it doesn’t seems to work. If anything, my first semester on it I went through an existential crisis and contemplated suicide for the first time in my life.

187,"

Well, first of all I don’t really like to be that guy who complains about his issues that he may or may not actually be having, but I felt as if I should just say this to get other peoples opinions, because I haven’t said this much to anyone ever before, and it’s bottled up for far too long . For the past 2 years now I’ve been Seeing a decline in my motivation and really all around purpose of what I’m doing, I constantly get existential crisis’ along with a very rough questioning of what I could’ve done better. I overthink my existence and I regret a lot of decisions I make, and along with that I really don’t make my family as proud as they should be of me. Along with these things I have a bad problem of second-guessing myself and really just having bad self trust at all.

I’ve lost a lot of people and pets in my life and family and some of them even helped me out with some of these issues, they gave me something to love, care and cherish for, but now that they’re gone, it’s just very bland. Sometimes I really don’t even think and I just do some tasks are other things because I have to. Life has become a tedious chore with no end result, and I only see it as a repeating process. Many times that I socially interact with family or others, I unconsciously act as if there is nothing wrong, and I try to make them laugh or at least feel comfortable with me. I’ve made lots of friends, and I’m very grateful to have them in my life, I just don’t understand what’s wrong with me, I don’t know why I’m not happy. Several points of the day aren’t even filled with dread, my body and mind just molds itself into an emotionless husk, not feeling sadness or happiness.

I really try to talk to others, but I often make into an awkward situation. I’m very nervous and anxious when talking to the opposite sex, not sure why, and it’s not fully because I am attracted to them. For the loved ones I have with me now, I constantly get paranoid that I’ll lose them quickly and unknowingly, and that I’ll lose my chances to spend time with them while I’m still alive. Without my family, I’m not in touch with those i am friends with, and the chances of any fun moments to spend with them are very low. When I’m alone, in my home or in bed, the feeling is both comforting and painful, my heart and chest suddenly ache, and it makes it feel as if my entire torso is going inward. On one end, I have nobody to talk to and no one to interact with. But on the other, I can’t make an idiot of myself around them, and I won’t become a disappointment to their faith or expectations in me. It feels good to cry, after it’s done, I don’t have anything else to hold back. Crying also makes me tired and sleepy, and it allows me to get better rest. Sometimes I don’t know what the tears are about, the day may be absolutely fine, but on the inside I feel the need to let it out. 

I’ve had suicidal thoughts at times, but fortunately it never came to actual planning or taking action to directly harming myself, and to this day it hasn’t reached that point. Along with the thoughts on what I’d be like if I were dead, or didn’t exist at all, a wave of guilt always hits me while having these thoughts, the guilt of how I would effect those who I cherish and love. If I were to be dead, that would be it, no going back. And that is one of the main reasons I haven’t committed suicide, the second reason being that if afraid of not existing. Heaven, hell, eternal darkness, or eternal sleep are all terrifying thoughts on what eventually needs to come.

I really just needed to get this weight of my shoulders and allow others to respond with feedback, because I know now how unhealthy it has made me to bottle up these things, and how it’s slowly killing me inside.",15Jan2020,1

Even if it's something I know I already enjoy, I immediately start feeling... hate? towards whatever it is they told me to check out. Like, I don't want to look at it at all and doing so makes me feel... bad. Like anger, or just generally feeling upset. 

An example occurred just this morning. My boyfriend asked me to check out the new Pokemon animation that went up on YouTube, and I LOVE LOVE LOVE Pokemon! But I started getting this ugly feeling deep inside and didn't want to watch it. I tried to force myself to watch it, and it's beautifully animated and looks like something I would really enjoy, but the feeling just wouldn't go away and I decided to save it for later on. Just because it was suggested by someone else. Also, I adore my boyfriend. We have our little spats, but we have wonderful communication and always work things out, so it's not because I have something against him. I'm just so confused.

192,"i have a tendency to lose interest in therapy or doctor visits after i feel good. 

I've been on Zoloft 200mg x Risperdal 2mg (2017-present) lowered to 1mg a few months ago.

I was also diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) in 2017, in 2018 i saw a second psychiatrist and the diagnosis remained, however Borderline Personality traits and Antisocial/NPD personality traits were also added due to my dysfunction in relationships and longstanding behavior of denial, unstable emotion, manipulation, anger, etc.

on Christmas day i had a few bad days where i was obsessing and worrying if someone close to me would die, this was too consuming. I finally felt reprieve. On January 6, i experienced a very bad episode again relating to relationships and fantasies, i experienced severe derealization, Anxiousness, Obsession and complusion, lowered mood, feeling 'blue'.

193,"I've posted on this subreddit for awhile about my deteriorating mental health, and I finally checked myself into a looney bin six days ago.  I thought I'd be there longer but it was almost a week so I guess that's long enough.  It wasn't the most fun experience but it wasn't terrible either.  I feel like I got a lot of help and I'm surprised that I feel better coming out of it than going in.

Things I disliked:

The strip search.  I tried to get out of it but the doctor and orderly performing it told me to ""just get it over with"".  Had to get totally naked for a minute, thankfully there was no shit like cavity searches.  It was uncomfortable for everyone I can tell from their faces and thankfully was over with in no time.  

The closed and sterile setting creeped me out.  Everything was so clean and so safe, its not what Im used to.  I know it's a hospital but it's still weird.

Bed times, as an adult I actually had a bed time.  Most of the time I didn't sleep and I didn't sleep much at all during the six days I was there, and would fall asleep during group therapy and even individual therapy lol.  I tried to leave my room at night and just walk around but was (politely) told by orderly I cant do that and they gave me more magazines and books to read than Ive read in years.  When you dont have a phone, things get really boring fast.

No cursing.  I was told this in the common area that I curse too much and to not use f bombs and to stop cursing like a sailor.  When I first refused, they threatened to take me back to my room.  And we were all adults.

The showers were communal.  Had to shower with three other guys, blegh it was not fun.

I had to make a pledge to not self harm and not attempt escape (I voluntarily went in but still needed a discharge to leave) and told me if I got violent and assaulted anyone, they would press charges.  I felt like I was in prison when they told me that.

They made me eat enough to stop losing weight, and the food was not very good.  They thought I might be developing an eating disorder.  Having to scarf down hospital food is not the most pleasant of experiences but at least they gave you a choice what to eat.  Ate a lot of seafood.


Things I liked:

I liked actually being able to talk to psychologists and psychiatrists all the time.  I thought they would be condescending and rude, but they were understanding and nice and they really wanted to help me.  I basically spilled my guts and told them everything, and they told me ways to deal with self-harm and tried meds on me that I'm now taking and are actually working, it frankly surprises me.

The orderly were actually very nice.  I asked the orderly who escorted me to my room what do I do to not be on their bad side, they said just don't get in trouble and we won't mess with you.  Surprisingly I had no bad experiences with them minus them telling me to stop cursing and one time disconnecting my phone because I wouldn't get off of it.  That was also an annoying aspect, I'd call my girlfriend or brother and they'd get mad if it was over 20 minutes.  Was very annoying not having my own phone.

The visiting hours were generous, my girlfriend visited me every day and it'd be for around an hour.  Helped me through the isolation.  I assumed it'd just be once a week and just be between glass like in a jail.  

I drew a lot.  A lot of group therapy was fun and stimulating, I thought it'd just be fruity nonsense I wouldn't be able to use.  But I drew a lot to express myself.  I guess kind of childish but I liked doing it.

The patients were nice, I was in a part with suicidal and self harm patients and they weren't mean or violent and my roommate was pretty nice, he was just 19 and he was going through a lot of rough stuff, we would talk sometimes after bed time for a few hours and we became pretty friendly.

I feel like the medication and the cognitive behavorial therapy has really helped me.  Only time will tell, but I think this was the right choice to make.

They told me not to hesitate calling back and checking myself in again if I need to, Im surprised they didn't want me out as soon as possible.

Overall, I'm glad I did it, but it still felt like I was in a cushier jail.  But I think it saved my life, for now anyway.

They set me up with a new therapist and psychiatrist and hopefully things work well with them.  So hey, I'm not dead, not yet anyway!  All I could ask for.",15Jan2020,1

please be aware that i plan to be as open as possible.  


I do suffer from mild depression, severe anxiety and I'm a slight hypochondriac. It's caused from traumatic relationships in the past. On 2 separate occasions with two different women, they fell pregnant with my children, The first time, was genuinely an accident, we were both young (15&amp;14) and I would have stood by my girlfriends decision to abort the child; however, I was never made aware of the pregnancy and she aborted it. I found out because her mother abandoned her (kicked her out) (highly religious) and came to my house telling me that I was scum etc. This lead to trust issues with me and after a couple years I got with someone else, we got drunk, unprotected sex, got preggo and bam she announced it to me and I was happy - due to the fact she was happy about it. Things were well and about a month later she told me she had a miscarriage. I, like a dumb fuck consoled with her and tried my absolute best to comfort her. A month later her sister and I got drunk and she let loose that she actually had an abortion. (because her parent's were religious.) Now obviously trusting people is hard, but when it comes to other people who've been in similar situations, losing kids due to miscarriage/abortion, I simply lack empathy. I started losing empathy for anyone that succumbed to a bad situation. Nobody cared both times I lost my children so why should I care. I see poor people in the street and I just don't care. My dad could be diagnosed with cancer and I just wouldn't care. I just want to work, eat bad food and drink as much as I can to literally die faster. I don't want sex/love/marriage/children/relationships. I hate people with kids, i hate people who ask me when I'm going to have kids etc. I don't care what happens to other people, I just don't give a fuck. I used to though... But now i'm like this I can't go back and it just makes me feel like even more of an obsolete person. My depression caused me to want to drink, so I do, daily. My anxiety prevents me from getting a job, I do try but the anxiety shows, and in turn ignites the depression and that also shows. This ultimately makes me look like a weak link and I'm slowly shoved aside. I wonder every day if someone out there knows how I feel, I guess i'm desperate for some assurance that my lack of empathy isn't just me. I've never seen a doctor about it, because, I used to go a lot because I was a severe hypochondriac at one point, and eventually the doctors just started laughing at me and that severely knocked my confidence and trust with doctors. I know I need professional help, but i'm afraid, I'm annoyed and I'm really, really upset that I can't.   


As i say, I suffer from mild-moderate depression, I don't have thoughts of killing myself with means such as hanging/cutting/overdose/toaster-in-the-bathtub etc., unless you count slow death via. substance abuse. I just don't know what to do anymore.",15Jan2020,1
197,"I know, I know. I dont consider my self as being in a broken down mental state, just that I caused my self to go into one in the Summer of 2019, wasting my whole summer over being sad over a relationship that barely lasted, and I still blame myself for being a wuss and wasting the whole summer that couldve been amazing!

I like the music that I liked back then, but now it just makes me kinda sad/question life. I'm not depressed, and never considered myself being depressed. Just get sad occasionally.


Is there anyway I can put my self into a positive state listening to the same music and not get emotional, I just randomly get emotional, not because of the ""break-up"" as I considered it back then. I agree, It was a mistake from my point by getting into a relationship and not being prepared, but at least now I guess I've learned?


Many thanks! 😁",15Jan2020,1

Hello,

I'm working on a school project to see if apps could better help people with anxiety and panic attacks. I decided to do this project after missing a call from my friend at 5am when she was having a panic attack. As someone who suffers from them, I know how much it sucks to suffer without someone there. I need to interview a few people about their experiences, so if anyone is willing to help, I would really appreciate it.

Thanks very much for any help!",15Jan2020,1
199,"I (20F) grew up with a mother (63F) that cannot accept her own mistakes. Being raised in an abusive environment with two younger sisters my grandparents clearly liked better, I can see why she has remained that way.
Unfortunately over the years this has contributed to me internalizing very unhealthy ways of thinking and acting. I cannot bear the pain of hurting someone else even if it wasn't on purpose, the thought of having caused an inconvenience to another person makes me panic. If I misunderstand someone on reddit I feel the need to apologise a billion times, and whenever my mother gets just slightly angry it drags me down for days. It's especially bad when I'm in a student-teacher environment as I feel an intense pressure to not disappoint the teacher. Back in school I got praised for being so mature and apologetic, when in fact I was just afraid of misbehaving and disappointing others. It's less pronounced with my boyfriend because he's very understanding and I trust him when he says I didn't upset him when I think I do.
I basically make myself the perpetrator, rather than the victim, in a conflict situation. My thoughts spiral into how I could have prevented this, what I did wrong, whether I am at fault. 
Due to external circumstances (anxiety and panic disorder diagnosis, high cost of living...) I have to live at home with my parents for the time being. I live in the basement.
Unfortunately my mum's and my personality clash terribly, and whenever I do something my mother perceives as unacceptable (e.g. telling her to please not go through my stuff while I'm away) she becomes verbally aggressive and starts to play games (in this case banning me from entering my parents part of the house). She's the type of person who doesn't tell you when she wants something, she just wants me to read her and gets upset when I fail to do so. She let's her emotions affect her actions directly and feeling her anger makes me want to die. My father (65M) disagrees with her behaviour but he's not opposed her until today, where he promised me to talk to her.

My mother is not a bad person, quite the opposite, but I wish I could somehow be less affected by her attitude until I can move out. She's so understanding and supportive when it comes to my mental health, but I am afraid of telling her that she might have contributed to my anxiety.
My therapist has helped me realize this whole pattern, but I'm just not sure how to escape this way of thinking, especially as long as I am in daily contact with my mother? Has anyone here dealt with a similar situation in the past and can offer advise as to how to stop blaming myself?",15Jan2020,1

202,"I can not remember a moment where I was truly happy, I honestly do not know if I am capable of feeling it for more than short moments here or there. My parents neglected me, I grew up homeschool and isolated, then moved out at 18 because my parents divorced and sold our house, rendering me homeless. My fiance who emotionally cheated on me several times has emotionally cheated again and left me. My ex fiance and I have a child together and honestly he is the only thing keeping me going. My fiance just told me she doesnt want me in her life and if it wasn't for our son she would never talk to me again. I do not feel loved, I do not feel like I ever get back the work I put into people, infact most of the time I get betrayed. 

I have been in therapy for almost 2 years and on anti depressants for about a year now also. I am meditating, exercising, and many other mental experiences to make me feel better, it does for a short time then it's right back to normal. All I have ever known is living with my depression, feeling alone, being unlovable. I dont want to suffer through this life anymore but I can not leave my son behind. I am alive because I have to be, but I so not want to live anymore. I dont know what to do because I feel like I have tried everything.

204,"Hello, good afternoon. I (21F) want to die. I have nothing to live for. Life has been completely shit. I fail at everything; school, my suddenness to move to a new city which has resulted to me taking a huge loss financially, my friends.  I have depression and anxiety, and I’m just emotionally detached most of the time. I hate living like this and nothing I seem to do helps. I don’t have any hobbies nor do I know what to do with my life. And to top it off, I want to break up with my boyfriend (M22) of six months.

205,"Hey, so I’ve finally somewhat built up the courage to finally seek some advice in some way with things and sorry in advance for the massive vent and if it all sounds like a big sob story… The last 6+ years of my life since finishing high school have been rough and I never expected it would be this bad, particularly the last 2-3 years and by no means am I saying I have it worse than everyone else as a disclaimer. I’m male and 24 now, I have little to no friends (probably only about 2-3 actual friends currently - I have had some fall outs with previous friends over the years) and these friends of mine already are a lot more popular and have heaps of their own friends anyway when they’re all I have, so they have much less time for me than I do for them and half the time I feel like these friends just use me anyway, therefore I don’t really end up socialising much unfortunately even though I would like to. I have been single for about 7 years now since high school (this was my only relationship ever) and even over these past years I haven’t really had many hook-ups or been on many dates either and I’m pretty lonely these days. I’ve mostly tried dating apps over these years so many times over and over to the point at which it's embarrassing, since I don’t really have the opportunity to meet people in person much and this has had very little success (tinder, bumble, hinge – you name it). I’ve probably been on only about 2 dates in this whole time and after each date I've been ghosted or cut off. So quick description of me, I try to take relatively good care of myself, I work out and am reasonably athletically built, decent face I guess and average height and Im usually pretty ok with talking to people too if that and can be confident where necessary if that helps to describe me a bit.

What makes this even worse is that I graduated college (business degree and want to get into marketing) almost 2 years ago now and have since really struggled to land a graduate role or job or even experience in my field (I currently still work my part time hospitality job which I’ve had for years so I at least have some income – I hate it but need the money). The worst part about this is I’ve almost graduated too long ago to be eligible for any graduate positions let alone jobs and I’m not even a very favourable candidate for internships either since I’m no longer studying (I tried to land interns while studying but still wasn’t successful after a countless amount of applications) – so now I’m slowly falling into more and more debt etc.

It's hard considering all my friends a lot of people I know are quite successful at this point, doing what they want, are in relationships and have plenty of friends and I feel like I keep getting left more and more behind and that Im getting nowhere.

Over these years I’ve tried various hobbies, through my last few jobs and tried making friends when I was at college but never really had any luck and also of course dating apps with my relationship issues which has also been pretty much successful too as I find people just don’t like me, and in terms of work its practically been a second job for me constantly looking for work, applying, reaching out, seeking advice etc.

If anyone is or has been in a similar position or has some ideas, I would love your advice, as I’m kinda at the point where I really don’t know what to do anymore… 

Thanks :)",15Jan2020,1

Ever since I was little this has been happening. My mom is an alcoholic who has been drunk everyday of my life. She had embarrassed me and my family like no other she has beaten me a few times while she was drunk but I was to afraid to do anything and I still am. My father works for all of us (there's 5 of us) he was okay at first but as time passed, he became worse.my dad is convinced my mom cheated so when I was little he didn't alove me to call him dad, he would yell at me for no reason and of course I didn't understand why.As time passed nothing pleased him they kept fighting everyday (there where times where my mom was screaming for help, no one called the cops, there was a time she screamed for me to call the cops but I was too scared) that left me scared deeply. My little brother is 6 currently he's to only reason I haven't killed myself,there where too many times to cound where he would come crying to me asking if everything was gonna be okay. He was injured once (couple of schraches) while trying to get in beetwen them. My father became more and more mean to me as time passed my grades dropped and my mental health became worse, when I finally had the guts to tell my mom that I wanted to see a therapist she called me crazy. My dad would bully me about my weight (if I where you I'd kill myself, throw yourself off a bridge, how aren't you embarrassed to leave the house, ect) as my grades dropped he would beat me more, he dropped me off at my grandmas house a couple of timees but he came back every time. Today like any other day he yelled at my mom, he told her that he's taking her to church to promise and pray that she won't drink again, and if she does that he will take her to rehab. Of course he had to yell at me for eating (I Mostly eat once a day, and I maybe get a snack while they aren't looking to avoid him) I'm sensetive, when I was eating he began again ""i get embarrassed when I see you, you're so disgusting"" so I started to cry when he saw thin he began to beat me my hand still hurts. I was bulimic and when my friend found out she told the teacher, who told my mom and my mom just laughed and yelled at me that I'm a crazy bitch who wants attention.

Its never that I’ve broken it so badly that that it can’t be fixed its when it’s only slightly broken. For example over the summer I became absolutely convinced that one side of my earphones was quiter than the other, and it drove me fucking crazy. Every time I put them on I would obsess about how one ear was quiter than the other. It was one of the most horrible feelings ever. My family all said that they heard no real difference which made it even worse. Another example is my pc. While I do love it I sometimes feel that it is too much effort for what I get out of it. I have spent so many hours banging my head against the wall in infuriation. I cannot tell you how long I’ve spent trying to work it out. I spent so long (and still do) trying to figure out what was wrong with it as I felt personally it was underperforming. I upgraded every part and was still unsatisfied and fucking miserable. Other examples was my mouse and my my mouse pad in which I went through around 5 mouse pads and mice as I was convinced they were all broken. More recently I feel things have definitely gotten worse. I don’t drink milk within 3 days of the drink by date, I started turning my downstairs light off four in fear of bad luck, whenever I’m given any food of any type I’m always convinced something is wrong with it e.g different brand, reheated ect and I also have been frustrated by my airsoft gun which I can’t for the life of me figure out if its broken.
