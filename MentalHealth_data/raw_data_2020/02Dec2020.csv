0,"I was physically/emotionally/mentally abused as a child. My worldview had been so distorted by this that I accepted it as perfectly normal, up until the age of 22, when i realised the situation around me.

This is my first post. I don't know the words. But I feel so alone, and so damn scared. I don't know what it feels like to be loved, really loved. I've never had a proper friendship. Most of the people in my life have no idea about my past. And every time i try to get close to someone, I feel them pull away from me.",02Dec2020,1
1,"I get this really bad with sounds such as chewing, kissing and whistling and slurping. It actually makes me want to tell profanities at the offender and be violent. It makes it hard to be around a lot of people and even my partner who doesn't realise or mean any harm. It's hard to manage it without coming across as an asshole because at best I just leave the room which can still appear rude.",02Dec2020,1
2,"Firstly, I am aware you’re not professionals. I’m sharing what I feel in hopes of finding people who are diagnosed and who experience/d these symptoms, so that I can learn more about it. If I could afford a psychiatrist, therapist or go see a counselor (my school doesn’t have one) I would. I just want to know what I could possibly have.

I’m a 16 year old girl, I don’t smoke, drink or do any delinquent activities, and I’ve never been to therapy or been diagnosed with a mental illness before. My mom had severe OCD though.

I have violent mood swings that occur very often in a day, could be each 6 hours or even each 30 minutes. Nothing triggers these mood swings though. 


Also, I thought I’d say this because maybe it could be my potential mental disorder manifesting itself: I used to create fake profiles for no malicious intentions whatsoever, except to make friends and experiencing what life would be like if I was that person, as I’ve endured a long history pf bullying from my own family and friends. It’s a form of escapism. I don’t think I’m ugly. I’ve been told I’m pretty many times, I have my insecurities but this isn’t why I did it.


These mood swings do not result in me harming myself in any way, however. 

For the past 2 years, I’ve been feeling like people (who I don’t personally know, could be celebrities or people I used to like or just random people in general) are watching me at home when I’m by myself or with my family, and judging me for the most simple actions and tasks and daily necessities: Going to the toilet? Gross. Preparing a meal? You’re doing it the wrong way. Praying? Ridiculous (?) Dressing in a certain way? What the hell are you wearing. Taking a selfie? You’re not pretty/you look foolish. Listening to music? Your taste sucks. Reading a certain book (on wattpad)? What are you, 9? They basically ridicule literally everything I do. 

I don’t hear them or see them. I don’t feel like they’re speaking either. I only imagine them in ly head, I’m aware of that, except I can’y stop acting weird “around them”.

I started doing some some extremely normal stuff in the dark (like going to the toilet with lights off) so that they can’t see me. I’m worried about what they think or that they’re laughing at me to the point that I don’t even enjoy stuff I used to. And I even started talking to myself as if I was making clarifications and justifications to them regarding what I’m doing. For example, I could say “Ew, that’s really gross.” which will match what *they think of me* therefore they’d think it’s out of my control and won’t judge me for it.

Also, I don’t think these are exactly hallucinations but I sometimes see shadows with the corner of my eye, but I think it’s just as normal as mistaking a pile of clothes for a ghost.


Someone suggested I have social anxiety but I don’t act weird around actual people. I’m perfectly fine in crowds. I’m only anxious around those inexistent people. I read a lot about it online and I think I either have paranoia (I don’t believe anyone wants to harm me) or some schizophrenic/schizoïde/schizoaffective disorder. 

It’s taking over my life and my parents believe everything can be cured by following the path of god or whatever and don’t take my mental health seriously, and I can’t afford therapy myself. Please provide any helpful opinions.

As I said I’m well aware you aren’t professionals. I’m just gathering information and opinions to look for methods to maybe reduce these symptoms until I can afford therapy. 

I know I’m a minor, but I’m sadly a part of a society that doesn’t prioritize mental health for kids nor adults or teens, there’s so much stigma surrounding it. 

If there’s any therapist in this subreddit who’s willing to only direct me to the right path so I could have accurate information, (I’m not asking for treatment), I’d highly appreciate that.

Take care.",02Dec2020,1
3,"Hi there, 
Im a 20 year old girl who was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) 2 years ago when I was 18, at the time I felt relief that I finally got some answers as I struggled with my mental health since I was a kid. For the past few months or so, I’ve been questioning my diagnoses, I’m not sure why, I often think I’m ‘faking it’ and I don’t know if that’s just a part of BPD. I was told about it slightly when diagnosed but not much information was given to me by health care professionals, I had to research myself which often leads to shit posts and false information etc. One health care professional also told me that I was too young to have BPD and that I can grow out of it which is why I think maybe I’m feeling this way. I know BPD can have similar symptoms to bipolar disorder and I did bring that up to my therapist but she brushed it off. I’m not sure if what I’m experiencing is mania or just the ups and downs of BPD, I know other’s opinions don’t matter but I think I’m looking for more guidance/opinions to maybe give me the courage and reassurance to push my therapist for more answers and closure. Here’s a list of what I’ve been experiencing it’s quite long, I apologise


talking over people
thinking of what to say when someone else is talking not focusing on what theyre saying 
interrupting 
listening to a few words out of a sentence and misinterpreting others
very gossipy 
arrogant/rude? 
finishing other people’s sentences
feeling very overwhelmed
very excited? yet tired 
anxiety 
telling myself ‘not to act like that’ as i know i can come across rude
feeling guilty and embarrassed
continuing to do it anyway
swearing a lot
talking about myself a lot
feeling very sensitive to what others are saying to me (i’m quite sensitive in general but even more so than usual)
feeling/acting like someone is watching me in order to watch what i say or do e.g. feeling/acting like manager is watching me so i don’t say anything bad about him/work or when i was younger acting like my crush was watching me etc but i felt like it was deliberate because i knows they actually werent? i don’t know if that makes sense 
suicidal 
wanting people to feel sorry for me/attention seeking 
feeling tense/irritable 
can’t stay in a job 
blaming others for things i did 
unsure of likes/dislikes and self
physical symptoms of anxiety (vomiting, rashes)
strange repeating nightmares 
avoiding work when employed 
constant changing of appearance 
feeling disconnected from reality 
detached from self/out of body experiences/feel like i’m in a dream?

I’m sorry this was so long but I really am struggling atm with myself and my identity in general and I don’t know if I actually have BPD or maybe in a few days I will believe I do but I don’t really have anyone I can tell this to as I feel like I might push people away or make them worry, thank you :( - E x",02Dec2020,1

9,"I’m a 17M. I come from a pretty broken home. My parents are divorced and I essentially grew up without a father in my life as he never made an effort to parent me past making me train for sports I never even liked from the ages of 4-8.
My mother is very overbearing, and nothing I do is ever good enough. I’ve struggled with depression, and my mother tells me it’s a ploy for attention. I know that these events have changed me. I bottle up my emotions a lot. I feel like I’m living two lives: the one I see, and the one the world does. This has made me clingy in my romantic relationships, and every time someone starts pulling away or losing interest it hurts me more than most. 

I’m not sure what to do anymore honestly. Maybe it’s just me being a teen, and hormones going haywire, but I really feel like no one really knows me. I’ve only ever had a very small group of friends, and now that we’re seniors, they’ve been pulling away too, and my last close friends are pulling away too. I just feel really alone. I feel like I can’t talk to anyone about my problems, because they either don’t listen, or they tell me I’m being over dramatic. 

My mom does this and she wonders why I don’t talk about my issues. This is why I’ve been looking for a relationship. I’ve always wanted someone to be my rock. Someone I can always count on and tell anything without preemptive judgement. I’ve been single so long I’ve just given up. I mostly just feel undesirable and worthless. I know that may seem over the top but it’s true. It’s not even just girls, it’s the fact I’ve only really had 3 friends I trust in any capacity, and lots of superficial ones that fade after I stop having classes with them and such.

12,"It’s the most wonderful time of the year, but not for everyone....

Christmas can be an emotional rollercoaster for many people. Whether you celebrate Christmas or not, it can affect your Mental Health. It’s that time of the year that puts a little more extra pressure on our shoulders... will I have enough money? Will I buy the right gifts? Will I be able to spend time with my family? But, for some people, they don’t have a family to spend time with...

This can be for many reasons: 

- Falling out 
- Unfortunate deaths 
- Not enough money to travel and see family 
- COVID restrictions 

But, with or without family, people can still feel lonely during the festive season. Why? It’s known that the festive season brings out happiness and joy from people, it makes them happier. But, for some, this can make them feel lonely. Thousands of thoughts will enter their mind, for example *why can they be happy but not me?*, you’ll ask yourself thousands of questions until you realise the main reason you don’t deserve happiness... because “you don’t deserve it” or “I haven’t earned it”. 

People will also don’t want to celebrate Christmas as there are too many things going on in their current life. For example, family breaking down, relationships breaking down, Mental Health issues... and due to Christmas, extra added pressure are put on the person’s shoulders. As you are here with us, reading this post, your Mental Health may have or is currently affecting you. As I’ve explained at the beginning of the post, the Christmas period can affect your Mental Health on more than one way... 

- Your Mental Health is dragging you back and due to that, you’re not able to celebrate it how *you* want to. 
- During the Christmas period, it’s easily enough to get more stressed and in a panic mode. Because of this, it can affect your Mental Health even more. Thinking you’re not good enough and the gifts and presents is simply not enough for the people you love. 
- During Christmas, many services are harder to get in contact with. 
- New Years can also be a difficult for many. Instead of thinking about the future and the good times ahead, your mind goes back to the following years... all the pain, emotions, regrets and guilt comes rushing back into your mind. Instead of looking forward to the brand new, fresh year, your mind is stuck on the past and not able to move on. 

So, the main question many of you currently have in your head... **WHAT CAN I DO?!”. Firstly, don’t panic. If Christmas is a difficult time of the year for you, don’t stress, relax and remind yourself that you’re not alone. If you’re struggling at any moment, in need to talk to somebody or even asking for advice on what you can buy your family members, partner, friends... my PM’s are open and I’m happy to help. :) 

During Christmas, it’s important to... 

- Look after yourself 
- Always plan ahead 
- Get as much support as possible 
- Don’t Stress, don’t panic 
- Always give your best 
- If in doubt, talk to someone 

Be gentle with yourself. Sure, the past year as taught you many, many things, but it’s important to take those lessons in and learn from them. Whatever that’s going through your mind, remember that it’s there to improve you, to make you learn and to make you stronger in the future. 

My door is always open for you, don’t suffer the festive season alone, let’s work together to make this terrific sub a place to bring in people who feel alone. This place is a big family, we are here for one another and we will support you as much as possible. Thank you for reading! :)",02Dec2020,1

14,"This is... a lot. So bare with me. When I was younger I was taken advantage of by someone a few years older than me, and it completely changed my life. I’m talking smoking, drinking, failing school type changes. This person disguised themself as my friend, convinced me they were in love with me, and used me. I was only 12 and fell for the trick. 

A few years later I got into contact with them again and they told me they loved me, I fell for it once again and it ruined us both. But this time, they told me they were using me all along because I was an easy target. 

I wish I could explain my confusion. They told me “I’ve been using you all along” and then a few days later says “I didn’t mean that, you know how I really feel”. It seems so genuine that I cannot for the life of me tell what they really mean. I feel crazy at this point because I have myself convinced they’re madly in love with me and denying their feelings. Ever since that last exchange of “you know how I really feel” I have been waiting and hoping and praying to see them again. I call it infatuation. 

WHY DO I FEEL THIS WAY??? This person hurt me, used me, but I’m still setting a place for them at the dinner table (metaphorically). Why am I denying what’s right in my face? Or is my intuition right, does it know something that I don’t know, and she really loves me?

I understand how this seems absolutely insane. Mentally I’m doing okay, my life is arguably the best it’s ever been. But I’m through feeling this way, and I need help.

I suffer from some pretty severe anhedonia a lot of the time, so I have a lot of anxiety related to constant boredom, but don't actually want to do any specific thing, and don't have the energy to keep doing something if I force myself to try. The only thing I do consistently enjoy is spending time with my friends. I love playing board games and Dungeons and Dragons and just generally interacting with them. But we're all becoming responsible adults with lives and jobs, and many of them are moving away to places with more opportunity. Just last year, I was able to spend four or five days a week spending time with my favorite people, at least for a few hours. And nowadays I don't see anybody except my girlfriend and our roommate, except for every other weekend when we get together to play D&amp;D.

Don't get me wrong, I love those weekends. I love them so much that they make everything else feel so much worse. I'm so overwhelmingly happy when I get to see these people that it reminds me of how lonely and boring the rest of my life is. And I get really sad for a few days afterward. Like really sad. And whenever we have a big party where everyone comes around, and we get to play our favorite big party games, I almost can't take it. I get overwhelmed with how much better life is when these people are in it, and I'm reminded of how much happier I was when I was regularly seeing them all, and how awful and lonesome I feel nowadays. And I almost want to just stop seeing them altogether so that I don't have these big spikes of depression after the party is over.

I guess what I'm asking is, what should I do? Obviously the answer isn't ""stop spending time with friends,"" but this kind of ""happiness spike followed by days-long depressive episode"" isn't sustainable.",02Dec2020,1

26,"I (m20) have been in a relationship with my pwBPD(f19) for exactly 11 months now and i never thought that i would ever have to think about leaving her when i first fell in love with her. We met online at the end of last year and after less than a month of talking every day, i asked her to be my girlfriend and she immediately accepted and i couldn't have been happier. Our relationship has been entire long distance due to covid which probably enhanced a lot of problems that have surfaced during the last few months.

When i first met her she seemed absolutely perfect and every day i would stare at my phone just waiting for her to message me. I would literally be up all night until 6am in the morning talking with her (she lives in the us and I live in europe so there's a 6 hour time difference) and we never ran out of things to talk about. We had so many similar interests and she was always caring and supportive no matter how many times we clashed our heads about something. She would literally tell me that not every day has to be perfect and that everyone has bad days and that everything will always be fine as long as we're honest and as long as we always tell each other everthing. I don't have a lot of experience with relationships, this is only my second and the first one was a catastrophy, so i didn't see all the red flags that have been there since the beginning.

After we started dating she was very quick to tell me all about her past and everything she's gone through and she would always tell me that im the first person that she's ever told these things and that she didn't know why she felt so comfortable with me and why she trust me so much. She has been diagnosed with multiple disorders and mental health conditions like major depressive disorder, anxiety, stress disorder, PTSD, self harm and also BPD and others. The fact that she was diagnosed with BPD was only something that she told me after months of dating and she told me that she initially planned to tell me when we're with each other in person because she was scared that I'd leave her due to the reputation that BPD has. At the time i didn't know anything about BPD so i didn't think it was something that i couldn't fix for her or something that we could overcome and work on together. I have always from the start been in the Hero position of wanting to save her and wanting to take away all her pain and hurt that she ever had to experience, she's been sexually harassed by a family member and was in a sexually, mental and physical abusive relationship for 2-3 years before leaving that relationship. She's been stalked by multiple people and to this day someone from England (where she lived for a while after that relationship) is calling and texting her from fake numbers and harassing and threatening her. 

She lied about her identity when we first met, the first pictures she send me was from a girl that wasn't her and she also lied about her parents and where she lived. She didn't even tell me her real name until 6 months into our relationship but for some reason i just shoved all of these lies away because my feelings for her were so strong and i just couldn't believe that she had any ill intentions. She would always say it was for her safety because she was stalked that she uses a fake identity online and she ""forgot"" about telling me her real name because the name she gave me was a nickname that her old friends used to call her and she was so used to it that she didn't think about the fact that for half a year i wasn't even calling her by her real name. Nowadays I don't even know what I should believe anymore but i guess that's what reflecting on everything has done to me.

Since covid happened we've been in a call every second of every day and we even sleep with each other on call every night. We spend every second of every day together and I've seen her at her highest and her lowest and I have always done absolutely everything for her. I have never once left the call or ignored her or not been there for her, I've sacrificed everything (friends, family, university) for her and i never cared what i would have to do as long as i could make her happy and smile. I always believed i could erase her depression, anxiety and everything she's ever struggled with but it's obvious to me now that that's impossible. She's had many therapists for 8 years now and has taken multiple different medications for her depression and anxiety over the years. But from what I can tell she's never gone into treatment for her BPD, although she has told me that she wants to and i can honestly say that she definitely tries her best when it comes to getting better and overcoming her past and her struggles.

She is such a intelligent, beautiful, and overall perfect girl and it literally breaks my heart that she had to go through so much and that she has to struggle with all these things. But for the past few months her BPD has become visible even to me. She has become extremely impulsive to the point that she takes a handful of sleeping pills or pulls out her hair when she's anxious, she gets extremely loud at me when all im trying to do is to be there for her and help her, she leaves the call and puts me on the silent treatment for a few hours and she has admitted many times that she sees everything in black and white and that she can't control her emotions and impulsive behaviors. And that's one of the reasons why i don't know what to do.. she knows everything she's doing but it has only gotten worse over time. I have always believed when she apologized for her actions and how she treated me but nowadays she doesn't even really admit anymore how she acts.. and now comes something confusing.. I've read so much about people with BPD always blaming others for how they're feelings but she almost always puts everthing on herself and blames herself and gets extremely suicidal whenever we have the smallest disagreement or whenever there's something annoying or bothering her. She had attempted suicide many times before she met me due to her abusive relationship she was in and i can't even count the times that she has told me that she wants to die and that she wants to kill herself.. and one time it came extremely close to that..

I just don't know what to do anymore.. because I've been reading on this Reddit and online about BPD the last few days and so many things have become clear to me but i just can't get myself to leave her, she always says how she can't live without me and that I'm the best that has ever happened to me and that she will end her life if she ever loses me.. but the constant drama, jealousy (even though i have never had any female friends and the only girl that even gets close to me is my sister), and the ""I love you with all my heart and soul to death"" to ""you don't love me, noone can love me and i should die"" every single day has completed drained me mentally and physically. There's so much more i could say but it's already way too much text.. i just want to know what i should do especially with Christmas coming up and our one year anniversary and on top of that she's getting a surgery soon.. i never thought I'd have to make a decision like this and im simply overwhelmed to the point of no sleep and crying every single day and night..",02Dec2020,1
27,"I hear voices but I very much doubt it’s schizophrenia or anything like that. They’re not constant and it doesn’t happen when I’m stressed. I’m wondering if it’s because It has to do about something with me being alone? Maybe I’m not being social enough and it’s affecting me? Whenever I hear these voices, it’s always when I’m alone or almost alone.

When I was younger, I began hearing my grandparents talking downstairs so I’ll rush down to see if they made a surprise visit. They weren’t there. They live states away from me. This happened a few times before it just stopped for years. Then I heard them last year in 2019, my mother whispered my name into my ear but no one was there. Both of my parents were gone at the store and I was home alone. This happened more but at separate timing like a few days would go by and I’d hear my mom talking to me through the door while I’m taking a shower, then I realize that she’s not there. No one is there. But this week was different. I heard my dad call my name several times and at this point I can recognize which ones are real and which ones are fake, this one was fake.

28,"A year ago, I was binging fentanyl for about 11 months before I got sober on Nov. 13, 2019. It was the worst experience I've had suffering from addiction, and definitely one of the worst parts of my life. I'm only 18 and have lived my entire life surrounded by addiction. My mother, who raised me in and out of shelters, over-dosed when I was 12 and passed away. This grief sent me into my own downward spiral during my high-school years and I ended up falling deep into a drug binge. 

What made the binge so scary was the withdrawal. I don't know too much about fentanyl from a clinical standpoint, but I do know that it's up there with the worst (Btw I didn't know it was fentanyl for a while as it was pressed into pills made to look like OxyContin). My tolerance skyrocketed (as I was doing it everyday for months at this point), and when I would withdrawal, I would go into a near panic-attack. This very uncomfortable feeling spread throughout my body and gave me the urge to walk around or sometimes even run. If I stopped moving, the feeling would be so intense I would begin to panic and breakdown. When I got sober, the feeling still remained. The doctors told me Restless Leg Syndrome was a common symptom of withdrawal, but I've never seen anyone look like they were experiencing it as intense as I was and my best friend and many other friends of mine were also seriously hooked on these pills, though truly, I don't know. 

Anyways, now, a year later, that restless feeling still has not gone away. It only goes away if I use. I wake up sweating and shaking, and it WILL NOT go away. I keep researching and everything says it's related to anxiety, while I am diagnosed with GAD and my symptoms can be severe, I still feel it no matter what mental state I am in. I am bi-polar, so even during mood-shifts or bouts of happiness, it still lingers and brings my mood WAY down again. I haven't felt a sense of true security, comfort, or pleasure since I got off the drugs. 

I saw a post on Reddit of someone experiencing something similar, and they stated it feels like ""a low electric current flowing through your body constantly."" That is the best way I can sum it up, but even that doesn't really describe it that well. It is driving me insane and I'm just wondering if anyone knows what could be going on. Is this just Restless Leg Syndrome? If so, why doesn't it ever ease or go away?",02Dec2020,1

They made up ridiculous &amp; disgusting rumours about me, which I care not to repeat, just assume the worst, you’re not that far off. The bullying left me with so much trauma that after I entered uni, I still can’t handle strangers laughing. My name has been associated with so much hate about myself that I graduated started to hate it, to the point that I feel discomfort when people call me by my full name.
It’s lucky that most of my friends refer to me/know me by my internet tag, which I identify more with. But my workplace mates still know me by my “real name”, and I just hate it. I feel inferior using that name.
I thought about changing my name but since even my surname gives me pain it would be a huge problem to change them both and they would mostly likely disapprove my request because no one cares enough. And my parents would freak out, they already freaked out once just because I want to move to another city.

I'm so tired of this shit, I've left the house 3 times in the last month.

44,"I made this account just today, I’ve always kind of creeped Reddit on other media but that’s not the point of this post, just explaining why I’m here I guess. Thought you guys could help. (Sorry for bad formatting, on mobile, etc.)

I (18M) have always had a really bad relationship with my sleep schedule. I’m clearly a night person, and typically don’t go to bed before midnight. This has been “okay” for most of my years because I had school to help keep me on a daily schedule and I could rest if I was tired after I got home. 

But sometimes I would fall asleep after school and wake up around 1am to 3am. It always set me off into a panic or upset mood because I enjoy spending my day keeping up on work, or winding down with games, art, shows, etc. 
I’ve told my family not to let me sleep in the daytime, but they’ve never really kept up with that request.

Here’s where it escalates: since covid essentially shut down my city, I’ve graduated school, been unable to find a job, and declining in my already less than stable mental health. Things obviously have been stressful, along with a bunch of medical issues that I’m still waiting on answers for.
All of this has basically ran my sleep schedule even further into the ground, where for months I had been sleeping at 5am and waking up around 6pm, which scares me enormously. I’ve been trying to get back to a normal (for me) schedule, setting up alarms and asking family to make plans in the morning so I have reason to sleep at midnight and wake before noon. But every time I slip up and pull an all nighter or fall asleep in the early morning, I go nonverbal all day and extremely antisocial. It’s become such a problem that there are times I will sit down to rest mid day and wake up three to four hours later and set off a panic attack.

Currently I’m not able to afford therapy but I am looking for help in my area that is low to no contact and free. I guess all I’m asking is if my sleep related panics are something other people understand, or have ever heard of before? I feel like I’m losing my grip on reality, everything I get upset over feels way blown out of proportion, and I’m worried this covid extended lack of schedule is going to ruin my sleep for good.

If i ever do meet someone online, i drive them away because my personality is horrible.

My family also sucks right now. My dad used to have an alcohol addiction, but one day, after an incident, he stopped drinking. He never went through any alcohol anonymous programs or anything, he just quit. I knew it wouldn't last long. Every time i call him from my moms house i can tell hes drinking and on thanksgiving, he caved in and got wasted the night before, so almost none of the food was properly cooked.

I planned to kill myself the weekend before thanksgiving. But... I chickened out. I dont know why because it would be so much better if i was gone, but im afraid to do it. I was planning on overdosing, i thought it would be pretty harmless, but im still scared and i dont know why",02Dec2020,1

I'm looking for recommendations for a therapist who offers online services.

I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and in general, just suffer from depression, anxiety, stress, low self-esteem, low self-confidence, and unpacked past trauma. 

I've tried out a couple of therapists recently, but I haven't found them to be a good fit. They really only covered surface-level issues and really focused on just one exercise that focused on one particular event that bothered me at a given time, and I wasn't finding it very helpful. But I was hoping to find someone who would help me unpack my thoughts and feelings at a deeper level and help me solve/cope with the root issues, and then from there, work up to dealing with current issues that I'm facing.

I would like a therapist who is available on the weekends or in the evenings. I'm flexible on the price, but somewhere around 50 USD (68 AUD or 67 SGD) would be ideal.

She projects her issues on other people (hence the abilify) and seems to think I'm an alcoholic as well (I don't like drinking). She has projected other issues on my sister(23)(according to her) as well. I don't know what to believe any more and I'm afraid of being evaluated by a psychiatrist because I don't want to be belittled for not taking pills when I have gotten along mostly fine with therapy. I don't know what to do any more. I have never been manic in my life. I feel seriously fucked over because while there is nothing wrong with being bipolar, there is a stigma associated with it and I don't want it to be incorrectly associated with me when there is 0 indication that I have it. My father thinks mental health professionals are ""quacks"" so I can't turn to him. I feel like my mother has seriously fucked me over due to her projection issues and I don't know what to do anymore besides wasting my valuable time to prove that she lied about my mental health.",02Dec2020,1

I can’t go in the hospital I’m not a danger to anyone but myself I guess but I’m not actively trying to harm myself. They’ll keep me for a week and send me home.

63,"But a lot has happened in the past 3 days that I have been gone. Firstly, I have had good contacts with my Probation Officer and she seems to think that this Drug and Alcohol thing was a mistake, and as soon as I get proof that the tests that the counseling center was using were reading FALSE positives on alcohol (as proof, I have gone to COLORS, which is totally random drug testing--when your color is called, you report and get tested and I have been CLEAN every SINGLE time) then I can stop going to COLORS, which is fantastic. I hate waking up at 5 or 6 in the morning just to make a stupid phone call, then drag my ass out of a warm bed and struggle to get downtown (we are very broke and taking a cab gets expensive when I can't take a bus, like on a weekend, and even taking the bus is long and arduous because I have to stand there in the cold until it comes) just to test positive because I AM NOT DRINKING! I don't have any interest in alcohol at all. None. Zip. Nada. I quit 4 years ago and I don't want to go back to it. I am done with being sick and fat...and not myself.  


Secondly, I just found out that our eldest daughter (the 21 year old) and her girlfriend has started an IndieGOGO campaign for our family to help with Christmas, and we have gotten quite a few donations already. I was shocked to see it on FB, and I am EXTREMELY grateful. However, I don't feel like we deserve that money (I mean, the children definitely deserve a Christmas, but I feel it is kind of our responsibility to provide that without asking people to donate money that they probably need for their own families) and now I have a shitload of guilt. I feel horrible for some reason.

  
I guess what I am asking is: what should I do about this guilt? I can't really express it to our daughter because then it seems like I am ungrateful and just an asshole. It is seriously eating me up inside. We just got paid (thank the Heavens for SSI) so we are OK with money at the moment...but that will only cover our rent, the phones (cell), and the XFinity bill so our kids can have Internet (and phone and TV bundled). Otherwise...we are broke. Still. Grrr. I just don't know how to feel. Can someone give me some words of wisdom, please?

I eat at most one meal a day, can go well over a week without showering, spend a concerning amount of hours just sitting in my bed on my phone, and then mentally, I'm just doing terrible.

I haven't been diagnosed with anything but I'm 99% sure I have some sort of anxiety disorder as I have panic attacks at least once a week. I don't see how I'm going to get a stable job or move out in my current mental state. It's pretty obvious to me that I need therapy and possibly medication, but the problem is actually getting it.

My mother is weird about the subject of mental health, for lack of better word. I don't know how to bring it up with her or ask her for help. I have an older brother who I know would try to help if I talked to him about it, but he doesn't have the money to get me professional help. I would feel terribly guilty going to him anyway because he's also had mental health problems in the past. He's doing much better now but I don't want to remind him of it, if that makes sense.

The last 3 years have been the worst for my depression (couldnt get out of bed, wasn’t taking care of myself, drug abuse etc.). I was in a long term relationship and living with a man who was good to me for the most part, but I was so depressed, I felt like I needed to leave and restart/ rebuilt. I was feeling so much happier. After 2 weeks he moved in with a now ex friend of mine and impregnated her. No matter how hard I try, I can’t feel anything. I can’t cry. I have very sudden moments where I am overwhelmed with heartache but before I can cry, I go completely numb. To summarize some of my other suspicious behavior, I used to be so sensitive and sympathetic, I used to always be the one getting fucked over and getting my heart broken but now I’m the one who doesn’t care and hurts people.

76,"I am not replacing professional help or opinions with online forums, I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this and why, and what anyone's opinions could be :) No self-diagnosing here

Lately I've been coming across things I have apparently done / interacted with that I have NO memory of. Example: pulling a vaccine into a syringe at work (vet hospital) that I was specifically asked not to and had no intention of pulling up. I found it on the counter and I don't remember what I did after being told not to do it, and there is no reason anyone else would have entered that room to do anything after the doctor and I left it. I also found a friggin burrito thing in my microwave that had been sitting for probably a couple of days and if it was possible I would have sworn it was someone else, but no one was here, unless my dog did it. 

Small things like that keep happening, like gaps in my days that are missing for tiny blips of time. Getting together meds or packages for people, walking dogs, showing someone how to do something, just nonexistent in my brain that I would pass a lie detector over if I said it wasn't me. Normally if I just can't remember something and I'm confronted about it I question it like ""yeah hey maybe I do remember you saying that, but refresh my memory?"" but if I didn't know better, in the weird situations I recently noticed, I would be CERTAIN that it didn't happen. In the moment, someone else definitely pulled up that vaccine and that burrito was not mine because I didn't buy them and I wouldn't want to take food someone else at home bought. But no one was in the house at the time it would have appeared!

After he left the room I lost it, I started sobbing, I felt ridiculous, I felt like this doctor didn’t even care.

86,"       First some background on me so anyone reading this can fully understand. I am 15 and in my sophomore year of high school. I live with a great family (my birth parents and younger sisters) but I have had bad adhd since I was a toddler. Throughout elementary school my teachers have written home letting my parents know that something was off. At such a young age it was difficult to tell but as I got older it was very obvious I had adhd. (Inattentive/distractible not so much of the hyperactive) My parents were enormously supportive but by age 10 we started consulting doctors about medication. I went through almost a dozen different ones before settling on one near the end of 6th grade (11 years old.) This whole process was a bit difficult since it was based purely on how I was feeling and not my performance in school. From 4th through 8th grade, I have *always* been the top of my class. Even without considering my adhd, the entirety of elementary school and middle school was incredibly boring because of how far areas of the other students I was. My parents considered multiple times if they should raise me a grade but determined that it would be better for me in the long run if I stayed where I was (I was already a year younger that most of my classmates.) Testing time varied based in the medication but ranged from a few weeks to a few months. I declined almost all of the meds due to the usually brutal side effects. Even at low doses feeling nauseous 24/7 and extreme mood swings was not uncommon. One of the first ones I actually liked was Adderall XR. This one worked great besides the fact that I never felt hungry, but that went away after long term use. The first time, my doctor took me off of Adderall because I was frequently light headed and had once blacked out after standing up. (I was generally against this since Adderall was the best one so far) After a few months of testing other meds I eventually requested to go back on Adderall. The doctor agreed and late in 6th grade I was on 5mg of Adderall XR daily. This was eventually raised to 10mg first year of high school and then 15mg during the beginning my sophomore year. 

       Anyone with adhd will understand this better, but since we are so damn distracted as kids, (and the rest of our life is nothing is done about it) picking up on social cues and overall social interaction is *overwhelmingly* difficult. Since my dad was in the military, we moved every 3 years which did nothing to help my social awkwardness. Thankfully, my dad retired after 20 years and we moved just in time so that I would have all 4 years of high school in the same place. Since I never did it as a kid, I have to constantly learn how the social game is played. I mostly use my intelligence and memory to my advantage here by constantly watching others while they talk and interact. When I’m by myself I practice when to smile, laugh, and when and what kind of comments to make in a conversation. I mostly do this by simulating a conversation with someone I know in my head. I know this all sound awfully calculating and analytical, and it really is. I so wish I could have the ease that most people have when socially interacting. 

       This is really the heart of my problem. I have spent 1.5 years in my current location but I have yet to make any real friends in my school. I know this may sound normal, “oh well you just moved, you can’t expect to get friends right away.” And that’s what I told myself for the first few weeks, and then the first few months, and then a year went by, and we’re now halfway through the second one. This whole COVID thing is not helping things I the slightest. 

       I have given myself so many excuses, well they have all known each other since kindergarten, I’m too busy with school to talk with people, well, I *feel* mostly fine so that means that I talk to people enough, and most of all, *I don’t need friends to be happy.* The last one is the thing that I have started wondering about the most. For a long time I have been in complete denial about my lack of a social life but recently my mom started asking me who I sat with during lunch. I always made excuses or just lied (I always sit alone.) But this made me start to realize just how lonely I am. (Sorry btw if I keep speaking in the past tense, not sure why, this is all VERY current.) While sitting at home I would go through my day section by section and try to remember what if any social interactions I had. After a while of doing this, I realized that I did not talk to people much throughout the day and instead talked to myself or listened to audiobooks. And I know most people will read “talking to myself” and think oh well I do that sometimes, that’s pretty normal. This is not the normal talking to yourself, this is a constant 24/7 inner monologue that is running even if I’m trying to focus on something else. It’s usually simulating an situation or trying to figure something out. For example: I am sitting in chemistry class completely focused on my notes, and then a bird flies by the window. *oh look a bird, I think it was a magpie, it looked a bit dark though, it could have been a raven, wow, ravens are such incredible birds, such large beaks and dark feathers, I wonder what causes their feathers to look green and purple in some lighting, perhaps it is oils on the feathers, does it serve a purpose? I don’t think so, the colors are most likely just a side effect of the oils on the feathers, how does the oil get there? does it grow with the feathers or is it produced by the bird in skin pores and travels down the feathers to create a water proof coating?* I give myself a mental tap on the shoulder and I realize that I have spaced out for 2 minutes. The thing is however that it is a constant struggle to not lose myself in my own head. The adderall helps and so does audiobooks since my brain wants to follow the story instead of creating its own. I think I really developed this as a kid in order to keep my adhd brain stimulated. 

       Anyways, back to my social situation. The bottom line is that for a long time I have convinced myself that I don’t need to have friends to be happy, but recently I have started doubting that idea. Over the months I have considered writing something like this but have essentially told myself that I’m fine and to suck it up. Well I know this was a massive post and if you have read this far ANY advice, support, suggestions, or anything of the kind would be very welcome.",02Dec2020,1

88,"LONG POST: NSFW - CW/TW: Sex, Nudes, Suicidal thoughts, anxiety/OCD

Hi, this post is express my guilt and to ask for advice moving forward.

Tl;dr: 
I used to catfish people on Grindr involving sexting and sharing nudes (the nudes were the real me, the face pics were not mine). I deleted all catfishing accounts/photos/chats. What should I do now? What steps can I take to try make things right/better?

The Full Story (long)

Context:

I am in my early 20s, I am gay and was raised very Christian. I was bullied in high school because of being gay. I have a good group of supportive friends. I suffer from OCD symptoms and have been diagnosed with anxiety. I am also a catfish.

The Backstory:

In the summer of 2019 (when I was 19) until about 3 months ago (aged 20) I used a fake profile to talk to boys on Grindr (a gay chat/hook up app). The vast majority of these chats were of a sexual nature (essentially arranging hook ups that I had no actual intention of going to, exchanging nudes and sexting). I used a fake name and a face photo from the internet but the nudes were mine. 

Every few months over the course of the last year or so, I would go through a period of like a week where I would have these conversations with boys on Grindr. I would block all of them, often without warning. I never said that the face pic was not mine. Sometimes if they asked for a Snapchat I would give them a fake one I had made and we would swap nudes and talk there. I’ve probably talked to like 100 boys in this fake Grindr profile. The longest I talked to someone was probably around a week. 

When I was doing it, I never considered that I was actually catfishing. I didn’t intend to cause harm or go into it with the intent of getting nudes to expose anyone or be malicious with the conversations. I never shared the nudes I received, often didn’t even save the photos or screenshot the chats. 

My Realisation:

In September, I decided to stop using Grindr. But then a few weeks ago, I really realised what I had actually been doing on Grindr. I had been deceiving people - catfishing them - often in a sexual manner. I now realise how incredibly wrong and disgusting my actions are. Not only did I waste people’s time, have them share things with me they might not have shared if I used my actual face pics but I also left them abruptly when they might have been developing some sort of actual connection with ‘me’ (my catfish persona) on Grindr. 

This has left me with a lot of guilt, stress and disappointment with myself.  I’m so mad at myself for doing something so vile and deceitful. It doesn’t matter that I didn’t intend to hurt anyone because the harm was in my lying - my acts were harmful and my intentions don’t change that. I feel like a predator and a creep, and I don’t feel like I deserve a future or to enjoy happy things anymore because of what I’ve done. I feel guilty that my friends still hang out with me and my family still talks to me because they don’t know what a shitty person I actually am. 

Advice Needed:

This where I would like some advice. I deleted all the chats, photos and accounts that I used for catfishing in a guilt-ridden, stress-fuelled rampage. But I cannot move this, it feels like something that is going to haunt me forever. I want to be better and grow from this - but how can I? It feels like something I shouldn’t be allowed to move on from. I fear people will find out and maybe I deserve that. I want to be a better person and grow from this and not hurt people again. 

I’m also going to get help from a therapist of some kind because this has really affected how I view myself and I have been suicidal over this (please don’t be sympathetic - I know the focus should be on my victims). I would appreciate any former catfishers giving me advice on how to discuss this issue with a therapist, as well as how to process this guilt and shame.

Closing Thoughts - to Catfishers and Catfish victims:

I will never be doing this toxic, disgusting shit again. I want to be a better person in the future but I know that cannot change what I’ve done in the past. To anyone catfishing right now - stop. Please just stop, apologise to your victims and seek help. You’re hurting yourself in ways you might not realise right now, but more importantly - you’re hurting innocent people. You’re still hurting people even if you don’t intend to cause harm - trust me, I know. 

To catfish victims - I am very sorry. I realise now how hurtful the actions of people like me are. You do not deserve to be lied to and violated. You have done nothing wrong and the guilt and shame lies only with the people who catfished you. I hope you are able to heal from what happened to you.",02Dec2020,1

90,"Hi - I am looking for some resources for help with teenager with suicide thoughts. We have put him in two live in therapy centers for mental health, some of the best in the region. He is a smart student (advance placement in everything, over 4.0 GPA), senior in high school, but for some reason he has lost interest and said a few times he wants to commit suicide. We don't know if it is the side effect of the medicines he has been given (antidepressants, and another one for OCD).

We would like to find the BEST resource in the US for him, after 3 months in two different therapy centers his issues have not gone away. He is a brilliant kid, should be excited about going to college, but it seems COVID lockdowns (being at home) and also bullying at school has had its toll.

since elementary school I struggled socially bc of learning disabilities that i couldnt get therapy/meds for so i struggled in school also. but i thought my short term goal to be making friends and getting social validation nothing else mattered like education or family (lots of issues there) cause i just wanted to be loved and accepted. spent my childhood on online forums and only had a few friends we drifted apart though. started high school decent kinda tried in classes but didn't care bc i saw all other kids have friend groups and people support them i had nothing so i couldnt force myself to look to the future i saw nothing felt like nothing. senior year tried to improve made friends at my job, went to couple parties even, got a girlfriend who genuinely loves me i think which is what i wanted but i still feel empty inside. for example she texted to make plans but i cant bring myself to respond while 2 years ago i would be overjoyed at the idea of a girl wanting to spend time with me its weird. so my grades are bottom tier, no extracurriculars except some volunteering and at this point i dont think i can get into my state school bc of my gpa. anyways only options i see are trade school or cheapo college and joining the army or ROTC to pay for it cause my parents think college isnt worth it unless its ivy league or MIT but my dream as a kid was joining the army so thats cool ig. if u read this far i respect that lol i just dont know how to get help i think therapy or medication could help and im legally an adult but i dont have money for that looked at prices in my area its pretty insane. yea just wanted to vent maybe i have no idea where my life is going feels like im a rock staying still while time flies past me. ok this is done now promise but thanks for hearing me out guys :)",02Dec2020,1

For the longest time, I was scared. I never let my feelings out, and I would never be honest with therapists. I let my emotions ruin my life. Finally, my parents sent me to inpatient at a mental hospital. I came in pissed, but after hearing other stories, something inside me clicked. I knew I needed to get the help. For the first time in my life, I vented. Start to finish I told the therapist my whole story. It hurt while I was telling it, but after it was out a huge weight was lifted off my chest. I realized that I wasn't a lost cause. I knew I could get help. For the past month and a half, I've constantly been going to therapy, and getting as much help as I can. I advise everyone out there, to vent as well. It is something that will hurt, but feel amazing afterwards. I hope everyone can stay safe. From your new friend, jmicheel19.",02Dec2020,1

both partners showed me a lot of love affection in the beginning, then began to draw back and make me try to fight for their affection later on. i just got out of the second relationship a few weeks ago. they made me feel like no one else loved them as much as they did, and were so affectionate and good to me, and i just. dont feel like im loved at all anymore after losing them. ive brought it up with the friends i have, but nothings really changed in a way that made me feel better. ive tried making new friends, it doesnt work out, and i dont have the energy to try to keep investing in new people like that. im tired. i just wanna feel like soneone cares about me again and actually enjoys having me around instead of pushing me off to the side in conversations or not getting enthusiastic replies to anything i say. idk if im asking too much here? am i just being too picky? i mean, im lucky to have friends in the first place, so is wanting them to seem a bit happier to be around me asking for too much? should i just be happy that they’re spending time with me at all? i dont want to be entitled, because i know im not entitled to anything from anyone but i dont know what else to do. it feels like ive tried everything, and im still in the same place. i just want to feel loved again",02Dec2020,1
97,"I believe every human attaches a sense of ego with everything it can be attached to; eg.- ego of the pain we've suffered &amp; considering it to be unique, ego of being kind, ego of being humble etc. I feel if everyone accepts the pathetic state of being that the humans are in right now, and allow some psychological space to change themselves, and at the same time allow some psychological space for others to change, it would be a better place to live in. 

Everytime I try this with any friend/relative/human, while they enjoy the space I provide them where I don't judge them for thinking out loud but I always end up being judged for some mistake or just for having a different thought process. 

I always end up hating human interaction and as I grow up, I only become more and more distant from social relationships, which makes me question whether it is practical to expect this space from people ?

98,"Hey guys sorry for the essay but this was something I wanted to get off my chest for a long time. I posted this a while ago on true off my chest but I figured it could maybe help some people who are going through tough times here.

But anyways 2 years ago I almost took my own life. I’m still hate ashamed to admit it happened. I was 19 and my father had just committed suicide and as you can imagine it was rough on me. It led me to a deep depression where I didn’t feel like myself. I wasn’t doing good at all, I couldn’t focus on my classes so I dropped out of school. I was working a shitty job, I was distancing myself from my family and barley talking to anyone , I left my ex girlfriend for no reason and I just isolated myself. I started to become and alcoholic and I was drinking everyday to numb myself. And I was living in a bad side of town so I had no real friends that actually cared about me. I always tried to remain positive through it all but it just felt like it would never get any better

I started to get suicidal thoughts. At first I thought it was normal and maybe I was having a bad day/week but it went on for months. Eventually I was so frustrated with my life that I wrote my family a note and planned out a day to end it.

I was so tired of living, I couldn’t find a single thing to be happy about. Everyday I woke up I just immediately felt tired and defeated. My plan was basically to crash my shitty Toyota corolla on my way home from my night shift into a cement wall. So one day when I was having a breakdown and thought I had enough I decided I would do it. I was going about 80mph down the hill but I bitched out last second because I couldn’t stop thinking about the pain I would cost my family.

I never opened up to anyone about this or my depression and I don’t think anyone knew expect for my mom who could notice I was acting different. But looking back it now I’m grateful that I never went through with it. I got sober and I landed a better job and even started school with a new career that I actually enjoy. I moved away to a new state where I’ve had the chance to meet some great people and I got to hold my nephew which made it all seem worth it.So long story less long and as cliche as it may sound it gets better eventually. Hope you guys have a good day",02Dec2020,1

100,"Stay at home mom to 3 year old. 32 weeks pregnant &amp; high risk (lots of pain and medical ptoblems), unmedicated schizoaffective, severe depression, and ptsd, no real support system.

As someone with schizoaffective, even at my best (medicated, not pregnant, physically heathy, no huge stressors) i usually crack under stress. What normal functioning people can handle without a problem is incredibly debilitating for me once it builds up. Like ive never been able to hold a job for more than 3 weeks because the set schedule and expections and overbearing bosses stress me out so bad that its like my brain melts. Ill end up depressed, paranoid, delusional, suicidal. And one day ill miss work without calling in, because im just so destroyed i cant get out of bed, and then i lay there for weeks trying to recover.

Before this pregnancy, i was actually kind of okay. I had my days. But i could take care of myself, clean, cook, and have fun with my son.

Well these days, all i have is stress. I lost my house, had to move unexpectedly. 3 weeks after that my car died had to pick up a car payment. My fiancee is a cook, so we got really behind financially with covid. Now hes back to working 12 hours a day, 5-6 days a week. Not that it helps because we cant pay our bills AND catch up. So were in an endless cycle of struggling now. Plus, i never see him. Im 32 weeks pregnant and high risk. I have SPD (lots of spinal and pevis pain), kidney problems, alpha thalassimia, now possible diabetes. Im basically on my couch all day every day. Alone with a 3 year old. Who destroys everything. And theres nobody to clean it. I usually do a 15 minute pick up once a day. But i have spinal problems and bending isnt really an option. Nobody will watch him for me or help clean. I have no friends. My only sibling lives 2.5 hours away. My dads never around. My mother is VERY unsupportive and actually toxic. Her verbal abuse has taken a toll on me. And  she will not watch my son unless im in the hospital dying. And even then, when i get discharged i get yelled at because i took too long at the hospital. My life is destroyed financially. On top of all this, its like everybody who knows me intentionally gives me a hard time. My and my fiancee havent been getting along the best because of my ptsd and paranoia. He can tell i isolate myself from him and usually dont want to be touched. Plus sometimes he gets rude and frustrated with me. Which is understandable considering im a mess and he works so much that theres nothing he can really do but watch me fall apart. Hom getting rude definitely makes it worse though. 

I just need a break. I need my phone to not ring. I need a baby sitter. I need someone to help at my house. I need to not be sitting in filth. I need people to stop putting their problems on me. Everyone always uses me as a doormat. Like nobody will just let me have some peace. I also just seem to have the worst luck. If something huge isnt wrong, 3 little things are going wrong all at once. Flat tire, stolen debit card, messed up paperwork i now need to call and fix.

My days consists of me laying on the couch in a destroyed house, stressing about money, feeling alone, feeling uselss, being in pain, wishing i had some sort of support or help. My 3 year old tears thru everything. And he gets bored and then acts out. (Before pregnancy we did scheduled activities and before covid we went out 2-3x a week for fun events for him). All i can do is sit and think anout how sad and stressed i am while getting yelled at by a toddler. I dont even have anyone to text. I cant handle it anymore. 

Anytime that i feel okay, something happens to stress me out. Now i can never relax. Today there was a moment where i realized things felt easy for about an hour. and every 15-20 i would feel severe anxiety and a sense of impending doom because i knew that if i relax for any amount of time then something terrible and  stressful is going to happen to me. 

Ive kind of worked out in my head that god is purposely giving me a hard time because its time for me to kill myself. Theres no way that my luck is this bad. It feels like im being targeted. 

The most i do is take care of my son. But me, i lay around, i cry, i dont eat, if i do eat its garbage because i cant find it in myself to cook anything, even instant foods. i dont brush my teeth, i lay on the shower floor and cry almost every night, but i dont always wash myself. I dont brush my hair. 

I literally lay down on my couch and just deteriorate sll day every day.

I cry throughout the day. Id say i have a minimum of 5 breakdowns a day at this point. At least 2 times an hour i think about how badly i want to die and how i cant wait for this baby to be born so im free to kill myself. 

I used to be excited for the baby. I waited so long to have this baby. I had 5 miscarriages due to genetic issues and was told i needed to try IVF. Hecqas concieved naturally 4 weeks later. This is a miracle baby. And now all i can think is that if im this stressed now, if im this invisible now, if im this lonely and sad now.... its going to be 100x worse after hes born.

My fiance keeps telling me ill feel better when im back on my meds. Theyll take 6 weeks to fully work. Assuming i dont give birth for another 5 weeks (37weeks), thats 11 weeks. I dont even think i can last 5 weeks. Sometimes i cry myself to sleep just because i know im going to have to get up in the morning and ill still be alive. And then i wake up and cry, because im alive and i have to live another day. 

There were times id stop taking my kidney and anemia meds in hopes that maybe id get sick enough that id end up in the hospital and they could save the baby and i would die.

And before you say my kids need me, they dont. I have schizoaffective and ptsd. Even on my good days im sick. And on my bad days im terribly sick. And no matter what, i will always be sick. 

I dont want to tell my doctors because they know my medical history. Whenever i get sick i have very bad suicidal tendancies. I cant get pinkslipped. I cant get admitted. Nobody will take care of my son, so my fiancee will have to leave work. Hes a cook. Theres no paid leave. So we would lose everything. And that would really ensure that im killing myself. 

I just dont know how to step away from it. I dont know how to relax. Ive never been so stressed or sad in my life. And ive been pinkslipped for suicidal tendencies and self harming 4 times. I have still never been this sick. It feels like my brain is crumbling. Sometimes late at night, when my fiancee is home, i get in my car and go sit in an empty parkinglot for an hour and just hyperventilate. 

I get so stressed that my blood pressure goes up, my heart races, i throw up, i cant breathe, i feel like im dying.

How am i suppose to survive this? Itll be weeks before i can even try medication. I just dont see it happening. Not with the way things are going. Not without someone helping me. not without a break and quiet and care. 

How do i survive this?",02Dec2020,1

102,"Hello I’m 23 M, 
And I’ve been dealing with GAD for about 2 years now after a random panic attack I had in the middle of the night. But with time I got better, I understood what had happened and why it happened. Things were going good. Porn and masturbating have always been an escape, a way to calm the nerves and relax. But recently I got involved in an online “sexual” (kinda not really)  act with an anonymous female that has left me with an immense about of guilt and anxiety. I have a gf 24 F that has helped me get better along the way, so when this happened it took some time to talk to her about it because I felt that I had betrayed her trust. In the end, we put things in to perspective and she was very understanding and reassured me that what I did was a fault in judgement due to curiosity and being horny. Regardless, after we talked the guilt and anxiety slowing went away, with the occasional bump in the road. I now find my self getting extremely anxious when it comes to the idea of jerking off, the idea of porn, basically any online sexual outlet. 
Something that I found so peaceful and relaxing has now become the bane of my existence and I don’t know what to do. I feel super lost cuz I feel like I’m fighting an inner part of my self that has always been free to be expressed. I now feel like my anxiety is causing me to feel like I have a problem or addiction to porn or masturbating .... and the idea of that makes me ever more anxious.

103,"I recently watched this video called ""When the Fat Girl Gets Skinny."" The title of this post is a quote from it. That quote is so powerful and something that's all too familiar to me yet I havent been able to describe it. I'm not talking about being overweight or anything, I've just developed an eating disorder drastically over the past year. Somethings always been like that in the back of my mind for as long as I can remember, but it's gotten so much worse. My mind is in a constant state of anxiety and paranoia about how much I eat and exercising enough. But food is one of the few things that gives me pleasure, which makes it more complicated and frustrating. If I dont eat, I'm happy that I'm making ""progress,"" if I do eat, I have a mindset that I'm a failure, I'll never be good enough, that I lost progress of how much work and effort it took me to run so much. And I wont feel even slightly better till I wake up the next day when I'm thinner after having slept.

I've been running 6 to 10 miles a day with maybe one meal a day. As well as lifting some weights with my arms and doing situps.

112,"So I'm between the age of 30-35. I am high functioning autistic. Before the virus hit I finished my last degree, and now I have a total of 4 degrees. (long story short, I gotten an aerospace degree but the job market collapse. During this time I tried working a number of jobs, but I kept getting fired or was so depressed from working and getting harassed at work I've became suicidal. So instead of doing nothing I went back to school for a general computer degree. This was an AS since I couldn't afford to go directly for a BS. While I was there a teacher mentioned to me that I was only a handful of classes from a networking degree. One of the 2 was a 2x2 into my last degree which is a industrial degree with a focus on cyber security.) The first degree I almost didn't get due to my grades and I was having a hard time in school. For the rest of the degrees I was taken at max 2 classes at a time since that was all I could handle. In fact, at several points I tried working while doing this and I couldn't even handle that. The most I was able to deal with is what I do now. Selling stuff on Etsy using my 3D printer, making YouTube videos once in a while, and a few small things to make some money (like $100-$200 a month total). 

Anyways, during my AS I notice when I was able to get something that could get me into something down the road like being an intern. I flaked out on it. Like I did things like made applications for my school and stuff like that. But those were 1 off things. 

After getting into my BS I found everything was going good and my grades were good enough. I did at one point try more than 2 classes on my technical side and my grades dropped to the point where I almost gotten kicked. But as long as I kept it down to 2 classes, my mental state seemed to be at least to the point I could keep up with the test (it should be noted even with this I had to cheat in a number of classes even when taking 2 classes at a time). The reason why I'm bringing this up is towards the end of my degree I had to take a lot of stupid classes like one on weather, another in microeconomics, and a few others. Because I spent so many years in school and I just wanted it over I did a full 4 classes back to back for 2 semesters. This 10000% burnt me out, and I literally had to beg my teachers to pass me. If it wasn't for a mixture of cheating and begging to pass, I know I wouldn't of made it. 

Shortly after I gotten out I found out even with a degree no one still wanted me. I tried using my contacts a few times, and found many companies flaked out during meeting me or when they found out I'm autistic. Even with applying to higher end jobs than the manufacturing jobs I applied for in the past. I found in some interviews I was harassed for how I talk and think. Like flat out picking on me and laughing about it. In some jobs they kept lying about oh we are looking for x (coder, network, etc) and the people trying to help me said I don't x y z. And then they would interview me for 100% different job.

Around this time I tried to enact my backup plan which was to go into the military. I found out the military literally has policies from autistic people from joining. My dad looked into it since he had connections to major generals, and more than less the policy was put in after a few autistic people were harassed to the point some offed themselves and some were hurt so badly that there is an investigation on it still today. So it's more to protect us than anything else. And it was made in such a way that even if you did get in, you have to get it OK with every commanding officer, and pretty much anyone in the unit can make a stink about it which would end up getting the person kicked out. Like it's better for that than the person getting hurt or dying.

&amp;#x200B;

After this I started looking into things because it didn't make sense to me. I did everything that was asked of me. I stayed away from drugs, crime, etc. I actually went through college even when my teachers in HS said I shouldn't be able to graduate HS. I stuck out what jobs I could and only quit 1 job, but that was by force. And while I did get fired from many, I went out of my way to show I knew how to code and what not. Anyways, I came across studies saying people who are autistic and have degrees are 85% likely to be unemployed or underemployed. And I found studies on how the UK looked into how much of the homeless is autistic, and they found around some of the cities it was 65% or more. Then I found it was highly common for autistic people to be abused in work places and other places. 

I brought a lot of this up to my parents because it was looking like I simply am not going to get anything that will put a real dent in my life. Like beyond the fast food/retail industry. They agreed I can stay with them as long as need, but we made a plan. Where they would buy a farm and have things contracted out. That I would help them get it up and running, and keep things up. And I can be the farm manager. While this does make me happy, it should be noted that it's estimated that it will take close to 10 years before I would get a livable wage. Just harvesting the crops it will take 7 years for much of it to mature to that point. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, what brings me here is I'm having a hard time figuring out what is wrong with me. The other day I found a basic help desk job on indeed that I could get if I put in for it and it wasn't already taken down (maybe, some of these they hire people with multiple years of experience because the job market in my area is so poor). My anxiety shot up to the roof and I was extremely suicidal. And this was simply for seeing there was a job I realistically could get. And this that happens isn't anything new. 

So my anxiety is always up because I know if my parents get tired of me or want to just because. There isn't a single thing I could do to prevent myself from being homeless since I don't have the money/income to support myself. And then when it comes down to looking for any job and seeing there is one I could work (even part time), if I had a gun next to me I wouldn't be talking to you now. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What is wrong with me? And don't give me the crap that there isn't anything wrong with me. This isn't normal.**

&amp;#x200B;

Note, there is a number of other things going on and a bit of info I didn't talk about since I don't think it relates. Like how even today I'm trying to work on doing independent product development and a number of other things (but none of it has made me anything). I mean something that might relate is how my entire family outside of my dad's parents, my parents, and maybe 2 or 3 others 1000% hates my parents and I. I believe it is due to my sister lying about us.  And the only thing I ever wanted in my life since I was a kid is a stable family and stable life. But the details going beyond that, I doubt it relates.",02Dec2020,1

My dad is currently not living in the house now and my younger brother who’s 20 is really struggling with all of it. The past two days have been absolute hell. Not only am I going through my own pain because of this situation but he’s lashing out at my mom and I and being pretty reckless in his behavior. He is now speaking about suicide pretty openly and it’s starting to really scare my mom and I. He keeps saying he doesn’t care about his life anymore and that there’s no point in trying. He keeps saying he’s canceling his therapy appointments because he doesn’t need them anymore. He’s also been extremely vicious in the way he’s speaking to us saying that my mom doesn’t give a fuck about him and we all let him suffer and nobody did anything. It’s hard though because he goes back and forth and will say things like “I just want to go to sleep please leave me alone” but then other times he’ll say things that make me feel like he could be a danger to himself. We’re doing the best we can and don’t know what to do. We tried getting him to go to the hospital and he won’t go. We threatened to call 911 and he got really angry and upset before saying he would tell them to go home and it would be a waste of their time. I also tried calling a suicide prevention hotline and they gave me the worst advice by telling me to “not second guess everything he says because it would drive me crazy” like they really told me to believe a suicidal person and leave them alone???? Does anyone have any advice or insight on how we should handle this???",02Dec2020,1

117,"We all have had a year this year. 2020 has kicked the world in its teeth. I’ve been bearing it but today it’s all just kind of bubbles over and I still can’t truly let it out...so here I am.

Where do I even start. I have a decent enough job pay wise. I do enjoy my coworkers. But it’s a retail environment so there is honestly no recognition or reassurance you’re doing a good job. Our district manager is too busy with his local political career to really care so he comes in, finds something to complain about, then leaves. The part that gets me with work is I’ve been sick for a long time (type 1 diabetic) and it was known when I was hired. The first time I start having complications that keep me from work, our DM immediately went to the idea of firing me. It’s just disheartening knowing how much you put into a job, to be discarded so easily. 55-60 hour work weeks and any extra I can give...for nothing.

My marriage is doing okay. My wife and I have an apartment with just us and our dog. It’s expensive but we make due. Honestly we could tighten up our budget but it is what it is right now. Our neighbors are incredibly loud people. Music, movies, stomping around upstairs above us. Between the three of them up there...it’s never quiet. So we haven’t been sleeping well and irritability gets to us at times. We have complained, called the police when the noise was too much in the evenings, and before all of that we tried speaking to them directly. No luck. My wife has depression and it wells up from time to time. I’m not as attentive to this as I want to be. It’s hard for me honestly. Like I’ve always been one to keep it all in and it’s never expressed itself as much of anything to me until recently. So I haven’t been catching it and being a good husband in that regard. This year has been rough so it’s hitting her hard.

Fast forward to this summer and a big hit came. My mother suffered a major stroke on my birthday this year. And five years prior she had a heart attack on my birthday....that day is cursed. My mother is the most important woman in my life next to my wife. Our relationship is incredibly strong and I would go to the ends of the earth on my hands and knees for that woman. She is a truly amazing person and I’m incredibly thankful to have her. But when it happened, I was terrified. As you should be terrified but I was having issues even mustering the courage to go see her when she was in rehab after the hospital. Due to COVID I couldn’t see her for a month and afterwards it was through a window outside her room. After she had gotten back home I would visit a few days a week. But now I am having issues even doing that. It hurts me to hear how altered she speaks and how brittle she has become. It stays with me that she isn’t doing well and that soon...I’ll lose her. And it terrifies me. My dad is doing the best he can but caring for her has taken its toll on him. Our relationship is already not so great so it gets volatile quickly. The whole situation just stews in my head and I can’t keep myself composed with the idea of what’s happening and what eventually will happen.

Now good ol COVID throws us another curveball. My wife’s small office had an outbreak this last weekend. And everyone is home. She has tested twice and come up negative both times. However the department of health is issuing a quarantine order since she exhibits a lot of symptoms. I can’t risk staying at home with my mothers issues and my dads. Did I mention he has COPD? So I’m at home. Being a diabetic. With my wife who is symptomatic. I tested when I heard and it’s negative. But I’m still terrified. If I get it, it’ll suck. But how hard will it effect me? My immune system is shit. And to add to it...I can’t work with this going on. So when am I gonna get fired? Because my wonderful boss and great company values me so much. My head is swimming with all this and I have the motivation to go to work and go through the motions to make the day go, and sleep. My wife thinks I’m ignoring her, my friends think I’m ignoring them. My parents think I’m an asshole for ignoring them. But I just want to sleep, or not interact with people. I’m an avid online gamer and I don’t even want to do that.

So, it’s been tough. I don’t know what to do. I could confide in my wife, but she’s spiraling with her own depression and I would never want to burden her further. Things have been financially tough with us too. Things have been behind and we have been floating bills as best we can. The cherry on top of this whole thing. Is at 8pm tonight I went to walk my dog...and my car has been towed. I’m fairly sure it’s a repossession but won’t know until I can speak with someone tomorrow. I’ve been behind on the note due to household and medical complications a few months ago, but I honestly didn’t think it was that behind and I had a plan to get things caught up. After this call tomorrow we can probably add to the rant about how I have to pay crazy money all at once get my car back, ruining Christmas gifts n stuff, or how I lost my car...which is one of the only things I have going on outside a place with my wife and dog that I enjoy. I’m a car guy and this thing is one of my top 5 dream cars. And now it’s gone. Or stolen. But the cops won’t even put it in the system because they’re convinced my car got repossessed. 

I have no idea what to do. I haven’t really processed everything. I can’t even muster up enough in me to cry, be physically upset, or even angry. I’m just...here. But whenever I stop and just think, or try to go to sleep, the entire years worth of bullshit and everything just churns and I can’t get on top of it. But I don’t cry, I don’t express it. It’s just in there. I’m drowning in my own head while wearing a sarcastic personable mask to face the world. I can’t even try to express it because before long I just shut down. I can’t even express it all without just hitting a damn wall. I don’t know what’s wrong with me but I just want for everything to stop piling on so I can start trying to process what’s already in there.

Between all of this I was in my final year of Uni. 

I worked my ass off and produced some truely amazing work for my portfolio. Despite this I’ve failed my course. I fell apart, didn’t leave my bed for weeks. Missed an entire unit simply because I couldn’t complete it from home. 

So I’m going to fail. And I feel no motivation to finish any of my classes because what’s the point? 

I feel pathetic, I have terrible self loathing right now. My partner is very supportive, but I just don’t know what to do.

I always end up hating human interaction and as I grow up, I only become more and more distant from social relationships, which makes me question whether it is practical to expect this space from people ?

I usually have difficulty dealing with loud sounds recently and this helps me. I find it weird. Hearing other people's conversations in public make me anxious. An other example would be at night, i have to play A/c unit asmr in order to sleep. I can't comfortably sleep without it. When i have to switch earphones at night (between wires to air-pods or vise versa) i have to make my own sound to avoid hearing other surrounding sounds. so i'll hum or cough loudly.

However, even with this self diagnosis of her mother, she doesn’t see it as all that bad. It’s rarely huge stuff, it’s the smaller things that I know are stemming from a huge root cause. I feel as if my wife’s relationship to her mom is healthy, but her mom’s relationship to her is extremely unhealthy, which basically negates any healthiness on my wife’s side. My MIL also takes every bit of information her kids tell her as if she “owns” the information. For instance, if we say we’re doing X, she feels free to tell everyone else in the family that we’re doing X, crossing personal space and boundaries. My MIL constantly puts my wife and her siblings down, saying things like “well I tried to teach her Y but she’s your problem now!” and then in the same conversation lecturing my wife as if she’s 12 again. My MIL has also done some pretty terrible things to me and my wife, but my wife “graciously” forgives her and just comes right back. My MIL is never wrong and always the victim. She’s got major hypochondria and always has some new health kick she’s on where we have to prepare food around her diet. I know for a fact my MIL knows what she’s doing because she tiptoes around me and one of my brother in laws (we’ve both been very vocal about these things and regularly tell her “no”). I thought we had a bit of a breakthrough earlier this year when she was at odds with her mom for a couple weeks, but she’s fallen back into a life of no boundaries with her mom and our nuclear family.

Lemme give a bit of back history here before I go any further. My wife was adopted into an extremely conservative family along with a handful of her other siblings. She came with a lot of trauma that she’s pretty much worked through entirely (I’m super proud of where she is given her past), but her growth now seems to be inhibited solely by her mother. Sadly my family hasn’t been super accepting of our marriage so it’s just pushed my wife straight into her mom’s arms. Up until a month before we got married (~1.5 yrs ago), my MIL treated her like trash until I think she realized that if she wanted any part of our lives, she needed to act better. Since then, my wife finds almost no fault with my MIL and continues to share all of our life with my MIL, causing issues for me with personal boundaries.

I have a lot of concerns with my in laws because  of the above. My MIL can guilt my wife into a LOT, although my wife is doing much better about saying no. My wife also changes around her and won’t wear certain clothes (modesty 🙄) or eat certain foods (my MIL is a health freak) at her parents house and all of it is causing my wife personal growth issues. Plus the fact that this seeps into our marriage: “why don’t you wanna go to my parents house?” or the fact that I’m very uncomfortable with my wife spending any period of time with my MIL alone.

So questions:

How do I help my wife break free? It’s not healthy for her, i feel like it’s inhibiting her personal growth. She’s very closed off to trusting new people and doesn’t really have a strong mothering/mentoring figure in her life.

What does a healthy mother &lt;-&gt;daughter relationship look like? I don’t really have a good frame of reference for what a healthy and normal relationship from mother &lt;-&gt; daughter looks like. Like I mentioned, I feel like my wife is sharing pretty normal stuff with her mom and I don’t ever feel upset when she tells her friends the same personal information. Yet I always feel like personal boundaries are crossed when I hear my wife telling her mom about details of our life.

What do I need to do, if anything? I am a fixer (what guy isn’t) and a vocal one at that. It stresses my wife out when I point out things because she doesn’t like to rock the boat. Most of the kids in the family just live with the consequences of a narcissist running the family and don’t want to cause any issues. I don’t always like rocking the boat but when I do, it’s with calculation and for something super important. I want to still be respectful of my in-laws, b/c as soon as I stoop down to the level of crossing boundaries myself, I undermine everything I say.

Anyone have thoughts/suggestions?",02Dec2020,1
144,"I really messed up when I stopped taking lexapro for 4 days. The first 3 days were fine, with the exception of a little headache sometimes, but then the fourth day was absolutely horrible. I went back to having bad urges of cutting (which I didn't have in 3 years). I was very suicidal, I called the suicide hotline thrice in 2 days with very strong urges to jump off the roof. 

My therapist is a kind person. I don't know how, but he tells me all the right things. I feel like I'm fucking dumb, and that I have zero motivation to study even though I have the opportunity to study and a good life, but he makes me feel alright, he tells me it is okay to feel that way and that I'm not stupid. I'm in a great program and my parents fully sponsor my studies. I feel like I've been born with a silver spoon, but then my therapist says that what I thought was a good childhood was not normal. I had experienced the extremes of helicopter parenting. Looking back, what he said is absolutely right. I just hate to think that what I thought were happy memories aren't at all. 

I'm gonna go back home for quite a while in 2 weeks and I'm scared how I would manage without him. He's a great friend to me and I would really miss him. He helps me a lot and doesn't think of me as an annoyance like everyone in my life.",02Dec2020,1
145,"my bitch ass blood father was and still abusive, he was away most of the time and never really bonded with me. I grew up with a lot of issues that now i know are because of his absence. He is a total loser, a very weak and stupid man who doesnt take responsibility of anything. Man... i never knew how these feelings are tbh, i broke up with the only girl that i loved because she had a family you know? she had a lot of gr8 stuff, she had something of a father instead of her abusive blood one. im 17, and i just lose my mind when i remember that i will never get to enjoy that. I really dont lookup to a lot of people that much, i kinda consider myself to be the only family i got, i have 0 real life friends and like 2 online ones. idk anymore, but everytime i remember this i understand that probably im gonna end up hanging like 20 years later. not being dramatic but being real, i try so hard to runaway from the fact that i will never get to expeirence having a father. People told me i can still be the ""god son"" or something of someone and they be my ""god family"" but i dont get how this works, whats the point of having a family if im like 20 something and already grown up? how much time it will need to bond and reach that level? and seriously how pathetic it would be to move in there lol. I wanted always this, living with a good father at least, having all the cliche father-son shit. dam bro my blood bitch didnt even have the talk with me, i knew all from the internet lmao. so now i see something posting a photo of him and his fucking dad both looking very fucking close and im about to have a break down and shit this life is fucked up man",02Dec2020,1
146,"I always thought I had a ""normal"" childhood, but that things were wrong somehow too.
As I grew up I fell into all the traumatised child stats. Suiside attempts, drug abuse and alcohol abuse at a young age, sexually active from a young age, abusive relationships with older men, dropping out, pregnant at 17. The works. 
I got myself right and smartened up, found a great partner and started a life raising my kids with him. Happy life. 
Then, when my kids were both in grade school I felt like it was finally time for me to persure my dreams and become a psychiatrist! So, I got my GED (80th - 99th percentile in all my subjects) and headed for university! Yay! Studied first year psychology and sociology. Loved it. But, something was off. 
Switched to Social Work and suddenly was hit with massive depression. I have always had depression but this was something else, it was constant sensory overload , I wore sunglasses everywhere because of the lights. I popped tylenol like tiktacs to ward off the migraines and hid in dark rooms with low sound every chance I could and wept. 
Got my perscription though and some help and have been doing well. So, in May i returned to school and back into my psychology program.
Now, Im in my second year and I am failing.  I get the work, Im not dumb. But I cant face it. We did a lesson on ACEs and I was like Ooo I wonder what my score is?! 
Its 9. A high score is 4  they dony even meaure the negative effects past 4 and I have 9. All I learn about is the way my chdhood trauma has literally shaped me, changed me physically and psychologically.
Sure, now I can blame my mother for even more crap but it just makes me hate myself and her for what she has done to me. I feel like all I am learning is all the way I am broken. My dream is gone, I cant continue in this field, I cant study this. I havent turned in any work in weeks or watched any lectures, and Im failing out of all my classes. Im going to loose my funding and I could submit stuff to get a health exemption but mentally Im in such a bad place I dont care to. 
All I ever wanted was to be a psychiatrist. I wanted to go to med school and become a doctor and help people and I cant face my own trauma enough to finish a 2nd year semester. 
I need to find a new program, but nothing else appeals to me. I dont want to do anything else, and I feel so stuck and lost. 
I work a min wage job at a long term psychiatric care facility hanging out with people with schizophrenia all day and I love it. They are so fun and kind, I want to work higher up in a better facility one day treating people like them but I now know I never will.

148,"Hey guys, I have been suffering from GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) and Panic Disorder since the summer of last year. I took anti-depressants (Lexapro) at that time for two months, and I overcame my anxiety and panic,

This summer, my anxiety and panic has returned like never before alongside new, scary, physical symptoms which seem to only get worse with time. It is driving me absolutely crazy because I am having a lot of difficulty coping with the physicality of this. I feel continuously stressed all the time and have recently developed two extremely debilitating symptoms. Heart palpitations throughout the day and frequent feeling of blood rushing to my head which causes me to sweat and heat up, starting from my forehead. My cheeks also start to hurt and I can feel tension in my jaw and my entire face even though I make a conscious effort to relax my face and jaw throughout the day. Sometimes I feel like I'll have a stroke as if there's something stuck in my head which isn't moving and my head becomes heavy. I can literally feel it throb at times, and can feel the throbbing in my ears.

I wanted to ask if anyone else suffers from this on a daily basis and how they cope with this because this is greatly affecting the quality of my life and my happiness. I am not seeing a way out apart from medication at the moment and the last thing I want to do is to take medication for this.

Thank you in advance to anyone who steps forward. Cheers!",02Dec2020,1

I am really not the type of guy, that talks about feelings with anyone, but here because of the fact, that this is anonym, I‘ll give it a go.

I have recently losed someone from my family and am having a really hard time, because of the fact, that I haven‘t spended enough time with her. I always thought that there will be a tomorrow or am too busy right now. And suddendly, out of nowhere, she‘s gone and I can‘t tell/show her how much I loved her. I am feeling like a kid in the inside, that wants to cry but on the outside, i can’t show how hurt I really am. People think that I am cold and do not care about what happene. When they would know how much this whole situations eats me up and takes my energy. I come from a family, where showing feelings as a man means being weak. This may be a reason why talking does not work for me.

163,"I've disclosed to my partner my history with mental health a while back which includes major depression and ADHD. I told him I started with adderall and another pill but the adderall wasn't effective for me so I stopped it. My therapist increased the dosages a few times but I eventually stopped it altogether due to no improvement. She changed my other meds and had me try it with adderall again thinking it might help improve efficacy. I stopped using it again after no improvements. I was moved to concerta monday instead of adderall and had some anxiety symptoms tuesday so I told him later that Tuesday night about my change in medication and why I may have been overthinking at times (which i stated to him to clarify for me or to give me some time to relax before responding to him).

 My first anxiety episode was me wondering if he was angry with me. I recognized my building emotions and asked him so I could know for sure and not be super anxious. 

My second episode was in text messages. I have an issue where if someone doesn't understand me I get frustrated and I get anxious over how to clarify or explain myself esp if their comprehension of what I've said so far is way off. I told him then that my anxiety was building up and I'd cut the conversation short. He didn't ask any questions and said okay until tuesday night. 


Tuesday Night, I told him about my medication changes. He asked me about why I need the new medication, what's all the medication I'm taking, and what my issue was. I only told him about my adderall and concerta but not the specific depression medication. I said that adderall wasn't working for me so I was trying something new- concerta. He then told me how he was diagnosed with ADHD when he was younger but his mom took him off it and then he didn't have ADHD anymore. His mom told him she just spent more time with him and socialized him to help? He then asked me what problems was ADHD causing in my life. I kind of clammed up right there as he recited some stuff I told him before. There are more issues it causes for me but I'm not yet comfortable with telling him yet (this is a new relationship). He said he wanted to know because he was wondering if I needed my medication and for what reason. I said yes I need it for ADHD to help me manage. He then said ""im asking because I'm just trying to see if you have even tried on your own without medication to help with the issues"". That's where I kinda broke down. We were on the phone so i stepped away for a bit instead of answering. Not sure if my medication is a factor but I believe I would react similarly without it. I cried for a while and went back to the phone after I could hold back how I was feeling in the moment a bit better.  He noticed my mood was down after I came back but I don't think he knows how much it hurt for me to hear that. I know 90% that it wasn't intentional but I still feel sad and upset that he'd ask me that. One part of me feels I'm justified while the other part is saying the question was not bad and I'm overreacting but I'm still feeling distraught to have someone say ""did you even try?"" &lt;--- as I came to understand what he said.

167," I was just 11 years old when I attempted suicide for the first time, but the first self-harm cut was when I was 10 years old.

 I want to say I am a survivor but I am not actually. I would be a survivor if I overcame my fears and wanted to live after my life was saved. But I still can’t get that thought out of my head that thought every once in a while, I get when I am holding a knife. That thought of hurting myself again and again. Those scars are just a tiny bit of all of the others. There are other visible scars all over my body and those are only what’s visible. Other scars are still within me but it doesn’t show itself. I was in grade six which means I was just 11 years old when I attempted suicide for the first time, but the first self-harm cut was when I was 10 years old. Since then cutting myself isn’t the only way I coped up. When I was 12 years old, I drank some poison, I vomited blood but that was it, I survived. Then again at 12, I filled my thighs and hands with deep cuts. Luckily those early years of self-harm didn’t leave any scars. I went through a phase where I would wake up in the middle of the night and start slapping myself, pulling my hair out, crying without a break, hitting my head on the wall. Then when I was 14, I tried overdosing myself to death. I don’t what those pills were but I took 5 different kinds of pills, each contains at least ten tablets and I swallowed them all without crushing. I survived. I mean I was constantly nauseous and dizzy for three days straight and nobody noticed still I survived. Then a few months later something triggered, (oh and I don’t hurt myself on impulse. I actually think months before actually hurting myself in any way.) So, a few months later I drank half a bottle of dark phenyl. Burned my taste buds for months and also burned every time I swallowed because my neck felt like it was glued together. I cut myself several times through the years but at 16 I jumped, from the top of my house. I jumped from a 3 and a half story building and didn’t even have a scratch on my body oh and I had actually cut my hand a day before that which required 12 stitches on my left arm.

168,"I will try to keep this short. A couple years ago was hospitalized for a manic episode. This plus a history of depression got me a diagnosis of bipolar, but I don't believe it is accurate.

On the diagnosis: I was definitely manic, and with a history of depression that seems to be enough for psychs to say ""yep bipolar"" and move on. But I had some heavy drug use during that period (\~1g weed concentrate every couple days, DMT a month prior) and some MAJOR changes in life circumstance (left behind a career and identity shortly before). As far as I am concerned, I pushed myself too far and snapped. I needed time and space to recover which I have been getting.

The problem: I am being prescribed meds for bipolar. Depakote is bad for your liver, hence the blood tests. This medicine is doing my body harm, and I don't believe it's helping anything. (I do not accept that bipolar is accurate here: my mood has never ebbed and flowed as described, and isn't very fragile.) I want to get off it but I don't know how to sort this out with a psych. I brought up concerns about my diagnosis with my last couple of doctors and was summarily shut down - one made it clear that she thought I was my own worst enemy for rejecting my diagnosis (but did not share this with me at first). I have no idea how to combat this, especially because I can't be logical with respect to meds.\[1\]

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know if there are insurance concerns with discontinuing treatment? I'm mostly worried that my medical record will say ""bipolar"" and my insurance company will say ""yep, untreated"" and deny me benefits at some point down the road. (Yes, I'm in the USA...) Is this a serious concern? Should I keep fighting to get the diagnosis removed? (Is this hopeless anyway? It definitely seems like it.) Are there alternatives - should I try to find a psych that is OK without meds? (Re: doctors, I feel really bullied and powerless and I don't know what to push back on. Initially I treated them like other doctors and followed orders; now I feel like they generally have no idea what's going on and I should basically figure it out on my own and just go to them for advice. Attitude help also appreciated.)

\[1\] what I mean here: the meds ostensibly prevent mania. My argument is, ""I'm not at risk of mania and don't need the meds."" But the counter-argument is ""well the meds are keeping mania at bay so we better not remove them."" That's only true if you accept the premise (that there is underlying mania/bipolar), and since a doctor will never advocate going off medicine, this basically means there's no legitimate way to challenge this diagnosis. I have gone off the meds on my own for \~6 months and felt no discernible difference, but I really do not want a discrepancy between what's in my body and what my doctor puts on my medical record. And I don't feel comfortable telling a doctor this - instead of convincing them with evidence, I think all it will do is convince them that I can't be trusted to take  meds. :-\\",02Dec2020,1
169,"a bit of background: I'd always been like an average to slightly above average student. I got really badly depressed last year, in my last year of high school. I still managed to pass and get university entrance (luckily). I went into my first year of uni this year (architecture), feeling a lot better. I failed almost all of my courses bc I couldn't, for the life of me, focus on any of my work. I'm not gonna lie though, this year's been one of the happiest years of my life bc every other aspect has been so good. but, anyway, I've failed my first year of uni, and I haven't worked a day in my life. now I'm doing some summer courses (my first year was free bc nz and I figured I'd make the most of that by taking some much lighter design courses), but I'm still having so much trouble focusing and getting my work done.

so now I'm a bit lost on what I should do next year. I definitely don't think I should be doing any like major studying bc that would just be a waste of time and money at this time in my life. I'm considering either, going to a polytechnic bc that might still be manageable for me, or just finding a job and working for now. but those options are still kinda scary for me bc I have so much trouble functioning even as it is. a part of me doesn't think I could even hold a job bc my insomnia is so bad sometimes - like I have no control over my sleep cycle. argh idk",02Dec2020,1
170,"I don’t have panic attacks often but when I do I always have a good reason for it (like an actual problem).

I took away as many books as I could but it still felt like it was too full and it gave me one of the worst panic attacks. I don’t know why it happened but my heart’s still racing.

174,"I’ve recently got out of a relationship and one of the reasons why we broke up was because I have relationship anxiety. I started to notice that I when I was around and she’d be talking to other guys, even when we were both in the conversation, I would get a weird jealous type of feeling, there were many other things as well but this was one of the main ways it affected me. I recognized this as something I had to work on but I couldn’t seem to turn it off, even though the idea of her leaving me for someone else was ridiculous. After a while the relationship ended up fizzling out on my end and I broke up with her, but I can’t help but think that one of the driving factors was that being in the relationship was causing me unwanted anxiety because of constant worrying that I was doing something wrong and she’d end up leaving me at some point anyway. I really don’t want it to happen again in the future, especially if I really like the girl that I will be dating, because I really did like the one I had before but it seemed to not be what I wanted once I started worrying.

176,"I've (M17) been skipping highschool on a regular everyday basis and don't know what to do. I've had a trauma of school for a great part of my life (11 years), I was bullied constantly and I now fear my own safety anywhere near schools.

I can't even show up at school as I start feeling sick to my stomach and am always on the edge of a panic attack.

177,"Writing from my phone, sorry if the formatting is weird.

I'm in Hong Kong if that's needed for any reason (I read the rules like a good boy)

I have nowhere else to ask this... I been struggling a lot recently and for at least like 6-7 months with some stuff... I hate calling it anxiety or depression because it just feels like I'm being self centered or something but I'll just explain what it's been like.

I dated a girl last year from about sep-dec. I really liked her, I thought she was beautiful and all that. She was way out of my league and I was so happy. When she dumped me it hurt really bad. I was numb for a few days and it turned into anger which lasted about 3 weeks ish, seeing her at all made me seething with rage.

She dumped me because she ""had problems at home"" and ""wasn't ready for a relationship"". I was convinced she was lying, even though I know that her family really is unstable. her parents are split up and there's a bunch of shit going on with her parents jobs, you get the idea. I was convinced she was bullshitting me because she told almost the exact same thing to her previous 2 bfs. I know because I had a mutual friend with the two previous bfs. 

Anyway following the breakup I basically was sad from January to March, which started turning into anxiety in March when I had a random panic attack after looking at my aforementioned ex's instagram page. 
Since then it's been a lot of things, too much to write all about... Some include crying myself to sleep for the first time, having a dream so vivid I cried for 30 minutes after waking up, using drugs (nutmeg, pseudoephedrine, diphenhydramine, computer duster and codeine, all stuff I could get legally or had in the medicine cupboard), being sad for no reason after what should have been a fun day with my friends (this happens a lot), several panic attacks for no apparent reason.
This all happened from February - May, during which time my school was closed because of COVID, so I didn't see my ex at all.

When we went back to school from may until the end of term in June. This meant seeing her almost every day, when I sat behind her in math class. Seeing her made me feel so awful. A crushing feeling across my chest, like someone was grabbing my ribcage and crushing it. It was like some primal yearning that I knew with every fiber in me that was never gonna be fulfilled. Like constantly having dreams shattered. And then it's accompanied by a absolute onslaught of negative thoughts and what if scenarios, just so much noise and thoughts and all I wanted was to stop thinking.

And when it wasn't that direct pain from looking at her every other moment was a dull sadness and emptiness. Just enough for me to feel empty and slow but not enough for me to be able to cry it out. I could never get rid of it. 

When summer started it felt so fake. All the fun experiences were great but as soon as they ended and I came back home after being out, the emptiness set in. Like my fave was so heavy and was being pulled into a grown by some external force, and my mood was being pulled down as well. 

By the end of summer I started feeling better as I forgot about it more and more. After summer we had online school again which I hate but I didn't have to see her anymore. It was closed from August to mid September.

When I went back to school I had to deal with seeing her again. But now the feeling when I saw her was different - a sort of anxiety bubbling up in me. I couldn't describe it so well then but now I can describe it like a primal fear, to just run away. The fear of a person being held captive and saying ""please don't hurt me "" over and over as the captor stands over them. 
This feeling was worse but honestly I saw her much less now that classes had changed in the new school year and so I was feeling much better.

In mid October though, I came across a picture of my ex chilling on a sofa and sitting cuddled up to a boy that I recognised as one of her exes, who'd she'd evidently got back with. Don't remember how exactly I came across it but that doesn't matter

By then I had distanced myself so much from her but all that effort I took to forget was blown away in that instant. I felt like shit. I felt like my mind was floating and I was helpless. What definitely didn't help was that I was on a medication at the time which as a side effect caused headaches and nausea, which was manageable but made infinitely worse by this new photo. every day I went to school feeling like the world was spinning and with a headache so bad it made my vision blurry. School was also mounting up pressure with several exams which served to make it even worse. Seeing her now made me almost entirely freeze up in fear and made me a helpless husk that stood there shaking until she passed. I hated it so much. I hated that everytime something happened even slightly considering her, if I saw a photo or heard her name I would instantly react so negatively and my day would be instantly ruined. Like my happiness was so fragile that a picture could completely ruin it.
That week was during the half term break of one week, and it turned that week into a sad blur where I started using more and more diphenhydramine to numb the pain. I opened up slightly to a friend during this time but it only acted as a temporary stopgap for me.
I was ranting a lot on my social media, hoping someone would reach out to help me. I wanted to be saved. 

That brings me to the most recent event this November. I had reposted the image of my ex and her ex on my public twitter account, and one of her friends messaged me to delete it. I told them sure. they told me to ""just get over it man, it's been a year"" and that made me feel even even worse. You think I don't know that.

The next day at school she called me over in the school hallway. This was the first time she had talked to me since January. She asked me if I could please delete the photo (which I had forgotten to do) so I said sure. 
This completely broke me. When she tapped me on the shoulder and I saw her I had the most primal fear I've ever experienced. I wanted to bolt away at lightspeed, but of course I couldn't. My hands were shaking and my whole body was shivering as she asked me that and when I walked away and into my classroom it was everything I could do to keep a straight face and keep myself from either having a panic attack or bursting out in tears. on the journey home the same feeling remained and for the rest of that day and the day after that. It was awful. I couldn't take it.

A couple days later I was in the hallway again and I was talking to my friend K, who stopped halfway our conversation and said ""D(her ex now bf) is simping for M(my ex)!"" as they passed behind me. I was frozen on the spot and more terrified than even last time. I waited for them to pass and looked as their backs as they walked past. I was so broken. I managed to steel my resolve in class and stayed together,  but only on the outside. All these negative thoughts filled my head and all i could think was negative thoughts. It was at a much higher degree than before, like the damage had multiplied together from x10 and x10 into x100. It was so incredibly painful. Music which had helped me last time did nothing now. That night I really wanted to kill myself. I wanted the pain to stop and the thoughts to shut the fuck up. I only didn't because after researching, I found that overdosing on benadryl would be painful and terrifying way to die (I had a pill bottle of 25x DPH 25mg). that was a week ago.

Since then I've been thinking on and off about different ways to die (it was a week ago). it's getting better again, school is closed so I don't have to see her again but I know seeing her again is going to hurt. I don't have the twisted motivation of pain to drive to me suicide anymore although it might come back. I really want the pain to stop and maybe therapy is a better option than drugs. 
Should I ask my parents about seeing a therapist? and how can I ask them? I don't know what to say.

tl:dr - I wanted to and still kind of do want to kill myself because of an ex I can't get over. seeing her is agony and I've been sad for so long. How can I ask my parents about seeing a therapist?",02Dec2020,1

My niece who is a 15 year old girl in the UK has progressivly gotten into worse trouble at school, to the point where they have asked her to not attend on multiple occasions. She has lost a lot of weight to the point where she is now borderline anarexic, and for the past two months has cut herself various places. Most of which she has hidden for 

Her mum has tried to speak to her to find out the issue however she will not speak to her, and she won't speak to her teachers who have shown great concern as well. She also has refused to talk to councelors and mental health professionals reguarding her eating disorder on multiple occasions.

This all came to a head recently, when the school councelor spoke to her regarding her behaviour, and she reluctantly said that she had the other night called the samaratians (UK national Suicide Hotline) and hung up after being on hold for too long. The councellor asked her if she would like to go home and spend some time out of school, to which she responded that she just doesn't want to be around anymore.

As you can imagine, we are extremely worried about her wellbeing. The fact that she won't talk to anybody and tries to hide how depressed/suicidal she feel infornt of us gives me the impression that this isn't just a ""attention ploy"" a lot of teens go through.

Anything advice on what she might be going through, or any simular personal stories of how people have overcome this would be a great help for me to better understand her situation and why she might be feeling like this.

Oh and a metric tonne of questions about literally everything, and I mean literally everything - including sexual health, cervical smears, family history, etc all the way to generic medications &amp; things my Doctor knows and has on record (I looked up a template of the questions they ask) I am beyond upset that I have to attend this sh\*t. It's literally none of their business and they should be liaising with my doctor anyway.

  


Considering they refuse to actually acknowledge that I do have two other significant long term mental health conditions that even my Doctor is aware of and knows they literally exist/I have a long history of, and prescribes me literal medication for, its all just a complete joke. Apparently I ""have to attend"" or I'm not allowed to continue under their ""care"". I don't want anything recorded with them, they're there to provide therapy and support my mental health not give me completely unnecessary ""health checks"" which are literally pointless. Oh an just to make it worse they not only have one person doing it - there's two, so two people invading my privacy, listening and watching me for no good reason, out of literally no where.

  


I am extremely upset and angry. Why do they think they're entitled to any and all of my personal &amp; private information just because I have a mental health condition. In what way is any of that helpful or beneficial to me - I should be able to have a choice to attend or not. My physical health is NONE of their business.",02Dec2020,1

203,"I’ve been known as a “crier” my whole life. 

I cry when I’m anxious (also generally anxious all my life).

I cry when I’m sad. (Just a thought can make me burst into tears)

I cry when I feel guilty of something I didn’t even do.

I cry when I’m overwhelmed by all the tasks I need to complete.

I cry when I’m overwhelmed by my [racing] thoughts.

I cry when I ‘get my way’. (Like if someone helps me with something)

I cry when I’m “bored” or unstimulated (if I have nothing planned for the mean time).

I cry when I have to do something I don’t want to. 

I cry when I’m expected to do something or be somewhere for someone at a certain time.

I cry when I’m wrong, especially in social situations. 

I cry if someone were to surprise me with a thoughtful gift.

I cry when I read the sentence: “I am capable of anything.” (Probably due to lack of self esteem and see little to not worth in myself, so it’s hard to hear something I don’t believe about myself)

I cry when I’m stuck on a problem I can’t solve.

I cry if I let someone know that I’m not able to help them right now (again, guilt/shame).

I cry if someone is kind to me and my depressed self can’t match their kindness ( 

I cry if the tone of my voice is not as ‘exciting’ as I was hoping it to sound (hello depression)

I cry when I reflect on my social interactions and noticing that I’m a depressed “negative Nancy” most of the time even tho at heart I don’t wish to bring any pain or suffering onto others.

I cry when I’m not sure what to do.

I cry if I can’t remember a word mid-sentence while speaking to someone,anyone. 

I cry if there are too many noises. (Overwhelm)

I cry when I look at my past.

I cry when I look towards my future.

I cry when I look at the present moment.

*I understand a lot of these would be considered “normal” to respond with crying, it’s just for me it’s serious. It’s holding me back from a lot of things, as well as it wastes a lot of time. I’ll cry anywhere from 20 seconds (tho not so much quick cries anymore) to 2 hours. I am a Highly Sensitive Person &amp; have ADHD, which both come with a lot of emotional baggage, but I don’t think I’ve ever heard of someone who cries at basically anything, and at the drop of a hat.
It’s not like I decide to cry; I literally can’t control it. It comes suddenly and at an instant, so there is not a pause that I can possibly stop and rethink it. 
I’ve never had control over my cries, and since at least age 8, I have always been able to cry on command. It’s as if the reaction crying is always in the back just ready to let itself out at any given moment. 
I’ve been in therapy for 10 years and nothing has helped. I’m 22 and feel absolutely worthless, useless, and a waste of space when I ask for emotional support, because it’s as if I’m incurable.",02Dec2020,1
204,"**TL;DR:  Am failing hard at life because of a lack of motivation, energy and  concentration to do literally anything. Want to improve but have no idea  where to even start or what my problem is in the first place. Have  tried therapy (for ADHD) without success.**

Sorry  if this is a bit too long and incoherent. Every time I try to express  what I'm struggling with(like now) I just get overwhelmed and have no  idea where to even start.

I  haven't had a social life or real friends since I was 14 (I can't even  fathom the concept of being in a romantic relationship). I've failed  high school twice, dropped out of college twice and am on track to drop  out of college this year. In short, my life the past 5 years has just  been a meaningless repeating cycle of failure. I don't know whether it's  just because I'm *extremely* lazy, have an undiagnosed physical/mental illness or if I'm just extremely stupid.

I  was a bright and, though always shy and socially anxious, reasonably  socially capable kid throughout primary school and middle school, but I  feel like ever since I was 15-16 I've become progressively dumber to the  point where I can now barely process *any*  information and almost feel like I'm always high or just 'perceiving'  life without actually processing or interacting with anything. This was  most evident to me when I tried (and failed) to get my drivers license. I  know perfectly well what the traffic laws are but was genuinely  incapable of keeping track of anything that was happening on the road.

The past 2 years I've finally actually *tried*  to study but discovered I'm too sluggish and empty minded to keep up at  all. I always end up rereading simple sentences a few times and just  giving up from mental fatigue. I feel like like I should be able to do  better but also feel like social withdrawal and negligence of my  cognitive development in my youth have wasted my potential. I spent a  lot of my time aimlessly surfing YouTube and reddit (still do, COVID has  had no impact on my life at all besides having online classes though I  didn't attend most of them anyway). I did have hobbies but, despite  investing a lot of time on them, never put any active effort into them.

I  have no fucking clue what my problem is. I know most of you will  probably say it's a mental illness like depression/ADHD/anxiety etc. but  the problem is that all of these illnesses are just a label for a  cluster of symptoms which in turn are vaguely and subjectively defined. I  understand how this could be helpful to others, but to me it seems  completely useless. I've been to a therapist and was diagnosed with  ADHD, but the treatment was pointless because the medication didn't help  and the advice essentially boiled down to very simple and obvious  advice I was already aware of.

I  feel like I missed out on some kind of secret to life or like I'm  missing some essential component necessary for being human. It  frustrates me how literally everyone I know has this figured out and  just naturally and effortlessly 'goes with flow' while I struggle with  every single facet of life. Even in the mental health community there  seems to be this consensus of some kind of internal 'force' that's  essential for overcoming a mental illness, yet I think that's exactly  what I'm missing. I think I'm 'just' lazy but hate the idea because  clearly that just means I'm too mentally weak to be alive at all.

I really want and *need*  to change, yet paradoxically at the same time am too lazy and apathetic  to actually do anything and can't even imagine ever being a functional  adult. I feel hopeless and am desperate for any kind of insightful  advice that could put me on the right track.",02Dec2020,1
205,So my mental health has gone to shit or pergaps it was always shit. I get really bad depressive episodes and self harmed(im handling it ) and anxiety attacks and a bunch of other shit. I've recently reached out to my mom and started letting her know of my struggles and even asked to see a psychiatrist to see if I have something diagnosible. The thing is we're poor and she said she'd save up for it but since then she has made it clear that she doesn't plan on getting me one. Every time I mention it or bring it up the invalidates my struggles and says that a psych wont fix anything and she has decided that the cause of all my shit is because I am alone too much and that it has made me overthink things and make problems that aren't there. I just confinced myself that it was bullshit and that she just didn't understand but now I'm thinking what if shes right? I have spent most of my life alone in a house with only 3 or 4 hours of contact with people when I wasn't at school and my parents were working and I have gone through a lot of traumatic things since I was born one thing after the other. So yeah I am alone for very long times and that can be bad for mental health but isn't what Ive experienced way more exrtreme than other people? I mean I know lots of people who spend most of their time alone too and they dealt with it just fine and they dont get suicidal and hopeless and foggy and all the nice shit that comes with depression. I do overthink when im alone but damn isn't it bad that being alone destoys me this much? Dont I still deserve help even if loneliness is what caused it? I am so embarassed and unsure of things. Am I just going to have to suround myself with people for the rest of my life in order for me to not want to kill myself? I have had these depressive episodes whilst also going to school and being around people so maybe my mothers theory is wrong? I just want to know what's real. What are you guy's opinion?,02Dec2020,1
206,Recently my friend started going through some issues with his wife and kids. Some very personal issues has lead to them getting a divorce. I want to be there for my friend and help him but the problems his wife is causing have me literally sick to my stomach with anxiety that their kids are going to end up in a very dangerous situation despite the various legal remedies that he has been trying to put in place. He’s trying his absolute best to give their family a good life and I tend to be his venting board which I’m very grateful to be able to be. What kind of coping mechanisms do you guys have that revolve around other peoples home issues?,02Dec2020,1
207,"I am going through a break up and finally I reached a level that I wanted to move on and never look back. I start to accept the reality as it is and really looked beyond the current situation and said to myself:"" whatever I am letting go."" yet, the very next day, I woke up with anxious thoughts. I started to have my panic and intrusive thoughts. I couldn't hold myself. The air was blowing cold, I couldn't feel my feelings and let them just be. I felt it wasn't the right time to meditate. I wasn't in peace at all. A wave of depression hit me so hard. I started to look for my motivational resources. Didn't work out. I felt so down. Depression is not a linear line. Some days are better than others but I really want to move on.",02Dec2020,1
208,"I’ve never really liked my birthday, over the years this feeling has gotten progressively worse. Tomorrow will be my 22nd birthday and I just wish the day would disappear. I’m back home from college which means my friends from high school are asking what we should we do for my birthday. Truth is I don’t want to give them the privilege of spending my birthday with me. They were once great friends, but now the thought of seeing them makes me sick to my stomach with a heart full of despair.
I could drive back to my college town and see my roommates, but I don’t know if I should. 
I kind of just want to disappear tomorrow, maybe go camping by myself and turn my phone on airplane mode.
I’m not sure what it is about birthdays that make me want to cry and feel so full of shame. People just want to celebrate me??? But all that makes me want to do is runaway. I know I’m loved (and I feel lucky for that), but also with my bipolar diagnosis I’ve learned how disingenuous friendship built over many years can be.

209,"Just a short, probably dumb question. Been having s*icidal thoughts and no joy in life for about a year now i think. It might have started when my ex gf cheated on me (not an intercourse of course, we were 13-14. She was dating another guy behind my back.) No friends, abusive brother [18] (beated me up several times when he's angry over the smallest things, even when he lost a game in LoL.), feeling anxiety at school, scared of being judged and laughed at, especially for my looks. I spend most of the time in the morning making sure there is nothing weird or noticable at me. I'm really close to giving up.

I'm 15, so this might just be a part of puberty and will be eventually fixed over time by itself?",02Dec2020,1
210,"I started taking Zoloft about 6 weeks prior to when I got a rash. I was taking 100mg and went up to 200mg for OCD. During the same week, I also went on a hike. A few days later I noticed a rash. It got worse and so I saw a doctor. He said it was poison oak and prescribed me steroids (prednisone). It was  a week's dose at 40mg and went down slowly. My eye was swollen shut, and other parts of my body started to swell. The steroid helped but as I went off of it, the swelling went up a lot. I eventually went to the ER because my genitals were swollen about 3 times the size. The doctor gave me a 3 week period of steroids to take. I personally am not sure if it truly is poison oak or if this could be a reaction to the Zoloft. It has now been about a month and although the rash it looking somewhat better, new areas are starting to create a rash as I continue on the 200mg zoloft. Neither my doctor or the ER doc think its Zoloft and maybe they are right but I am not sure myself. What are your thoughts? I can't be on these steroids forever and I don't want to continue to take the Zoloft if its the problem. Obviously, I am going to take to my doctor about getting off the Zoloft to be sure, but I wanted opinions. Thank you in advance!

211,"My younger brother is in his 30s and currently spiraling out of control. Drinking around the clock and has threatened suicide several times in the past month or two. His wife called me earlier this week in tears. I rarely have ever spoken to her up to that point...not out of any sort of bad relationship we just have never been close so I know that she must be seriously upset by all this for her to call me. She said she is scared every day and is being abused. I asked if it was physical and she said no he's never done anything physical but it is around the clock verbal abuse. They have a one year old in the house as well.

&amp;#x200B;

About a month ago he was threatening suicide so my father went to his house to try to get him to go to a rehab or mental health facility and he refused. The police wound up getting called and took him to hospital. The hospital released him in less than 24 hours, presumably because he said he was fine and hid whatever issues he was having.

&amp;#x200B;

I got a call from my sister-in-law this morning to come over and help her out in talking with him. When I got there she was crying and I told her to leave and go to her parents house. I spoke with him for about an hour and the only way I can describe the conversation is that it was like talking to a crazy person. He said he know he has a drinking problem and mental health issues, but at the same time ranting and raving about people being jealous of him, wanting his money, doesn't trust doctors because they will lie to him so that is why he can't get help from a medical professional, etc. I tried being understanding and going along with all that and saying that even though those are valid concerns, he needs to do this to show his wife and son that he is trying to get help, which sent him down a hole of ""I can't live my life for other people because that's all I have done my whole life and it has ruined my life.""

&amp;#x200B;

I am very worried about him and my nephew and sister-in-law and I do not know what to do. She is almost certainly going to leave him with their son, which is 100% what she needs to do because she is miserable, but that still leaves him needing help. How does one help someone in this situation, or can they even be helped? I called a clinic in my area and they said basically if he doesn't want to be admitted (either for substance abuse or mental health) they really can't do anything. Is this something where we all have to sit by and watch and wait for him to do something that causes himself or someone else harm?",02Dec2020,1

I realized that my life will never be the same, that my physical health will never be the same, that I will carry this burden and pain forever because I was so unlucky to catch this disease or whatever it is that disfigured my body. 

No treatment exists for it, only some things that will make some days more bearable than others. I’m only 24 years old, I had so much planned, so much that I wanted to do, but now it’s not even worth it anymore, for I am done. 

I have been engaging in more self sabotaging behavior since I already messed up my life, might as well ruin it more since it won’t get any better. 

My biggest wish now, is to die young. I ask God for forgiveness everyday, because there’s this side of me that doesn’t think and just jumps out there impulsively...And it’s destroying me completely. 
I ask God to save me from this, to please release me from this. He won’t heal me physically, so at least I hope he please frees me from this horrible behavior that is ruining me. I know it’s ruining me and it won’t help my case and I still do it... Why 😭 It wasn’t suppose to be this way.

I was working for a pretty big company at the time and I had been honest in the run up to it with my boss so they were very understanding I was allowed to just basically stop working while I fixed myself.

So roll on today and I’m starting back at software development next week, the HR rep and Manager have both asked me what I want to tell people as regards where I’ve been to explain why I’m basically not a new hire but also will need adjustment time and I’m not sure how much I should divulge so as to not put myself at a disadvantage/set myself up for any bullying.

I’ve experienced depression for the majority of my life, and was diagnosed by a therapist but I’m afraid because for the past month or more my symptoms have been really light compared to where I used to be and I guess I’m afraid I’m faking or I’m just not sure where this leaves me. 

It’s not like I’m happy, but I’m also not as bad off as I used to be, and for some reason that terrifies me. I never imagined a life past where I had been and it’s scary to process anything that could be in my future at this point. I don’t really want to.

I’m scared that maybe this period could just be a time where it’s better and I’ll get worse again. I feel like I deserve to feel worse again. 

It’s hard for me to process my life because it feels like I’m hardly living, but a blank mind is better than a hurting one, but I don’t want to live blank. Sometimes I feel I’ve lost my personality to my pain and when that’s gone I’ll be a shell.

222,"  I almost died 4 times this year and I’ve had 7 psych ward admissions this year. And I’ve had to even stop going to go to school. And I’ve really badly permanently scarred myself this year from self harm. 

   I honestly really didn’t think I would make it to Christmas but now it’s looking like a might. Anyway my family is apparently very thankful also. I have always sorta been the forgotten child until I went all mental lol. I had a secret traumatic childhood but my friends spilt my secrets when they were questioned on what was going on with me. (I don’t blame them I’m not mad at them I just felt betrayed in the moment). 

   So yea holidays I was just in the shadow. Siblings get $200 worth of presents each and me $50 which was fine it just made me feel left out. And my birthdays forgotten sometimes and when it’s not I got hardly anything and I don’t even get to pick out the cake because “you have to think of what everyone wants”. My sister got luxury stuff and I got off brand cheap stuff. I had no friends so I hated birthday parties anyway because no one would ever show up. 

   And I was stuck doing all the chores that my siblings were supposed to help out with. The only pro is that a lot of the time they wouldn’t even notice if I wasn’t home so I would be off miles away just riding around town on my bike. I hardly spoke at school because kids bullied me. And I used to get A’s and B’s but got yelled at for the B’s while my brother literally had straight F’s and got a “it’s ok you tried your best”. 

   But now I choose the restaurants and we split the chores and I get lots of attention. And for Christmas my dad is going all out. Especially for me. And so is my mom. And even my younger usually bratty brother is spending lots of money on me. I don’t even tell them what I want they just found out that I had wish list on my dads amazon account that I randomly add stuff to all year round when I get bored. And I know I’m a snoop but I have settings to where when something is bought it disappears from the list. And I getting a $600 laptop and $100 headphones! I usually save up and buy myself things and it takes FOREVER because I’m a kid but wow my wishlist is really getting smaller and smaller. $70 worth or hello kitty cr*p. And a $80 keyboard. 

  First of all I should stop looking at my list. And second I feel kinda bad because that’s a lot of money. More money then ever been spent on me. The most expensive thing that I owned before this is a Nintendo switch. That I got back when they were like $300 only instead of $700 cr*p. Like I even mention I’m hungry and my dad ask if I want to order a pizza. And I even walk out of the house to get the mail and he notices (which is little annoying I miss my all the way across town free time sorta). 

   I mean I call my brother a name when he is getting on my nerves like we used to go back and forth. But now I call him something and he doesn’t call me 
anything back. Like he is being nice?

  I don’t know I feel like I’m being a nuisance when they get me stuff. And I feel like a spoiled brat. My dad has been just giving me money in my account for months now also like $100 here and for my birthday I got $600. Like just crazy.",02Dec2020,1
223,"My family is dysfunctional. My mom told me this morning that my older brother is angry that no would calls or talks to him. He lives in another country and our time difference is 7-8 hours. He isolated himself and moved to his own place.

I’ve had nightmares again of him threatening to beat me up physically and just talking to him makes me incredibly stressed. I started to have to back away from him secretly for these reasons. He has told me numerous times when we’re just having a normal conversation that he’s getting irritated and he wants to warn me that he’s scared he’s going to physically hurt me so then I leave. He has scary scary anger issues. I’m also scared that he’s going to abuse his wife if he ever gets married. 

Only two sisters supposedly talk to him and my mom was telling me what an awful sister I am. I have a lot of brothers and sisters. My siblings don’t all get along. There’s no respect and very bad issues in all of them. I’m the youngest so once I also stopped talking to everyone things got way worse. I blame myself for my family falling apart like it did because I feel like it was my job to keep everyone together and I did for a while. It’s not like my family loves or cares about me and I’m supposedly suppose to care about them.

My parents have had very bad issues all their life too and I still live with them so I’m mentally not okay. I’m really tired of taking care of their emotional needs.

My older brother hasn’t been there for me either and he also takes advantage of me. I honestly would rather not have anything to do with him but I feel incredible guilt that he is possibly suicidal again. He was in a hospital before for suicidal ideation or attempt. 

I haven’t been okay myself and even if I talk to my brother he’ll just get angry at me and hurt me emotionally... 

Should I still reach out to this brother? Am I just being an awful sister?

I stopped talking to him because I’m honestly scared of him and it’s really stressful being around him. I know he doesn’t respect that I want to also be less religious, don’t want to date, etc.

I have been struggling with depression and its draining the life out of me. This is one of my only choices to talk to someone. I can't open up to my friends and family but I can to you.",02Dec2020,1
228,"While fighting the stigma associated with mental health is important, I think we need to start communicating that there are success stories in mental health.  I started a website that documents people that have successfully navigated mental health issues.  We post videos of people and they talk about what they did to overcome their particular ailment. Like everyone else, I'm trying to get it to go viral, so I need some help from this community.  Please visit the site if you need inspiration.  Also, if you would like to post your story, you can do that on the site as well.  Thanks.

229,"Currently I am 24 years old and I admit that I am a failure at life. I messed up everything I have ever done. I chose the wrong high school, college, and major. I am in debt by a lot and still live with my parents. My friends look down on me because they are successful while I am not. 

I always thought about suicide in the past and when and how I would go about it. Now I know. My family consist of a bunch of older people. My cousins and uncles who i talked to in the past are already dead. Once my parents die then I will have no reason to keep myself alive. I've thought about this numerous times and I weighed the options of the physical pain I would experience in my last moments but I think it is better than years of mental pain. 

So at this point I am starting to find comfort in my death. I know that I want to do it in a way that is not bloody and keeps my body together. I just want to wake up, watch a show or movie for the last time, maybe eat my last meal with a desert and them kill myself. 

I just don't think life is worth living for someone like me. I have failed at life and I am not deserving of it. I am 24 years old and I have already messed up my life to the point where I have experience everything. The only thing left to go through is more death, shame, and failure.",02Dec2020,1
230,"Last week my gf broke up with me since we didn’t click. Looking back on everything, I strongly believe I was emotionally abused throughout most of the relationship. She’s blamed the breakup on me and when I tried to hold her accountable she got defensive and played the victim card. I’m conflicted on how I feel after everything. Some days I feel good I left because she gave me lots of anxiety. Other days I feel responsible for our breakup and how I was bad, then I’ll feel embarrassed for ignoring all the red flags. I almost feel ashamed for defending her bad actions while we were together. I was a fool and kept going back. She’d threaten to breakup often and I’d beg for her not to. I’m stupid. She told others it was just physical but yet she told me we were a thing. I fell for it and I’m ashamed.",02Dec2020,1

But things changed now. My country is having a lock down again and I feel completely lonely and isolated. I am single now for 1 1/2 years, living by myself for the first time ever for 4 months now and don't have any close friends. I have what I call 2nd degree friends who are great for going out, brunches, going to events with etc. but I don't have that deep connection with them which I am missing. And we barely talk now because we can't really see each other in person and it feels as if the connection is more and more fading. I moved a lot in my life so I don't have these consistent old friends others seem to have. I live rather close to my family again now, but I am missing actual friends to talk to. This pandemic sucks, I can't do the majority of my interests, I am losing connection to people I liked and the hobbies I have that I could do I don't enjoy right now.

234,"Ok so this whole thing has been going on for a while but I'll try to keep it short. A girl (16f) who is friends with my sister started saying some things that make me concerned about her ""anxiety doctor"" 
1. He prescribed her anxiety medicine which I see her drinking all the time, i found out the ""medicine"" is vodka + water in a bottle. 
2. He said her mom needed to get metal bars put in her wrists to help with her anxiety - I've never hear of this and havent been able to find anything about it online 
3. He reccomended a therapist to her who has been giving some sketchy advice (give up hobbies that make you happy, plan days to make yourself sad all day, etc). And whenever one of her friends questions it she tells the therapist and they tell her to cut that friend out and block them on everything. 
4. He keeps putting her or diets with rules that don't make sense. Like you need to be vegan but you aren't allowed to buy almond milk or anything premade, you have to squeeze all your own almonds. 
5. One time, a whole year ago, she was hanging with my sister and all of a sudden her mom called and wanted her to go to this doctor, so I drove her there and dropped her off. It was a house in the middle of nowhere that looked like the roof was caving in. 

So I don't really know what to do with all of this. Since the pandemic hit she has been ignoring messages from all the girls and blocking them. I tried reaching out to her too and she ignored it. We're worried but I'm not sure what can be done. What do you all think about this situation? Are this doctor and therapist legit?

240,"Hello,

My future brother in law has some serious mental health issues and refuses to go to therapy. Now normally I believe it's none of my business to meddle in other peoples health issues, but I am really worried about my in-laws and his children. 

For context, he is in his early 30s and has been this way since I have met him. He has high and low cycles but has also shown aggression during his high periods. He does not work and spends all if his time researching conspiracy theories online. He tends to get in huge Facebook fights that normally make little to no sense and he thinks he is smarter than everyone else (including therapists which is why he won't seek help).

I personally believe he is getting worse. His entire family is disowning him except for his parents and because his many conspiracy theories are based on politics, diseases, and religion, what we are going through now has really pushed him over the edge.

His parents buy him groceries and cigarettes, they bring his children to him (was never married and not with his children's mother) and have spoiled him his entire life. They aren't rich and he lives in pretty poor conditions but for the way he treats them they really go the extra mile to make sure he can live fairly comfortably. 

Yesterday he out of the blue started fighting with his sister and my fiance and sending really horrible messages about my transgender sister and posting them on his Facebook wall. We have now all blocked him but are worried about the safety of his parents. The live 13 hrs away from us and it's just the parents and brother and law that live in that town. He has been violent before and had the police called on him in the past. 

I guess my question really is if there is anything we can do from here. I don't want to get into a situation where it could be too late. And yes we have pleaded with him to get help but he refuses. We were talking about getting him placed in a 72hr hold but not sure that is an option or even a good option.

Plus I really think that my in-laws are scared to do anything because he might loose his children (he has a horrible relationship with his ex) and because he is an adult it's a lot harder to pull the trigger on this. 

Any suggestions of support or ideas on how to help would be amazing.",02Dec2020,1

242,"First post on reddit &amp; English is my second language, so apologies for any grammar/spelling errors.

So I've recently started my first semester (online studies), and things are not going well.

I had some trouble with anxiety in the last couple of years, and its been a while since I really had a regular schedule and deadlines.

Honestly the hours are surprisingly reasonable, and being online saves me a lot of travel since I live a bit far from campus, but that's not really what's bothering me.

My main issue is that I still have a pretty hard time with my anxiety, and it doesn't seem like there's much I can do about it.

Ever since I finished high school, it just feels like nothings going right for me. Looking at it objectively, I finished a gifted students program with good grades along with some side projects, volunteer work and such.

But I really don't think its all that impressive. I didn't work as much or as hard as most people I know, and most of my achievements were basically a requirement in order to pass my class, and I barely managed to get them done properly.

It's pretty much been downhill since, with me having to leave my last job due to mental health issues.

So here's why I feel like there's not much I can do about it all:

I went to a therapist during high school which was helpful...ish. I don't really know why but I just felt like I couldn't really be honest about how I'm feeling with him, he gave me all sorts of tips and stuff to help but I just didn't feel motivated to follow through, not sure if its just cuz I was being lazy or because it seemed kind of ineffective, but at some point I just started saying that I'm doing well and everything's working out just to make things go more smoothly (to be fair, things were doing pretty fine, but I'm pretty sure that's just due to the fact it was the final few months of school so there wasn't really anything going on at all at that time).

For various personal reasons, I just didn't have much time for therapy after I graduated. As I said, things got pretty bad, and I ended up just staying home doing nothing for a couple of months (this is about half a year after graduation, so not all that terrible but still not good).

I'm currently staying with my parents, and its pretty easy to tell that my personal problems have a pretty severe impact on them as well.

I'm certainly not a mental health expert, but my mom worked from home even before Covid, and especially now it is very obvious that they both have enough trouble of their own, without having to deal with my issues as well.

Now I get that in theory I maybe should be giving my own health some priority, but I don't think that seeing them stress out about me is going to make me feel any better. Either I say nothing and suck it up alone, or talk about it and continue to have a bad time, but now with more people sharing that bad time with me. It's pretty much a lose-lose situation, and I decided to bet that I can make it through Uni without having a major mental crisis, and trying to take care of things later.

I'm trying not to be too naïve about it, I know that its not going to be easy, and may very well prove to be impossible for me to handle, but I feel like I just can't quit before I see the end of it, given that I've already done that plenty before, and it never really improved my situation.

That's pretty much it so far, I'm still doing quite badly, and I'm not sure if I can manage this semester and the next one before I get some time to rest and maybe recover for the next year.

Uhhh so if anyone's got any good advice on that, or maybe just on how to study while you're very anxious, cuz I have a test in a few days.",02Dec2020,1

I was on the phone with the woman and she was asking me some pretty difficult, technical questions. I was so stressed out and was trying my best to hold myself together and answer well.

256,"So, I'm a high school student. And I get a LOT of work from school. In all subjects.

So the first thing I noticed was- I'm fucking slow at this. Like everyone else seemed to write like flash and I could not. I am a pretty dumb child (that's an understatement), so I didn't think much of it.

But for the last few years, I've noticed something that I do all the time, everywhere, not only when writing, I mean EVERYWHERE.

So the first thing I know is that I HATE it when things aren't symmetrical. Why's that? I don't fucking know. But whenever I make, for example, a rectangle on a ruled sheet, it HAS too fit perfectly on the lines, and all the lines need to be the exact same as their opposites. Get what I mean?

For a while, I didn't think much of it. But I KNOW that it really affects my work because I spend so much time correcting things, that probably aren't even mistakes.

Another example- whenever I'm writing a fraction, the bar below the numerator HAS to be on the printed line- if it's not, I cut the whole thing (a symmetrical zigzag lmao), and then do it again.

Then one more thing I've noticed is that if I do something with one of my hands or legs, I HAVE to do the same thing with the other side.

I'm obsessed with things looking perfect (to me).

And it's not just that, I obsessively try to perfect everything. Is it because I'm insecure? Probably. Do I know for sure? Abso-fucking-lutely not.

&amp;#x200B;

As I said before, this is not just limited to schoolwork. If I decide to do something, I CANNOT stop until I've done it. I've stayed up whole nights because I started doing something and wanted to finish it before anything else.

Example- This post, the one you're reading. I wasn't planning on writing it right now. But I thought about it. And because I thought about it, I HAD to do it. I feel helpless before my own self.

Then I looked up symptoms of schizo and found that I 100% have the negative thoughts symptom (I researched it and am certain). As for the other symptoms, I'm not sure. Although I have them, I can keep them all from interfering with reality. I get the unorganized thoughts, unorganized motor capabilities, and the delusions. I didn't actually believe my delusions until the past six months, in which I developed a belief in one of them (boxing welterweight champion).

Seeing that this could potentially be schizo gave me a reality check, but the delusions don't stop. They are constantly happening, only in times of great focus do they stop, such as learning parts to a song on piano or doing math. 

I understand I can't get diagnosed here, but should I bother telling my parents and try meeting with a physiatrist? Or is this definitely not schizo. Like I said, it could also be developing, which scares me the most. 

I have OCD and depression, which could be important as my risk of other mental health issues may increase with those.

I hate doing the things i love, i cant keep up with higiene, i just cant do it, i have to force myself. i do not care about music school anymore. i used to be very passionate about it, but i just completely do not care anymore. i hate drawing now, even have a wacom tablet, cant even force myself to draw anything. but i cry maybe like once every 2-3 months.

267,"My brother has been depressed for over a decade.  He is in his late twenties and it started near the end of high school when our parents told him he was worthless.  He was not good at doing anything except for drawing and art, but at the time they didn't let him pursue that career.  He has been dating his girlfriend for 8 years and now has a full-time job as an artist.  Having said that, his depression ""still hasn't gone away"".

I won't go as far as saying that at this point he's faking it, but I do think that he would rather be depressed than not.  Here's why:

He has a habit of constantly making excuses for his shortcomings and responsibilities (""I forgot, ""I'm depressed"").  He knows all the depression symptoms by heart and will use it to justify his actions.  A part of me suspects that he's gotten so used to using depression as an excuse that he wants to stay in that zone where he can have unlimited passes.  

He is always looking for depressing things to read or watch,  whether it's negative news articles or TV shows/anime with the most darkest plot, he is fiending for it.

One day he said he came home from a doctor visit and said that the doctor diagnosed him with some sort of anxiety.  This really made me really uncomfortable because he was smirking the entire time he was talking about it.

He refuses to live a proper lifestyle and take care of himself (consistent meals, proper sleep).  My mom still cooks all his meals and cleans up after him.  He attributes this to how these are common symptoms of depression.

He does not want to take antidepressants because it will make him ""unproductive"" at work.

Whenever he's not feeling good, he has to make it known.  He slouches over in a seated fetal position with a sad look on his face like he's waiting to be asked about his problems.  After talking to him about his problems and changing the subject he will constantly try to steer the conversation back to his depression and his problems.

271,"What lve always considered to be my family was my mom, my two sisters, my nephew, my aunt(mom)and uncle,  two cousins, my two grandparents (mom), my great-grandmother. 

There's other people on the fringe who very much my extended family,  but these people have always been the ones who are my blood and part of who l am where we get each other more than anyone else and have that love of being the most important people in our lives above friends or coworkers or the dating spouses that come and go. 


Five years ago my 7 year old cousin died of leukemia. It was absolutely devastating as l'd never experienced such a tragic event such as that. Someone so young and who l cared about so deeply. I'd never faced cancer before so l was ignorantly optimistic that she would not die any time soon, maybe 10 years on as a worse case scenario,  surely not as a child.  I have many regrets for things l did not do and selfish choices l made to not spend time with her when it was still scary for me to see someone l loved dying in front of my eyes and leaned towards denial and avoidance of the incoming truth. When l went to visit her for the last time and the first time in months l wasn't prepared for her to already be unconscious and hours from her death. 

This was a life changing experience for me that in retrospect led to some PTSD'esque behavior but nothing at the time l would've considered life destroying for me.  I tried to take the lesson from this that life had to be lived and while l look back and see the depression that l did not recognize at the time,  l focused instead on what l believed was a new found belief that my life was a gift and l had to do things like travel to the other side of the world or kiss the girl you like just because you're going to die eventually.  I see now how that was actually the birth of some self destructive tendencies but at the time, l thought l was living the way you should after such a tragedy. 

Then, three years ago my mother was diagnosed with stomach/throat cancer and grandmother had a life destroying stroke within the same week. In the year and a half that followed my mother had her stomach completely removed during a surgery where they were only going to take some of it when they went in, which was incredibly hard as it's something l didn't even know was possible and resulted in an unbelievably impossible quality of life that lead to her becoming bed ridden, undiagnosed depression as we all lived shell-shocked and in a haze over the horrors of what was happening to her,  eventually weighing only 56lbs by the beginning of the year when her cancer returned. I have so many terrible painful stories from that time of things that in retrospect l wish l'd had the clarity of mind to do differently or to help her when we lived in a constant state of just getting through the day. 

Within two weeks of her cancer returning (this was one year ago)  l received a call at 3am that was the call to rush to the hospital because my mother was coughing up blood. They attempted to stabilize and seemed to once bringing her to the ICU, but she was in shock and couldn't speak or fix her eyes onto anything.  Within minutes in the ICU l went to fix her pillow and saw blood was pouring from her mouth and pooling next to her. Over the course of the day they attempted to help the bleeding but kept trying to make it very clear that my mom was not going to make it through the day, l fought the idea of giving up on her as she had always told me she wanted life to always be chosen over drugs to let her die. Eventually, a doctor spelled enough out that it broke me and l agreed that if she needed to be resuscitated again to just let it happen.  I watched her bleed to death over the course of the day and stood crying insanely and holding her hand telling her she would make it for half an hour just in case she heard me and was scared we'd given up once they believed she was minutes away.  I could write 15 more paragraphs truly explaining every last detail of this day. 

I fell into a pretty insane depression after this, and experienced intense PTSD that changed my personality and the way my mind worked entirely.  I lost 20 pounds to stress and now, a year later my hairline has receded at a crazy excelerated rate going from a slight widows peak to the point now where only a year later I'm going to need to shave my head if l don't want to look like a sad man with a combover. 

It took about two months for me to reach a day where l woke up and felt that this day would be the beginning of my path back to a good life.  That same day my grandfather (Papa) was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer after himself losing weight and being all kinds of off but the belief in the family was that it was just the similar shock of watching his daughter die.

Long story short l then immediately began helping Papa with his cancer 3 or 4 days out of the week until l finally felt that as much as l loved him l just knew l couldn't do this again or it would destroy what was left of me.... that week covid happened, and with the loss of my job and the need to quarantine NOT in Brooklyn at that time, and the knowledge that my grandfather would now truly have no help or outlets for companionship, l decided to wait out the ""14 days to flatten the curve"" with him and my aunt. I'm still living in that house. 

Backing up to the initial diagnosis His wife,  my grandmother with the stroke had been living at home and being taken care of by him, but their quality of life had fallen terribly over the months to the point where we were considering it an abusive/neglected situation prior to my mother's death but the shared trauma made us all very slow and depressed with taking action to better their lives, leaving them to suffer on their own for the better part of 2019 in a terrible, disgusting living situation with little to no help. When he was diagnosed the idea of ""maybe we need to put our foot down that even though she didn't want this,  she would have to live in a nursing home for at least his treatments and in our minds probably forever after that,  though she fought it tooth and nail and every day begged us to take her home.  

I watched my grandfather deteriorate and age 40 years physically and mentally in 3 months.  I can't begin to fully detail all of the insane things l experienced with him every single day during that time from New found dementia symptoms to falling and hurting himself multiple times a day to the point where there was a month where every single day l was awoken from my bed to the sound of either hearing or being told he had fallen and l was needed to pick him up off the ground.  I can't continue to detail more.

We began to see news that nursing homes were being devastated by covid.  But with the 24/7 life of only taking care of a dying man, we didn't take action about getting my grandmother out of a nursing home when we had checked her in in the first place because we could not handle attempting to care for her as well. One week she called me and begged to be taken out of the home before she caught the virus but we held on to the false hope that with no visitation there was no reason a quarantined home would get it, and then within the next few days we found out it had arrived in her home. We decided then to get her out but this being within the first few weeks of the pandemic and distracted with our own traumatic 24/7 living conditions in which noone could even help if they wanted to because the strict early times isolation everyone was following, we just weren't used to living in a time where you need to act no or your life can be over tomorrow.  So instead of getting her the day we decided to do it, we made a plan for that weekend to take her out and have her Quaratine with my cousin in a hotel just in case she had it but as a formality really in our minds.  Well a few days into her stay at the hotel,  it became clear that she did indeed have covid... and oh... she had COPD, a devastating breathing disease. She was taken to the hospital and two days later we were finally able to have a brief 5 minute webcam conversation with her about how they expected her to be better by the next day or so. The next morning we woke up to the news that she had died during the night. My grandfather, who was already beginning to deteriorate did not take this news well.

The funeral was the worst experience of my life.  It was only us three because early covid restrictions. We were all required to wear gloves,  the panic was high in the room at the feeling that the disease was airborne,  and the entire service and day only lasted for about 45 minutes.

5 weeks later my grandfather finished cancer treatments but was now completely mentally unable to remember that just because food had no taste didn't mean he couldn't eat.  We demanded him to drink boost protein drinks multiple times a day which became an issue along the lines of him feeling we were torturing and dominating him on purpose to make him suffer.  He was down to 105 lbs by this point.  When bringing him for his check up the next week the doctor was very concerned by his looks and his mind and wanted to keep him to run tests.  We knew what would happen but what were we going to do? This was at a time where the hospitals were packed and no visitation was allowed and we were concerned he would not receive the care he would need to survive.  We were assured that he'd only be there for 3 days.  Those three days became 10 days of ""tomorrow we'll have the resources"" before we simply were forced to take him back out without any of the tests being done.  Without the proper care or attention, he was likely being given meals that he did not eat which were taken away and essentially starved him for 10 days. On the day he was released they surprised us with papers agreeing that he needed to be on hospice care from this point forward. When he was returned to our home, he was now on his death bed and within days he died. I was in the room with him when it happened.

Its getting progressively more exhausting to explain all this so l will just simply say that yesterday, after months of us wanting to make plans to see her which were always put off due to covid restrictions and spikings and all that,  my great grandmother Mama died after likely catching covid and being unable to breathe.  We did not know she was sick until after finding out she was dead.

I now have to go to the fifth family funeral on Thursday or Friday of this week and l honestly do not know if l can do it.  I had just been considering leaving this house which l have been in all year with my grandfather and all that.  It's myself,  my aunt and my uncle (the ones who lost their child) but quite frankly, they have become mentally exhausting to live with as they clearly have not dealt with her death in any type of healthy ways, looking at me and treating me as if l am their teenage son in their house and not a grown ass man,  which has really fucked with my state of mind to point where l feel myself living as if l am bound to their rules and lifestyle in the same way a high school teenager has no choice but to do whatever his parents say and to make matters worse l have spent the last decade of my life in a city with no need for a car and thus don't even have the freedom to drive off the property or anywhere on my own, completely dependent on them to bring me anywhere.... which is no where because l have no life.  I'm 30 and used to have an entire life of my own that has devolved into living here with no friends, job or life of my own. My uncle always has work around the house to be done that he ""needs a hand"" with guilting and forcing me to participate in order to earn my keep and sometimes just means standing there and handing him tools like I'm a fucking 10 year old boy, and then dealing with his lectures and his sad eyes over why l should be more interested in learning about the things he's doing when all l see is that l have no identity, no agency and have somehow regressed to being a 30 year old boy that's spoken to and treated as such and in no way feels like my own man. My aunt is becoming near schizophrenic levels of devoted to the church with beliefs that God has shown her visions of why she needs to dedicate every moment of her life the religion and save our souls. 

I'm completely lost, have vague ideas of returning to an room in an apt l have been paying for throughout the entire pandemic to reclaim my life but have no concrete plan on what that actually means and with the way covid news has been unfolding it appears that NYC is now just as bad if not worse when it comes to daily deaths and new cases than it has ever been in this entire year. And since I'm being honest about fucking every last detail of my mind and soul, l have not gone on a date, had sex or even romantically touched a woman in any way over 2 and a half years since my mother was initially diagnosed and l had just broken up with a long term girlfriend so the idea of getting back in there always felt like it should wait until a better emotional time period which has never come thanks to the years of nonstop trauma and devastation that have come since. 

I'm not even positive I've truly detailed everything,  as l very much wrote this as a 6am, still awake from the insomnia of needing to just voice this, stream of consciousness. There were two other extended family members who died suddenly before covid that l regret not visiting as they had always asked me to. There were devastatingly dumb dating life choices that has led me to not have a real, healthy bf/gf relationship in the last five years, instead being in situations where l was the other man to a failing long term couple or the FWB to an ex where we both mutually no longer wished to be together but tortured ourselves by continuing to find sex with each other instead of with someone new etc. My career goals have been non existent since my mother's diagnosis to point now with that being three years ago and unemployed via the pandemic from the side job that had become the only job, all feel like lifetimes ago l even held such aspirations. I feel as though I've suddenly gone from a 25 year old to 30 year old body with no recollection of how l got here or why lm realizing that l don't know when l starting living in constant physical back and shoulder blade pain and it seems a curve developed in my spine from slouching for years and standing to compensate the shoulder pain which began about six of so years ago much more slightly and easily livable but l both brush off as just normal aging stuff but have recently begun to question if lve just been so busy self medicating with things like Tylenol and marijuana and drinks that now cutting back on those l may be feeling real issues that are years and years overdue to have looked at by a doctor. 

I get the feeling that the last few paragraphs have just become ""Well since l'm saying everything bad that's happened, here's just everything else too"" and the writer in me wants to wrap all of this up with a bow or edit it down to just the deaths of this past year but fuck it, l try to tell myself that this is all just normal shit that happens to people and the my life is fine because at any moment l can just choose to get right back to where l was 5 years ago and pick it all back up again like no time had passed, l tell myself to be charming on the dating apps I've just recently starting using again and act like the old me and fake it til l make it and to carry that over to finding a new job and returning to my home in NYC and building a life for myself.  But there is no world right now is how l feel.  That the whole world is shut down even if l wanted to try to stand back up and that this shit actually isn't normal. Which is really hard for me to admit to myself, that l actually need to accept that my life has been abnormally devastating, not just the same as most people my age but with the details changed. I don't know, all l know is that if l don't force musky myself to stop writing l just never will and will never go to sleep.",02Dec2020,1
272,"Hey all!

Recently I’ve been having some anxiety about a lump i’ve found. It’s in the area where the sternum meets the clavicle. There seems to be another similar lump on the other side, but smaller. Squishy and moveable. Gets bigger when I lift arm up. It seems to be part of my joint and GP said it’s likely muscle.

I have an appointment with a dermatologist next tuesday to get it checked out, but there’s not much information I have going in.. Been looking at Dr. Google and, of course, I’m starting to only see the bad picture here. Would love some encouragement.

I’m not exactly sure how to post a picture, but here’s a link to a picture where the bump is. Curious if anyone else has this joint “lump”.

Another note: I have been diagnosed with costochondritis roughly 4 months ago. This lump could’ve always been there, but only noticed it after feeling my chest from the costo pains.

273,"I feel broken. I'm a 16yo Male.

I met this girl through a friend. She lives in Maryland. Remember this bit. I met her around April during the start of the pandemic. We started talking on the phone starting on FaceTime and Snapchat. At first I really didn’t consider her all that attractive but she considered me attractive. At first we were just friends, friends that would call each other everyday, over quarantine. I want to note that she had a boyfriend at this time. Over the course our friendship she broke up with him and gained a new boyfriend. When this happened I felt pretty hurt. I couldn’t distinguish why but I felt hurt. So I told her I was done talking to her for a bit and it hurt her and she could not tell why. This is when I found I had feelings for her. A week or so later I talked to her again. Fast forward onto school, I’m starting to feel bothered. I realize I want to see this girl. It becomes the only thing I want. Slowly I abandoned my interests in the gym but my performance in school is still well maintained. Now I want to include this piece of knowledge. I want to note, I live in Florida. Now I know what your thinking. She lives in Maryland. I live in Florida. This isn't going to work. Well, I didn't care and so I did what any crazy person would do, I went to see her. I'm not going to note how I managed to go from Maryland to Florida but let's say I pulled some strings and got my way. I can tell you that what I did was quite out of character and this is not something I would have done so the year prior to this happening. When I saw her we hooked up. This is when everything goes to shit. By doing this I think I’m mentally made myself completely vulnerable. As I went back to Florida, I realized in the next week that I could not live without this person and I slogged through the next week with no drive. This happened over a month ago I am now writing because I cannot take it anymore. I’m going crazy. This is the only person I can think about. I know this is of one girl but I feel like I connected with her like no one else. After going back to Florida, I told her I would no longer talk to her and she cried. I feel like it’s affecting me worse than it affected her. I am not someone that talks to the opposite gender to where I have options. The worst part is I look like a mess to others and I feel like a mess and I have no drive to even put on a façade that I can use to get someone that I can use to distract myself from her. I feel like this is the ultimate conundrum. I’m writing this because I felt tempted to add her back on Snapchat and on her story that I accidentally checked, To my luck it was her boyfriends birthday and it was her with him. I have distinguished seeing (Her with her boyfriend) As a trigger. Even though we were ""friends"" It drove me CRAZY. I literally cannot handle the site of seeing her with someone else. I made myself so vulnerable to her because I was able to connect with her like no one else. I am well aware that you are not supposed to put another being rather than yourself on a pedestal but internally I always feel that way because the way she once made me feel. I have no drive for anything, Or anyone but I am trying, I am trying. I attempt to go to the gym and I just slog through the work out. I go to school and I just slog through the classes not paying attention to a damn thing. I go home and I lay down for a few hours before doing an hour of work total. Thank God I got all A’s last quarter so now I can I can get B's And it will average out to A's so I am not affected by this. I don’t know what I’m going to do for the future because I do not see this getting better. I cannot find a way to distract myself from this and I need serious help. I’ve always been kind of a down person but this is really sent me and I really never understood this constant weight that does not ever ever go away. Not like this. Please  help.",02Dec2020,1

A lot of us are experiencing pandemic fatigue whether we notice it or not. Even though the days are shorter, somehow 2 hours feels like 8. Our issues are so widespread and we all may not know the answers to everything, but the most important part is that there is always someone willing to work through things with you. Whether it be a family member, a dear friend, a partner, or this wonderful online community. 

I know at times it's incredibly hard to believe to feel like you're understood. But I can't express enough that there is someone who will listen, whether it would be at 3am at night or in the middle the day. I've recently had to cut ties with someone I deeply care about because he wouldn't let me in. After a long hard battle of patience, I was still willing to work through anything with him. Unfortunately, he chose not to.

Guys, please open up. When you stay closed inside your own four walls, it can also hurt the people around you who *wants* to come in. Be vulnerable. Show your world, and there will be someone who will love you unconditionally.

If I believed, 100%, that my eye color was green, it would then change. I never really believed this, until my fucking mind knew it was convenient. I draw, and I recently drew something I was proud of, and I realized my progress.  I felt it was the one thing I could finally do half-decently. My mind is a piece of fucking shit. It's always there, ushering in a new invasive thought that lingers and never leaves until it's replaced. This time, it went and procured something along the lines of 'what if you got dumber? What if your mind was to deteriorate faster? What if you lost all that muscle memory you've spent months working on? It started small, but the thought wouldn't leave my head, and it only grew more prevalent with each time I inevitably fucked up something. I'd think it was evidence of me deteriorating, which would in turn make me believe it more.

The second one was the best and I saw clear improvement after two months, but my situation was ongoing and toxic and I could not get through without support. She left due to personal reasons after this period of time and suggested my third therapist. She was nice but could not provide the support I needed and was ineffective so I left. Eventually I sorted out my own problem, but I feel as though therapy did more damage than helped, and I don’t trust visiting another therapist.

The first therapist completely crushed my sense of self while I was already dealing with a difficult situation. I was left unable to trust my instincts (which were correct) when she claimed it was anxiety speaking, and not  reality. The second was very helpful but I felt like I was completely dependent on her. It was exactly what I needed at the time since I could not easily get through my responsibilities without reassurance, and I know I would have become a stronger person with my second therapist over time but after she left I felt like I was completely dependent on my therapist. The third therapist was not very supportive but also not toxic. She made me question my instincts again, and could not answer my constant questions. Even though it took a long time I was able to sort out my problem but my therapist felt more like an observer than a guide. As a result I still don’t trust myself fully even though I know I can make good decisions, mostly because she couldn’t answer my questions and the few pieces of advice she did provide did not really help me gain any insight. Actually after my third therapist I’m questioning more aspects of my life and feel more insecure about more elements of my life and less confident in general, even though my confidence in regards to my problem has increased. 

I’m not sure if therapy works for me, I never received a plan of what success looks like, I only have more questions about my life as a whole and feel less secure about my life than before the problems started. I feel like my life was worsened because of therapy in general. I definitely don’t want to attend therapy again because I believe it caused more problems than solved, and I only solved my problem with the help of others outside of therapy. If it weren’t for therapy, I think my problem would have been solved a lot sooner with less damage to my sense of self. I don’t believe therapy helped me actually solve my problem, so why didn’t therapy work for me?",02Dec2020,1

279,"Basically the title. I'm just in a really bad mental state and have been for a pretty long time, I don't eat or sleep and if this keeps up I might end up in a hospital, but I'm not suicidal (I've never even once been in my life tho I experienced some pretty bad things, I literally just can't assume the luxury of suicide). However I have 0 money and can't afford therapy, but I just need some asap counselling rn by an actual professional cuz my friends can't help me anymore at this point. So I was thinking suicide hotlines but I'm afraid I may be wasting their time and keeping the line occupied for a person that's actually suicidal. Anyone has experience with this? Should I give it a shot and call them?Ty for the help and sorry if I have any spelling errors",02Dec2020,1

281,"This is a lot to unpack here but sit tight. M20 here. Recently I told my girlfriend a bunch of things that were eating me up. Last year I went through a break up that was for the better but things stuck with me. My last ex was very emotionally abusive in the worst ways possible. She was 100% unfaithful and was draining but I chose to stay anyway because I was afraid I wouldn’t have anyone else. Luckily I managed to get the courage to break up with her but the negatives of the relationship stuck with me. With my current girlfriend, she’s the most incredible person and so wholesome, but I spilled a few things to her. In the beginning of our relationship, I would do this thing where in a depressive mood I would decide to m*sturb*te. But when I would, thoughts of my currently gf and her ex bf would cloud my thoughts and make me feel even WORSE than I already felt. She was in the same boat where she was in a relationship where her partner was emotionally abusive but she stayed away, which kills me anytime I think of her in that situation. But, I hated thinking of her being emotionally abused or her having s*x with him in my head because it would make me feel like shit imagining that, it would make me feel guilty for some reason. So I would start watching p*rn to silence the thoughts of my girlfriend and her ex. The reason I am here is because I need help trying to understand my brain so I can explain better to my girlfriend. She feels very hurt because both of our exes had a common thing where they were addicted to watching p*rn and comparing our s*x to what they were watching so she felt hurt when I said I watched. But I’m trying to explain to her this. When I would m*sturb*te, I would be in a depressive mood and a random intrusive thought of her and her ex would pop into my head. It would make me feel like complete trash so to mask the thoughts and quiet them, I would put on p*rn. It did nothing for me, I did finish but the videos itself did nothing for me. It was just a way to feel guilty for something else. Because once I was done I felt guilty for watching p*rn, which is what I was trying to go for because the plan was to silence those thoughts of her and her ex. Of course it wasn’t a good way to silence them, but I have never been good with emotions and intrusive thoughts. She feels hurt and betrayed but I have no idea how else to explain it to her. For some reason when I do those things I feel like I’m punishing myself. I’m pushing myself for thinking those things by watching p*rn even though I am trying to reassure to her that watching that meant nothing to me even though I would finish at the end. My mental health has always been horrid growing up, but recently I feel like I’ve just developed some bad habits to mask all the intrusive thoughts that go on in my head. I just want to get bette, for me and for her since she’s a huge help in why I’m still even alive. But I don’t even know why I do this myself. I don’t know why I punish myself by thinking that way, watching the videos, and then end up feeling incredibly guilty afterwards. How can I make her know that it’s just my mental state toying with me and that just having those videos on in the background is my way of masking my intrusive thoughts? + bad way, I may add. I hate that this is a bad habit of mine and I really wish to stop but I have no idea how...",02Dec2020,1
