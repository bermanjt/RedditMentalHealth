0,"My situation is so complex, there’s so many things making me feel low all the time. I feel so alone because my situation is so specific, and it’s taken me nearly a month of stalking this sub reddit to finally build up the courage to open up.

I’m a 15 year old male from the South of the U.K. just for the record.

It’s taken me a while to speak out about my problems for four reasons:

1. I feel like no body would understand or care
2. I feel too embarrassed as a boy to admit I’m having mental health problems
3. I feel like I’m being selfish because there are people who feel worse than me and that I shouldn’t be getting help that should be going to them
4. There’s so many reasons why I feel shit that I don’t even know where to start or how to say any of it


My first issue and one of my biggest is my sexuality.

I’m a straight masculine male, and that’s what confuses me so much, I’m so confused by my sexuality and it makes me so scared. Most of my friends are macho boys or laddy lads or whatever you want to call them. If any of them knew some of my thoughts they would all hate me because as a group we are all straight. 

Sometimes I just get a little turned on by boys, and although I don’t see myself having a future with a boy ever, it’s still confusing me, and I would love to know why I’m having these thoughts and what they mean.


Another issue of mine is that I feel lonely.

I feel like my friends are just my friends and that’s all, like I feel as though there is a lack in support and help, I’m not saying that I expect there to be because like I said they’re mostly boys and boys aren’t exactly the most caring, especially when there’s so much banter.

I also feel like I’m never gonna get or keep a girlfriend, I feel like I’m gonna feel lonely forever and it scares me.


Another issue is my future.

I’m scared for my future. I used to be quite smart but it’s kind of starting to slip and with the coronavirus I’ve missed 6 months of year 10 (which if you didn’t know is a year before my main exams in school), I really feel like I’m gonna fail in a lot of my subjects.

That brings me ok to the next thing about my future, is my job. If I fail what job will I get? I kind of want to go into the army but I’m not sure about that, I don’t want to be stuck in a 9-5 kind of job or an office job or working from home, I want something different. It scares me so much that my future is so uncertain, I don’t know what I’m gonna do especially if I fail. 


Another issue if self-esteem.

I feel like I’m not good enough. I’m terms of looks, personality...

I mean I’m not ugly at all and a lot of people do compliment me but sometimes I feel like people just say these things I would give myself a 7/10 but that’s on a day where my hair looks good for example, on average I feel really ugly and about a 4 or 5/10. 

My issue with my self-esteem is that nothing can be done about it and I’m stuck with this face and body for the rest of my life.

The last issue I’ll mention on here is me being scared.

I don’t want to tell my problems to any one else really, a few friends know, but they’re only people online who are my age, who I know won’t be able to tell anyone that I’m close to. I can’t tell my parents or any of my close friends because I feel like that would be so embarrassing. 

Depression also runs in my family a little meaning that the chance of me getting it is quite a bit higher.

I’m also pretty sure I have ADHD and/or ODD and I feel like this just makes my problems even worse.

Idek what to say anymore, to anyone. I’m scared. If you’ve read all of this then thank you so much, and I don’t expect anyone to respond or reply to this, it just feels good to get it out there.",12Aug2020,1
1,"So I'm 26 F, diagnosed ADHD, depression, anxiety, (greatly improved) social anxiety. I'm currently living in a city under a pretty brutal COVID-19 lockdown - majority of businesses/workplaces are shut, curfew, can't leave more than 5km from the house, can only exercise 1 hour a day. Along with this, I'm working stupid hours (from home). My workplace has had a lot of redundancies but the workload has only increased, so I'm generally working around 12 hours a day with no break. Because of curfew (and needing sleep), I'm rarely able to just get out for a walk. As a result, my mental health is suffering. On a 'positive' note, it feels highly circumstantial right now and I know it will improve as the situation improves. 

I've been with my boyfriend for a year and it's the first relationship I've ever had. I'm a highly independent person - all my family lives 8 hours away, I have always had very few friends, if any. I can be very aloof and I withdraw into myself when my mental health is shit. I live with housemates and see my boyfriend all weekend every weekend. My boyfriend is currently not working as his workplace has temporarily shut (he's still being paid for this period).

He is really unhappy and said I've been increasingly 'distant'. He is extremely lovely and always checking in on me and reaching out, but I've been conditioned to keep my problems to myself, and i'm not comfortable talking to anyone who isn't being paid for it. He is a lot more open with his emotions and feelings than I am and the imbalance is distressing him. I'm just so run down I can't really muster the energy to be affectionate right now, I just feel like I'm operating on autopilot. I find myself getting more irritable than anything.  I feel incredibly guilty about it. I've been as honest as I can about this but it doesn't seem to reassure him.

This is more of a vent than anything. If anyone has similar experience, I'd like to hear it?",12Aug2020,1
3,"I’m a senior in highschool, I have been diagnosed with clinical depression. During my freshman year I started feeling the symptoms and it hit me all at once. (My family has a history of severe mental illness) That year I tried to end my life 3 different times. The second time is the only one people know about since I was found and rushed to the hospital. Because of my age at the time I had no say in what impatient care I went to. They sent me to a facility that greatly negatively impacted me (I can go into more detail if I need too, I don’t want to used the word trauma because I don’t want to self diagnose). I was not treated for my illness and instead my parents pulled me out and took me to therapist appointments that a friend recommended. It took a good year to move on from what happened during that time. I am a senior now, I still struggle with mental illness though I’m not sure what kind anymore, since because of family issues I can’t see my therapist. I struggle with mood swings, isolation, anxious thoughts, and the feeling of leaving my body and seeing the world as not being real. I don’t know what that would be.
   The new covid regulations at my school are the exact same as the practices used in the mental hospital (minus the masks obviously). Today was the first day back to school and it brought backs all the feelings I had being in the facility. I was extremely anxious to the point where I was shaking and couldn’t breathe. By the end of the day my hands were bleeding from the amount of times I scratched at them and I had a pretty heavy break down in the parking lot. The memories kept flashing back in my mind and every time I would relive my feelings. It’s already stressful with the possibility of school being canceled again, college decisions, and I am pretty much a loner anyways. My support system graduated already and my family as a whole are not people I can go to. Please what do I do.. I don’t know what to do on my own, should I go to someone, who would that be? I couldn’t handle it today I don’t know how I will alone for the rest of the year.",12Aug2020,1
4,"I personally love that I’m seeing reminders to “check in with your friends” more often on social media at the moment, as I agree it’s an extremely important message and something everyone should be doing, regardless of whether you think there’s a reason to or not. However, I believe there are flaws in this approach that we are all ignoring.

Societal norms dictate that when asked questions such as ‘how are you?’, we respond in either a positive or neutral manner such as ‘I’m good’ or even simply, ‘I’m fine’. This is generally the case even when that answer is untrue, and oftentimes when such a response is given out of perceived obligation rather than in honesty, the implication to follow up is either not there or, unfortunately, missed. 

I believe we need to begin to rewrite some of the social guidelines we tend to follow, creating an understanding that being vulnerable is okay, and that answering the, sometimes dreaded, question “how are you doing?” honestly, is just as acceptable as any other response. 

Most often, when we’re not feeling good, having someone to simply listen is a huge step in beginning to feel better - a problem shared is a problem halved, after all. Even though you might not know the ‘right thing’ to say when a friend tells you they are not okay, they may find comfort in just being able to tell someone how they feel. This is one of the biggest obstacles we need to overcome in fighting the stigma against mental health struggles. 

When we all learn to expect honesty, and learn that not feeling fine all the time is okay, we will be making progress towards a new societal norm in which being truthful about how you feel is accepted and even welcomed. 

Reminders to “check in with your friends” are important, but even more important is ensuring your friends, and everyone else, feel comfortable enough to know that responding to a check in by saying ‘actually, no, I’m not feeling great today’, is a perfectly reasonable answer, and that by “checking in”, someone genuinely cares about the real answer.",12Aug2020,1
5,I dunno about u guys but I love animals more than humans humans are fake and mean rude and disgusting ppl while a dog is a loyal one..Hayst oh god where are u?Its been forever now since I belive in theres light in the tunnel but feels like forever now on the tunnel.,12Aug2020,1
7,"Hi all, posted a couple of days ago about a relationship of mine that didn’t work out. With the other person leading me on and moving onto another person. 

I think what I am going through now may be a sort of grieving? My emotions are flicking between unbearable loss, sadness, anger and regret. I have mental health issues which I believe stem partly from not feeling like I am good enough. And the other person being chosen over me has really triggered this. 

I think they were a good friend before, with hindsight I am not so sure now. Why you would hurt someone you ‘loved’ like I have been? 

I want to speak to them, I want to mend bridges and move past. But I don’t know what to say. I think potentially at this point I am hurting too much. 

I don’t want to lose them, but I think the damage is too much. I want them to reach out to me, to help and tell me everything is going to be ok and the future will be bright/ back to normal. I doubt this will happen when they are the cause of the pain and already off playing happy little families.",12Aug2020,1
8,"I’ve always felt not good enough. I look in the mirror and what I see is hideous. I had anorexia for many years in an attempt to make myself more “attractive”, but in the last few years gone from being underweight to overweight.

My last two girlfriends have really hurt me. And my most recent gf broke up with me because she realised she “wasn’t actually attracted to me” (which makes me feel pathetic to even type)

My biggest dream is to be a musician. I even got a record deal last year. However, my label is close to dropping me because I have been postponing any visual element (photos, videos etc). I look at other musicians (king princess, clairo etc) and they are so praised for their generically pretty looks and socially accepted body. It makes me feel like people will just laugh at me. I don’t want to be an “ugly” or”overweight” artist that people do the whole “iSnT iT grEat shEs ouT heRe dOing her thing despite being ugly” (you know the type of thing I’m talking about, think of how people talk about Lizzo). I want to make it clear I accept ALL forms of beauty and all sizes, just not for myself. When it comes to me I am obsessed with being “attractive” and feel like I’ll never be able to change that.

I’ve been trying to lose weight for the past year but with my ED pastor just ends up being me not eating for a week and then bingeing ultimately getting me nowhere. 

I feel so lost and depressed and tired of being insecure about my body. I’ve been in therapy for 8 years and tried so hard to love and accept myself as I am but, I just feel like I’ll never accept myself physically as I am and never be able to change it, so therefore never be able to be loved or Persue my dreams.

Sorry for the vent I’m just sad",12Aug2020,1

10,"My sister got diagnosed with anorexia in October, and after she recovered fully in April I have been really struggling with flashbacks. I have flashbacks all the time, mainly about really bad arguments we had in the few weeks before she started recovery. I feel really sh*tty for having flashbacks because I caused her anorexia to get bad by not telling anyone when I first suspected it. When I realised how serious it got I cut myself as self punishment for keeping it secret and dieting with her at the beginning of her eating disorder before I noticed she was actually starving herself. I’ve started having really bad, sometimes graphic nightmares about it. I keep having nightmares where she relapses and it’s absolutely terrifying. Last night I had a dream that she died from it, so now I’m too scared to sleep in case it’s a recurring dream. I told my sister that I keep having nightmares about when she was anorexic and now she thinks I’m really weird. I really want to tell my parents about it but idk what to say and I’m scared. I’m embarrassed that I have violent nightmares and I feel seriously messed up for having the nightmare I had last night. What can I do about it and how can I tell my parents?",12Aug2020,1
11,"I'm emotional while writing this so please bear with me. So tonight, my older brother (22) finally opened up to me about his mental health. I've always suspected he had problems but not to the extreme he's just told me. He said for the past two years he's been feeling emotionless and has no feelings for anything. Me or the rest of our family. He said his girlfriend does everything for him but he has no feelings towards her. For example she misses him when she goes home for the weekdays, but he said he doesn't feel anything for her. Although he acknowledges how much of a kind person she is and helps out. He said he has no feelings towards me or the rest of the family and doesn't mind not seeing any of us ever again. After going back and forth trying to open him up more, he told me he's had thought of ending his life, which made me cry and still doing so writing this. He said for over 2 years he's had the thoughts. He said he's messed up and has nothing to show for himself. I told him you're 22 and really young, people change career paths at 40 and start from scratch. I told him he needs to see his doctor and a psychologist, but told him he doesn't need the mind altering pills. He said he will never ever go to them. Because he's had a problem with his nose, which only lets him breathe out of one side, it's been like this a year. And he's tried going to the doctors and hospital twice, but they just put a bit of nasal spray and say it will get better, when it hasn't multiple times. So he told me he's lost faith in them. After this I also opened up about some of my struggles, which I've never told anyone before. I kept telling him it will get better, there's always light at the end of the tunnel. Weirdly, he said he only has feelings towards our pet dog. I thought psychopath and clinical depression came to mind. I don't know where to start. He's gone to bed now. And turned his phone off.",12Aug2020,1

A tall figure standing next to the road(it was a street lamp ), a bit later a white figure(a road sign)  or things that i can't explain like dog like figure, humanoid shapes ect.

13,"I dwell on mistakes and things I think I did wrong. I'll repeat them over and over in my head and make them seem like a huge deal, like I committed some huge moral crime when really all I did was say something stupid or do something a little insensitive like call someone a mean name in the heat of the moment. 


Sometimes I'll basically just make shit up about myself to hate myself for. Like im terrified as a guy (especially as an unattractive guy) that people will see me as creepy and be uncomfortable around me and now I've taken that fear and convinced myself that not only that its what people think but that its true and that I really am a creepy little weirdo. 


Worst of all I feel a horrible sense of imposter syndrome. People always tell me im so nice and friendly and sweet and just generally a good person and I feel like im misleading them. Like im secretly a monster. Even though I have done nothing wrong at all. 


I've made mistakes and im not perfect but I've done nothing to warrant hating myself like this. Even writing this im terrified people will read it and think ""well he must be hiding something, no one feels like that if they're innocent"" its horrible and I just want it to stop.",12Aug2020,1
14,"I am not sure if it’s just that I’m naturally more “introverted” or that I have social anxiety, but social interaction in general takes a huge toll on me. 

For example, after work I need to be left alone or else I start lashing out at my family and just get easily agitated. I essentially act like a grumpy/cold version of myself that is unable to think clearly. 

This is preventing me from being able to fully enjoy the company of others. Unless I get a lot of alone time previously, I am never fully there and feel stressed. Un

While I don’t get anxious or worried in every social situation, I constantly feel the need to be alone even with the people I am very close with (like my family). 

While I have come a long way in other respects regarding socializing, this is something that I have not been able to change. It’s not that I don’t like other people, but rather that I just always have a feeling that I want to be alone. 

Even with social distancing in place, I can’t seem to just get a break.

16,"Hello! So lately I’ve barely gotten any sleep and usually can’t fall asleep until at least 2am, even though I go to bed at 10pm. I’ve completely changed my night time routine and it’s still been rough to sleep. I’ve tried sleepy teas and wearing blue light glasses before bed if I’m gonna use my phone at all (which already has a blue light filter on it), but nothing has been working. 

The reason why I believe is because as soon as I go to bed and start to drift off, I keep playing music in my head. I don’t consciously do it, it just turns on as soon as I go to bed. I don’t physically hear it or anything, but it just keep playing for a while. It’s been keeping me up at night and idk why.

17,"Hey guys and girls. Im new to this sub reddit and maybe something in here might help. I have not been diagnosed with anything because my first theripy session is Saturday. Basically I just feel lost. A tldr is basically ive been dating the girl of my dreams for the past 4 years. I never treated her with respect and the way any woman you love should be treated.  About 2 years ago we had a hiccup where she started falling for another guy. But im giving her a 2nd chance because I love her. She stopped talking to other guys because of this. Now recently she started playing with some new friends on Xbox, and she tells me that they respect that she has a boyfriend and doesn't make any moves. But my jealousy and ptsd from the last incident spark up really bad anxiety and overthinking. I keep thinking now that there's someone else, but she promises me over and over there isn't.  I haven't gotten to see her that much lately ( maybe 10 hour total in the past 2 weeks) and it just causes me to over think. I feel like my mood swings are keeping her from seeing me because she already has her own list of things to deal with and can't deal with mine as well. Everyday is a fight. I love this girl. And I trust her with my whole heart. Bht my brain just makes me go crazy. Do you guys have any ideas on how to control this?",12Aug2020,1
18,"I'm new to this sub, and I'm sorry if I break any rules. Anyway, on to the post:

My brother has changed to the point of not even seeming alive. He's spent the last 13 years or so locked away in his room. (He'll come out to get food and stuff, but that's all.) He rarely talks if at all and never makes eye contact, always looking down.

He barely survived being born, he's blind in one eye since birth, and he and I were both beaten often by our dad. My brother is the step son though, and he got the worst of it. Towards my brother's teen years, he started getting IBS D. Any time the slightest amount of stress or fear hit him, it would flare up and he'd need a bathroom. Eventually after his high school graduation and failing at finding work, he started getting worse over time. All of his friends moved away to bigger cities like Seattle, and I was working. Our parents as well. A girl that he really liked since middle school also moved right before graduation.

He stopped talking, stopped going out, and gave up on everything and just played video games. I like gaming too, but I think it's literally all he lives for. He plays stuff like Mass Effect a lot for their social aspects and romance. He's gotten pale, is as skinny as a stick, has no strength or energy and sleeps randomly.

We are way too broke for any kind of therapy, and our parents don't seem to care about mental health anyway, like most of the US it seems. I always ask if he's ok, but he won't say what's wrong. He was always a shy introvert, but he never went this far.

The other day, I asked him if he ever wanted a girlfriend or his own place and I finally got him to talk. He said ""I wish, but It's all hopeless as long as I'm chained here. My life ended a long time ago. At least I have the girls in my games."" I asked him if he had any suicidal thoughts. He said he's too afraid to kill himself so he won't, but he doesn't want to live anymore either, so he's ""ready if something happens.""

How do I pull him out of this? I want to save him from whatever is wrong. What do you all think I should do?

Huge thanks in advance.",12Aug2020,1
19,"I was 14 I was walking through the school halls and a was poked in the ass with an umbrella... I turned around and it was a guy stunned to see it was a year 10 and he was a know gay guy... he was with a bunch of his friends so maybe it was to show off but I walked into the bathroom and cried... it’s been like 4 years and I still think about it... I was so embarrassed I didn’t tell my family and I felt so violated...

I’ve never felt this was assault, because he’s gay so it wasn’t a sexual motive...

But I knew it affected me, I just thought I was being dramatic

Now I’m staring to think it wasn’t ok and was actual sexual assault no matter what the sexuality...

20,"my entire life for as long as i can remember, i have struggled with so much. i've been through a lot in the past 7 years and it's really taken a toll on me. i'm currently seeing a therapist and im about to have an appointment in a few days with the second psychiatrist i've seen.
i have very bad anger issues(that i'm 99% sure have stemmed from insecurity and anxiety) and every day i have horrible panic attacks that sometimes throw me into fits of hysteria. i am not emotionally stable and i can't control it, i don't know how and the help i've gotten so far has not helped.
i had a wonderful girlfriend for almost 5 years and she was my rock, but she's recently left me. the breakup was completely out of nowhere, and she lied continuously.
ive been in this horribly long depressive episode for a few months now, and self harm has been my biggest issue. currently im a day clean, which is actually really good for me.
i miss her so much. it physically hurts my body how much i miss her. 
i just want to feel okay. i haven't been eating very much and i've either been sleeping too much or not sleeping at all. this morning i woke up having a damn panic attack and had to rush to the bathroom to throw up.

I know that's completely irrational but I can't help it. I'm terrified like 24/7 and can't turn it off. Every time I eat I feel immense guilt. I keep thinking I hear something and then realizing it was just something else. Am I going insane? I'm so tired of feeling like I can't breathe 90% of the time.

22,"I have been on Zoloft for my anxiety for a couple of years now. My apologies, but I cannot recall at this time how many milligrams I’m on. I guess you could say that it’s worked for me for the most part. But, for some reason, the one thing that I’d hoped it would help with the most, has not been helped. That thing is talking to girls. Now, I did have a girlfriend for a year and I had gone out of my way to DM her on Instagram and that’s how we eventually started dating. But, I don’t know it’s weird. At times I’ll get this sudden burst of...I don’t even know if *confidence* is the right word for it because I sure as hell don’t have any of that. But every now and then I’ll get the urge to talk to a girl despite my anxiety. But that happens very rarely. Anyway, my now ex-girlfriend and I broke up because of reasons that I won’t go into, and I was absolutely crushed. That was the lowest point of my life. I was in a very dark place. Fast forward and it’s now been over a year since she and I broke up, and I’m starting to feel *okay* again. But now, I’m beginning to feel lonely and a fear sometimes creeps up on me that makes me feel like I’m going to be alone for the rest of my life if I don’t act now. But, I just cannot do it.

There’s this girl at my workplace that is absolutely beautiful and she’s my age (I’m 19M and she’s 20F). I would absolutely love if I could talk to her and possibly even hang out sometime. She’s very nice. I’ve talked to her a few times despite myself. There’s no reason for me to be afraid to talk to her. But I just am. My heart begins to speed and I can feel my face turning beet red. 

Even so, as I sit here thinking, I can visualize this girl and I being together. But the thought of talking to her and asking *”Hey, you wanna hang out sometime?”* Makes me so god damn nervous, and it pisses me off to no end. It’s like something is holding me back. Like something doesn’t want me to talk to girls again and try to be happy. Not that I’m depressed or anything. I’m fine with my life. I’m actually better than ever. But I just wish that I could talk to a girl without feeling like I was going to have a fucking heart attack. 

It probably also doesn’t help that I have zero self-esteem. Trust me when I tell you, my friends, that this girl is absolutely stunning. So much so that I feel as though she’s *out of my league*. I know that sounds cliché to say but it’s true. I feel like she’s too hot for me. Like she could do so much better than me. I don’t know.

Most likely, nobody is going to read this far. But on the off chance that someone has, first of all thank you so much for taking the time. Second of all, can you give me any advice at all on what I should do? I have a psychiatrist that I should probably be asking about this but I thought I’d ask on here for fun before I try that. Do you think I should ask my psychiatrist to up my dosage?

Okay. I’m sorry, I won’t keep you any longer. Thank you again.

So I have my crazy little dog to keep me company, but I'm stuck living with the one person who hates me more than anyone else. I wish I could evict myself.

24,"I want to get a tattoo so badly and I have seen loads I like but none I have just fallen in love with. I’ve finished a year course of therapy targeting my childhood trauma and then targeting to my ocd. 

I have come such a fuc#ing long way and I’m finally happy. Of course I still have my bad days but I want something to remind me how bloody awesome I am, how strong I am - even when I don’t realise it. To show me I have been through so much shit and still smashing life, so that even through the bad days I’ll be fine!

Brief bit of background, I was sexually abused by my stepbrother when I was around 8/9 (he’s a year older)  who is still in my life which definitely hasn’t helped the situation I’m fighting through. My dad and stepmum are still married so I kept and still keeping this to myself. My fiancé knows of course as does an old school teacher because I had a breakdown during a levels and an ex boyfriend who was a piece of manipulative shit. As you can imagine, it was hard. So bloody hard to just carry on as if nothing had happened but ANYWAY. That’s over now, I was in such a bad place a year ago and just broke down. Maybe it was having a traumatic birth with my son that triggered my depression which then triggered everything else. I was having blackouts during anger outbursts and honestly I’m so grateful my fiancé stood by my side and helped me through it because I feel completely different now. 

It was super difficult to open up and explain every single little detail of what happened, where it happened, how it happened, how I felt, what I wish I had done and step by step descriptions. Especially for keeping it in all to myself all those years, until I went to therapy at the age of 20. But I’m so grateful for my therapist for changing my life completely and showing me how bloody worthy I really am despite everything I’ve been through. 

I want something to remind me I’m worth so much more than I realise, I’m so fucking strong - so much more than I give myself credit for other than every now and then but I just want a little something to just help me get through it when times get a little tough, to remind me “meh. This is nothing. I’ve got through a whole lot worse” kind of thing you know?

I’m getting married in two years, finishing uni next year and have the most amazing two year old little boy who adores his mummy, even when he’s wiping my tears away on my bad days!

26,"I have always been the person that my friends go to for emotional support. I have always been extremely emotional and empathetic, when other people cry I always cry as well. I can’t watch a movie where people cry and not cry myself. When people talk to me about their problems I get really sad as well. Somehow with everyone in my life I become the emotional dumping grounds. It can be so overwhelming when everyone in my life leans on me, yet I’m so unsteady myself. I can’t talk to them about my problems because I’m always helping them. I don’t want them to feel bad about themselves and I don’t want them to stop talking about their problems either. I want to support and help the people I love but it can just be so much. I feel alone in my head with everyone else’s emotions piling up on me. I just don’t know what to do. I can’t tell my loved ones to not tell me what’s bothering them. I can’t tell them what’s bothering me. It’s made me so constantly anxious. Even today I was talking to two of my friends over text at the same time and they were venting their problems to me.",12Aug2020,1

She says when she tries to do either of those she gets super anxious and worries something bad will happen to the people she cares about if she does or something.

29,"He’s an online friend I talk to on Reddit, we help each other with our problems. He’s from Finland I’m from Canada. He told me about a delusion he had where he thought he was dead a few weeks ago, I told him to tell his therapist but he didn’t get the chance yet. He’s been getting more and more paranoid. Today he said he felt like someone was watching or following him. Then he was in bed in the dark and said he couldn’t turn the lights on because the man who’s been following him was gonna hurt him. He thought the man was in the room with him. He started questioning who I was, who he was or where he was. I got him to go to bed.

What do I do? How do I help? I’m not a doctor and haven’t ever dealt with smtn like this. He has a driving license test tmrw and has to drive for the first time, I told him to cancel. I told him to tell his therapist about the man watching him tmrw cuz his appt is also tmrw. I didn’t go against his delusions cuz I heard you’re not supposed to do that? I just told him he’s gonna be ok and he’s safe cuz that’s also what ur supposed to do? Idk please help. I also asked for a friends snap or his parents number or smtn in case he starts talking about doing smtn dangerous. I’m also scared cuz what if he starts to not trust me and ignores me and I can’t help. He’s gonna wake up soon and idk what to say please help I’m worried for him",12Aug2020,1
30,"I feel like I have a short ""person attention span"". I love being on dating apps and having people compliment me (who doesn't like compliments), but I can't seem to carry on a conversation afterward-- really everything just feels too superficial and like I'm talking to them out of guilt because I feel like I have to. I don't understand why I can't seem to keep an interest in people. I'm also asexual, so there's no real desire to have sex with them I'm solely looking for a relationship. It's almost like I'm looking for a spark and I'm just not finding it at all and I'm too caught up in the concept of getting attention. Not to mention I feel like I would just be a burden on them. 

I am constantly afraid of the idea of being abusive or toxic in a relationship because I really struggle with self-control and emotional regulation and I do have lots of problems with bad behavior. I get bursts of just ridiculous anger and I have long periods of irritability. A lot of my closest relationships have admitted to having to ""walk on eggshells"" around me, and I don't want that-- that's like the opposite of what I want. I've gotten a LOT better at that, but who is to say I won't just wake up a year from now and it will be back? On top of that, if I AM toxic or abusive there's, like, no coming back from that. And I know if that happens and my partner leaves me I'm just going to feel so absolutely crushed and utterly abandoned that it depresses me currently and I'm single and it hasn't even happened yet so I'm already creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. I don't want to date someone only to ruin their life with my presence.  

I also have some wicked trust issues that I need to work on and an absolutely awful self-image. All of these things that I think and feel and struggle with I've heard are bad to have in a relationship whether it's romance or just a friendship. It makes me feel almost wrong for wanting to have a relationship because I'm doing all the bad things already. I also don't want to be too clingy or needy, but I can't make any kind of promise that I won't be because, try as I might, I can be an emotional vampire. It feels selfish of me to try and seek out a relationship, and I am probably not supposed to. 

Another thing is that I also just don't fit in very well. I think this is just a general thing people with mental illness understand and relate with. I'm just not super desirable, it's hard to be when you're depressed and also annoying and obnoxious. 

Although, I am very lonely. I just want to watch horror movies, but I get scared and have bad dreams and I just want someone to sit with while I watch them and tell me that it's just a movie when I cry.  And we could also cook dinner together and go on walks and do a bunch of other couple things.   


**tl;dr** I'm really struggling relationship-wise because I can't seem to maintain interest in anybody, I'm afraid that my emotional problems will become abusive or take a toll on my partner, even disregarding the emotional problems I have a lot of self-esteem issues that are like personal red-flags, and I struggle to relate and fit in with other people.

31,"I invited my on-again-off-again over to my house to talk about what was on my mind and where things were going. We ended up getting into a fight in her parked car and we were screaming at each other, crying, etc. I ended up slapping her in the middle of us yelling and immediately felt my stomach twist into knots. I wanted to vomit. I still do, but nothing will come out. I left the neighborhood and started walking, bawling my eyes out. Didn't have a destination. She found me on the road and told me to get in, then took me home. She left and I lied in bed. I turned into my biological father and that was my biggest fear in life. I physically hit the only woman I've ever thought about my future with. There is no way to undo it, make it better, or move past this. She texted me saying that she thinks she hit me in the confusion but I don't know if she did, I don't know if my adrenaline was too high to notice. She also texted me that she thinks she's done. I wanted to fix things and work on starting a life together and only made it worse by becoming my father. I want to cut off my hand.

32,"Hello, my name is Jake, I'm almost 16 and from Britain. I always try venting but I end up feeling like I didn't get everything out and that I can't express how I feel, then I'm in this constant cycle of frustration and stress. This could be the same, but it's worth a go.

&amp;#x200B;

(I'm going to clarify the British school system so it isn't confusing. Primary school is Year 1 - Year 6, also known as grades in other countries. Secondary school is Year 7 - 11, and then college/uni, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know where my mental health decline started, I don't. I couldn't tell you. But as a 15, almost 16 y/o, it's safe to say I've been through a lot to question life at such a young age. I don't know how categorized this will be, but I'm going to be listing all of the reasons why I do have suicidal thoughts regularly.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a disability known as a congenital amputee, where you're born without a limb or parts of a limb. I do not have a left hand, I have half a left arm. To put in perspective what it looks like, my left arm ends at where my elbow would be, and although I have the elbow bone there, it's underdeveloped. I was born with this disability because my arm was stuck somewhere in my mother's womb and therefore it simply never grew. Unfortunately, doctors said I was supposed to be left-handed so I had to teach myself to be right-handed, which has been hard.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate my arm with a passion. I hate it. In primary school, I wouldn't get many negative comments, mainly just fellow kids asking about it since they hadn't seen someone like me before. But in secondary school, I realized just how much I despised my arm. Without knowing it, even before secondary school, I would be slyly ostracised and lied by classmates, to a point where I talked to plenty of friends in Year 8, but now I only talk to my girlfriend and our mutual best friend. No one else. I fucking hate my disability so much. No one likes the disabled kid, no one likes Jake The Cripple, and that's truly how I feel about my arm. I would have rather be been deaf or mute than my arm, and it's hilarious that my disability is one of the rarest ones you can have. I hate it so much to a point where I've tried multiple times to self-harm to it and I have, I've managed to self-harm on both arms (I would explain how, but there's no need). When my mum found out about my arm in one of the scans, the doctor had to ask if she wanted to go through with the pregnancy. I've dealt with such indirect and direct ableism in my life and frankly, I'm past the final straw when it comes to it.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been through some things that add up to my mental health issues. I have severe anxiety and depression (which could be genetic), PTSD, I could have bipolar disorder, and although it hasn't been the clearest since I don't do anything at all nowadays, I could have a disorder regarding attention. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I've mentioned I've been bullied, but being bullied online for some reason hurts far more than most realize. It hurts being powerless as several people are taking turns bashing you and laughing at you, not knowing what their actions could cause. Because of all my time online and with groups of friends who ended up ganging up on me and making me feel like shit, I developed anxiety at a very young age (or it could've been genetics as I mentioned).

&amp;#x200B;

My depression is a culmination of numerous things. The death of my great grandfather, witnessing my pets dying because of dogs attacking them (one was a 10-year-old cat, and then 6 months later we had a kitten for a month who got bitten by our neighbor's husky), my disability/ableism, feeling such crippling loneliness, how useless I feel as I watch my mum's mental health cripple with each time I witness her crying or see an extra mark on her wrist, my sexual assault during Year 7. So fucking much.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to make a separate paragraph regarding that last one. I was sexually assaulted when I was in Year 7. I don't know when it happened, could've been in the middle of the year or nearing Year 8. Hell, I don't even know if I was on my way to school or on my way home because of how much my mind has tried blanking it out. But being a male victim is a bigger struggle than I realized it would be. I would feel ashamed trying to speak in a circle of other victims and I was the only male. I'm supposed to be strong after all and it was probably my fault. That's what I've told myself anyway. I mean some ex-friend online once told me to 'Jump off a bridge' and 'Go get raped again', so I guess sometimes I believe her haunting words. Some days I feel like I'm back there when it happened. It is a struggle and I wish I could tell my mum but I just can't. I once asked how she'd react if I had told her something like that happened, and the face she made when she thought something happened made my heart drop. She was so shocked and she made me promise nothing happened, I had to look her in the eyes too. I can't possibly be honest with her about it, not yet anyway. I don't want my mother worrying about anything else because of how bad her mental health is anyway along with having to take care of 3 babies. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's such a fucking struggle. I'm only 15 and I feel like there's no hope or light ahead of me. My whole life it's just been a gloomy and dark trail. I'm not exactly a smart kid, I'm not going to do well in my last year of secondary school where I need to think about college, so it's not like there's any fortune there. My mother is the most mentally unhealthy stage you can get to and she's in her early 40's and she's just recently in the last 10 years been like this. I'm 15 and I feel like I'm as bad as my mum mentally.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any reason going on? The voices won't stop, the pain and suffering won't. I don't want to die, I'm scared of death. I don't think anyone truly wants to die. But the pain won't stop, the voices won't quieten, nothing is stopping. I don't want to die, I just want the pain to stop. Maybe it's just one of my bad moods swings again. I want to be a good big brother for my three baby siblings to look up to, I want to be the best son and the best boyfriend, the best father possible. But I feel like the only way to stop my demons is by taking it out with me. Tomorrow I will be thinking differently because of my moods, but eventually, I'll just be in a vicious cycle where I think this way and I don't, then I do and repeat. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I probably can't be helped, but I heard venting can help release some stress, which I feel like it has. No one has to respond to this, this was like a personal therapy session with myself. But if anyone does respond, thank you. It's 2 AM so I might sleep, might not because I hate sleep. Goodnight anyway.

33,"I'm going through some shit but whenever I tell my mom about it she doesn't really care. I've basically begged her to let me get help and I don't know what to do know.

 I haven't been tested/diagnosed so I'll explain what I experience.

   I'm pretty sure I have anxiety. I used to have panic attacks weekly before quarantine but during quarantine it calmed down a bit. On my bad days though I cry a lot and feel like I'm suffocating and I have to leave the house. Then the next day I'm be completely fine. 
   I don't go outside because I don't want people to look at me. I can't breath properly when I'm in public and my throat closes. Sometimes when I'm hanging out with friends and having a good time I'll suddenly feel an insane amount of dread and I have to go home, like if I'm there any longer I'll die. 
   At school I shake my legs and tap on things and look around a lot and talking in class is the worst. When I do presentations or answer a question I feel like I'm gonna cry.

 This is very new but I've been disassociating every day, or that's what it seems like. My vision goes blurry and I stop thinking and I drop whatever I was holding and kinda slump down. My eyes will get wide and race around and I'll blink a lot or roll my eyes into the back of my head. It feels like I'm not in my body. I can't complete my thoughts. I space out for a long time. Sometimes I'll lose feeling in my body starting in my legs and I fall over. Usually I can catch myself but earlier I fell off my bed and laid there for a while. 

Along with that ive been having crazy mood swings. Today was the worst. I was in a depressive episode for a lot of the day but then suddenly I was full of energy. Like, a bit too much. I was thrashing around and jumping up and down and screaming and throwing myself into my bed and punching things. That lasted a few minutes. Then I was happy for a little bit and then really sad again. I started spacing out again so I was sitting on my bed for a bit and my body got really hot and felt static-y and I started to rock back and forth and I could tell I was having a panic attack. I started crying and rocking more aggressively and pulling at my hair. That was about 20 mins ago.

My mom is a naturopath and doesn't take me to the regular doctor. I don't go unless I need stitches. I begged her to get me help for my anxiety but she refused to take me to the doctor. Her naturopathy clinic gave me some ""remedies"" for my anxiety that I took for a couple weeks but nothing changed. I told her this but she doesn't care. I don't take anything now. I told her about the recent episodes I've been having and she even witnessed one but once again wont get me help. Earlier when she saw me spacing out before my panic attack she just closed my door and walked away.

Once I'm calm I'm going to tell her that if she wont get me help I'm going to do it myself. I seriously can't take it anymore.",12Aug2020,1

35,"I want to say before hand that though I do have some mental trauma,depression,anxiety,etc. I am in fact aware that he is imaginary;

A couple days back my sister and I were talking, and the subject of relation ships came up. One way or another, we talked about being in relation ships. I stated I've never been in a relation ship before. (I'm 16, vary young for a relation ship) She had responded with the fact that I never give anyone a chance etc. I have been advanced upon in the past, but I was either creeped out, scared, or thought the person asking me out was joking. (Due to self hate issues) :( 

I've gotten vary lonely, and as a child I made an imaginary friend, (probably at 9 or 10 y/o) and he eventually became kinda like my significant other... (I know its stupid please hear me out) Like I've said before, I've had a lot of mental issues, and I feel like that's the main reason I made this character. I often talk about my feelings and issues to them, I think of them as a coping mechanism, but it feels wrong to do it. 

I feel like I will be judged if any of my family and friends found out about this. I feel ashamed. But at the same time I kinda depend upon this character. I have a therapist and some supportive people in my life, but I still feel like its a burden to others to be myself in front of them. 

So should I get rid of them? Do I need help? Is it okay to have this here? I know one day I will have to move on from it but it pains me to think about it. What the hell should i do?

38,"Marking NSFW because of self-harm and suicidal thoughts. 

For starters, this time of the year fucking sucks. I never know what my fall semester is going to look like so I obsessively check to see if a professor has posted a syllabus. My mom is a teacher and goes back to work around this time of year, leaving me to stay home with my siblings who are 10+ years younger than me. I love them to bits, but they’re so much to handle as they both have high-functioning autism. 

It started around this time last year, August 2019. I began to come to terms with having depression. Of course, I began losing it around this time of the year. I was self harming more often. Until one day I got into a fight with my sister when my mom wasn’t home and she told me to kill myself.  That was the match thrown on the gasoline. I ended up being admitted to a mental hospital, and it was the worst week and a half of my life. I was forced to be around strangers all the time and had no escape, not even to see my own family. In all honesty, it felt like they just wrote me off as an anxious and depressed perfectionist college student and that the root of my mental problems weren’t really looked at, which possibly would have warranted a different diagnosis. It was so overwhelming that I almost felt like I just said I was doing better so I could go home. 

I still get upset thinking about my time at the hospital. But things got better, that is, until Christmas. My boyfriend told me he had to move out of our college town and back home with his family. My parents promised they would help me get a car to visit him and get my way around town, since he was always my ride. 

First they said before I go back to school. Then valentine’s day. Then spring break. COVID hit so I moved back home. Then it was the summer. Then it was the beginning of the fall. They kept finding a reason to put it off. 

Now that it’s August again, I’m home with the kids all day...again. Yesterday my sister and I got into a huge fight, and she told me to kill myself. Saying that just set off a cascade of memories from the hospital-the stench of cigarettes, the loneliness, the boredom, the ever-so familiar feeling of being an outsider-that I broke down. The rest of the day was better, thankfully, and she realized she screwed up and apologized. 

Today. My dad asked when I had to pay my tuition by. I told him the 14th,, 3 days from now. He casually said “okay, just pay from your bank account”. Which means all the money I had been saving to buy a car for so many months will be gone. 

“But you can use your refund” No I can’t. It won’t be that much. 

“You don’t need a car right now anyway” But you promised. And you’ve been promising. Now that my boyfriend (aka my only friend) is moving away again, that’s how I would get to see him. 

“You knew we were waiting to help you get a car until you get a refund” But I didn’t know you were going to make me spend all my money on school!

I can’t even get a job because my parents are making me stay home for the semester to babysit while they work. 

I’ve been crying just about all night. My mom eventually came up and yelled at me about how she has it worse at work, as she always does. I can never be upset around her without her saying she has it worse, which is why I repressed my feelings for so long. I just don’t fucking matter to them. 

When they left, I cried even harder and got so angry I found myself scratching at my wrists again and smacking my head. Now I have a visible scratch on my wrist, just like I did when I was admitted. I’ve been abstaining from self harming by reminding myself I don’t want to go back to the hospital, but tonight I fucking lost it. And I remembered what my sister told me yesterday. For the first time in a year, I thought about just downing all my antidepressants before I go to sleep in hopes that I won’t wake up. 

I’ve cried to the point where I’m just exhausted. My parents won’t listen to anything I say. They’re so angry at me. It’s all my fault that I didn’t just say “ok.” I can’t tell them any of this because it’ll be worse for them and they’ll send me back to the hospital. 

I want to make it clear I’m not going to follow through with ending it tonight. My boyfriend asked if I want to go out with him in the morning (my dad will be home to watch the kids) so I have something to look forward to. At this point I’m just exhausted and wanted to vent. 

TLDR: A year after being hospitalized, I feel like I lost it tonight after a fight with my parents. I’m ok for now, but I don’t know how these next few days will be",12Aug2020,1

You know when you get into a tricky situation and you can feel that you’re scared? I don’t FEEL it, my brain just goes (for example) “you could get arrested, leave” while most people can feel that sh*t in their heart, like they can feel the adrenaline and fear. Or in a haunted house, or a rollercoaster. I literally don’t feel it.

Or when you are around someone you like, or you hug them or touch their hand and you get that little tingly feeling everywhere. I still fall for people, but really not even that much anymore.

47,"Hello! I'm Jason (17 Male) this might take a while. Recently I have been losing my appetite and it seems I'm sleeping way more than my usual. Here is what happened yesterday. I woke up at 6:50 and went downstairs to start my day by finishing my 30 minutes of SAT practice that my parents require. I finished it and started playing video games (League of Legends) in the middle of my ranked match. My stepfather came and started to tell me to stop playing it. I asked him why and he said because it was the morning but I don't remember him telling me I wasn't allowed to play in the morning. (We make these kinds of weird deals where I do a favor and he gives me some freedom) I said no and explained that I could not pause it and offered that if I finished the game I would not play for the rest of the day. He said I needed to obey him right now but I kept playing. He then said if I continued to he would turn off the internet and stop me from playing badminton. Badminton is my favorite sport and I spent 6+ hours on it when quarantine wasn't a thing. Anyways I kept playing and ignored him and he just got extremely angry and threatened to starve me to death. He can't beat me or at least not anymore anyways as I have outgrown him physically. He then told my mother to get me to stop but I just ignored them and finished the match. My mother was confused since she was okay with me playing only that game and none for the rest of the day. Later on, I found her sad and sitting alone on the couch. Apparently she had argued with him and he left the home. He threatened her saying he would cancel my eye doctor appointment tomorrow(which was supposed to happen today) and that he would stop paying for anything including college and other things. She wanted to divorce him but since she no longer has a job we would have nowhere to live and no money to pass by. This all happened in a single day.

Anyways that summed up what happened yesterday. Since yesterday I have caught myself repeatedly talking to myself and constantly thinking about killing him. It feels like I'm being corrupted or that I can only think about murdering him. Although I know I am in the wrong playing like 6+ hours of video games during quarantine with my friends I finally felt like I had some sort of freedom or joy with my friends. I don't know what's happening but I can feel that I am losing myself. It seems as if there is a devil or something that is constantly telling me to follow through with how I feel about murdering my stepfather. It's to the point where I just stare at knives for like an hour every night thinking about what to do. I keep punching my walls to feel something or anything to keep myself sane. The thing running through my mind at this moment is that I should kill him, call the police and just turn myself in to help everyone. It seems like my only escape but it will ruin my future and probably my mother's mental health.

I don't exactly remember how many years but it seems to be around 5 years since he's been around. I knew him for 7 but he seemed so nice until the marriage. Right after that everything changed. He seemed to be in control of everything and every time I wanted to enjoy myself with some gaming he manipulated my mother and blames her for creating such a failure. To me, he has completely ruined/killed off my future but I know it is myself that ruined my own future. Because of him I deliberately went out of my way to do worse in school to anger him. I wanted to make him so mad he would leave or something I wanted him to suffer or something I'm not sure. I remember some of the things he's done in the past 5 years.

I remember being late for school and having that bad breath feeling so I went into the bathroom to brush my teeth and maybe eat something but in the middle of brushing my teeth he pulled me hard and the water splashed onto him. This made him furious and he started yelling about how I could throw water on him like that and what was wrong with me even though my mother saw he himself caused it. It continued to drag me by the shirt and throw me down the stairs and told me to hurry up and kept shoving me down the stairs to our shoes. Another time was when we had guests over at the house and I don't remember exactly what but I angered him somehow. Probably an argument between us and I proved him wrong which embarrassed him in front of our guests. He then told me he owned the house and that he would force me to live outside if I disobeyed him even if he was wrong. He made me kneel at our first-floor entrance. I kneeled for 2 hours on cold marble at night and the guests were leaving and stared at me saying they were sorry for me and to stay strong which made me cry until the end. Another time was when he found out I was fake doing my IXL (some learning program) which he expected me to do like 2 hours every day. If I missed a single one that would be stacked onto the next day and what happened was I couldn't keep up so I started faking that I finished them by using the inspect element. He then said he was gonna starve me and some other punishments which I don't remember. That was the time I went to the counselor of my school Fremont High. She was so kind and caring and I explained everything to her. That was the point where I found out that some people that weren't me also played more than 6 hours of video games a day which I thought was just only me at that point. I still know it is wrong but I thought maybe I wasn't that different. She called in my parents and we made some agreements about how we should treat each other and other stuff like that. And that was the moment I realized how fake of a human he is. He said everything I said about him was false and I acted so nice and sweet to the counselor and he even said I was imagining things. He told my mother in Chinese what was happening because he offered to be the translator and I could understand that he was just telling her to agree with him. She agreed because she didn't understand what the counselor was saying since she only spoke in English. I didn't say anything because at that time I thought she actually understood. But once we got home the niceness was gone and he was back to his old self. Of just demanding I do this or blank would happen and stuff like that. I would say that I only played 1 hour of video games when in reality I played much much more just to hide and save myself from some trouble. I learned to lie and listen for the creaking on the floor and to manipulate my own mother to side with me which sometimes didn't work out.

Now that I'm writing this I see how much he really changed me. I used to cry at night almost every day because of him and the feeling of how little freedom I had. It got to the point where gradually it seemed like I lost my emotions. I now only feel them when it is really intense. I didn't even feel anything when my beloved grandfather passed away. Not a single tear. He has robbed me; he makes me feel like I'm not human. Over and over for the past 5 years, I just want to kill him just to escape just to get out of this mental barrage this mental torture that's been happening it's too the point where I just want to run away. I know I would never kill myself my mind is strong but it can only handle so much.

I remember 2 years ago. One night it seriously went bad and I just grabbed my computer and my setup and just locked myself in my room to play with my friends. He started banging on my door and yelling at me. That was the first time I actually felt fear for my life from him. It went silent and I started to worry. My friends could hear what was happening and shut up real fast to listen. I said to call the cops if I don't respond in 2 hours. Suddenly the doorknob shook violently and I jumped in my seat and realized he was unlocking or breaking the lock. He busted in and we just looked at each other. He took the wifi adapter of my computer and said this is mine (even though I paid for it with my own money from work) and at this time I already was starting to form my murderous intent. I ran after him down the stairs with a metal pipe and threatened that if he didn't give it back I would kill him right there. He threw it and ran downstairs and called the police. I just went back into my room and waited for them to come. That night I was cuffed and sent to Uplift for some time. There I realized how little of my emotions I had left. I signed their paperwork and it felt so good. for the first time I felt free. I felt as if I was able to do anything. Even though I was locked in their facility I felt happy I felt that I was finally free from him. I met other people who apparently were there for serious suicidal reasons and I was able to chat up with them and made them laugh. I really felt happy after so many years. Then it struck me. My mother. The only person I would do anything for. I felt that I had betrayed her or broken her heart. The night I was cuffed she was yelling at the police to please not hurt me and to send me back safely. She yelled at my stepfather and I could see just how afraid he started to get. My mother almost got violent until the police interrupted and questioned them separately. Soon I learned that my stepfather tried to talk FOR HER and was saying stuff that was putting the blame on her and me and my mother spoke out but she had poor English so they barely understood anything. after I returned nothing much was different I just felt renewed. but entering the home and after a couple of hours, It felt like I returned to hell once more. I just want to escape with my mother and know that she is safe and capable of taking care of herself. She has some medical issues and no job to pay them off. The only money we have comes from my stepfather and in my eyes, it makes him so powerful. Able to hold us at our necks by his threats and able to destroy my entire future if he wished.

I should end this here before I drive myself insane. I'm sorry I wrote this much but honestly, this is just a little taste of what I've been put through like what 5 examples out of the 5 years I have been with him. almost every month something insane happens and it's absolutely crazy. I don't know what to do I feel trapped I can't escape him it feels as if I can only kill him or myself but I would never kill myself never. I've worked to pay for my FTX membership (some Muay Thai training) so I could release some pain and frustration. I feel as if I'm addicted to the pain like some crazy masochist. I love the heavy blows from my coach and it seems as if I would scare him in our sparring matches as he just couldn't keep me down. I honestly feel like an animal, something not even human. I don't feel my emotions much anymore and the pain I get physically I just want more of. but since then I lost my job and can't afford the memberships anymore and quarantine struck and I have just been forced to stay in hell. Please if anyone has some form of help like any mental doctors or some kinda virtual therapist I really think I need it. Maybe for him as well but my stepfather is just too stubborn he didn't listen to the police or my counselor so I have no hope in him.

\- I love you all

49,"I was wondering if anyone else experienced this. I don’t understand why this happens but I want to know if anyone can explain or has also gone through this. It might have to do with my depression, I’m not sure. Every once in a while, almost always at night, I get delusional. I start thinking extremely highly of myself (which is strange because normally I have no self confidence). I think I’m beautiful, smart, talented, and that everyone who has ever met me was lucky to be in my presence. I become obsessive with certain things or thoughts and start to spiral. I think things I would never normally think and want to do things I never normally do. I wanted to visit a church in the middle of the night and pray (I’m an atheist). I wanted to shoplift (I’ve never stolen anything). I wanted to go out and walk around for no reason. I also started thinking obsessively of my partner. I missed them a lot and just wanted to see them. Then I thought that I would do anything they told me to, like jump in front of a moving train. I was weirdly obsessive, normally I’m not like that at all. It didn’t feel good to be this self confident and impulsive. It felt really bad and empty, actually. Can anyone tell me what this is and why it happened? I would appreciate it so much!!",12Aug2020,1

My body felt super weak. Then the scariest part, my speech was impaired and I was slurring/my speech was pressured. I called my dad and talked to him to keep myself alert and to make someone aware of my situation. I’m at my SO’s house, I have taken Passion Flower to calm myself and have rested a while. I took the medication about an hour before all of this happened. Has anyone ever had an experience like this? And does anyone know if it’s okay to stop taking it since it’s only been a week?

Long version: Ive been recovering from really bad depression and anxiety this year and was just getting back on track when my cat died and 2 days later my wife dropped the bad news that shes not happy in our marriage. My psych has told me to focus on self care for the moment and said it may be worth splurging on something. I dont really splurge though, i like doing activities over buying stuff. Even with that Im usually pretty chill with my activites, i just like hanging out with friends, watching stuff together, playing games. I love travelling and that would have been my go to but you know, covid. I do like to do a spa day but that was a splurge thing my wife and i would do together and I dont want to do it alone just yet. My psych suggested something like a drone thats engaging and has learning involved. I dont really have a lot of interest in drones but the engaging/learning part sounds really good.

56,"I (16F) became best friends with J a little over a year ago. We met online, and eventually got to the point where we texted every day (and still do). We videochat occasionally (yes, she is a real person, no she is not some 40 y/o pervert) and mail stuff sometimes. 

I have depression, and so does J. That was one way we bonded. But, unlike her, I have access to support. When we first became friends, she was taking a year off school for mental health. The original goal was to get a job, but she didn't end up doing that because she was depressed. I'm getting increasingly worried about her, as she doesn't have insurance, and now has to start school and her apprenticeship. 

(some background on her situation): J lives a little outside of Berlin. Her mom is unable to work due to health, and all of her family's income comes from her step-father, who is an alcoholic. She's always scared of him. She doesn't have a great relationship with her mom, either. She has two older siblings, both of whom are adults, but doesn't talk with them much. She was previously on her bio dad's insurance but isn't anymore and doesn't want to reach out. 

She's taking driving lessons and is on her way to getting her liscene, which is really the only thing holding her together right now (aside from her favorite show). But, I'm worried. She has been texting less. She cried herself to sleep last night. And she just... Doesn't care about getting better. I mean, she wants to... But I think she's giving up. 

How can I help her? I'm going to be supportive, whether she gets help or not, because she's my best friend. But I want her to get help, because she deserves it. She's smart and funny, and she wants to take acting classes. 

I've been encouraging her to talk to her school and see if they can get her any information on free counseling. I think medication would also be really helpful, which would mean a psychiatrist. In Germany there's a waitlist, though. She was on it, and then when she went in for the consultation, she couldn't do anything more than that because she doesn't have insurance. 

Please, any help would be appreciated.  I don't know enough about the German healthcare system to be able to do anything. And, I can't force her to do anything. But I want her to have the resources to get help.",12Aug2020,1

I have fought since early childhood. I'm tired. I have been betrayed and manipulated by almost every person I've ever known. I've been molested, raped, beaten, and have had several men try to kill me. I've even tried to myself a few times. The sheer amount of physical and emotional pain I bear on a daily basis is horrific. People see me as a target, and they are right because I've always seen the best in people. Even the ones who were nothing but monsters. Why ask someone like me to continue on? Why ask me to battle every single day so that you don't have to miss me when I'm gone? Why do we ask that of anyone who has spent so many years living just to not hurt others? Why can't human beings just actually care about one another? Why ask someone to enjoy a few moments between the neverending hell that is their lives? I don't want pity, I don't want words of comfort.

59,"This is a bit of a long story and I really am going to try my best to summarize. 

TW; self harm

When I was a kid, I was a pretty crazy kid. I was very hyper to the point my mom had to have me on a leash when we went to public places. I was bad with focusing and retaining information was super hard. My mom took me to a doctor thinking maybe I had something wrong and the doctors said I had severe ADHD/ADD. Back then, the media about medication was a bit of a frenzy and my mom decided not to medicate me and taught me plenty of ways to keep myself grounded. If I’m too jittery in class, hold myself. If I can’t focus, imagine crazy things around the teacher. She got me lots and lots of books, a better diet, exercise, and really the best she could do. Over time the hyperactivity subsided.

Once I went into high school my biggest issue was focus and motivation. We went through a lot of family and personal changes and as ADHD/ADD can cause, I became anxious and that anxiety caused depression. It was pretty bad and without going into much detail of the usual distancing and lack of motivation, the most concerning was that I’d get panic attacks, sort of black out and come back to reality with cuts on my body. 

It took me three and a half years to finally say something about my self harm and everything that had been going through my head and I saw a psychiatrist. We got blood work done and a genetics test and the results for the latter showed I had a deficiency in... something. My psychiatrist scheduled me a therapy session and another visit with him to talk about options as my anxiety and self harm was a big issue. He did give a small supply of pills to take in case of emergency if I was having a panic attack and couldn’t calm down. 

Unfortunately, covid hit and all my appointments got cancelled because I’m high risk (asthmatic.) I didn’t feel comfortable doing things through ZOOM but I think I need to. See, lately, I’ll overthink things more than usual and trigger myself to have a panic attack during my break at work or at home by myself. There’s not a week that goes by that I don’t have a panic attack. Aside from that, I’ve been having weird tics. I use to think I got chills randomly but from my research, severe ADHD/ADD can cause tics. Now these “chills” have gotten worse. Aside from that, when that time of the month comes, mentally I get really bad. I use to just cry or get emotional on the first night but now, I get suicidal thoughts on the entirety of it. What’s worse, everywhere I go alone I feel like there’s someone looking for me—An old friend hating me for leaving, an ex still trying to contact me, a stranger who will cause a misunderstanding—pretty much some sort of persecution even though I know it won’t happen, I feel like there’s a chance someone’s coming after me. 

The only thing that isn’t happening is the self harm due to a promise I made to not only myself but both my boyfriend and mom. (10 months clean!)

I thought maybe the stress of going to college, finances, my relationship, and moving were causing it but now a lot of things are resolved and I’m still mentally freaking out for no reason. 

I think I’ve answered my own question but, should I wait till my psychiatrist goes back in office in a couple months about this or should I schedule a ZOOM meeting now?",12Aug2020,1
60,"I’m an international student in the U.S. As many may know, tuition and fees for international students are crazy here. My parents spend a lot on my school and living expenses and I cannot help but feel guilty for making them do this. We are not very rich; my mother sold a few and rents out apartments for funds for college. My dad is a simple salary man. I feel extreme imposter syndrome and feel like I’m draining my parents. Not only that, they have paid for several surgeries for my sister and I because we both have medical problems, and hers is chronic.

I have recently began to feel kind of suicidal. I feel like I’d be saving them a lot of money if I didn’t exist. I’ve had a great, fun, and privileged life (compared to the majority of people in my third-world country) and I think dying now would not suck too bad.

I wish I could find the courage to talk to my parents about this but I cannot talk to them without crying a river and ultimately not getting my point across.

61," Hello to whoever is reading this, I will try to be brief but I really need advice. 

  Growing up I had a somewhat challenge childhood, I was sexually abused at 4 and homeless for a couple years with my father. My mom gained custody of me and I (now 19) am living in the suburbs on the country side of my state, I want to also say that my dad has his own company now and I am incredibly grateful for everything. 

   Since I was around four, I have had severe panic attacks about dying. At around the age of eight I began having OCD symptoms and was also sexually curious with myself. At eleven years of age I was addicted to watching adult content on my laptop and it was all very graphic role-play of abuse. At 14 I received help and was diagnosed with OCD and Anxiety. This year and the following first two years of high school were very hard, I would eat in the bathroom stalls and once I even slept there all day. It became so bad that I tried online school which resulted in me getting held back because all I did was watch stupid conspiracy videos that triggered my anxiety.

   In conclusion, I became insane. I would convince myself the government was out for me, I would talk to the ceiling because I thought something could hear me, I had frequent panic attacks about dying, and I was packing for the end of the world by purchasing survival gear off websites (something my mom did because she thought I was gaining a hobby and wanted to support me). 

Well thankfully I snapped out of it, I started to get my sh\*t together and I just graduated. Everything has been going great, I have a great job and I am apartment hunting with my boyfriend, my life is beginning and I am excited. That is until yesterday. 

 I have and will most likely always will have panic attacks about dying so this was new, I also have this ""out of body feeling"" where I feel numb and I am pretty good with being able to control my intrusive thoughts. But yesterday I felt like everyone around me was fake, like a cloned world. I live an hour away from my boyfriend so when I left to go home, I tried driving and out of nowhere I was hysterical, I couldn't stop freaking myself out and screaming, my boyfriend ended up coming to get me and I stood another night while he comfort me. I know its not his job to help me and this was the first and I want to be the last time he ever sees me this way because he has depression that he has to deal with, I don't want to ever stress him with my mental health.

 I don't know what to do. I feel the cycle of crazy coming back and I am terrified, I having keeping myself preoccupied but I cant stop panicking. I feel like I am going to have another episode,  I have tried meds, I have went to therapy, I feel helpless and scared of what my outburst might lead to. Ironically enough, in that moment I am so scared of dying, I want to die just to get it over with. Please, if there's someone out there who's been through this, please give me advice.",12Aug2020,1

63,"Hi there. Using a throwaway account because I don't want anyone in real life to see this. Had a really hard time figuring out how to title this, so idk, make of it what you will.

I just turned 25 and have been struggling with mental health my whole life and I am just so overwhelmed right now. I recently started seeing a therapist for the first time in a few years, and I feel like I never have enough time with her to get everything off my chest. She asks me what I want to talk about and there are just so many things that I can't pick just one. She has already diagnosed me with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and ptsd, and there are things I haven't even told her about yet.

As of writing this, I'm really concerned about work. I've been working from home since March with my partner and 7 year old daughter, and I have had some really low points. My job is very deadline-oriented and I've missed almost every deadline the last few months. It's very out of character for me. I was being groomed for management in February and now I feel like I'm in danger of losing my job entirely. I know several of my higher-ranking coworkers (some of which are high leadership of the company) are very annoyed with me, and at least one has been saying nasty things about me not getting my work done in closed door meetings.

I normally take a lot of pride in my job and I love the company and my coworkers.. but I can barely bring myself to function right now (at work or at home!). My team lead seems very understanding of the stressful nature of working with a child at home, but for me it's so much more than that. My daughter is actually really well-behaved for the most part. My biggest issue there is that I feel guilty that I'm spending more time working than with her. 

I've been considering telling my team lead about these other issues I've been having. I have a weekly checkin with her and I want to just scream and say ""I'm doing terribly right now! I know I've been doing really badly at work lately, but I am barely keeping my head above water"". I've had suicidal thoughts multiple times over the last few months, and almost every day something happens that makes me think ""I just wish I could fucking end it""

I know I'm rambling and this isn't really a coherent thought. I just can't deal right now. I tried looking online for advice on how to handle mental health in the workplace and it was all just a bunch of HR ""feel good"" shit (like take a walk on your break, get a good night's sleep!).

I have, what seems to me, a very serious recollection issue.   About 80% of the time I don't know what day it is today, but I chalk that up to my work schedule, going in one night and coming home the next day.   I forget to eat *alot*.    Tomorrow, I won't be able to tell you what I did today.    I've been talking to this nice girl for 6 months now and I have a habit of asking her the same questions I've asked before and I only remember when she gives me the same answers.     

My ex-wife, who I was with for almost 10 years is fading from my memory; I've completey forgotten what she looked like, and slowly forgetting her voice, and it hasn't even been a year since we split.     My whole life is a huge blur to me. I only remember snippets when a familiar song plays or I smell something from my childhood.   I all but forget close friends and coworkers after a few months, and I feel terrible when I can't recall their name after meeting them again.

This has been going on for the past 8 years or so, and I can tell without a doubt that it's getting exponentially worse. 

I'm more than a little worried, I'm not just misremembering I'm losing my whole life, but I don't know who to go to?  Neurologist?  I wouldn't even know what to test for. 

Does this sound like an early onset disease or am I just pushing myself way too hard?  I feel like I have a good solid schedule and routine these days. I don't really feel like I'm hitting my limit, but I guess I'm too used to it to be able to tell.

69,"Hi, I know this might sound really weird but it is getting a problem so I wanted to ask here for help. I am not sure if this is the right subreddit, if not please tell me ans I will post it in another subreddit. I also might post it in r/adhd.

I recently got diagnosed with social anxiety and am still testing for depression. This is just as a background.
I am struggling with concentration since years. I can‘t follow a conversation, listen more than 5minutes in a lecture or study longer than a few minutes witzout getting distracted. I talked with my psychotherapist and she told me that this could come from anxiety and depression but the symptoms I have (like in what situations do I struggle to concentrate, how di I fell then, etc.) doesn‘t add up with the symptoms of concentration problems from anxiety.
She asked me if I got ever diagnosed with ADHD/ADD, and this is how my obsession started.

I didn‘t really know much about ADHD so I started researching. I have symptoms but the most important ones like loosing my keys or forgetting about time doesn‘t fit to me at all. I was already pretty organized as a little kid. So I know for SURE I don‘t have ADHD but I just can‘t forget about it. I started googling if it is possible that I have ADHD without being disorganized, etc. I WISH I have ADHD, but I know it doesn‘t make sence. I don‘t know how to stop it and overcome my obsession!

Do you guys know similar situations and maybe have a few tips how ti overcome this really weird and unhealthy obsession? I would be really grateful for any tips and comments.

TL:DR I really want to have ADHD even tho I know I don‘t have it. I don‘t know how to overcome this obsession.",12Aug2020,1
70,"I’m just going to vent because I don’t know where to start. Back a while ago I was dating a girl who I was absolutely in love with. She was my everything and my best friend. During this time I was in this small group of friends, about 8 people or so and my girlfriend and some of her closer friends in that group had a falling out with someone else so that person was removed. As a result, 2 people who didn’t have a say in what happened argued that they didn’t actually have say in anything and I had to stay neutral on that issue since I they were very close friends but in the end I got pulled to my gfs side by presumption. After that the group was essentially just my gfs closer friends and one other person. I would have tried to stay close with them but one of them who is my best friend dated her back earlier in that year and still had a thing for her and was upset that I was dating her despite the fact that he didn’t tell me anything about it. Going into Juneish I started having really bad anxiety and I started getting into some bad habits which I am not going to specify. She ended up breaking up with me during this time which didn’t help very much for what I was going through and I started getting super aggressive in the group chat we had and I had a bad mental breakdown that everyone found out about. 

To get to modern date after that until about a week ago I was doing a summer program that kind of kept me distracted but I still thought about it. Now I only have free time and I can’t stop thinking about it. I’ve been extremely irritable and I can’t stop thinking that I’ve lost every friend I’ve had. I talk to some people on a regular basis but I don’t actually have conversations with people individually. In that old chat I had they added someone new and then made a completely new group chat with them and everyone except me. I feel like I’m lost now and I no longer have a purpose and I’m scared that my habits are going to relapse because I don’t want to be sucked down any of those holes again. I feel sick everyday and miss having a real friend to talk to.",12Aug2020,1
71,"So I have an ADHD diagnosis that I've seen on paper because my school needed to see it for specil allowances, which I understand. I'm medicated for it.

But I'm really anxious and did an anxiety x depression screening my GP gave me so that I could get a medicare rebate for therapy. When I did this she remarked I came up as having very low mood and very high anxiety. She then confirmed the rebate and sent me to the therapist.

Recently I saw my psychiatrist who wants to start trying me on anti-anxiety or anti-depressants, which makes sense to me, except nobody has told me what I've been diagnosed with, and idk how to know what it is without asking.

I was wondering if anyone else has had experiences, where your psychiatrist hasn't explicitly said that you have a certain diagnosis but heavily implied it and began a treatment path?",12Aug2020,1

We all used to get along really well but his gf has influenced how he sees me, to the point where he won’t even acknowledge me anymore. My roommate doesn’t seem to care either. Everytime i mention this to my roommate, he brushes it off and sides with his friend. So now I’m just waiting for him to leave so I don’t feel like I’m just a bother to everyone anymore.

So it usually goes like this: I would be scrolling through tik tok or some other app, and I get some type of idea or I remember something. I then tell myself to forget about it and move on, but that just ends up making me stressed out because I forgot what the idea was. 

It is very hard to describe, but I have been putting my ideas into my notes that stops the stress, though it is very troublesome to frequently type it into my notes.

If anybody can give me an idea of what I am describing I would be very grateful. These feelings have been on an off and I sometimes have impulses of these.

With all the restrictions currently imposed on Melbourne and the whole of Victoria and New South Wales, my parents and I cannot visit him. The only person with him is his girlfriend who has been telling us (My parents and me) how things are. He has been fairly regularly looking up how to kill oneself and has recently purchased a rope with which to hang himself (Trust me, It is to hang himself with). He is also autistic, relatively low on the spectrum but still affects him. It has worsened at the moment because of the lockdown.

80,"I’m not sure where to begin. I was clinically diagnosed with depression back in high school and was on medication for a time but it didn’t make me feel better so my mom just stopped putting me on it and I naturally just sort of drifted away from depression, or so I thought. I now think I had debilitating depression and anxiety back then but now am a high functioning depression. 

I cry myself to sleep every night and I don’t know why. I hate my life even though I know I’m privileged, and I wish I never existed. I don’t think I’m suicidal but I really, really wish I was never born. A lot of people get surprised when I even broach the topic of mental health because I can be open and outgoing when I need to be, and also because I’m attractive (apparently, I don’t think I am but get told so) so no one takes me seriously. I can never talk to my parents about this because they don’t take it seriously and reply with “everyone is depressed” or my mom pulls out her favorite “I’ve lived with depression longer than you and sometimes I want to commit suicide but I just live with it.” 

I hate living. I’m in every position where I now I can succeed in life but I just hate breathing and working towards what feels like nothing. I don’t know why I can’t stop crying when I’m by myself and since I’m not at school to distract myself, I think quarantine is making my mental health worse. Sometimes I wish a car would hit be for an instant painless death but then I realize I’m too scared to die. I feel like I’m failing in everything in my life(even tho I know I’m not) like being a horrible sister, daughter, student, friend.

I constantly feel indifferent about so many things that honestly when I get hurt by people now I just don't care about it. I don't get it. I used to feel so much more emotion and joy in my life and now it feels like my life is consumed by pessimism and also by a lack of desire for a lot of things in life.

87,"Well actually already is. She calls it poly but I'm not aloud to do anything or even befriend a female( but she wants me to get head from another man) She went thru alot of trauma recently like the worst you could ever experience for most. After this trauma she had an urge to sleep with other people(to forget and be distracted). Now this was sort of a kink a long time ago for me but wanted to be more involved. We had one experience early on and it didn't go well. Neither party was having a good time it was just bad. After that I still sort of had a kink meaning wanting to have a threesome. But knew it wasn't going to happen. I eventually gave up on it and moved on. She's a very depressed person has been since we've met 5 years ago. It's taking such a toll on me i've always helped her thru it and made sure she felt loved and had support(alot more too). Not only from me but my family. When she was younger she was very bitter and broken. People took it as her just being a bitch but in all reality she just hated her self and hated her life. She use to get fucked with and ghosted constantly by dudes. I think that's where her need for constant attention came from. 

But anyway 

So basically it's been going on for a month she downloaded tinder with my permission and found some matches etc. I thought it was going to go down way different but our first experience I was at work(with my permission) while she was doing her thing and they waited for me till I got home by then they were already basically done. The threesome only lasted about 10 mins if that and he said he was done. No one finished. Now fast forward 

She's met another couple which didn't work out and has another guy she sees on the reg. I've been struggling with this life style since it started but I was desperate to see her happy. She brought it up on her own and when I agreed something changed in her. I couldn't help but just let her be free and be happy and feel confident. Now this whole time I've kind of wondered what was I doing wrong for her to have this need for other men. Like I'm not enough. She denies it and basically says she hates that she needs the attention this bad but it's like really helping her. (Side note she wants a Dom so I know that has something to do with it ) I can be some type of way but I'm a total lover 
I've asked for certain things like certain style videos if I'm not involved so I could atleast get something out of it but never really got anything I wanted(shitty videos). Or even told her not to be telling people and she tells basically everyone she's cool with and a person that I know(tried to hide it from me)  Whenever I feel like I'm struggling with jealousy or heart ache she gets defensive and scared that I'll make her stop.  This whole time she's been consumed by it constantly talking to like 4 people at the same time while swiping on tinder and sending nudes etc. It's basically all she does now. It's all she ever looks forward to it's all that give her motivation to help around the house and just normalife shit (when she gets a dick appointment)

This whole time has been terrible for me. She got ghosted a few times and I know it was triggering. But she was being terrible honestly very terrible. Acting like they broke up with her and she was just all alone. I kept making sure she knew I still got her. Still love her and to just drop it but she was so stuck on it. Depressed again until she found someone else. 


Now while this is happening our sex life has been great and honestly our relationship has been flawless. Like the best it's been since the beginning(aside from feeling like shit over it). So I just deal with the heart ache ( I can get into it sometimes) but 90 percent of the time I'm not about it. 

She made a comment about how she's destroying us cause she knows I struggle with it but it's honestly bullshit when she says this shit bc nothing is gonna change. I finally broke and just told her I'm hurting constantly over it but I support her and just want her to be happy and I'll wait for her. I feel like if I didn't let her do this she would've gotten worse(suicidal) she constantly talks about how she wants to kill herself. She lowkey forced it on me. She talked about being so unhappy before this started even with our relationship to these other men. After I told her that I really don't like it but I won't stop her she tried breaking up with me. Basically told me she couldn't be with me if I hated it but doesn't want to stop. She needs this attention she craves this attention. ""She hates that shes like this"" I begged her all night to stay with me (kind of feel like a fool for that) but she kept saying stuff like I think some type of way about her and ""caught her being a hoe"" how this was all my plan to prove that she's a hoe. How she can't be with me unless she can be ""open"" with me. How she loves being open. She basically chose random men over me. She was so ready to just drop me. Fast forward to the morning and hadn't talked to her but she still felt the same. Didn't wanna be with someone that lied about being into it( when I did say I found joy in it at times) how I made her feel disgusting and made her feel completely stupid brought up old wounds just didn't wanna be with me""how this is abusing her"" I gave up and told her I was blocking her an did on my phone but not social media yet. She threatened to kill herself if I blocked her how I'm testing her and how ""I know that she wouldn't do it"" basically forcing me to keep talking to her. I couldn't stand the thought of loosing her but didn't wanna be a fucking fool. She's the love of my life my soulmate (were so spiritually connected) aside from the bs. The good times are really good times. But it still brothers me that she wouldn't be with me unless we're open and she says it won't be forever just until she copes better ? 

I'll stop cause i don't wanna ramble but I'm at lost. I still feel shattered but I truly don't wanna loose her. Idk what to do we also have little obligations that make this even more hard to deal with.

90,"I am a teen, and I am genuinely worried that I could possibly be one. I am friendless. I haven't had any friends since I was 12. This is in part due to the amount of moving my family has done. But, also I am emotionally unavailable. I have tried to make friends, but it usually ends within a short period of time. I acknowledge that it is my fault. I don't enjoy being vulnerable, it brings along discomfort and self hatred. I feel that if I share things with others then I will be judged, and so there comes a point in which I just distance myself from the person. They also become bored of me quickly, so it is easy for the beckoning friendship to just fizzle out. 

I know that I am probably, at least on the surface not a mean person. In school my peers would refer to me as nice. Being told that I am nice is the only trait that has been given to me consistently throughout my life. But, sometimes I find myself being nice simply for my own self gratification. It makes me feel good, and sometimes I just do it for that feeling. Also, I want others to think that I am a kind person. My reasons for being kind at times just seem so selfish, and I feel gross for it. 

I don't think I am better then others. For the most part I feel inferior, but I do sometimes purposely downplay certain talents. I used to run, and I did quite well. But, when people mentioned it I downplayed it. I didn't want to come off as being arrogant, and so I just acted like I didn't think I was good at running. I didn't want to seem full of myself, but I also liked the reassurance that was given. It reaffirmed it for me that I was in fact not bad at running.

92,"27f have been diagnosed with Borderline PD, MDD. 

I have a pattern of going into a really hyper state where I fixate on things to the point of not being able to focus on anything else. Not work, not my basic health needs, not my partner. I cannot focus on anything else. This lasts for days-weeks at a time. 

Sometimes I become super productive and accomplish many things. Other times I cause a lot of destruction. 

My most recent ""episode"" of this involved me accusing my parter of 10 years of sexually abusing me, abruptly changing my sexuality and attempting to date other people, planning/drafting correspondence to break our mortgage pre-approval, telling my friends/family I was in an abusive relationship and that I was leaving. I even convinced my partner we needed to take a break from our relationship so I could date other people in order to figure out my sexuality.  None of this is true. I'm not in an abusive relationship but I was convinced I was. I'm curious about my sexuality but I don't want to take a break or date other people. This lasted 8 days.

94,"So this is kind of confusing and will probably be a longish post. 

In eleventh grade, (2016-2017) idk if it was too much stress or anxiety and depression, but my brain just decided to give up. 

I used to be able to go into my memory and pull out specific details and I was pretty sharp.

Now it’s hard to think of specific details related to emotions and how I feel about something, where it’s like I know this is a super important thing to me, but I can’t come up with the reasons why kind of thing.

I’m still able to be pretty sharp in present conversation and thinking, not related to memories, but my brain just gives up if my brain starts to try. 

I’ve got adhd, so my mind is hyperactive a lot so maybe it was too much for my brain and something broke?

I’ve still got adhd but it just feels like my brain connection to my memory or being able to hold onto topics I want to talk about when in a discussion with a friend is just not really there.

My brain still works in the same way during present thinking, it’s my brains connection with my memory I think is what it is.

I have a bit of an example of how my brain visualizes it.

So imagine a rubber band that’s wrapped around two poles, so it’s stretched taut. Strong. It’s like in my brain, say the left side, somehow snaps off of the top of a pole and disconnected so now the rubber band is limp and no longer taut. When I try to think of things too hard, it’s like the rubber band can’t get put back on the left pole.

Another example is like a cut cord. It gets cut and there’s sparks. The left side is trying to reconnect with the right side, but when I try, it just kind of twitches and barely moves. Does that make sense?

I started thinking harder about this again, since my brains been like this for a while now and I’ve come to kind of accept it, even though I don’t like it. But what brought it up and made me upset was:

You know how people can right a whole paragraph to an artist celebrity that really impacted their life? I’ve got people like that too, but I can’t think of specifics. It’s not that I haven’t been as impacted as I think, my brain knows that these people are important and special to me, but I couldn’t think of specific things to list. So it gave me anxiety and irrational worry that if I ever met one of these people, I wouldn’t be able to tell them and thank them for all the ways they helped me and not look like the huge fan I am.

I can’t remember if this has been happening since when my brain kind of broke, it probably has, I just can’t remember exactly, but I have episodes of dissociation and derealization/depersonalization. I don’t know if I’ve just been having a constant state of dissociating in my brain that’s causing this? Because I still get episodes where I’m like super dissociated, but maybe in between episodes there a remnant if that sticking around in my brain making it lazy and difficult to think with? Like possibly I’ve got a constant state of dissociation, but I still get new episodes that add on to it that make it a full episode where I just zone out kind of thing?

Another thing is that, I used to be able to put my thoughts into words through text and write long paragraphs to friends, but now my brain just doesn’t wanna bother. Sometimes I’m somehow able to do it, but the main point out of all of this is that a majority of the time, my brain simply *can’t bother* to work anymore in some situations.

I started anti depressants and anti anxiety medication around the time this happened so maybe that’s the cause, but I remember feeling my brain start to go wonky before I got on them IIRC.

I’ve got anxiety so I really don’t want to talk to my

I’m sorry this is probably really confusing. But this has been going on for years now and I really would like to know exactly what might be happening and if I’m correct it might be a constant state of dissociation in the brain or something.

I think I’m *slightly* dissociated right now, but I’m still able to *kind of function* since I have adhd and my brain is still able to do lots of things. So that’s probably why this might be more confusing.

It really is scary, even though I’ve kind of learned to live with it.

I’m tired of this daily routine and I have tired escaping it but somehow reality always shows up at my door and makes me face it. I hate that I got involved in their fights, hate they still drag me, hate the idea of  marriage. 
I connect more emotionally with mom, but after years and of getting involved in their fights it has taught me the best choice is not to get involved. But now they keep dragging me. I can’t sleep anymore due to the severe hallucinations and their shoutings. The worst part is that this happens everyday, I have tried talking to close family member like uncle or aunt but it didn’t help. I worry about my younger siblings, I feel so sorry that they have to go through this with me. I have had 17 year of experience of these fights. They weren’t so severe at first but now it has crossed the level of severe. Escaping didn’t help since reality would always follow me there. I love both of my parents but I’m tried and u think they are too. 
I feel like either my mom or my dad are going to burst one day, and that it scares me. The consequences of this toxic volcanoes scare me. I don’t know how far are they willing to go. I hate being trapped between them. The worst part of all is that I don’t have anyone to talk about this situation, my sister doesn’t really like talking about it and my brother is just too young.
My father doesn’t consider the idea of a counselor. But honestly I’m so tired that I just want them to split up cause it’s driving me crazy mad. 
I’m depressed and feel helpless in these kinds of situations. The only thing that keeps me going is there are people who are facing much force situations.

97,"I don’t really know how to start this, so I guess I’ll just jump in.

Around a year and a half ago, my ex broke up with me. Our relationship was turbulent—she was a serial cheater, and I was aware of it. She took out her anger on me in ways that I’d rather not describe. I was never allowed to have a say in anything, I was “stupid”, she got angry whenever I saw my friends, etc. I never left, though—I know it’s the classic answer, but I loved her too much to go. Our relationship lasted 5 years, and i couldn’t bear to say goodbye to it. And, as fucked up as it may sound, the bad times made the good times 100x more exhilarating than they might have been otherwise.

Anyway, when she left me, things were actually pretty GOOD. For a while, I felt free!! But recently, especially with COVID, I’ve been isolated again. And I just can’t stop thinking about how long I let myself stay in that relationship. I know logically that it isn’t my fault, but I just wish I had been strong enough to leave before it ever got that bad. To this day, seeing others get angry makes me freeze. I’m still trying to get over a massive inferiority complex, and I struggle to accept love from others when it doesn’t feel “deserved.” I just feel like a broken person.

99,"With everything going on at the moment, I just don't feel that I deserve to seek help. I so desperately want it, I want to feel better again but I can't - for so many reasons.

I'm not sure what I have, but for the last 2 years I haven't felt okay. It feels like I'm missing all colour from the word that I previously saw; I'm on autopilot and I can't be motivated to do anything. I can sometimes laugh but everything feels forced, like an effort. I'm able to get out of bed, but I do nothing. Since there's no school, no distractions, I feel extremely irritated. I do my best to procrastinate on my phone etc, not caring enough to do schoolwork anymore, but it isn't enough. I want an answer, I want to be able to have friends again. I don't want to feel like a burden, lowering the mood around people. I don't want to feel tired every single day. I want to feel sharp, alive and not want each day to be a waste of my life.

I'm not sure if it's depression. I don't feel valid. I'm coasting, nothing severe as acting on suicide, but I don't feel anything - certainly not happiness. My friend is depressed and I'm trying my best to help him, but I don't think I can say no. I can't just disappoint him. I don't have any energy; I haven't since I was 14. My life has slowly been turning to shit with family events and specific things I don't want to go into, and then this year has been worse - globally with a pandemic and all.

I feel like my issues are so insignificant to everything around me. I don't want to diagnose because that would mean my problems are real, but at the same time I can't live like this. I don't want to be a failure, and yet I'm doing nothing to avoid it. I want the world to change, but the resources/help for me would only feel like a waste. People need help more than me, they need treatment, support so that they don't die and I just feel like shit in contrast.

I'm not sure my parents are aware of real signs of depression or other mental illnesses. My aunt is depressed, and my parents can recognize that, but she's a clear case - living alone, unhappy etc. Yet still, they complain about her and her actions. My parents just call me lazy, and perhaps that's all I am. I feel so bad for even typing this and concerning others. I just feel like crying, but I can't.",12Aug2020,1
100,"So you saw my question but let me give some context for the question. On like a biweekly to monthly schedule I would be doing nothing and then I will experience big fits I guess you would call them where my fear of death is the only thing on my mind. Lasting from a few seconds to a week at most. I would say it is my biggest fear. 

Also. I panic and over think anything. I couldn’t meet a friend from online because I was too afraid of being stabbed or kidnapped. I was shaking from my driving test and failed my first time because of it. I also shake when giving any sort of presentation. In front of 1 person or multiple.

In school I was in theatre for 6 years and had stage fright every single time. One play I stuffed my face and ate 6-7 bananas right before going on stage just to have an upset stomach the whole time. 

I am freaking out about working at a fast food joint because I feel I don’t have the confidence to actually pull it off. Or I would forget something and be fired on the spot. Like I have been going through orientation for 2 shifts so far spanning 12 hours in total and I still have stuff I need to finish. What if I don’t remember how to clean a tomato chopper correctly? Or I and too afraid to get burned to grill or fry?  *WHY AM I SO MUCH OF A CHICKEN!?*

But he stays in the shadows and when it's his time to be in charge he causes so much pain.  He is the darkest of Dudes.  Light Dude and dark Dude need to sit down together and work out their shit so maybe we can have a Grey Dude.  So now in this scenario I'm neither of the Dudes and am instead a Neutral Dude, a mediator between light and dark.  So now I have 3 Dudes?  Wut??  Or maybe they're not separate identities, most likely we're all part of the same root and one part is the more logical, easy-breezy lighter Dude side and the darker Dude side is a rotten part of the root further down south.

105,"Hey guys! I (F24) would need your help regarding my younger brother (M22). I live in the Philippines, and unfortunately, the active cases have been increasing so going to the hospitals us being discouraged. We cannot afford to have an online therapist because both my parents are unemployed. Anyway, I am just trying to understand what is going on with him. As a sister, I care for him. I have tried talking to him, and my older sibling too (F32 &amp; M27), but he wouldn't just say anything. It started to happen when our older brother had to move to another country with my dad to find work because of that my mom and I were worried because he doesn't have his best friend to hang out with. He would go out with his high school classmates but it feels like he shuts down when we moved to another city that is quite far from where we used to live. Since then, he would only come downstairs to eat, get some water, get some snacks. Whenever my mom would ask him if he's feeling okay, he would just mumble and looks as if he's annoyed which is you, bit disrespectful for me. My dad encouraged him to find work but once he realized that he doesn't feel like it, he would just quit. There's a time that my dad and older brother were here for vacation. My older brother would try to spend time with him but he got surprised when younger brother asked him to leave his room. My dad thinks he has an antisocial personality disorder and needs therapy but he refused. I opened to my younger brother that I am suffering from imposter syndrome, anxiety, panic disorder, and depression. He said that he would join me to have therapy but he's bot gonna do it alone. But then, I would insist to my parents to encourage my brother to go because it would be more expensive if it were the two of us that would go. I told him the other time that I am reading books that would help me understand my mental struggles and he told me that his learning about stoicism. 

I am sorry if I am being disorganized but can you just help me understand a bit about my brother? What are your insights and suggestions? Thank you all so much. I will answer if you have any questions.",12Aug2020,1

I hate meeting anyone, no matter if they are my best friend or not.

I love being alone enormously. I'd do everything to just be at home 24/7 without needing to see family or friends/strangers, etc.; my mother &amp; twin sister are saying this isn't normal and I'm antisocial. But I do feel empathy? It's just I don't have the need for relationships.

118,"Hi, forgive me if this is a long post, but I'm kind of desperate for advice. I feel like I've tried everything to have a good relationship with my sister but nothing works. She has depression and was having therapy (before lockdown) and is on meds.

Both me and my mother were very patient and supportive with her at first but she frequently gets moody and angry. We wouldn't take this personally but when she's angry, she is fine with everyone else but us. Sometimes she just wakes up feeling bad, shouts and swears at us if we do anything she doesn't like, but then goes and plays on the xbox with her friends like nothing is wrong. I don't get it, why does these mood swings only affect her family, when we've been supportive?

This has been happening for a while and normally I just take it, but perhaps 2 or 4 times in the past 2 years I've completely snapped, destroying the relationship we had. I'd shout back at her, telling her how horrible she's been to us and that I've had enough of her, and after that we wouldn't talk properly for weeks, even months.

I'm tired of this happening and I just want to be able to have a relationship with my sister without having to take all the emotional abuse.

I remember thinking back in highschool, ""what if I just disappear?"".

My mother passed away almost a decade ago and my father blamed me for a couple of years. We did not celebrate any occasion for several years. I spent my birthday, Christmas eve and new year's eve on an internet shop.

At random times at night, when my mind idles, thoughts just pour and I just lay in my bed thinking of the consequences and possible outcomes.

It worsen when I reached adulthood and adult problems came.

125,"I don't know if this is the right sub but it's something I'm working on in therapy but really struggling with. I'm a people pleaser because it's all I've ever been allowed to be. I don't think I've ever been allowed to say no. If I said no to my parents they would punish me, and now I am reduing my contact with them they are getting angry, calling me selfish/a bad daughter, love bombing and guilt tripping me into talking to them more. Ever since school every friendship I have made has been ruined by me putting boundaries in. In primary school I made friends with kids in my class, but when I couldn't play out because my parents wouldn't let me they wouldn't talk to me anymore and started physically bullying me and encouraged all the other students to do it. This carried on into secondary school and got more violent, and if I ever told a teacher or fought back they would make it worse. I've never had a friend in my life. The most I got was a few people pretending to be my friend so they could get information out of me and then they would embarrass me or trick me, or frame me for things they had done. For example they put stuff they had shoplifted into my bag when I wasn't looking right before a bag search after the school was notified students were shoplifting because I couldn't go shopping with them as my parents wouldn't let me and I didn't have any money for the bus or shops anyway. Another time I made ""friends"" with a girl in the year above me at school who was quite well off. She let me stay there to get away from my parents a couple of times and I got nice food, and she had a pool which was relaxing. But after a few weeks she started inviting a girl who would hit me most days at school and I said that I wasn't comfortable being there with her so I wanted to leave, but would still hang with her separately. She pushed me into the pool and pulled the cover over so I was trapped and she left me for an hour. I had a few boyfriends growing up but I couldnt say no to them either without them spreading rumours about me, sending out nudes they foundonline and saying they were me, or the worst was when my boyfriend had me chased by hunting dogs because I was on my period and didn't want to have sex, but I offered to do other things and it wasn't enough. Boyfriends until my current one would just do what they wanted to me whenever they wanted, and if I said no I would be punished

Then I moved to uni, fresh start 3 hours away. 4 years later I have no friends. I made friends in the first few weeks, but I had to do everything they wanted. They would get mad at me for going to work and not going out, or hanging out with other people. I would invite them to parties and events with other people and they would spend the whole night telling the other people how horrible and selfish I am, and then they wouldn't talk to me either. They tried to get me kicked off my course by saying I had cheated and they sent a convincing fake email with wrong exam dates on it so I had to repeat a year after missing the final exams. They did this because I went on holiday on my own because I wanted a break and I had always fancied solo travel. I have had 4 or 5 jobs since I moved here and had to leave all of them because my coworkers wouldn't let me have boundaries. I would be bullied out if I couldn't take an extra shift (I already worked 5-6 days a week whilst full time studying), I got bullied out of one job when I had to go to hospital after having a 2nd trimester miscarriage and they told my other coworkers that I had an abortion so I could go out partying so everyone thought I was an awful person. When I tried to explain my side they just told me they couldn't stand the sight of me. Another job I quit because the manager was constantly telling me I was doing everything wrong and she would tell me how to do it her way, which was what I was already doing. It felt gaslighty and one day I said that I appreciate her help and wanting the business to be successful and asked if she would give me a copy of the food spec so I could make sure everything was up to standard. She screamed and spat in my face and said I was the rudest worker she's ever had. I walked out after another shift where she changed the whole menu without telling me and when I asked her to talk me through it she called me stupid and insufferable and that any idiot could figure it out. 

I'm lucky that I now have a boyfriend who is really kind and supportive, but I can't say no to him because of my past. I still don't have any friends and I feel so isolated and lonely. I'm an introvert but I am social, I love having people around me and sharing experiences, I think everything is more fun when the experience is shared with someone else. I still find it hard to say no to my boyfriend even over little things, and I can't make friends as I'm too keen to please because I'm so scared of putting my own boundaries in. When I have boundaries I have no friends and I hate it. I miss having people to see and talk to and learn from and be inspired by. 

It's a big part of my therapy atm (I have OCD, PTSD, BPD, and autism) but I am struggling because I can't understand putting in boundaries when it ruins all my relationships? How do I have friends but have my autonomy and not do things I am uncomfortable with?",12Aug2020,1

In other words I know how to tend to predators and other such things. Well on Monday my friends girlfriend had just started a chicken coop with about six or seven birds. Americana chickens if I’m not mistaken. Well a Coyote decided her coop was now his all you can eat buffet and had claimed a one chicken after tearing a holy in the fence. She called me And she asked if I could lend her a hand. After an offer of $50 and beer I said yes. I set up cameras and found a hole where the little guy was getting her chickens. I asked her “do want him dead or alive”. She told me either or, I hate yodies so kill it was. At about dusk I see him going through a cotton field. Might I say he was a plump little bastard. I called the girl on the phone and said I was about to take a shot since I was maybe 200 yards from her house where the coop was. Why was the coop that far out? “Because they stank”, anyway I take a shot but he stepped forward and I missed the heart shot hitting him in the gut. Not going to lie I kinda felt bad for him so as I’m walking I hear my friend and his girl running out asking if I got him, “yep he is out here” and I pointed. Nothing special about it anyone who hunts this bastards knows exactly how much of a nuisance they can be. We found it laying down with a bit of blood pooling around his midsection and it was whining. The girl straight up goes “**gasp** oh noooooo”. Her bf (my friend) was pale. So I just took out my .45 and cocked it ready to put the animal down. Oh my god this girl had a major meltdown “NO NO NO NO DONT KILL HIM!”. I said either a bullet to the head for a quick and painless death or a slow bleed out death for it and to chose now. It started getting up and I put a round to the back of its head. You think I would have shot her from her screaming. I drug it back to my truck and loaded the cadaver up to be disposed of and she said I wasn’t getting paid, that was animal abuse (even tho that’s why I was hired), and that I wasn’t getting paid. My friend is still pale. I just said what ever and left. It’s not a profession a friend needed help. I’ve killed coyotes, rabid foxes, and A stray dog once due to it charging at a little kid.

147,"I think I'm depressed. For the past few weeks, I've been perpetually sad, anxious, tired, and struggling to maintain interest in most things (except working on my art). Though I've been trying to be happier, life just feels empty and meaningless, lately (*especially when everything is focused on covid deaths, negative politics and police brutality*). 

Also, I can't help shake the fear and anxiety about my loved ones being hurt or suffering, and my being powerless to do anything about it 😕 I'm not sure what I need, painting seems to help, but I know I need to get out of my head more because, right now, it's not in a healthy state.

I think moving more may help? I'm basically stationary 95% of my weekday (*I work at a desk job that's an hour commute from my home*) and my diet is so-so at best. This has lead to weight gain that I can't seem to shake.",12Aug2020,1
149,"Hello, this has been on my mind for quite some time and I'd like some help.

So for a very long time I've been unable to feel emotions. Obviously I can feel things such as hunger, pain(physical), etc. But I just can't feel anything.

I don't feel empty, and I don't feel numb, because you can actually feel those things, I used to be able to feel those things so I can tell the difference.

I just feel nothing, you can say I'm void of all feelings, I just go about my day on pilot mode most of the time anyways. I've researched it and there's things such as emotional numbness and such but I'm unsure if I have it or not.

I asked my doctor and he got a therapist to contact me for an appointment. They called me last week but I was busy and I missed it but they asked me to call them back. I still haven't. It's not that I'm scared or anything, I just feel like I'm overreacting. It's not like I'm feeling a huge amount of despair or my life is horrible. I just feel nothing.

So I'm unsure if I should go ahead and get the appointment or not. I'm honestly fine with how I am right now, because I got used to feeling nothing a long time ago so I can manage now.",12Aug2020,1
150,"Basically, when I was 11 I had an older boyfriend and we were only dating for about 8-9 months. He started crushing on a girl a few weeks before we broke up, and when he confessed i was filled with so many emotions. I started screaming at nothing, like I screamed at air, and my mind was filled with questions and i started laughing and crying and then screaming. When he left me and got with her, I did the same except then I had extreme thoughts of killing who he left me for. I was serious, too, i had nothing but thoughts of killing her in multiple ways. I never met her, so i couldn’t have, i only knew her name and basic info like that. The thoughts and urge never went away. Then I had another boyfriend (online though), and we broke up but he then, almost immediately, got with another girl. They live in another continent from me, so i couldn’t have really done anything, but I wanted to kill her so bad. I cried, laughed, and yelled in pain like last time, but not as bad, and I was serious about finding a hitman to kill her off or something. But i didn’t search it up or anything for legal purposes. I was so filled with anger, i grabbed a knife and stabbed a teddy bear i had. I wanted to kill them, 100% serious. Then, my current boyfriend who i’ve been dating since 8/20/2018 told me he had sex with a girl a while back in 2019. I was absolutely filled with rage. I wanted to kill her so bad, I asked him for information about her so I could find a way to track her and kill her. I would’ve done anything to get my hands on her and kill her even myself if i had to but I just needed to kill her. The urge of killing was so strong. Since I’m always alone, when the urge of killing is strong, I lash it out on my (tw ⚠️ ) wrists and create multiple cuts. I let them bleed and imagine as if they were the girls i want to kill’s blood gushing out. Then i stab the teddy bear again. All my mind can focus on are pictures of their dead bleeding corpses, and just by thinking about it i get pleased. I smile, sometimes laugh uncontrollably, and i feel an extreme happiness of that image.",12Aug2020,1
152,"So I have some pretty deep scars from when I would cut myself. They’ve healed the best they could. It took a lot of confidence and courage for me to wear short sleeves. Obviously I was scared to make people uncomfortable and didn’t want someone to point them out because I’m still having trouble coming up with a reasonable believable lie about them.

My coworker saw them the other day, and goes “is that the trend these days, to cut yourself. Are you like Emo or something, that’s the emo trend”.

I was shocked asf and didn’t know how to respond. I just laughed it off but it really like struck me. First off I’m not emo while I have am a black girl who’s a little alternative lol I’m not emo. Secondly, that’s really offensive and ignorant to say about emos. Thirdly why tf would you say I’m part of a trend. 

My scars remind me every day, that I OD, was in a psych ward multiple times, broke my family for while, lost friends, and most importantly they remind me about unstable I am sometimes. 

But my scars also remind me how far I’ve came. I went from withdrawing all my classes to I’m graduating with my associates this spring. They’ve healed and so have I. I’ve learned to deal with being bipolar I’ve accepted it and Im doing great now. Closet to happpimess I’ve ever been.

Recently in some of thier life events i made some really really negative assumptions and said some things that ended up hurting them to point that they felt like taking a break from me.

159,I wanna know your thoughts.,12Aug2020,1
160,"Hey, I am new here and I have been lurking around for a while. English is not my native language so excuse me for any mistakes.

I have decided to post because of some problems in  my behavior, the way I perceive social feedback and how I respond to it, especially negative feedback. I have come to believe that these issues severely undermine my quality of life and my ability to maintain interpersonal relationships.

So let me present to you these problems. First of all, I have a strange sensitivity to rejection, to the point of crying and becoming depressed if someone doesn't greet me back, even though the may not have seen me. Which leads me to the next problem.

My behavior is often passive-aggressive. This has become increasingly distressing for me during the last weeks as my passive-aggressive behavior seems to worsen and I often use more serious forms of it more often. Not to say that it wasn't serious before but i have started doing some really bad things. I would stop talking to the person who had insulted   me for a few minutes in the past but now this behavior is targeted towards everyone in the group. On top of that, I began using sarcasm and insulting everybody and I am not proud of it. This type of conduct is closely tied to my rejection sensitivity and it in turn makes it worse as it makes people actually reject me.

However my aggression has recently also started becoming more overt. I have become breaking the trust of everyone around me. For example, I after a mild argument with my friends destroyed all the progress we had made. Now this is of course incredibly toxic, I take full responsibility for my actions and I won't blame my problems for it. But it wasn't the same for my past self. Blind with anger I was ruthless as I destroyed our progress with no regret nor guilt, saying ""I don't care"" to any of my friends' complaints. It took several hours to cool off and realize what I had done. It filled me with guilt and pushed my friends away. I am sorry for it. 

Moreover, I have another problem. I frequently seek attention. It has many forms. It may be listening to music while passing in front of members of the preferred sex or trying to appear interesting to people who I feel have rejected me by talking about dark or weird things near them. There have also been cases where I deliberately annoyed the people from whom I wanted to get attention. If I don't get attention I feel incomplete.

Well, these problems may already appear not that serious but I have in fact concluded that they are the reason for a lot of seemingly unrelated. For example I have realized that every single one of my attempts to learn, improve or acquire something have been all attempts to get attention and become more desirable. Furthermore, this need for attention and my rejection sensitivity have resulted in me getting ostracized from the general social structure, not ostracized by others but by myself and I am also somewhat socially anxious because of it. Last but not least, I can't function well without attention. Without it I become depressed and I often have fantasies of power or fantasies where I get a lot of attention. I would like to leave all that behind as it has clearly destroyed my life. I would like to become normal. I don't need advice on the situation. I know that I should apologize and I will. I don't simply want to become less aggressive. I want to change the very thing that causes me to become aggressive, sensitive to rejection, etc. .

Before I finish this I should add that I am also 100% sure I suffer from OCD but It is under control and doesn't currently cause any distress in my everyday life. Finally, I would like to say that therapy isn't easily accessible for me. For one I live in the country where therapists aren't that many and good therapists are even less, the only one I know of in the area is a close relative which further adds to the problem. Also, I am a minor and I can't travel great distances to find one. Thank you everyone in advance for responding.",12Aug2020,1
162,"Hi, i think i really need to start seeing a therapist, but, because of COVID and my living situation, online therapy over text is really my only option.

Also can an online therapist make a diagnosis? I have issues around feeling like I'm faking my mental health issues, and I think a diagnosis would help alleviate this.",12Aug2020,1
163,"I went to a very prestigious art school which had particular ways of doing things and I just didn’t fit into that. I am incredibly conscientious and high in openness. 

The projects we were set were interesting, but I found the formula of them suffocating and it hurt my confidence considerably. 

Most projects would go something like this:
*You’d be given a brief and the deadline (which was always unbelievably tight)
*Have tutorials where you would show your working progress (I.e show your process through drawing in a sketchbook, they were very particular about how you did your sketchbook/process)
*On the deadline/end of project there would be a class critique

What would happen to me is:
*The brief would excite me and I’d start brainstorming ideas but I would then get anxious  because my process doesn’t fit neatly in a sketchbook. I like to experiment with interesting materials, and I hate drawing and much prefer to work in 3D. It’s just much more suitable for the outcome I would like. 
*At the beginning of the course, I would go to all my tutorials because I’m deeply conscientious and wanted to make a good impression on my tutors. Towards the end of the degree I would skip them because I found that they would invalidate my work and completely hinder my progress eg tell me that my research wasn’t good and criticise me for not doing enough drawing. Sometimes I would try doing more drawing but it would be completely irrelevant to my work, it wouldn’t add anything to it. 
*The studio we worked in was all open plan which was fun at first but the tutors would constantly be around and you couldn’t get away from other students, it was like everyone was watching you all of the time so you couldn’t be free to just try out an idea and roll with it. It probably doesn’t help that I’m very introverted and love my alone time. They also used to look down on students who liked working at home. 
*The deadline was so horrible. People would constantly be doing all nighters etc The class critique on the deadline was THE WORST for me. By then I would’ve spent the project in the worst anxiety, seriously sleep deprived. The crit was like public humiliation because I would be made to show such a small pathetic amount of work (I’d have say 30% of the project done). The shame was absolutely horrific because I cared so much about my work but I could never be one of those students who presented such beautiful, complete work. But, what I had done, other students would ogle over? My work was often very beautiful but very incomplete. 

Often when we had projects/completions with external companies I would do exceptionally well and win the project? I have had such good feedback from others outside the school and it adds to my confusion as to why I have no confidence. The rational part of my brain knows that this was just school, the school don’t own it he world’s opinion, you don’t have to work in a sketchbook if you don’t want to, but I can’t seem to shake the feeling that I’m invalid. 

But now, I’m broken. It’s been 3years since I graduated and I cannot for the life of me work on my art anymore. I wanted to have 6 months - 1 year working on my own projects and developing my own process at my own pace, but I find that when I begin to work, I feel stressed, anxious, like no matter what I do it’s wrong or that someone else would do it better. I can’t think straight, I criticise myself terribly as if I’m one of my old tutors. I beat myself for working so slow. I can’t make decisions. It’s all gonna fail anyway, I just can’t work on it anymore. This has led me to isolate myself. I’m unemployed because I can’t get a body of work together to apply for anything and no one understands what’s going on with me. I know deep down people are starting to think I’m just lazy and that also hurts. Ive been in and out of depression too which has been brought on by this experience. 

Kind opinions, encouragement, suggestions, analysis of this situation are so welcome. I have so many ideas that I can see crystal clear in my head but I can’t make them happen anymore. I am so upset and broken.",12Aug2020,1
164,"So I've been hallucinating for 6 months almost, with having ""Delusions"" and I think I've had psychotic episodes almost 4 times now, I'm still unsure because I haven't talked to a psychiatrist but a friend of mine told my situation to one and they did say mine are the classic signs of schizophrenia.

So, I have always had voices in my head and thought it was normal, but recently I was told by someone that it isn't and it changed my whole perception of myself not gonna lie.. and then there are evil voices in my head which tell me to do bad things to myself(usually self harm or suicide), whispering or screaming, etc. 

Recently, I was depressed and sleep deprived and I actually had a whole conversation with a voice in my head which tried to comfort me and actually responded to me unlike any voices in my head which just ignored me.. but then I got even more depressed because if I can talk to them that means I'm getting more mentally ill I guess?

169,Lately I’ve had these episodes where I’d cry for no reason until my head hurts and just think of the post negative thoughts. And I never cry I usually just avoid my feelings and try to cry like 4-5 times a year. Before quarantine I was always alone and during it made it worse. School helped because I had some social interaction with people. But I told my mom I want to talk to a therapist and she’d ask me what’s wrong and I couldn’t find words to put together to explain myself. She says she feels as though I’m just looking for problems and that she already has all problems on her and would I like to trade places (single mom). I’m not suicidal or anything but if I did die I wouldn’t mind. I wish I could be like in a coma and wake up in a happier time. Why would I fake being sad?

170,Did you tell your parents your problems? Like when you have a bad day do you talk to them? How does that work? Do you tell them things when you realize you have a medical issue has just gotten worse all of a sudden and emotionally breaking even more? Is there an age that is no longer appropriate if you vent to them? Curious. I got a memory recently about a time I found it odd at age 20 long long ago when a doctor wanted my parents to be with me in a medical office because of something rare I just discovered that I had. I think my doctor was angry that I didn’t want to listen and do certain testing. I told that doctor that I’m over 18 &amp; got so hurt. Just curious how involved parents are suppose to be &amp; until what age do you have them around for any support. I get that my doctor thought I was being immature etc. &amp; didn’t care or realize how bad something was &amp; I was offended that he asked to speak to my parents. He said that “someone should be with me”. I try my best not to tell my parents anything at 24. Sorry for my really odd and awful questions but thx for answering.,12Aug2020,1

I've never had an episode like this before, the previous worst being last Christmas break from work when I think because I was home too much I was alone with my thoughts for too long and every night like clockwork around 9-10 all my mind could do is ponder time and our impending mortality. I currently don't have anything diagnosed though I'm sure I've always had a mild depression I could function with. (Imagine me as a male April Ludgate from parks and rec.) There was nothing leading up to this episode, not really stressed out from the news, works been fine, family is fine, my dog is fine, been playing a good new game and getting to finally get good workouts in. The only thing I can guess that might be a cause was too many hits off my thc pen.

My old psychiatrist straight up told me to shoot lower and not bother to get my Master's degree or be a social worker like I'm in school for.

I feel terribly uncomfortable when I hug or when I think of hugging someone. However, I find it cute when others hug.

My parents (especially my mum) is always trying to hug me but I never let her do it. The only time I don't feel weird hugging someone when I'm not very close to the person (like, I feel relatable but not close for me to consider them as friends: like a teacher or my idols), nor when I totally like everything about them (like a lover) and when it's a character of a story/film. (I know this sounds a little bit non-sense). My psychology said that it could've been either trauma (if it did happen, I don't remember) or it's just my mind being weird.

181,"I saw this sub i realised my problems aren't that big. Kudos to people fighting through hell. You guys are amazing

I am just going to leave my story here because I feel like shit and I don't have anyone else to talk to

My girl friend broke up with me as soon as the lockdown started, we were in our respective  homes, so this happened over a phone call and texts. It was early April, I thought it was a April fools prank. that night I wailed, I wailed the strongest sharpest and most silent scream I ever had. I felt my heart was being ripped out, I felt seperated from myself. things have been really fucked up internally since. Few weeks later during on going pandemic I lost my job, that hit me like a truck, they are temporarily reducing work hours, pay cuts (as high as 90%) and in my case suspending till things get back to normal wich yet haven't. I am grateful that I still live my parents so it wasn't that bad, my mother owns a small business which too was closed up. 

I have been trying to make myself better this lockdown, work on myself, I have had some success but today it was just tiring, there is just so much to do, so much to study, so many things I feel like I need ro improve on because I feel like shit. I hate it. But I just feel so beaten down I don't feel like doing anything. This is just so much uncertainty in the world right now, feel like my whole nation (which isn't US) is going to dog shit.

I get instantly overwhelmed and anxious when its time to ""people"".  Anyone else?  

Its like an instant feeling of not fun, nervousness, social anxiety, awkwardness and confusion. I feel bad because although I want to see my family (sometimes), I just hate making plans.  

Getting outside to buy groceries is hard enough, and I was kind enough to offer a place to sleep for my sister thinking she would refuse but she accepted, so now I will have 3 people in my tiny 1 bedroom apartment realizing I have accepted literally what everyone else wants to do for my borthday but me.",12Aug2020,1
188," 

To give you some background I've been suffering from depression and anxiety disorder for over 10 years now.  My grandmother is very old so my dad wanted to organize a family long weekend. This side of my family lives far away and we are not close... They are more like strangers to me, to be honest. They have very different views and ways of living than me. Usually, because any kind of holiday is a source of a lot of anxiety for me but since my grandmother wanted all of us to be there I agreed to go. I had only one ask/condition - to have room to stay in. There is not a lot of space in this house so I told my dad I have no problem getting a hotel room I would just need someone to drive me there for the night. He wanted us to all be in one place. I proposed I can stay in a tent (there is a lot of space in the garden) but he said that there is no need that in the worst case I'll have to share a room with my sister and I said ok.  I need my own room because of my anxiety. I get overwhelmed, I get panic attacks also to get here I had to get up at 4 to take a 9-hour train ride so I knew I will need to take a nap after I get here or go to sleep early in the evening.   So I got here... And I'm sleeping in the living room... With 6 other people. I have no space for myself.  And this place is also a mess. So I'm exhausted and will not be able to go to sleep until everyone else goes to sleep and that will probably be very late. I'm very anxious and just wish I could leave. But I'm stuck here for the next 5 days. .... So I needed to vent because there is no one I can talk about this. They would think I'm just being difficult and should get over it. I wanted someone that understands what anxiety and panic attacks actually feel like. So yeah it feels better to share.

189,"They wonder why I don't like to go outside, but they kept me indoors my whole life barely ever letting me go outside to do normal stuff like play with other kids, which I was allowed to do (and I'm not exaggerating) less than 10 times in my whole life. They wonder why I'm antisocial, again, never allowed to be outside around people my age. They wonder why I get anxiety and nervous while making decisions, yet I was never allowed to make them growing up and if the decision I made was ""wrong"" the looks and the things they would say to me were scarring. They wonder why I don't trust them with anything, when a couple of years ago I told my mom that I was very sure I had ADHD (which I still think I do have), she brushed it off as me just finding excuses for starting to have worse performances at school, which happened because everytime I would do something wrong my mom would tear down any confidence had, from kindergarten all the way up to 9th grade, eventually leaving me depressed and hating every inch of my body. Eventually I got her to realize I was serious, she called her aunt, a psychologist, to see if she knew someone we could go to, but she wasn't home at the moment, so she never spoke about it again. My dad wonders why I don't get relationship advice from him, but it seems he forgot he spent 7 years cheating on my mom, leaving me with a lot of trust issues and more depression that still are with me.

I have no family, I cut them off and now I’m realizing I’m the problem. Yeah my mom is addicted to drugs and was not the best mother and was abusive but I was a shitty kid and teenager always skipping school to hang with my friends and smoke weed. I’ve been depressed as long as I can remember. I’m engaged to someone I don’t even know if I like anymore, I know I’m an awful spouse and jealous and insecure but he can be very mean and cold. I just wanted to be a family and have a baby but I would be the worst mother ever, that baby would end up hating me too. 

I have no friends and the people who try and be my friends I push them away. I have no high school diploma and will never have a good career.

When I was younger I was hurting and I took it out in other people and did and said awful things to people and I feel so bad and I can’t even say I’m sorry 

My life feels like it’s the worst thing to ever exist, I feel like such a shitty human and unlovable and worthless but I’m too scared to do anything about it.

Then right now I'm feeling happy for no reason I don't understand who whas that one hour ago. like who tf was that. That ain't me. Or is it and this isn't me. 

Like what should my life goal be. I can't decide shit. I can't even agree shit with myself about what I want for two days let alone a week or more. 

Sometimes I feel like multiple persons are trapped in me. One that is on his way to slowly destroy me and the other one ain't normal but at least not constantly trying to destroy me.

I started therapy but it takes time to get into the right departement where they can help me. 

The psychologist where I talked to first said I probably have some form of depression. Is it normal for depression to have those extreme mood swings all the time?

193,"Hello everyone, I'm sorry for this incredibly basic question but I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all the info available on Google and I'm wondering if someone could take the time to answer a question about my specific situation. 
I think I might have an anxiety disorder - I've always been pretty socially anxious, but lately (for the past year-ish) I've been downright terrified about things I shouldn't be. For example, a friend of mine invited me to watch a movie with her and it's been all I can think about for two days, I'm so nervous. I've been really scared lately that my roommate is going to have a psychotic break even though he's not showing any worrying signs. I can barely take my dog outside to pee at night because I'm so scared. I'm not trying to get a diagnosis on reddit or anything, I'm just trying to illustrate how strongly my anxieties are affecting my life and how desperately I'd like to find relief. Where would I even begin to seek treatment? A doctor? A therapist? A psychiatrist? How much should I expect to pay? I'm in Illinois and I don't have any health insurance. Is there even effective anxiety medication? Should I be scared of side effects? Will I be taken seriously for this?

I told my mom in 8th grade and when my dad came home my brother was grounded from video games for a weekend as punishment. This solved nothing obviously and the trauma continued until my senior year of high-school when I finally went to the police.] My parents and I got into an argument last night over my mom posting ridiculous articles on Facebook without doing research or anything. She even posts things urging people with my beliefs to kill themselves. I got really worked up and decided to ask my dad what my mom told him that night I told her what was happening in 8th grade. I laid out for him how the whole situation has made me hate life and I'm constantly suicidal. My mental health is horrible. I told him how they are fighting so hard for people they don't know with their posts on Facebook but they didn't do anything for me. I asked how a weekend punishment was enough for all my years of suffering at my brothers hands. My dad never responded. He read it and never responded. He proceeded to post on Facebook many posts talking about toxic people in life and how you need to walk away from them and their disrespect blah blah blah. So I messaged him one more time, I said that his silence answered my question. He read that too, no response. I proceeded to block both of my parents.

It happened ages ago, but I cant shake it 

I dont know who to talk to 🤷‍♀️ I know that people have their own lives to live and unloading on people that dont ask for it can become resentful in the end.

211,"TLDR: I had depression and couldnt take courses anymore, lied for months to my mom that nothing was wrong, I finally told her and shes mad, bo sure what I'm going to do for the next year.

I've finally got put into a corner, about 3 hours ago I figured out that I couldn't lie my way out of telling her. I knew I'd fail my courses basically since january but I never really had the courage to tell her about it. I finally told her and understandably she is pissed. 

Long story short first year was just awful. In grade 12 I tried really hard to get into u of t and I succeeded. I promised myself I'd try my hardest to get in and I did. I got into other schools and likely they would've been better fits for me but I'd conviced myself that since my Mark's were so high (normally had like mid to 70s and had a 84 average) I deserved to go to the best university. 

And boy I really set myself up because things really didnt go my way there, basically any friends I made just disappeared and my Mark's started to drop. I was hard to accept because I had told myself all through high school that a fresh start in another city with new people would've been my solution and enduring high school to get there would be worth it. So for my big victory of getting into u of t to fail was very humiliating for me. 

Just doing anything felt exhausting, I had gotten to the point where I was either forcing myself through sheer willpower to go to class or trapped in my dorm unable to force myself to even get food to eat. By the time i hit november i couldnt take it anymore and i just stopped going to class in general. I was pretty alone to say the least, all through high school and middle school the only real consistent people in my life was my family. 

So a year went by where i accomplished nothing and wasted money. I never told my mom, atleast not in a direct way what I was going through which in retrospect was a really stupid thing to do. And even worse is that out of fear of losing her and her not loving me I pretended for about the last 5 months that nothing was wrong. 

She knows now because I could lie to her anymore, as I was thinking of some grand lie in my head i was like enough is enough its august she needs to know. So there in lies the big question i dont really know where to go from here. I still like my subject and i still want to go back to university but I'm not really sure anymore if that is possible. I'm really only worried about September because I camt go back to university. Ironically the university that turned down my transfer was the same one that offered me a scholarship only 1 year ago.

213,"So I’ve been with my amazing girlfriend for almost one full year. We see each other just about every single day, text non-stop and all that. We’re both committed and totally in love and I have no doubt in that whatsoever.

Everything has been perfect the entire time, except one reoccurring issue. She has had a bad abusive relationship for 5 years and a near death experience, as well as a depressing childhood. She has a lot of anger, regret and sadness about it all and it triggers her anxiety almost on a daily basis. She freaks out and starts overthinking whenever she sees something on my phone that she doesn’t like, or if we’re watching tv and a female appears on the screen. She has admitted she is very insecure and I totally understand and I’ve been doing my best helping her love her self. 

The only issue when she freaks out she is impossible to calm down, she starts becoming suicidal on occasion, she’ll try and take drugs to help her calm down. She takes out all the anger and her imaginary thoughts that she thinks are true but they are all crazy made up things and she claims she can’t help it and it’s driving her insane. It hurts her that she does this to me, but I am a committed type of person and I truely have hope she’ll improve. We’re both trying to see what type of mental Illness it could be. It just doesn’t make sense the things she gets mad about, were 23 and 24 and adults so that makes it even more strange. She does have anxiety and some PTSD from her car accident in which her ex boyfriend purposely pulled the wheel of her car into a ditch and they crashed. Her dad recently moved far away and was never close with her and that also hurts her. We both feel stuck in our situation and we’re desperate for help to fix the one and only issue in our relationship. I plan on marrying this girl as she has the most kind soul.

And because of this I rarely ever have positive interactions with anyone because I'm always on the verge of crying or in a kind of lazy depression and It's making my interactions with everyone negative and embarrassing because I'm always, fucking, venting.

I'm a burden to everyone and I actively make the lives of those around me worse, none of my problems are solvable so I just end up getting all kinds of depression from the same issues plaguing me and when people ask how I feel or what's on my mind the conversation always goes to what I'm feeling, I'm In a constant state of dependency and I don't give anything of value to the people I love I just make their lives a little harder and make them feel bad, I'm basically a child again.

I just got banned from a discord server I made a lot of friends on because I used the venting hashtag too much, one of the mods told me I should've interacted with server in a more positive way and that I've been kind of poisoning it with negativity and constantly asking for advice and that the things I vent about aarevery dark and triggering and don't have solutions so I'm kind of wasting everyone's time and complaining and when I feel validated and seen I come back to vent again the next day

The problem is I literally don't have any positive emotions right now and can't interact with people more positively to make other people feel good, I can't just put a fake face on and talk to people positively when I want to kill myself almost constantly.

Now I've lost contact with a lot trans friends and my insecurities about being a burden to everyone around me have been amplified, how can I let the people around me know they're loved and appreciated and bring their lives something of value when I'm always venting and feeling suicidal and depressed?",12Aug2020,1
221,"I’ve been working at my job for about 8 months and lately I’ve been having overwhelmingly intense moods making it extremely difficult to do my job. I don’t know what my exact diagnosis is, because I have had way too many diagnoses in the past. But basically, the way I describe it is it’s like bipolar but far more rapid. Intense depression shifting to manic states within minutes. Each of those extreme mood swings can last days or as little as a couple hours. I have no idea what this could be. I don’t think it’s BPD, I don’t think it’s bipolar, and I can’t think of anything else that fits the criteria. 

Anyways, it’s getting in the way of my work, I haven’t been able to complete my shifts and have had to call out sick completely these past few days. I love this job and don’t want to lose it, but I have to put my mental health first. It’s a retail job at a large corporation so you can imagine I’m pretty disposable to them. It’s not a bad place it’s very nice, think along the lines of Starbucks’ corporate attitude, where they “care” about their employees, but the employees mean absolutely nothing to them at the same time. 

The work is driving more stress which is worsening this condition. I just need a break, but I don’t want to lose my job. Another issue is I have a vacation planned later this month so I’m already taking that time off too. I don’t know what to do. 

Also any advice for more immediate help on my mental health situation would be great I don’t want to go to a hospital but it’s not out of the question, it’s just the last resort for me.",12Aug2020,1

235,"Long story short, I have a long-term history of pretty severe anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I finally managed to get a job two years ago that is very exhausting physically and emotionally. I do not want to quit and I know I would be even more unhappy if I did. There is nothing else I would rather do.

However, right now, my depression and anxiety are spinning out of control with work occurrences compounded on top of the usual stuff and I feel that I am growing increasingly unhinged. I've started debating self harm and suicide again. I feel that I need to escape, or to at least take time to breathe. I'm afraid of what will happen if I don't.

Today I spoke to both my therapist and my psychiatrist. My psych recommended that I take two weeks off, and if I was told 'no' he would step in with a physical note stating the need for my time off.  I fear that if they know I am 'sick,' they will never trust me again and forever look at me like I'm 'crazy', or that my coworkers will see me as a burden since they will have to cover for me.

I have no idea how to approach my manager or my boss with this. I am petrified but logically I know I need this. Has anybody else had to do this before? How can I approach them in a way where I can imply the severity of my situation without giving details? Any advice for wording without completely exposing myself to them, or is it possible that I am better off being completely honest?

So there is this mother who has bipolar disorder, she has it under control with meds. She is very kind and too lenient when it comes to her daughter. 
Here comes the toxic part. The daughter is in her mid 20’s, lives with her mother, very immature, very selfish, always quits jobs so she never has money to pay board or for anything she needs. She relies on her mother for most things. She made her mother pay for her meal and drinks on her mothers birthday and did not thank her for it. Whenever she does get money (somehow) she will spend it on something she does not need (expensive phone, bags, clothes). Instead of giving that money to her mother because technically she owes her mother a lot of money, she decides to spend it stupidly. She never cares about wasting money and going into her overdraft because she always relies on her mother or even her brother to lend her money. She has no remorse whatsoever. 

I do not want her mother to be in this situation, I know this will not help her mother’s mental health but she is too caring and scared to say something. Something really needs to be done but I am not too sure what help we can get for her. Please let me know what we can do for her.",12Aug2020,1

They have ignored symptoms for years now, and this person has not been very open about their emotions, as in repressing a lot.

They are going to book an appointment for a doctor and ask about filling out an application to go to a psych ward.

However, they are unsure of how to tell their boss about this. They’re worried they’ll get fired for this, but in my opinion (since I’ve known this person for 7+ years and seen what has been going on, and how it has affected them.) it is for the best long-term. They really need help, and I am encouraging them to seek the the help that they need. This is a very big step for my friend, and I am so proud of them for realizing this.

I figured out I was trans when I was 19. I'm 20 now and I'm 5 months on Oestrogen and things are much better.

I really struggle with embarassment, dwelling and worst-case scenario thinking. As a young kid I always remember friends talking to eachother right in front of my face about my embarrassing stories in school, birthday parties, etc. My older sibling really loved to remind me how 'cringey' I was all the time. Got bullied a lot about hygiene, hair, spots etc. I was a bit of an on and off recluse and it kind of got me into a lifelong overthinking habit.

I had my first sexual relationship when I was way too young, I was 13 and she was a year older than me. It was not fun, she constantly told me how suicidal she was and that I couldn't help her at all but she kept drawing me in closer. I just remember we were either having extremely bleak conversations, or doing sexual things. I found out later she was bragging to her friends about the she was doing to me.

Around this same time I started developing just some fucking weird BDSM fetishes. I have always HATED them. They have brought me no peace, no satisfaction, no real pleasure. I have talked to a therapist and read a lot of information online, and they all say the same. 'You have to come to terms with it'. I have tried for so many years to purge them from my mind, or try and embrace them, and neither have gone well at all. It's just an endless cycle on intrusive thoughts.

I was such a pathetically thirsty teenager, but just could not shake all the anxieties I had when it came to relationships. I just cant shake the feeling I'm doing everything wrong. When I would be in a relationship I would just be so overly excited to begin with, but as time would set in all my anxieties and intrusive thoughts would just set back in and I just have to break up. It seriously pains me just not really being able to say why, it's too personal.

When I was about 15-16 I was always making edgy/dirty jokes, in that sort of Filthy Frank and Attack helicopter kind of way. Really was just a mask for how I couldnt process any of my own problems so I might as well see it all as one big stupid joke right? Fucking hell.

I was too scared to accept my femininity, I hated my body, my own masculinity and just having to be male. I just look back on every single moment of my life and fucking cringe.

As my mom lives alone (she has never gone on a date since - and never talks about why), I call her every second day to see how she is doing. Bear in mind that I live in a different country more than 6 hours' flying time away. So far.

Whenever I do so I'm reminded of how verbally abusive she is and how much damage and hurt it has caused to me over the years. She badmouths literally everybody. Her work colleagues. My sister. My uncle. Her banker. It doesn't matter who. Speaking to her is listening to a really boring monologue about the drama going on in her life and how it's all caused by other people.

To protect myself from hurt, I've had to learn not to share any details about my life with her. She will either criticize whatever I do on the spot or use it as ammunition for whenever our relationship sours next.

I feel obliged to call her but I'm not sure how much negativity I can take. I've grown tremendously over the past few years and rebuilt the self-esteem and self-confidence that she tore down through a lifetime of providing unwanted ""constructive criticism"" that was just more negativity.

I am not sure if this is the right subreddit for this question, but anyway:

For a few months now, I have been feeling waves of feeling anxious and have sometimes also self-harmed. In general, I am mentally quite stable, so these feelings surprised me when they first came up. I believe that part of it has to do with me still living with my parents. I have a very close relationship with them, but at times I feel like I am suffocating. Sometimes I feel like I am trapped in my room and cannot escape, like I want to scream but just can't. It makes me feel like I am not my own person,  This goes along with physical reactions (headaches, feeling sick, tension in my jaw...).

In some cases, I get angry at my inability to communicate my feelings when I feel it should be easier to put them into words. Simultaneously I don't want to bother other people too much by talking about my problems. So I also sometimes feel trapped within myself, if that makes sense.

Now, I would like to see a therapist who can help me deal with these emotions and find a way of dealing with them in a healthier manner.

My question is: Have any of you had similar experiences? Does this sound like actual anxiety (or maybe another mental health issue) or is it rather something caused by my current situation?

Sometimes I'm on the reciving end. It doesn't seem like there's ever a right way to address it without sounding like a pansy, and when I do, I feel like I did it wrong.

Sometimes, I tell people I don't like being touched and the first thing they do is touch me! I don't get it! Then I have to go through the whole embarrassing process of them seeing my physical response to being touched (widened eyes, reeling, etc) then they get weird about it and I have to explain and it's all very shameful. 

The worst part of being haphephobic is not being able to hug. People who regularly receive hugs don't realize how important hugs, as well as other forms of physical contact, are for mental health.

For those that do not know the difference between a narcissist and a narcissistic personality disorder is that a narcissistic personality disorder is when one’s narcissism disrupts your personal life. That is me, apparently. I am open to changing and making a difference.

I recently met up with this guy that I met on a gay hook-up app, who I had always admired from afar. He’s very handsome and in someways I am jealous of him because of his apparent popularity on social media. Instead of giving him immediate attention— admittedly, I texted back a bit later. When we were suppose to be meet on Saturday, I didn’t push for meeting and went to sleep instead. And basically, I was called out for being manipulative for doing this. I see how I can be manipulative.

Then the next thing, he said that he wanted to “hang out.” Because my therapist encouraged me to slow down on the multiple sex partners that I have been having, I did not make any sexual advances towards him. However, I had it in my mind that he would make some kind of sexual advance. However, nothing sensual or sexual actually happened. This also made me feel so insecure.

Now I am stressed whenever he takes a long time to text me back. I want to know if he’ll ever invite me over to his place again. He said that he had a good time with me. I don’t know if he really had a good time though or he was just being polite. We still text, but my insecurities keep me so distracted. He called me “boo” after I called him “sunshine.” I asked him what he was looking for, he said “friends or whatever too busy for anything serious and deep”

After sharing this with my therapist, he was able to pinpoint my narcissistic behavior.

Why do I need attention from these men ? When did it all start ? That’s the thing that stresses me out the most. I want to know where it started for me. Did it start with my insecurities surrounding my sexuality ? 

I want to be able to focus on my school and my education. I place too much attention from one particular individual. Why do I need validation from other people ? Why can’t I form the opinion of myself. Why do I rely on other people. The constant need for validation is too much for me. It really bares deeply on my soul. 

Why does Sex give me such a validation ? I am addicted to pornography. I have found that there is an addictive aspect and I don’t know what empty hole inside of my life that is filled by porn and masturbation ? Maybe I am stroking my own ego ? Pleasing myself in the only way that I know how ?

There is a possibility that I could be manipulating some of these guys. I don’t want to manipulate anyone. 

Lack of empathy is also signifier. I have so much sex with different men and my therapist says that I 
view them as disposable. Maybe it’s because I see myself as disposable ?

Grindr and Jack’d is very addicting because of the validation that I receive from these men. My self esteem is low and I need to find a healthy way to bring it to bare. 

The question is: how do I BUILD UP MY SELF-ESTEEM.

What must I do to build my self esteem ? My self-esteem should not be grounded in sex and men and attention from men.",12Aug2020,1

263,"Hi I'm still a bit new to Reddit (with a registered user) and I have been battling mental health for a couple of years now. I am currently 22 and have mooved different city's in my home country Norway since I was 17. For the moment I'm diagnosed with Panic Anxiety and depression. I also have a hyperactive thought process (faster doesn't always mean better) and am still waiting for my diagnostics to be finalized. On a daily basis I suffer from self destructive thoughts ranging from banging my head to mutilating myself with glass-shards. I know I don't wanna do it, and I know that I am not doing it. But I'm always seeing stuff like this, even when I'm closing my eyes. I was in a really intense relationship for three years (18-21). I've always been suicidal since, longing for the past in a haunting way. People say I'll find someone but fuck it's been such a long time and I've been trying my best. Right now it 1 am and all I wanna do is fucking jump the window. I hope days get better, but shit. I've always done that, waiting and praying. The hurting doesn't stop. I can't undo my past. I can only undo myself. How do I help myself out of this mindset? I know it's unhealthy to think like that, but I can't stop. I wanna die because I want to bad feel like I should and I don't, because I'm a scared pussy. I can't even perform a task as easy as climbing out this window and land on my neck. If I would dare to try and end my life I would not be here. But I also try to believe there is a reason why it hasn't happened yet, as if there is more to come.

266,"For years, I have had a constant war of inner voices in my head. I feel like I'm split into two people. I always had this strange obsession with being pure, perfect, an ""innocent angel"". Untouched, clean, and oblivious to the trouble of the world and the people. Then there's another part of me who just doesn't care and hates everything. It gets so confusing cause it makes me question my beliefs and opinions, not really knowing which one to believe. This has caused problems in my friendship were I would hurt my friends cause of it and out of panic like my personality I would switch and act like I'm innocent.  I don't want to hurt friendships or my friends but I feel like it's already too late for that. Then I just don't feel like I belong in my own body and I don't recognize myself in the mirror. Like everything about me is wrong and fake. I know this is a little sidetrack from mental health, but I always questioned my sexuality and now I've started questioning my gender. But no matter what I stick with it just doesn't feel right and I doubt myself. I feel like I don't know myself.",12Aug2020,1
268,"I’m really just not okay. 1/3 of my head is telling me to end it all, another third is telling me to help myself, the rest is pretty much me, and my body is acting on its own sometimes. I’ve been pushing this to the back of my head, but today it just can’t be like that anymore.

Today I went with my sister to get her stuff for college, we went with my little sister, I bought food for everyone, and everything seemed well. Then I got home and I was playing with my sister, and bam I hurt her. Mind you it wasn’t intentional, but that doesn’t matter, since I hurt everyone I care about in some way, despite me not wanting to do so.

I keep hurting those I care about no matter what I try to do right. I could be trying to just make lego with my family or some crap and bam, it all falls down on them and I hurt them. I don’t intentionally do it, but in the end I hurt them.

I’m really fucked up. I’m in a constant state of choosing between suicide and life and while this happens I hurt everyone around me constantly, even if it is by accident, whether it be physically or emotionally. I don’t care if I’m ‘just 15’, I shouldn’t be doing this stuff. I don’t even know why it happens anymore! Am I really just that bad of a person?",12Aug2020,1
269,"So when I'm all alone in my bed at night, for some reason I often like to lie still and pretend that I'm dead, sick, hurt, in pain or in a coma. I don't know why, but it kind of helps me to relieve stress or to, I guess you could say express myself, as I kind of turn my negative emotions or mental struggles into something more understandable and imaginable. 
It helps me sleep, and it also helps me be a little more balanced in my life, and keep my negative emotions to myself without it eating away at me. 
this is kind of a weird post to make on here, but I'm really wondering if anyone else copes with emotions or stress that way.",12Aug2020,1
272,"I’ve been numbing any emotions for the last 1-2 years. And have never been showed affection during that time. recently a girl that I used to like told me that she had feelings for me and just hugged me, she had this comforting lightness to her.
But Unfortunately, I didn’t hug back as I wasn’t familiar with the emotion, and didn’t know how to react. 
And the more I thought about her I started experiencing a tension in my stomach area. So I tried to stop thinking about it. 

That didn’t work and I started feeling, actually feeling emotions. All of the emotions that I have numbed. All bursting back out, every single one. All at once.

I feel sad, happy, hate, guilt, the need to cry, disgusted and angry/mad. 

But then I felt a new emotion that I didn’t recognize, the need to be around her. Wanting to be right there next to her. To tell her how she made me feel. But then again, all of my emotions are spiraling out of control. And I cry, I smile. I get mad, and eventually think of Suicide, just to make it stop.

With all of these emotions I just held it in for a while, Until I was alone, and then I cried. And couldn’t stop.

All of that tension on my mind. Just disappears. And comes back in an instant Mix.

How can I just let it out and not let it all come again. What do I even do?",12Aug2020,1

274,"Today I was feeling super down so I thought I'd write here. I honestly don't think it would help and I have no one to talk to so I thought I'd vent here.
So I've been in denial of depression for a long time now, it started 5 years ago when I was still in middle school.
I remember waking up one day to school and it just hit me suddenly. I suddenly was so exhausted and tired by everything. I never thought about it before. I was 13 and I think people at that age (or before) don't really think about it.
I was fine until suddenly I wasn't. My existential crisis started.
From that point on, it just started to get worse. My grades went downhill. My mental health too (though it only really got worse until this year). I started not to enjoy anything in life anymore. School was probably the most exhausting part of it all, having to keep up a happy persona, socialize, act like everything was good in the best of the worlds. 
So the year after that one, I changed schools. Just for your information, I'm not a sociable person and I'm a little bit shy but I can be sociable at will, it just feels draining.
I really thought the change would help, I've read that somewhere at that time, but it actually had the opposite effect. I now was just miserable but in a foreign environment. I don't know what I was expecting but I went through that year while staying strangers with everyone. I just closed on myself more. That was also the year I got aware of so many of my flaws and got complexed by them (e.g crooked teeth, self conscious about looks and overall style, late puberty...).
The year after that one, I started highschool and I honestly can't even remember that year even though it was just 3 to 2 years ago. At that point, I did the same thing. Acting like everything was good in highschool while keeping everyone away and not opening up. Not caring about anything, not studying, no motivation, no will power, no passion, no desire to live whatsoever. But I never thought about suicide at that point or ever self harmed myself. 
I kept a happy sociable persona at school, and once at home I closed up on everything. I couldn't even reply to messages because it felt so draining. 
And it just kept going worse, this last year, I couldn't even keep up the persona. I lost so many friends this year, and I intentionally (or maybe it was just me not caring) messed up my relationship with them. I even got asked by at least two teachers if everything was good at home (I usually was very good at pretending). My grades could have never been worse, I almost failed this year (knowing that I had good grades in the past). 
The last months before my final exams, I didn't study anything, and I mean it. With the whole lockdown situation, I was just staying home and I slept until afternoon and never attended virtual classes because it felt draining and I think it triggered some kind of anxiety in me, especially thinking about the teachers talking to me. It also was convenient since no one in my close family really cared. My family was never the really loving one with hugs and everything. I was basically a stranger with my father, my sister, and my relationship with my mother was kind of complicated (I would always seek approval from her). Occasionally, my mother would ask about virtual classes and I would lie my way through and she'd just nod.
I feel like my mother played a big part in my depression. She is the strict kind of mom. She was never satisfied by any of my results even when I ranked second. She wanted me to rank first, not forgetting that I have an older sister who always ranked first and succeeded in everything she did.
I was always compared to my sister and my mother would always rub it to my face. She would rant to her friends or our extended family how good my sister was in everything and then she'd joke about me being difficult or for example me never helping at household chores, which I did in fact help, but everything I did was always invalidated. It happened that some times she made up bad things about me that I did supposedly say or do, just to tell it to her family and joke about it. But I could never say anything about this, I would just feel extremely sad at the segregation that I was being put through simply for not being as good as my sister.
I can't even remember how many times I heard the ""why can't you be like your sister"" phrase. I even got told by her that I had gotten so ugly since my child days (this happened three years ago only once but I still remember it some days). There has never been some serious violence from her, one time (three to two years ago) she grabbed me by the hair and hit my head to a door but it only really happened once. I would get sometimes some hits when she'd get nervous at me but nothing that'd leave me with a bruise. 
Anyway (I keep getting distracted I'm sorry), all this to say that I was really tired to try meet up her expectations that I just completely gave up. I no longer seeked her approval (though some deep part in me still searches for that), I no longer tried to be like my sister, I stopped hating my sister, I was just indifferent to everything.
I really didn't care about anything, I developed sarcasm as a defense way. I'm probably annoying to talk to because I never take anything seriously and reply to everything with sarcasm. I didn't feel anything, though occasionally I would go through some down periods where I completely shut myself off, cry almost everyday in my room, and feel desperate and empty about my whole life. I'm in fact going through that same down period which led me to writing that huge whatever you call it here. I don't even think I'll re read it again.
I'm feeling empty, I feel like I have no future, no present. I have no relationship with anyone. I feel so lonely, I feel misunderstood and I completely fucked up my future. Any advice ?",12Aug2020,1
275,"I wasn't sure where else to post this or who to tell, so that's why I'm here. About a year and a half ago I started seeing a psychologist for my insane nerves. I went for a while and she said I have OCD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), and we worked on things to help with it. I continued going, and I felt really good for a time. She showed me coping mechanisms for my anxiety and ways to suppress or reduce compulsions. I had never felt so calm and my head had never been so quiet. I went throughout mid-2018 and most of 2019, and decided that I didn't need to go anymore in October. I made a big deal of refusing to go and saying I was fine. But now I don't think that was such a good idea. I know that sounds stupid, to stop getting help the second you feel you might not need it anymore, but I've always felt bad about asking for help and this was a big deal for me.

&amp;#x200B;

For the first few months, I was okay. But then things started going downhill majorly. My OCD has never been worse. My compulsions work with numbers. 3, 7, 12, and 21. I don't know why 12, since all the others are odd, but that's just always been one of them. I affects the way I walk. I tell myself I need to walk with every other foot stepping over cracks in the sidewalk, which results in me walking awkward and taking odd steps so that I do it ""correctly"", and if I don't, I feel this pang of dread in my chest. If I scratch my head with one hand, I must do it with the other. Everything must be symmetrical otherwise I mentally freak out. I think that why I like odd numbers. There's an even amount of numbers on either side of the middle number, if that makes sense. It's to the point where I try to breathe symmetrically through each lung, or walk with the same pressure in each foot. The worst part about that is that I can't control it. I bite my nails super short and bite the skin around my nails to the point that they bleed and I have scars. I also have thoughts of the very worst scenario happening whenever something slightly bad occurs. If we're driving over train tracks, a part of me genuinely believes a train is coming to hit the car at any second and that everyone will die but me and it will be my fault for thinking of that in the first place because that's why it will happen. I know it's dumb, but it affects my life more than you think. Coping mechanisms don't work. But that wasn't the main purpose of this post.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I may have depression. I don't want to self diagnose, because that irresponsible and biased. But here's my main problems:

&amp;#x200B;

Insane restricting and bingeing of food. Most days I try to eat no more than 110 calories and burn at least 200 (Don't have the energy for much more) but I'll go through phases of being ravenous and eating everything I can for a few days(I don't purge because I have an odd fear of vomiting) followed by days of fasting afterward to ""make up"" for it. I've lost 30 pounds and am constantly lethargic. Right now, I've binged for 4 days straight. I'll try to fast for 8 days.

&amp;#x200B;

Horrible sleep patterns. It's like I always either get 5 hours or 12 hours of sleep. I can't find an in-between no matter how hard I try. And even if I get 12 hours of sleep, I'm ALWAYS tired. I went to the doctor and they said it's because I have low Vitamin D, but the pills aren't helping so I don't take them anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Horrendous anxiety. It's so much worse now. I'm always tapping/shaking my foot or rocking back and forth or swaying if I'm standing. I worry and overthink everything, from school tests to answering questions in class to saying the ""wrong things"" at home, even though I have a great family. I've pushed away many friends because I feel like they don't deserve such a lousy person in their life. I still have friends, but I feel guilty for having any.

&amp;#x200B;

Trouble concentrating. I can't focus on anything. I mean anything. I'm getting distracted writing this and rocking back and forth right now. I feel nervous but I don't know why. I can't focus on homework, but my anxiety won't let me not do it, so it takes so long. I can't focus on watching tv, so I don't. I can't focus on reading books, so I read less, even though I love reading. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bad memory. Sometimes I can't remember what happened five minutes ago or what day of the week it is even if I've just been told. My friends made a joke that I'm Dori from Finding Nemo because I don't remember anything, and while I find it funny, I heard it could have something to do with this.

&amp;#x200B;

Guilt and paranoia. I'm not sure if this ties in with anything, but its something I've noticed recently along with the others. Feeling guilty for saying something that could somehow be rude if I think about enough, even if it's not. I'm paranoid about everything, even if I've done nothing wrong. My parents don't know I have Reddit, so that's tearing me apart, but I need to vent somewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Dropping hobbies. I love soccer and poetry and creative writing and comedy. I hardly do any of that anymore. I don't get why, I still love it, but I don't have the motivation too. I'm too tired or too sad.

&amp;#x200B;

Self-harming. I used to self hard occasionally before I started going to therapy. Now I self harm maybe every other day, sometimes more. I used to use scissors, and it became a compulsion to do rake the scissors across a certain spot on my arm 90 times, counting by 10 3 times for 3 times. They left large, dark scars that my parents are now noticing, so I dismembered a pencil sharpener and use that. I know its bad, but I depend on it now. It seems to be the only thing that calms down my anxiety, even just a little, so I can go to sleep. I currently have many cuts on both calves, my right arm, my right thigh, and my stomach. I hide them all with baggy clothes to also hide my body, which I despise.

&amp;#x200B;

Suicidal thoughts. I know this is the worst one and I should've started with it. But I think about it so many times a day. I have a plan, but I haven't prepared or anything. I won't go into detail. Right now I'm at a point that I'm a little worried one breakdown would push me over the edge, but I don't want to allow myself to be so fragile. I wouldn't mind if I went to sleep and didn't wake up tomorrow. I'm so tired of life most days, but I don't want to inconvenience my family with the guilt that they could've done something. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want or think I'll go back to therapy. My parents think I'm fine and happy, I don't want to ruin that. If you reply, thanks so much and if you feel the same, I genuinely hope things get better and feel free to talk to me. I know I'm a stranger, but sometimes it's better to talk to someone you'll never see in real life as opposed to a friend or family member. I won't say my age, but I'm young. Under eighteen, so I can't pay for any mental services myself.",12Aug2020,1
277,"My father gets drunk every night before bed, he is 77. Just today he got drunk, fell and busted his head open. He seems to be okay but the ambulance took him to the hospital.

278,"Worrying too much?

Is it okay to be worried about a friend? I met him/her two years ago and we didn’t talk too much to each other until this year. A month ago he/she told me he/she was going abroad to US. The first thing that I thought was I would never be more closer to him/her after he came from US. In case I didn’t see him/her, I wrote him/her a letter remembering the first time I met him/her, all the good moments and suggesting my availability.


After that, I had a terrible depression that made me cry every night and ate less and sometimes, more. I couldn’t ask for help because all my friends were studying for the exam to access university, then I decided to wait. 


The day in which my friends finished the exam, I wanted to meet with him/her at any time. The first time I saw him/her, I was embarrassed. I didn’t want to look too much to his/her face and I was uncomfortable. In that meeting, we were with another friend and I talked more with him. Also, I asked the boy/girl who was going abroad if he/she was going to US and he/she answered yes, because before doing the exam to access university he/she told me no; and my face changed me completely.



Days later, I met with him/her, alone. It was the first time and I was super nervous. It wasn’t as I was thinking because he/she didn’t talk a lot in that meeting, in which I did a lot of questions and I wasn’t feeling comfortable asking too many questions.


Anyway, we met another day again, that was the last week of July. That meeting was a little bit better. We ate at the McDonalds and he/she asked me questions, that in somehow I was surprised and I didn’t ask him/her too many questions. That was the last meeting in which I saw him/her alive. In case I didn’t see him/her more, I told him/her I would miss him/her and I loved him/her, I didn’t tell that as a long sentence so I told that individually. The first sentence he/she told me he/she wasn’t thinking about it because he/she was going to start crying. And the last one, I told that “I love you” at the moment when we were saying goodbye, I didn’t hear what he said. And that was frustrating. Then, I saw him/her going to the bus stop and I wanted to repeat the “I love you” part, but he/she went running because he/she was going to miss the bus and I didn’t get the chance. 


Now, we chat. Not often, but we chat. I’m afraid he/she doesn’t want to talk with me after that last sentence. Afraid to lose all that we get in our friendship. Afraid not to keep in touch with him/her.
