0," Many of us pretend to be happy at some point in time or another. Maybe we're just having a bad day and so we put on a smile and pretend in order to keep those around us happy. 

 After all, you're not only pretending to be happy but you're hiding your true feelings and your true experiences from them and those are also going to play a role in how you feel and how you interact with the people in your life.  


It's okay to cry, it's okay feel sad, it's okay to feel lonely.  


Everything you feel in this world is valid. Be kind to yourself ☺️",06Nov2020,1
1,"I’m currently only on 2 medications and they have different colors on the inside of their caps. Does this mean something? I’m beginning to study to be a pharmacy technician and I’ve not learned about this yet so I figured I would ask here since they are medications for my mental illness.
Fluoxetine has a white cap, quetiapine has a red cap.
Is this because the one with the red cap makes me extremely tired? Is it due to OD or addiction potential? I’m in Texas, I know different states have different rules around medication packaging.
The caps are both white on the top/outside, but one has a red inside, to clarify. They look the same from the outside but I usually flip the caps upside down to bypass the child safety lock thing since I don’t live with children, that’s when I noticed the difference in color.
Any input would be appreciated, sate my curiosity and also teach me something I need to know for my class :)",06Nov2020,1

4,"Example : There’s this redditor I got into a debate with some times ago, he ended up calling me a moron and mocked me. 

That really pissed me off and the fact that this redditor was apparently someone who was pretty smart (he had a lot of reasonable opinions and seemed to know a lot about politics and economics), I don’t dismiss his comment the same way I would dismiss a comment made by someone who is obviously a 14-year old or a neo-nazi.

But it turned me insane : I keep thinking about this redditor day and night cuz I want him to change his mind and to admit that he was wrong when he called me a moron. I ended up creating different accounts to taunt him, he ended up blocking whatever 1-day old account was talking to him.

He’s not the only redditor I got obsessed with. Sometimes I will do an all-nighter arguing with a stranger about something political on reddit, hoping I get the final word. 

When I stop the political argument and let the other have the last word, it will stay in my mind for days. Sometimes I can't enjoy watching a movie because I'm thinking about what the other online stranger will answer to what I've told him. It's insane.

Why am I so obsessed with things like this ? It’s disturbing. My guess is : maybe because the coronavirus lockdown has given me too much free time, to the point where I try to fill my mind with something. What do you think ?

EDIT : Also, what I don’t understand is that I‘m a very selfish person who does a lot of shameful (but not illegal, don’t worry) things, so why would I care about the state of the world ? And yet, I do. Or, at least, I pretend to. It doesn’t make sense. I think it might be an obsession to fill a void.",06Nov2020,2

Current - I am at my worst right now both physically and mentally. Because of the pain im in and the way it increases i cant do almost anything right now. Mentally im very depressed and anxious. My physical health has been regressing this last month and my pain has increased so much that i am feeling like ending it is the only good option.

I dont know if i should tell her or not because rhe first time i brought this up she said to try not to talk to her about that one toxic feeling because it affects her to. Its getting worse and im not sure if i should tell her or not. Im nkt sure i will do anytning but truthfilly im terrified. I dont want to hurt her and i dont know if it would to tell her.

14," **Here 10 Bad Habits That Cause Sleeplessness**

* **FALLING ASLEEP TO THE TELEVISION**

Having a tv in your room looks as if a very good idea, right? Nicely, this is one of the worst approaches which will doze off. A television has shiny lights and noise that can affect your brain.

Even as you may think it’s helping you to get to dreamland, the lighting is sending scrambled messages to your mind. Your mind is seeing the lighting fixtures and listening to the noise, and it prevents you from going into a deep REM kingdom of rest. Meaning, you received't experience refreshed because you may in no way enter the recovery part of your sleep.

* **HAVING CELL PHONES AND COMPUTERS NEAR BED**

Every other trouble that is tremendous in our day and age is a mobile telephone near the mattress. These little gadgets have replaced the alarm clock and house phone, however, are they inflicting extra harm than proper? Cellular telephones emit a mild as a way to mess together with your circadian clock rhythm.

If the cell cellphone is more than 5 feet from your mattress, you then are secure. However, the general public keeps it within an arm’s length from them always. While your circadian clock rhythm receives out of whack, then your frame gained’t produce melatonin that facilitates you get and live asleep.

* **CONSUMING TOO MUCH CAFFEINE**

Caffeine is a stimulant that hastens your coronary heart. Even as consuming a cup of espresso or one soda a day isn’t going to kill you, it can preserve you up at night time. When you have a caffeinated drink too past due in the afternoon, it could motive  
Sleeplessness.

Part of your nightly habitual should include nothing caffeinated after 4 pm. When you have the self-discipline to cut these beverages, it might be useful in your frame. Caffeine is very addictive and follows the identical pathways as cocaine to your brain.

I (F19) have a twin brother who is absolutely awesome. I love having him around no matter what kind of day it is and that is great. However as I’ve grown up with him and my mental health has deteriorated from years of trauma, it feels more like I want him around but he doesn’t want me around. 

I also recently was told that he felt unheard because of me. I feel like a burden or a failure. I just feel guilty for even being alive with him. I keep thinking he would thrive better without me but not the other way around. And I’m just making this post to ask if anyone else feels this or if it’s just me. Also to hopefully help someone else who feels the same. Hope you have a good day and stay safe. 🌸",06Nov2020,1
16,"Idk if this is the right place to post but I just need to talk a bit about how extremely grateful I am for this man. 

When I did my bachelor’s dissertation, I was lucky to get my fave lecturer as a personal tutor. He’s also the head of well-being for my faculty, so I’ve had a lot of time talking with him about stuff. When I was doing my dissertation I struggled a lot with depression and procrastination and executive dysfunction, leading me to not doing nearly as much as quick as I should. Lagging heavily behind everybody else and constantly changing topics and angles and interests for what I was writing. And this man stuck with me with the patience of an absolute saint. Not once did he show annoyance or frustration, just gently pushed me and helped me figure out how I should do things. Worked with me and supported me in a way no adult in my life ever has, out of compassion. Replied to my terribly distressed emails in the middle of the night (why weren’t YOU asleep though mr adult man) 

I ended up doing my entire 9k words over a weekend, and when I was too exhausted to edit it in the morning I emailed and he said he was proud of me and he knew I could manage it, just go for a quick walk and then come back and slam that motherfucker together. And I did. I made it, and I never would’ve been able to without him. 

And we’re still in touch. He still replies to my emails when i tell him how we’re doing, even though I’ve asked him over and over if it’s ok bc it’s no longer his job to do so, but he says that he sees potential and wants me to succeed. I’m not used to this sort of compassion from anybody, without any frustrations or anything that makes me feel stupid or dumb like so many other people have. I worried he’d somehow end up taking advantage of me, but he’s not even been a tiny bit weird. I got a therapist as well now so I’m not using him for that sort of heavy stuff either. It’s just so weird to me that someone can actually care about me like that, but it helps me so much.

TLDR: one adult showing compassion and support for you can really help huh",06Nov2020,1
17,"A lot of mental health tips involve taking a negative thought and looking for the evidence for and against.

For example, I often think I'm rubbish at my job. You then look at the evidence, do I get bad performance reviews, have I ever got the sack, what positive feedback have I had etc etc

I really want to change and be different, but I have trouble believing the logic! Just because something doesn't make sense doesn't mean you stop feeling it. For example spiders are not dangerous in my country but many are still scared of them.

18,"Hi, not really sure if this is the right place to post this but I feel like having covid really damaged my mental health, I've just got tested negative after more than 2 weeks spent in my room and being stuck there was awful. I mean absolute no disrespect to people who have it far worse than me with this virus, I'm lucky I'm physically well and I hope this post doesn't offend anyone and if it does I will take it down.
Before being tested positive I saw my friends and my family, of course with a mask on, but i was still really anxious the whole time i was quarantined cause I was afraid they could be positive too because of me. My grandparents who are very old and already sick were at risk also.
But the worst part was not being able to leave my room and simply have physical touch (if it helps ""physical touch"" is my one of my love languages). Of course I couldn't see my boyfriend and I really rely on him when I'm down so it was kinda hard. I was scared the whole time I could infect my family and I had to sanitize everything I touched in the bathroom. Of course I did all of these things anyway and it wasn't that much trouble, I don't want you to think this is a rant, it's simply for you to understand.

But today, since I was tested negative three days ago, I went to a park, but now whenever i am outside i just can't stop sanitize my hands or I get MASSIVELY worried and anxious, also when I was to a restaurant I kept noticing whenever someone was coughing and I just wanted to leave, I felt so uncomfortable being in such a ""crowded"" space, even if there weren't many people. I feel so anxious whenever my friends ask me to hang out and I don't know how to solve this or how to deal with this, can anyone help me?

44,"I'm 15 and have been alone most of my life. My parents are divorced but I still see them but I can't stand being around my dad and I'd rather not do anything with my mom. I don't really have any friends or at least not friends I consider close. I was diagnosed with schizoid personality disorder about 3ish years ago but I'm starting to feel like it was a false diagnosis. Before now I loved being alone and didn't really have a problem with it. I still don't want to go out or anything but it's starting to wear on me. My girlfriend of a year recently broke up with me and it's probably been the worst thing ever to happen to me. I've had several family members die, pets die, I've broken bones and been sick in the hospital but it never made me depressed or upset. I remember telling someone at school that I didn't cry at any of my grandparents funerals (all 4 are dead) and he reacted with shock, so since then I've felt like I shouldn't even bother trying to be social because people find me weird or hard to communicate with. The reason I'm starting to doubt my Schizoid personality disorder is because I miss my girlfriend. She was my best friend and it's been very hard for me because If i never had any friends how would I know what it's like to lose a friend? I've been trying to talk with her a little but I think I'm just annoying her so I'm trying not to talk to her but I really hope we can get back together. I've never felt this way before and Its really getting to me. I've cried every night for 2ish weeks now and idk what to do. It's really hard because my dad is really hard on me despite knowing I have this disorder. Basically when I would go to my girlfriends house over the weekend I would tell them I was hanging out with friends. Now that I haven't gone out for 3 weeks now my dad always gets upset and yells at me about how I'm wasting my life and whatever and I have thought about killing him but I don't want to get convicted, although im afraid if i go through some sort of mental breakdown I'll end up doing it anyway. I've put myself in a position where I want to have people to talk to but I can't. I cant talk well at all and most people think im weird/depressing. I just want my girlfriend back but idk what to do especially when she doesn't wanna talk. I have thought about killing myself and I have tried to self harm but i dont really have a reason to. I'm really trying to stay positive but I just feel like my mental states deteriorating.  I've been talking to my stuffed animals at night and stuff like that. I just really don't know how to make friends or how to organize plans. I was in a groupchat with friends from school who I would hang out with occasionally but either no one uses that specific one or I got kicked. I guess i could find another girlfriend but the problem is my girlfriend had asked me out, and I have no courage to talk to girls, especially if I won't be able to talk to them in real life because of online school. I still don't really want friends but I don't want to be lonely either. I could ask any girl  out but I'm too scared and no one besides guys at my school really knows me. Plus I still want my ex back because she was the sweetest person and she actually cared for me which was completely alien. Thanks if you read the whole thing :) i just wanted to talk about it to someone besides my ex who gets annoyed when I try to start conversations with her.",06Nov2020,1

I was in an abusive relationship that ended about two years ago, and I cannot remember the majority of the things that happened. I know that a lot of bad things happened but I can't remember them. I only remember like 3 instances, and not with much detail. I haven't been able to remember for a while now, and at first it was unsettling. There was a lot of gaslighting and emotional abuse, and sometimes the fact that I can't remember makes me doubt myself and wonder if I was really wrong? Or if I really was crazy? I deleted all of my old social media after it all ended cuz I didn't want him to find me, but cuz of that I don't have anything solid (messages, pictures, etc).  I am in a healthy relationship now and I try not to dwell on this, although it is a bit unsettling to realize just how much I don't remember.",06Nov2020,1

48,"The past 4 years have been a living hell, ever since my father died in December 2016. Then a year after that in December 2017 my grandmother on my mother's side, Nanny, was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer she smoked cigarettes multiple times a day and lived in a house with asbestos for part of her life, she was in the hospital for Christmas, and it spread from her lungs to her brain and in December 2018 she died, she was a shell of the woman that rased me when she was in the hospital, I hated watching her deteriorate over the course of a whole year. 10 days after Nanny died my mother broke her leg and I had to help take care of her and myself until February, I had help but it was still hard. After that my grandfather's health started to deteriorate. Then I was going to a high school that most of my friends weren't going to, it hurt saying goodbye to them, but I did see some of my friends from elementary school again, so that's nice, I guess. My grandpa died in September of 2019. In February of 2020 my other grandmother, Grandma Susan, was diagnosed with lung cancer, she also smoked cigarettes, but also smoked weed, too. Then in March, Covid-19 hit and I was separated from all of my friends at school for months, I missed them so much. Then we went back to school and most of my friends are doing online school. Grandma Susan died in October of 2020, the lung cancer spread to her brain. I am trying to make new friends, but that dark part of my mind that hates myself is telling me that they are using me. I think my crush likes someone else . I just want a long term relationship with someone who likes me for the person who I am, not someone who is in a relationship with someone else and hits me up at 7:30PM, fuck that bitch, she got blocked. I want someone who will be there for me and I will be there for them. Fuck dating.

I (40f) have a huge issue that I am coming to terms with. I know it’s disgusting but I wanted to share anyways. I am from the USA but I live in the U.K. Here the age of consent is 16 for everything except sleeping with a teacher or anyone in power over you. I am sexually attracted to boys in their mid to late teens (16-19) but I usually fantasize more for 17-18. I know it’s disgusting, socially unacceptable, and makes me basically a p-do. One of my coworkers is a younger male, he is 17. He is tall, muscular, and I can’t stop myself from staring at him. I had a sex dream about him and I felt so guilty so I stopped talking to him. I have not slept with anyone under the age of 20- but I have sex with men in their 20s who look young and pretend they are 16-18.. I also would watch porn where a young looking guy is the “teen” and he’s having sex with an older woman/ watch porn with 18-19 year old boys. I have since stopped and I’m currently trying to find a therapist. I am also trying to seek men my age as sexual partners. What I’m nervous about is admitting this shame to a therapist. I am always so afraid of judgment. I don’t know what’s wrong with me or why I’m so messed up but I am trying my hardest to create a sex life with men my age who match my life experience.

53,"This is deeply disturbing to me and I promise I’m not proud of it at all but I for some reason I feel like I NEED to prove to myself and to believe that I have suffered a lot. I know this is a major victim mentality and that’s part of what I feel so deeply ashamed about. Self pity is the worst. I genuinely want to get out of it.

At the same time, shocking myself into reality and self-awareness, as I try to do often, by practicing gratitude and putting things into perspective elicits hugely painful and intense feelings of rage (and self-rage) and shame.

It’s about accepting myself as the cause of most of my problems. In theory I truly believe that and think it’s a wonderful thing to believe and act on, because it means you have control over your life. But in reality when I begin to believe that, I can’t stand to accept it, it’s so incredibly embarrassing because I have so many mental weakness and am so miserable, knowing it’s my own doing, I just... every bone in my body feels repulsed by that. 

When I read online or in books about people taking control of their life they seem to do it so gracefully. As though they have this epiphany which liberated them, but they do not talk about the crushing guilt and shame and anger towards the self that naturally accompanies that self-awareness.

Two years ago, I had surgery two remove a tumour in the appendix. Besides that I was fine except being mentally exhausted thanks to very poor health care.

Eventually I had surgery and since then I haven't been the same. Sad, Impulsive, sometimes off, angry, memory and concentration issues time passes differently, It's weird to explain.

Anesthesia was Profolol and Ketamine, Tramadol, Pethidine, among others.

My parents kept forcing me to psychiatrists who don't have a clue. 5 mins interview and heavy meds and off you go, every single time. Every type of antidepressants and antipsychoticos made me all those symptoms worse, much worse and you can add murderous rage and violence to the list. Every single time and they still insist on those charlatans. 

I resent my parents, and honestly I wish I could kill them. They deserve it.

58,"This was originally posted on the website Novni by me. It is unedited and was written during an episode (which usually last up to an hour) and right after the episode (I'm still shaky after the fact for a bit so writing still isn't the best):

I experience these weird episodes and I have no idea what it is.

It normally starts with losing most of my feelings in my legs/ going weak in the legs, then I start shivering and having a stomach ache. Sometimes, especially if I'm around people or talking/thinking about my past, I get a twitch in my neck.

I start floating a bit, not all the way out of my body, but enough to feel detached. Every once and a while, my entire body will just jerk and I'll feel shocked and go back for a second until the floating starts again.

My thoughts get clouded, and I'm somewhat aware of myself, but not much. As it keeps going, my hands and knees/legs will loose feeling, and then suddenly come back only to loose feelings again. This hurts in my head and makes me more confused.

I loose interest easily and become unable to put sentences together right (I'm surprised I'm writing this right now, seeing as I'm having one of the episodes, but it's not as intense right now. I can see how messed up my writing is and it doesn't read like I wrote it).

I don't know if I have some sort of trauma. I am transgender, so I already feel disconnected from my body. I had to grow up fast when I was younger because I hit puberty early, and due to dysphoria, kind of lost my mind and sense of self. While I was going through that, no one could help me and so I developed fear associated with not being understood or being unable to control my circumstances (which is one of the reasons the episodes mess with me so much). I have a good family and friends, and my only issue with them is that they ignore my triggers sometimes because they think I'm fine and have nothing against me in life (I'm in the closet about being trans) and this triggers the not being understood thing.

The episodes are often triggered by:

Persistent loud noise

Loud noises and things being too close to my face (which makes me forget where I am or what I'm doing)

Think/talking about being younger specifically during puberty

Having/thinking about dysphoria

Talking about dissociation or any out of body experience

Being told to do too many things at once

Frustration with being unable to read suddenly. I have no idea why this happens either. (episode just ended while writing and took my train of thought with it! From here on out in this writing I'm back in my regular state of mind.)

I haven't been diagnosed with anything, but my mom has depression, my dad has anxiety, and my brother has anger management issues. I tend to be a perfect mix of my parents and the opposite of my brother (we both have strong emotions, he strikes out, I strike in).

I developed a coping mechanism a while back where I would pretend people would come save me from the episodes, and I've posted here before about them. I'm pretty sure they're made up, but I am still figuring out that part. It doesn't help me ""put myself back together"" as I call it when I have to get myself back into my body.

I hope I touched on everything! I would just like some help because for some reason I don't trust therapists as much any more seeing as mine told me multiple times she hadn't ever met a kid that thought the way I did, and that made the ""not understanding"" trigger go off way too many times.

Thanks so much!

P.S. not proof reading to avoid triggering myself again, so you get episode me AND post episode me XD",06Nov2020,1

 He said he only let me live with him ‘temporarily’ fairly rudely. Of course I don’t need that negativity so I did my best to ignore it and not let it bother me. 

Fuck. Well... not the best situation but I just felt like he was rude and condescending. The bad part is well, I don’t have a room (long story) and I have like a partition with a bed. It’s a long story sorry... involving him moving out and moving back in. 

Well, the area had a poster that I took down. It kind of got crumpled. I was moving stuff around and set some stuff on it. To be honest I made a mistake. But he got confrontational and was condescending. Then he sarcastically something about ‘inspiring’. I know I need to save but saving can be hard but maybe I could cut back on the weed. I’m kinda anxious right now. Then he called me ‘Mr. Anxiety’ and I told him I wasn’t dealing with his crap and left.

A few months ago I remembered something I did when i was about 19. I was at a party in a local restaurant to celebrate the birthday of a family member. Pretty much everyone from my (quite big) family was there. My (at the time) 8 year old niece asked me if she would ever see my girlfriend again. We broke up about 6 months earlier and they where quiet close. Now I don't really remember what my response was but i gave her on a kiss on her head. I think it was something I meant in some brotherly way.

Now kissing as a good-bye and out of affection are totally normal in this family but in this case i feel like I did something weird and maybe this has really affected her.

Over the past five or six years I’ve been extremely suicidal and have had tendencies to self harm in attempt to feel something but about two people in my life know about it and if it weren’t for my partner I’d still be harming myself. There’s points where I’m so far into a breakdown the only thing stopping me from lifting a blade or taking some tablets is the fact he’s laying here beside me peacefully sleeping and that it would pain me to waken him.  

All throughout school I was put down because of the way I felt and I was made out to always be the problem and it’s part of the reason why I can’t tell anyone what’s really going; but it’s getting to the point where it’s really eating me up inside and it’s affecting my relationship with my partner.

i’ve always worked incredibly, incredibly hard and sacrificed everything for my studies. consequently, i have perfect grades and a lot of extra curriculars. when applying for jobs, i either get rejected at the outset (probably because the applications are over subscribed) or i get through the stages but don’t make it through to the final round, because candidates are marginally better - i.e. got a couple more questions right on the psychometric testing. even though i’m confident that if i made it to the final round, i’d really be able to shine. 

mentally, i’ve been forced to be resilient. i don’t really have any other option. i don’t have any good role models. i’m a first generation child and all i’ve seen my life is poverty. my accomplishments stick out like a sore thumb compared to everyone i went to school with. my family don’t want me to get a good job, as this would entail me moving away from our city and to london. so they’ve not been supportive at all. 

thankfully, i have good self-esteem for the most part. i owe it to myself. i honestly just feel like i’m missing luck. i guess i just want some reassurance that things do turn out okay, and they turn out for the best? i don’t know where i stand philosophically on this. 

part of me wants to believe things happen for the best. the other part of me believes that there’s no underlying reason to anything, and life is nothing but a string of fortuitous or unfavourable events which you’ll never really have total control over. sure, you’ll perhaps be able to control 90% of things, but the other 10% is just down to chance. 

sorry about this. i guess i just needed a vent. becoming an adult sucks. young people are under so much pressure. how is one to balance university deadlines, job hunting (whereby 1000s of candidates apply to the same roles), mental health and having a life, all amidst a pandemic?

I don’t know if this is the right place to put this so if it’s not I would be grateful if someone could point me in the right direction.

So I have this “thing” about myself that my mother is very worried about and wants to me go to therapy for. While what I do isn’t “normal“ and from the outside looking in I could come off as “not well.” I‘m a responsible and productive adult who’s not hurting anyone nor myself so I don’t think there’s a problem, but my mom is very worried about me and thinks that I should get help.

Ever since I was a small child I’ve always had a very “active“ imagination. While my mom did have a talk with me about not “playing pretend” in public she left me alone for the most part and thought I would just grow out of it. However at around 11-12 not only was I still doing it, when I made sure I was alone, I got more active about it. To this day my mind will often wander into “Fantasy Land” and I will run around, jump, and talk to myself. Hell, I did it twice already before writing this. I admit, growing up I had to work extra hard to focus because my mind would just wander, whether I wanted it to or not, but I was able to finish grades K-12 on time, I went to college, and I can drive just fine.

I just get so caught up in my fantasies that I don’t feel like I can help it. Believe me I’ve tried to stop but I get so antsy and feel like I HAVE to do it and can’t go a single day without doing it multiple times. Having roommates would often make me anxious but if they ever walked in on me, because I was studying Theatre, I would just lie and say I was practicing a monologue for class. Now that I’m living back with my mom she’s commented on how she can hear me, but for the most part we never really talk about it and she is worried. I think it’s because I’ve never had any romantic relationships before and admittedly this is part of the reason, but I’m not sure where to go from here.

71,"I talked with my partner a bit today following an argument about how it's hard for people with diagnoses not to pathologise themselves and to understand when a difficulty isn't them or their condition, but just a part of life. As a type A underachiever who is great at burning herself out by trying to 'fix' herself to an impossible degree, it made me wonder about what on Earth 'good enough' mental health even looks like.

Even someone at peak mental health will still be flawed, have conflicts and disagreements, do bad or unhealthy things - but at what point do they have the healthiest version of these flaws? When they accept them? When they commit to changing them? Both? Neither?

Would a mentally 'well enough' person still need or benefit from therapy?

It's very confusing especially if you're nuerodivergent - because we have no real reference point to what an achievable good life looks like in comparison to nuerotypical people. Autistic, ADHD people etc just get represented as eccentric genuises or tragic children. The wide, wide middle isn't really explored. It feels like we can't even know if reasonably contented people like ourselves even exist.",06Nov2020,1

I’m trapped underneath the debris of a home you broke .
Beat black and blue with the words you spoke .

After all the pain you put me through. 
People say I should hate you .

Remember that night I tried to take my own life and I needed you there ?
As I cried you lie in bed , to “tired” to care .

Remember those hospital appointments I went to alone .
Frightened to death with no one to phone?

Remember when you mocked my sexuality in-front of your friends.
“Stop being so sensitive “ was your way of making amends.

Your not sorry but I believe every lie.  
I forgive you for everything but I don’t know why ? 

You swear and scream at me , until I cry .
Saying I ruin your life , but I don’t know why ? 

Your sweet as pie in public and make me look a fool.
Put behind closed doors , you easily loose your cool .

What can I do to make you like me ?
Give me commands and that’s what I will try to be .



Edit: I am completely safe . I am getting intensive professional and medical help . I am in no danger whatsoever so please don’t worry 😊",06Nov2020,1
78,"Disclaimer: I hope this isn’t just a rambling mess.   I’m titrating off of my Effexor, so I’m in not in the best state of mind atm. 

First off, I’ve been diagnosed with ADD/ADHD-PI, Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I just got out of college, and am working in the first real job of my life. But, I’ve noticed that an issue that I have had all of my life, and especially throughout college has started to affect me; my timeliness. No matter what I do, I can’t do the things I know I need to do or even want to do within a reasonable time. I will say “ok, I have an event in 30 minutes”, and sometimes I will miss it entirely, or get somewhere an hour late. As you might think, these habits haven’t helped me very much in my job as of late. Getting to places on time is extremely important for my line of work, and I just can’t seem to cut it. No matter how much I plan, how much medicine I take, or how much therapy I go to, I just can’t force myself to do these things. I barely got through college, and I honestly have no clue how much longer I will be able to keep my employment. Am I just a lost cause? Do I have some other kind of disability? I don’t really know. I will say that I also feel tired all the time (I run out of energy after doing very little all day) , and I have this strange, needling sensation in the nape of my neck on and off all day. Idk if that had anything to do with my problems, but I feel like everything just started to really ramp up after I was in middle school.

TLDR: I’m chronically late, and nothing I’ve done in the past has helped. I can’t keep to a schedule, calendar, verbal agreements, etc. Am I beyond help? Why do I feel everything is connected to the pain in th nape of my neck?",06Nov2020,1
79,I'm overwhelmed with emotions of failure. I feel like a loser and am just mediocre in every way. I wish I could do something great at work but I can't think of any good ideas. I'm jealous of my friends who are doing great for themselves and I feel like I can't catch up. I don't even want to talk to certain friends because of jealousy and feel like they look down on me. How can I find little successes to be proud of at the end of the day? How do I get over feelings of jealousy and stop comparing myself to others?,06Nov2020,1
80,"I don’t know where to ask for help because google dosent have answers for this specifically. 
Sometimes when I go out biking or hang out with my friends, everything starts feeling strange. Like when I’m biking and I see a hill and plants, everything will start feeling like a cartoon and warp but very subtly. It dosent happen often, only when I’m outside. I know it’s not DR/derealization because I never feel detached or anything like that. I’ve used light drugs like weed and LSD but I’ve never had a bad experience either. Am I just blowing this out of proportion or should I seek help or something?",06Nov2020,1
81,"Graduated with a certificate in graphic design in May, but I haven’t created a single thing since then. I haven’t applied for any jobs or made anything for my portfolio, but now my mom wants me to make a website for her small business. I really don’t want to considering i can’t even do anything for myself, but she doesn’t speak English well, so I’m the best person she can communicate with and it saves her money if I do it. I should just do it, business has been suffering immensely because of COVID, and this would help my mom out a lot, and she wants it soon, esp because she’s stressing because she doesn’t know what to do now that we’re making like no money. But every time I tell myself I need to start i get so anxious and I don’t wanna do it. I just remember how long it took to set up my portfolio website, and now I have to set this one up for online shopping, and I’m just overwhelmed. My mom doesn’t understand and thinks it shouldn’t be hard because she watched like 2 youtube videos. She says understands if I feel stressed and she can just hire someone else to do it for her but I’d be a bad daughter if i let her do that. 
It’s not even like i’m so busy doing my own thing. I have the time to make it. But i really can’t get myself to start and I feel like shit.",06Nov2020,1

I messed up last night and now my parents are really sad and it’s 23:19pm and i have been crying since 9am. I’m really really scared of going to the hospital but i think i might be going tomorow because my therapist says i might need to stay a few nights. I’m getting freaked out and i’m just super fkn scared. I may or may not have had 2 pills already (i’m prescribed them) but my stomach hurts a bit now from it and i feel sick again.

85,"Every once in a while, a sudden thought comes to mind of my loved ones being sexually assaulted, screaming for help, and my powerlessness to do anything to stop their (imaginary) attacker. I want these thoughts to stop because I've become over protective of my loved ones and get anxiety whenever I have to leave them.

Personally, I feel like these thoughts arise from my constant feeling that I lack control over the circumstances of my life.

86,"Well first of all, even though the title probably sounds like it comes from a teenager, I am not, I am 24 (female).

I have a lot of social issues. Anxietys, I get mad really easy which is probably one of the reasons why I lost all my close and not so close friends. I am also self concious and struggle with simple things like small talk, meeting people etc. I am often extremely lonely until the point of desperation and wanting do die because I miss being social so much (even though I never had many friends anyway).

I think this and the fact that I struggling a lot with my self worth creates this defect in my head that I tend to crush really fast. Like, super fast and intense. When I was 18 I had a crush for the first time in my life and even though I never really got to know him and never had a chance it lasted for years. And it happened more times.

And it is happening again right know with a coworker I have known for a few weeks now. It is not as extreme yet but I can feel that I am again getting this feeling of affection and wanting to be liked by that person desperately even though I only had a few conversations with him that were not about work. And I think there were some hints that he might be somewhat interested in me as well (but I might be completely misinterpreting that). The messed up thing about this is: I am in a relationship (which is kinda complicated - different story). I am such a fucked up person.

It's really unhealthy and I know it. Those feeling are not real and I know it!! I tell myself everyday, stop it, stop it, keep distance to this person but my brain is working against me. I'll probably have a beer with him and another co worker next week even though I tell myself I shouldn't. It is so scary how much this thing in my head controls my actions. I don't know what to do.

Is there anything I can do to get control over those feeling or at least get enough control over myself to keep away from this person? I really need some advice. Thanks a lot for reading.",06Nov2020,1

89,"I'm 20, I moved into the ghetto after I was labeled 80% disabled by the VA. I was also forced out by my mother when I needed my family. They sat and watched me have seizures but my mom kind of acted like they weren't real. They've went away after leaving all the stressful situations I was in. 

In the Army I was happy, I actually went to South Korea. I had an unlimited network of friends and everyone just kind of acted like they knew eachother so it was easy. I was a paralegal, but eventually I suffered a horrible accident during PT. Three of my cervical discs are herniated and one herniated lumbar disc. A pinched nerve in each shoulder. And I basically have radiculopathy in my entire back and all the way down my legs. This made me pretty upset and it made me drink and I was addicted to cough medicine because it numbed everything. Before this I was at the prime of my life I worked out everyday I was in good shape, ate right. Right after this happened I eventually got discharged and sent home.

Shortly after getting discharged I met this girl who I decided to get an apartment with because I thought it would be easier, we got in a relationship and it tormented me but I couldn't just leave because I felt responsible for the apartment. Which we took from my mom when she moved out so her name was under the lease. And I suppose it didn't just torment me it tormented the girl I was talking to as well. Because I was just mean for no reason sometimes. But so was she. And we were just a bad couple I admit that. But the stress it put me under eventually I started having seizures with the pain of my back. Mainly after we got in a heated argument.

I eventually got away and moved in with my mom. She ended up moving all of her stuff out and into some new guys house, all while she was still having me under the impression we were together. I moved in with my mom and she promised me I'd always have a place there, and she'd help me until I got my VA stuff done and moved into my own place. So I stayed there and I tried to go out more look at nature. That was really nice. I never felt more alive and without stress in my life. And I met this woman I'm with now, she was sweet to me, and nice and before I had any money she stuck with me. My back pay for the military came in and my mom said that if I wanted to continue to stay there I should give her a large sum of the money, talking about in the range of 2k. 

My mom has never even taught me how to drive and I still don't know how to because she kept me for 17 years secluded and isolated from everyone and everything. And we argued literally every day of our lives. I spent days in this trailer just disassociating from everything. They would tell me that my mental illnesses are made up and that I should just say hey fuck it, it is what it is. And I did just that. 

Getting back on topic, I got kicked out that day and I had to find a new place, I eventually did. I moved in this place and it isn't nice. Its pretty rough. The girl I'm with now moved in for a little bit and shes from a rich neighborhood. Her mom kicked her out so I said she could stay with me. We lived here, tried to make the best of things but it just wasn't exciting here. She eventually moved 2 hours back to where she's from and she's STILL depressed from the experience while I'm trying to figure out what I should do with my life. Right now she probably sees me as some loser trying to teach her how things work. She tells me all the time how she wants to kill herself. I dont even know what to say to her I'm so out of it. If I don't find something to become exciting I'm not gonna have anything left to keep me going. And I don't mean suicide, I just mean I really am just gonna give up. Because all these audiobooks and meditation and everything everyone tells me to do doesn't work. I get closer to something and then its crushed. I just really need to know what I need to do to get back to the exciting me who made a lot of friends. I'm working on my license, but even now I wonder what exactly thats gonna do. I never talked positively before but I can't even be funny anymore, how can I pull this all together again?

TL'DR - I need to get out and make more friends and I need to be more positive. How do I do that?",06Nov2020,1
90,"I have OCD, so I constantly replay sentences that people say to me or from a video or whatever. My brain counts syllables, the number of the syllable must be one syllable itself (seven=sev, eleven=lev, etc.)

For awhile now, I have found it LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE to replay things in my mind. It’s ABSOLUTELY frustrating, losing control of my own mind? That’s supposed to be the one thing I CAN control in life!

It’s weird, my brain will literally be unable to playback, it causes severe physical distress, me trying to concentrate to replay what was said in my mind.

I barely read anymore because I constantly lose focus and reread to make sure I didn’t skip anything, because I could miss important information! When I was a child, I read ALL THE TIME. I don’t know if years of Zoloft and/or Trileptal damaged my cognitive skills, or if watching video over reading simply rotted my reading skills.

It is the strangest sensation, being LITERALLY unable to THINK. Like this sentence I’m typing right now, I can be trying to think it in my head, but my brain just can’t do it, it’s hard to explain. Often I’ll manage to form the thought/playback, but the quality will be degraded (doesn’t sound clear).
