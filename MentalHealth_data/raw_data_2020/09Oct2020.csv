0,"I‚Äôve just started reading the book ‚ÄúFeeing Good‚Äù by Burns, what appears to be a very popular book on CBT. I‚Äôve explored the idea a little before starting the book as well. But I‚Äôm having a hard time seeing how to apply it. From what I‚Äôve gathered it‚Äôs about correcting distorted thinking, like for example absolute/extremist thinking like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the ugliest person ever‚Äù, or filtered thinking like saying ‚Äúbad things always happen to me‚Äù when actually good things happen too. Sounds great, except I don‚Äôt see myself doing this very often. Most of the time I am just depressed for no apparent reason. There isn‚Äôt some event that I am having a negative response to. I‚Äôve tried different types of journaling to look for triggers or patterns and haven‚Äôt found anything. There must be others that have this problem. Is it just not the right approach in this case, or am I missing something?",09Oct2020,1
1,"Tomorrow is my last day at the mental ward I've been staying at, but... I don't seem to have gotten any better...

I was sent there because I nearly bled out from excessive self harm, as I've been struggling with an all-consuming addiction to self harm for 6 or so years...

My parents have been telling me that sending me to that mental ward is the most extreme step they could've taken to help me get better, the last ditch attempt to help me, and if I'm not doing better than it must be me not internalizing the help they're supplying me with at the facility... And to some extent, that's true... I don't remember a majority of the DBT skills they taught me, and that being the *only thing* they ever tried to teach me, I just seem to have thrown away my parent's time and money and effort like they say I have... I feel like I'm trying my hardest, like I'm doing my best to try and get better, but... I just can't seem to get over this...

This *must* be my fault, right?...",09Oct2020,1
2,"I posted something on r/OCD about troubles I have with intrusive thoughts/memories and repetitive verbalizations, some comfort words but many times words relating to self-harm/suicide (note: I do NOT have any true desire to hurt myself or others...they're just words/phrases that come out). Most of the time I say them when I'm alone and most of them time I feel I have control over them but not always. I noted on that subreddit that I most often find myself repeat the words or phrases to myself when I am triggered by a memory of me doing something shitty/embarrassing as a teenager/younger adult 5-7 years ago. I've worked hard on forgiving myself but I still struggle. When I relive one of those memories my whole body tenses up as if from a painful shock, but the pain is completely in my head. No real physical pain. 

Someone suggested that repetitive behaviors can be tied to trauma and I'm wondering if it's possible to self-inflict trauma somehow? I always kind of thought it was something others did to us and was very severe in nature. Not like my case where I'm the one at fault for losing my temper, doing something embarrassing or disrespectful to someone else, as a teenager. The biggest ""trauma"" I guess would be the rift I created between my self-image as a good person with integrity and respect for others and the reality of my true nature.",09Oct2020,1

5,"Hello friends :)

This is mostly a ""does anyone else get this sort of thing?"" type of post.

So, for more than a decade now, I have had a severe phobia of injections, which is the worst of all the phobias I might have. But the more I learn about it, the weirder something about it is.

See, I thought it was at least partly about getting punctured at all and maybe it is a little, but around 5 years ago I started getting ill and needing blood draws for tests. That is difficult - if I'm left waiting too long I will start having a panic attack regardless of how I try to distract myself - but I head on up to my local hospital asap where you can (or could in pre-Covid times) rock up with your form and get blood drawn most of the day on any weekday, and if you tell them about your phobia they'll do what they can to fast-track you if there's a queue. And the important part: *once it's done I feel super relieved and go on about my day*. I've had that done dozens of times now and I always get the warnings of a panic attack beforehand, but I also always feel (emotionally if not physically, since sometimes I faint) alright afterwards.

However, actual *injections?* Massive depression spiral afterwards. I don't have injections often, but when I do: massive depression spiral. I do have a history of depression, those old paths are well worn in my brain, but regardless of how I've been doing, an injection just kneecaps me and I'll immediately want to die rather than live in a world where I'm bound to need to get another injection *eventually*, plus the return of all the old depression thoughts about the pain and worthlessness of existence, etc, etc. Which is weird, given that my brain is pretty chill after blood draws, even though beforehand the panic levels might be similar between the two situations.

And so I find myself wondering if anyone else gets that crushing depression when exposed to (some of) their phobias. Or, given that my aforementioned illness indicates neurological bs, perhaps it's a very me-based thing due to physical issues somehow hitting my brain in response to getting injected ü§î",09Oct2020,1

ok but that's like 10 MONTHS AGO MY DUDE?!! i keep reminding myself that all i can do is let go of what was rlly just an unfortunate sequence of misunderstandings and yet when im not fantasizing about getting even i get lost in thought about the idea of her caring about me??! it's disgUSTing

i had a chronic illness that took a pretty bad toll on my mental health at the time, all she knew was that i couldnt eat without throwing up and i was drinking a lot (among other alarming behaviours lol), and before everything happened i just remember her trying to get me to eat, letting me stay when i had nowhere else to go

Like, it matters above all else that I find proof that these things aren't the truth. Because I can't bear the fear of living with the fact either might be true. Particularly the first. It would render me permanently inconsolably lonely and unable to love or form a connection with anybody.

Being medicated for my mental disabilities saved my life.  Im the best version of me I've ever been.  It took a few years to get my meds just right but it was worth every step. I take 8+ pills daily, if I miss a day its bad but not nearly as bad as being uneducated.

19,"I've always been supportive of therapy and would frequently encourage my friends or family to find a therapist if they felt they needed to. 

For a while now I've felt I should probably start seeing a therapist. But I'm still on my parent's insurance and so it would require speaking to them about it and I just can't bring myself to do so.  It's not that my parents are against it, my brother sees a therapist and is on anti-depressants, but I'm not close with either of my parents, and talking to them about this is difficult for me. I never really talk about personal things with my parents and for plenty of other reasons I feel insecure and somehow I've convinced myself I'll be a disappointment if I go to therapy. 

Some days are really bad and I start to build up the courage to talk to someone about it but eventually, a day will come along that's no so bad and I conceive myself I'm perfectly fine and that I was overreacting or that I was just making it up for attention. Which is also strange to me seeing as this is literally the first time I'm publicly talking about my mental health, so how can it be for attention? That's a question I ask myself a lot. I'm terrified of accidentally convincing myself that I have a mental health disorder and that in turn influencing symptoms I notice. 

Recently I've been thinking about the 'what if' of going to therapy and what that would look like. I think about what I would say and how I would explain how I'm feeling. I realized I didn't have many specifics to give cause I had never thought about my actions in detail. And so I'm trying to pay more attention to how I feel and act throughout the day. The problem with that is that now whenever I notice myself doing something strange I ask myself, 'did I do that naturally or did I only do it because I'm looking for something to be wrong with me.'

My boyfriend doesn‚Äôt know how to make me feel better, or what to say, and quite honestly I don‚Äôt know what to tell him.

I've felt this way since I was 4; at the time, it felt like I was watching a kid doing stuff, not me. I don't feel that way anymore, but I still feel like my body is not mine, as if I'm possessing someone. When I look at a mirror, It feels like I'm looking at a stranger, someone who I can't bear to look at. I think this is partly why I conceal myself with baggy clothes and masks; so I can control how much people see of me and so I don't have to look at myself.

Now and then, I get these sorts of ""attacks"" where I get an overwhelming feeling that everything isn't real, that there's another level of reality, and it feels like I was put in some deep sleep and this is the dream I'm stuck in. I think this is called dissociating, but I don't know if that's the right word. They normally happen at random or when I'm looking at myself in the mirror. I've felt these ""attacks"" since I was little, six to eight, I think. They've gotten less frequent over the years, but they're still a problem.

I usually try to escape reality and retreat into my imagination so I don't have to deal with the real world. I entertain myself with story ideas and interacting with fictional characters (I know they're not real; I just do this to pretend I have someone to relate and talk to). I've been doing this for years, and it's become a normal part of life for me. Imagination's more exciting than reality, anyway.

I don't know why this is, but I have a therapy session on the 27th (on the phone, don't worry), and I plan to tell them this, but I want to get at least an idea on what I have first. If anyone can point me in the right direction, I'd really appreciate it.

28,"Hi. I am a 26 year old single mom. I live with my parents, brother, and my daughter. (I guess my brother and I both failed to launch after high school.)

When I was 18, I left home and joined the religious community The Twelve Tribes. They are the group that are Messianic and run the Yellow Deli cafes (in case you've heard of em or want to look em up). I lived there for 3.5 years.

I left at 23. Since then-- my parents sold the house I grew up in in North Carolina and we moved to upstate New York.  When I left the cult I moved to New York and I dont have ANY childhood friends here.. I am so lonely.  As a result of being around bars-- I experienced a rape (not my daughter's father..before I got pregnant). A few months later I had a child. I have been in and out of community college. I drink too much. I am in rehab trying to get custody back for my daughter (my mom filed for custody after multiple domestic violence situations and alcohol abuse with her dad). I stopped smoking pot! Which is a plus I guess. But I started cigarettes a year ago. I smoke a pack a day sometimes depending on the stress. I've been a server since I left the cult but now I work for a real estate agency and I am trying to get my license! I love my new job! I feel like getting out of the restaurant industry is a big thing for me. I'm just afraid of real estate bc I hate putting myself out there (as much as I love attention--- it's such an annoying contradiction).


So that's a little background on what I've been through. I don't know who I am. I don't know how to be authentic. I'm afraid that everyone hates me and I think I secretly hate everyone too! What do you call this and how can I be more confident that I love people and that other people love me too????

32,"Hi everyone! First off, I know this isn‚Äôt a place for me to receive a diagnosis or anything but I would love to know if anyone else can relate to what I‚Äôm feeling and maybe offer some advice. So, I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, mild depression, and OCD in high school. For the longest time, I have always thought I had ADHD as well due to my inability to remain focused, forgetfulness, etc. I thought it was impossible to have OCD and ADHD at the same time because I didn‚Äôt understand how could I be a super-organized neat freak yet completely inattentive and aloof? After doing some research though, I found out that ADHD is often misdiagnosed as OCD, especially in adults and I‚Äôm wondering if I received a misdiagnosis? Or maybe I really do have both? But here‚Äôs my main issue: I struggle and struggle and struggle to talk to my psychiatrist. She‚Äôs a great lady and a very good listener, but I have such a fear of her thinking I‚Äôm just crazy, or that I‚Äôm just looking for pills due to the fact that I rarely make appointments with her. I come from a family that shames those who take medication for mental health (ridiculous, I know) and insist that I find ways to cope. And trust me, I‚Äôve tried SO hard to deal with things on my own. I stopped taking all medications long ago but things are getting worse. I can‚Äôt hold a job, I‚Äôve become so unmotivated to clean my apartment, get groceries, etc., the littlest things send me into a fit of tears...I could go on for days. Should I feel ashamed for, I guess ‚Äúcutting off‚Äù, my psychiatrist? Or should I put down my pride and set an appointment to explain to her exactly what I‚Äôm feeling, why I haven‚Äôt been present, things like that? Another thing I‚Äôd like to note is that through all my years of schooling up until high school, I was incredibly smart. I had no problem remembering things, I read all the time and could remember every detail, schoolwork was the easiest, etc. Then in high school, I became so frustrated with myself because I didn‚Äôt understand why it had become so hard for me to concentrate, so hard for me to finish schoolwork, etc. Could that have been a starting sign of adult ADHD?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

	You're likely coming to this article because you've found yourself **asking the same question** over, and over; ""**Why** am I not doing the things my whole-being wants me to do?"" I don't believe the answer is simple, and that it varies slightly for each individual.    


	However, I do believe people have in common is the ability to support each other; creating systems that allow us to be motivated by default- by the **general energy of others**. In the same sense we have few differences in the ways we try to work through this just-can't-do-it feeling; we dissociate despite how much desire- or passion we have for something. 

&amp;#x200B;

	It's my belief that **in our similarities there is a solution**\- and that solution is realizing how alike we are to one another- and implying empathy to do something greater than we are, while achieving what we desire. I know what you're thinking; ""Redundancy."" 

&amp;#x200B;

	To explain further; If we can understand the ones we are closest then we can **understand ourselves**; furthermore we can understand how some of the more successful people have gotten to where they are. My theory is that compassion and empathy will ultimately thrust us into a more savory position.

&amp;#x200B;

	1.	Ask the people you care about how their day was **more often**(yes, all of them)

	2.	Give people more compliments than you give yourself, and give to them more than you take. (when you can) inherently somebody will be on the weighted side of the scale; **understanding this is key** to achieving your goal.

	3. 	**Reflect on the things you do**, big and small. If you do something that doesn't make you feel good, then don't do it anymore. Vice-Versa.

	4.	**Humility** has it's limits, as **anger** does not. Keep this in mind while doing daily tasks.",09Oct2020,1

40,"This happened 2 years ago. It was my junior year of high school and I was in this early childhood education class. One day there were these 2 girls that went through my school computer without my permission. They saw some stuff that I was into that I really didn't want anyone in public to find out, not going to say here, but they found out about it. So I tried not to make sure that they didn't tell anyone nor accessed anything that I own. A week later they stole my phone when it was unlocked and one of the girls hid it in her chests and went through it. I didn't know what to do because I didn't want to touch a girl's privates and be ""callled out"" for it. I still tried to ignore the shit out of them and not take them seriously, and I was careful to not let them take my stuff. The final nail in the coffin was when they stole my school notebook and found out my sexual fetishes.  We don't use our school notebooks at all so I write whatever I want on there because nobody's going to see it. They saw some weird stuff in there (nothing serious trust me) but they were concerned about it and reported it to the school officer and I had a talk with him. While this was happening I was worried about what was going on and why he was going to my stuff. He told me that 2 girls went through at my notebook and I know it was obvious there was those girls that annoy the shade of me earlier. I had enough of their bullshit so I stayed the fuck away from them for the rest of the school. 
The thing was it was even over yet, I got a random phone number from someone who tried to tell me that the hair I was cute and I had a big butt and stuff like that in a still ignored them but I knew it was one of those girls. I told your fuck you and I said some very fucked up words that I'd rather not say here but they were pretty sexist because I had enough of her bullshit I wanted her to be pissed at me so she would never screw with me again.
I found out that when the girls went throughmy phone they stole all of my contacts and kept them. I saw them again during my senior year of High school and they apologized to me very casually about it, It didn't seem like that they were very ashamed about it and I couldn't take them seriously so I ignored the ship out of them but I'm still very angry and I'm still very upset about what they did to me. I wanna beat the shit out of them sometimes with what they did to me I feel like getting a jackhammer and hitting their heads. Sometimes I feel like calling them racial and sexist slurs just to make them very angry at me to show how angry I am at them.
I feel like a loser for not really standing up, I don't want to commit suicide or anything but I feel like I shouldn't have ignored them. It's been nearly 2 years since all that happened and now I just don't know what to do. I know it's the past but I can't help but think that they still have that info and I can't help but just know the fact that they know my secrets. What the fuck am I gonna do. This doesn't bother me all the time but whenever I think about it I just get really angry and I just wanted those feelings gone.  They haven't shared it with anyone, but I can't help but feel worried about what could happen. I haven't seen them for over a year but I just can't let go of it.",09Oct2020,1

background:
diagnosed with depression, anxiety, the usual. 
i stopped smoking weed about a month ago because of my partner who doesnt support it. 

nowadays, everything feels extremely off. my thoughts have changed, my habits are very different. this is mostly good. 
except for my memory. its falling apart. i have lost my job because of it, i forget what day it is, and even my therapist is concerned. i cant remember what i ate for breakfast this morning. i cant remember any important events from this past week. its like im doing these things and sending the memories right out of my body. where are they going??
but its getting to the point where im terrified. as i type this i cant remember what i was about to say. im never fully aware of what is going on. i do things because other people say i have to. my motivation is gone, im not suicidal, just confused. 
am i going mental?? i feel like my consciousness is shifting. i dont even know what that means. 

im not sure if i was dependent on weed or not, so it could just be that im paranoid. has anyone experienced this before? can someone help me?",09Oct2020,1
43,"In December on last year I was at my lowest point. Suicide seemed like a guaranteed outcome for me around then but in March I started doing things that would make me happy and improve on some areas of my life. I took up an instrument, stopped bad habits like biting my nails and not brushing my teeth, started cleaning my room, started working out (all in all I managed to lose 35 pounds since march), etc. 

Overall I‚Äôm pretty happy with the fact that I didn‚Äôt decide to take my life and work on making those improvements. However there‚Äôs an aspect of myself that I have difficulty improving. I develop obsessive crushes really quick. Not serial killer type of obsession but the kind of obsession where I start day dreaming about them and think up a whole life with us together. This has happened on many occasions and I know given my current circumstances it‚Äôs pretty much impossible for me to end up with anyone currently (I‚Äôm an atheist in a muslim household). I know this and I feel so stupid every time it happens and every time they end up with someone else and even though I knew from the start that would happen I still feel like shit and fall into a deep depression. It‚Äôs not a healthy mindset to have I‚Äôm really aware of that but I have zero clue on how to conquer this aspect of myself at least until I‚Äôm able to move out.

46,Obviously as like a 2 year old I'd pick my nose. When I got older I stopped. And now I'm 15 and I've been doing it for a few years. And it is embarrassing but I also continually find myself doing it and I don't know if it actually comes from my anxiety.,09Oct2020,1
47,"Sorry for any typos, I‚Äôm writing this on my phone. 

I constantly feel anxious about every little action I take when other people are present. This is with the exception of like 2 friends and my family. I know it‚Äôs probably normal to fret a little, but I overthink every little thing I do, even stuff like asking a stranger to press the button for me on an elevator. I feel the need to control and plan out every word or action because I worry it‚Äôll feel misplaced. 

I‚Äôm always insecure about myself. It‚Äôs not about my appearance (which is one of the few things I‚Äôm sort of confident in). I know I‚Äôm above average for almost everything I do factually, but I have no big achievements to show that I excel at anything in particular in life. I grew up as a ‚Äúgifted child‚Äù, learning to speak early, always being praised for my drawings or math or whatever else. I feel like it‚Äôs the source of my insecurity. I feel the need to live up to that standard of being ‚Äúgifted‚Äù. To some degree, the ‚Äúgifted‚Äù description is true as I tend to pick up new skills quickly. But, I lack the commitment and time management skills to go through with any one thing. I care too much about everything else to drop everything for one thing. I constantly feel like I‚Äôm striving for an impossible goal that I can‚Äôt give up on. At the same time, it feels like I‚Äôm not striving for anything because I‚Äôm not striving for something achievable. 

I constantly seek approval from others, whether subconscious or consciously. Whenever doing anything, I hate being in the spotlight but at the same time want to make it known that I‚Äôm very skilled at said thing. I think about every detail from whether I should raise my hand to answer that question or if I should push myself just a bit harder so I remain in the first 3 people when running. 

Sometimes I think I have commitment issues. I‚Äôm scared to tell more about myself to people because I don‚Äôt want to ruin their perfect image of me. I seek validation from simps on discord despite knowing that they just want nudes from an underage girl, despite knowing that I‚Äôll inevitably unfriend and block them no less than a day later. I know it‚Äôs fucked up, and their praise makes me feel like I can act like someone else for a while, someone who is photoshopped and perfect. At the same time, I can never commit to getting to know someone online, and often in real life too. 

It‚Äôs been a month from the start of the semester, and I think I‚Äôm feeling burnout. I‚Äôm loosing track of unread emails. I‚Äôm late on assignments. I‚Äôm at a new school and I don‚Äôt know how the fuck I can keep my shit together. Honestly. I don‚Äôt know if something is wrong with me. It seems so easy for everyone else to finish everything on time and still have time to watch stupid k dramas and anime. I always promise myself I‚Äôll change but I don‚Äôt know how to do it. I tell myself that it‚Äôll get better, that I‚Äôll change my habits and it‚Äôll get easier. It never does. I want to slip into sleep and never wake up from the void again. I have some history with self harm from when I was younger, but the same time, I‚Äôm too scared to actual damage for myself because I‚Äôm so anxious about other peoples perception of me.

The worst part is, I can‚Äôt even tell if there‚Äôs actually something wrong. Is it normal to feel like this? Is this a problem that everyone just has? I can‚Äôt even tell anymore, and there‚Äôs a lot of reasons for that. 

First of all, I feel perfectly ‚Äúnormal‚Äù most the time, so maybe this is just me being melodramatic. But at the same time, I know that that‚Äôs not true because I don‚Äôt just slip into these ‚Äúmoods‚Äù, this is just everyday for me by now, and ‚Äúnormal‚Äù just seems like a mask I put on to hide my problems. 

Second, theres such a culture in our generation of being a mess and being ‚Äúrelatable‚Äù that I don‚Äôt know if  these are real feelings. I don‚Äôt know if this is actually how other people feel because when I say these ‚Äúrelatable‚Äù things about myself I‚Äôm not exaggerating or being dramatic at all, it‚Äôs just what I perceive as the truth. 

Third, there‚Äôs an idea of making fun of teens for being edgy and depressed, saying that they do it for attention and etc. I know that this is extremely harmful to the lives of teens with actual issues, but this is the first time I feel like it has impacted me. I didn‚Äôt want to make this kind of post online to seek support because I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll just come off as ‚Äúnot like other girls‚Äù and ‚Äúedgy‚Äù and ‚Äúattention seeking‚Äù. 

All of these things make me doubt my own emotions and how I feel. During the spring and summer of this year, in quarantine, I finally felt like I got a break from the stress and expectation. Of course, my what I think is soci anxiety was worsened by this time period, and looking back on it now, non of that relief feels real. I invalidate my own feelings of happiness because it doesn‚Äôt feel real once I start slipping. Like a frog at the bottom of a well, I can‚Äôt imagine that the small spot of blue sky that I see stretches infinitely.

Are these feelings normal? I think I‚Äôve become so used to feeling like this throughout the years that I don‚Äôt know what actual normal is in my head anymore. 

I‚Äôm sorry this was long, I really just needed a place to organize my thoughts and reflect. Support would be appreciated too. &lt;3",09Oct2020,1

50,"Hello Reddit,

I am a long term mentally ill person who somehow gets by most of the time. My diagnosis doesn't matter, that's not the point. Rather in my two decades of mental health issues, I've learnt some things that I'd like to share. 

If you decide to implement any of these and are currently feeling depressed I highly suggest aiming to just do 1 of the things once a week (or something similar). Don't overexert yourself. 


1. Put shampoo and soap everywhere. 

In my many years of being ill, there's been too many days to count where a shower hasn't happened or it's happened much later than it would have for a healthy person. Because of this I've learnt to be strategic about where I keep soap.
Can't do more than wash your hands today? Have a bottle of face wash by that sink as well. 
Crawled into the shower and now can't stand up? Make sure there's a bottle of shampoo and body wash on the floor of your shower as well as up high (same goes for mirrors).

2. Upgrade your ""I'm dead inside"" clothing.

We all like wearing sweats or pj's, but it's not exactly the clothing that inspires success. At the same time when you feel like crap you don't want to put on nice clothing - it's too much effort. 
So upgrade your sweats into ""comfy depression clothes"". Go get some jeans that are super comfy or some Lululemon fitness wear that looks okay, and make those your at home clothes. 
Always wearing an oversized jumper? Go get one that fits well and wear that instead. 
These things can feel very small, but overtime their effect adds up. 


3. Meal prep when you get a streak of good days. 

Meal prepping for your illness is not for the day after feeling like crap. Wait till you've had at least 3-4 good days before trying as it can be a big task. 
What you're trying to do is fill your house with food that you could eat when depressed. 
Always nauseous? Great. You need to stock up on ginger tea, honey, and maybe saltines. 
Only want/able to eat junk food? That's cool too. Cook versions of the food and just over season them.",09Oct2020,1
51,"I'm 24, and I feel like I haven't accomplished anything in my life.. this year with all of the isolation, my mind have been hitting me harder than ever.

I still don't know if I like it enough either, so...
I see people I know at a similar age range doing, not much, but better, and I can't help to feel like a failure every day. It's awful and I hate it, but I don't know what to do.. I always had some suicidal thoughts, but with the isolation amplified them. I don't self harm or havent attempted, but the feeling is there, always. 
Also I don't live in the us, here the economy is not thriving, and I don't have savings at all so trying to move is not a possibility, at least not now.. my boyfriend tends to be really supporting but he always give me the same speech that I'm going to thrive once I get away from my parents, and I know that that might be true, but it doesn't help at all in the short term..

Are they really that egotistical? And what‚Äôs so bad about being ‚Äúinferior‚Äù anyway? Why do we put so much value onto arbitrary beliefs?

hello, my name is faith and i‚Äôm 18. i was recently diagnosed with bpd. once i was diagnosed, all of my symptoms started to make perfect sense. 

in 2019 i was hospitalized once in july after my boyfriend at the time broke up with me and i became suicidal, and again the next month because i was suicidal. everyone thought i had bipolar disorder, but now i know it‚Äôs just bpd.

i take meds (when i remember and when i want to) to try to keep my mood swings at bay, but it doesn‚Äôt help with the bigger problems that i face. 

if you have or are familiar with bpd, you may know that people with bpd can sometimes (but not all the time!) have a ‚Äúfavorite person.‚Äù for borderlines, this is not just a person that you really like a lot. it‚Äôs a person that your whole mindset, mood, thoughts, etc. revolves around. i thought i learned how to harness that, but in reality i just learned how to suppress it. about 7 months ago i got into a relationship with this guy who is truly amazing, and he very quickly became my ‚Äúfavorite person.‚Äù at first it was very easy for me to ‚Äúharness‚Äù or suppress my overly strong feelings for him, (that‚Äôs another one of my big struggles. i feel so much emotionally that it becomes painful to think about the things that make me happy, like my boyfriend.) but after 7 months of pretending they weren‚Äôt there, i just can‚Äôt do it anymore. i love him so much. and because i love him so much, he is the person i am most afraid of losing. the thought of losing him is all that i think about. 

i‚Äôm coming here because nobody understands it. not my boyfriend, not my mom, my friends, even my therapist and my psychiatrist. 

yesterday, i was at work, so was my boyfriend. he didn‚Äôt text me when he got to work like he usually does, so i was afraid he died. i went to the bathroom and looked up car accidents in my state to see if there were any recent ones because i was worried he had gotten into one and died. i thought about going to his funeral, that if he died i wouldn‚Äôt be able to survive it. i cried for about 2 minutes, texted him a few times and went back to work. (luckily for me, he doesn‚Äôt mind that i‚Äôm ‚Äúclingy‚Äù like that. he actually likes it so that‚Äôs a win-win lol.) eventually he did answer me and told me he was okay and that he was just at work. so at that point, i knew that he was alive, so i had to find another thing to worry about. so the next thing that popped into my head was that he was cheating on me. 

nothing is ever okay in my head, i always need to find something to worry about, even if it isn‚Äôt real. 

i just thought about it all day and when i got home from work i was able to avoid breaking down for a few hours before i realized he hadn‚Äôt called me on his drive home from work like he usually did at this time. his work closes at around 8pm. it was 9:30. so i thought he had to be cheating on me or at least hiding something from me. and that‚Äôs when i broke down. i was in hysterics. i felt so heartbroken despite having little to no evidence that he was cheating on me (and for the record, i never had any evidence. he has consistently reassured me that he loves me and is loyal and even spoke to me about moving in together when he has enough money. even my parents who are very good judges of character believe that he‚Äôs a good guy.) however, i also was breaking down because part of me knew it wasn‚Äôt true, and i was so angry that i always have to worry myself over things that aren‚Äôt even real. turns out he just had to work late and clean up after closing. after i talked to him that night i felt better. 

the next day i went to work and asked him if he would text me whenever he has any free time just to say hello so i know he‚Äôs okay. he was totally fine with doing that and called me after he got off and we talked for a little while and then we hung up. suddenly i started thinking about him cheating on me again, and i‚Äôm so afraid to ask him about it because, while he usually doesn‚Äôt mind me asking, i imagine it can get a little annoying when i ask him every day. so i just kind of sat there thinking about why i am the way that i am. when i tell my mom or my best friend or even my boyfriend about my worries, they‚Äôre just like ‚Äúfaith you‚Äôre being ridiculous, stop worrying about it.‚Äù as if it‚Äôs just that easy. even my therapist is like ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need to be thinking like this.‚Äù which is true, but it‚Äôs not like i didn‚Äôt already know that. it‚Äôs just not something i need to hear because i already know ‚Äúthese thoughts aren‚Äôt productive.‚Äù i think what i need is some advice from someone who understands what i‚Äôm going through. so i remembered that reddit basically has a subreddit for everything, and now i‚Äôm here. so if anyone is still reading this, please, if you have anything that you think may be helpful, whether it is advice or empathy, please please give me some feedback. i just hate living like this all the time. i feel like i‚Äôm losing my mind because i get so sad about it that i dissociate and think super morbid thoughts that scare me and i just am not sure what to do.",09Oct2020,1

I always think about how I can't leave my mom alone as we're an immigrant and no family members in this country. I'M SO SCARED TO DIE. :(

She kept everything the house, the car, and the savings. His mom has days to weeks. He lost his job.

I would go to his house nearly everyday to spend time with him, because I knew he was lonely. He began verbally and mentally abusing me, but I shut up, because I knew he was ill and I wanted to be understanding. He was under doctor's care, was prescribed medication, and constantly assured me he was on top of his shit. I never thought he was suicidal. His episodes and attacks against me became so severe, I decided to distance myself from him. Tip toeing around his mood swings made me so tired and anxiety ridden.  I didn't see him for the month leading up to his death, and for that fact alone, I have massive pain. It's going to be a year soon and it still hurts everyday. 

I would like to write this briefly for anyone who has contemplated suicide, not only would you be doing yourself an incredible disservice, the pain it puts on your family/loved ones is absolutely indescribable. I will never be the same. There is really no way I can put how I feel into words. I am a college aged woman who was generally happy with an ""average"" life prior to this.

80,"I had paragraphs of the final letters my brother wrote before taking his life tattooed on my forearms. The very last sentence he ever penned was ‚ÄúI can see no way out.‚Äù 

There was a point where I was going to take my own life because the thought of not having to feel suffering anymore caused visceral relief. So then I and my brother were at the same moments in time at one point; sitting in a room gripping a tool we intended to use to remove ourselves from the fabric of existence, driven by a brain full of false thoughts that what we were feeling would never end. 

If I could rewind time and go back to the hotel room my brother Jake was in, right before he stopped his own heart, I would say:

What I have found is just beyond the soul-crushing suffering that fueled my desire to end it all, there was a well-lit horizon of happiness that I could have never imagined existed. One fact that has always remained, is that just like the creation of this universe where light came from darkness, the same rings true with us. Because we as humans are made from the same thing that made the stars, so then it would break universal truth for you to not eventually overcome this darkness, because the light always wins. But if you end it before the miracle can happen and the light shines through, then you will be doing the reverse of what we were meant to do as human beings--live. And until you see that, it is okay, because I love you and I will stand by you no matter what. I am sorry that I was not by your side, I had no idea you felt this way, it was impossible for me to know without you telling me.  

One of the things I did before I almost stopped my heart that Jake never did, was contact someone. I sent an email, all it said was that I feel like ending my life and that I need help. And help came, other people stood by me once they knew what I was experiencing. And if you, beyond the masked version of yourself that you show the world, feel like ending it, I beg you to just let someone, anyone know how you feel.

I've had weird intrusive sexual thoughts for at least 10 years (since I was like 14). In general I will just come up with the absolute worst possible thoughts immediately when considering any scenario. For example if someone doesn't come home when they said they would, my first thought is that they've died. Every time.

I've always had rituals or compulsions without realizing that's what they were. Like at my current apartment there is a staircase and a door that closes slowly at the bottom, so if I can get to the top of the stairs before the door closes it means whatever thought I'm having (ex. If I get to the top it means my boyfriend loves me) will come true. Things like that. Also rearranging my keys to be in the correct order, lining up objects symmetrically, just very specific and random things.

I also have different obsessions for months at a time. In the past it has been health, existentialism, sexuality, right now it's my relationship. I've suspected I could be OCD for years but lately it's gotten super noticeable. I want to get an actual diagnosis sometime and should probably consider getting a therapist again.

86,"First of all please excuse my English because it is not my native language. I have a very bizarre thing to share..it started when I was only 14 years old. (I am now 21) i signed up for a writing website and made up a whole new persona and character for myself. Like a catfish but i did not do for the sake of relationships or with the intention of deceiving anybody into me or get friends at all  i just wanted to live in somekind of a world I‚Äôve created for myself a. Years have passed and my character grew more and more complex and well defined i used to steal all the writings ive posted before but when someone confronted me about it I apologized and suddenly begun to write super well that I became when of the top most followed authors in the website. I do not know how i managed to gain that skill so fast like so, but really believing i was him made me do it effortlessly. My character had friends in my head a life a career every little detail about him i knew more than my own self. A little more time has passed and i created another character to be his best friend on the same website with completely different mind set different book styles different interests different backstory diffraction hobbies also became one of the top on the app for the books and interests and for 7 long years continued on it like it was real.  
Mostly i was only being an (influencer) on that app. 

I do not know how and why but in my real life as myself 
I started to act differently as well. Depending on the situation i felt like my mind is divided to be either one of the two on spot.for that i became super outgoing i have so so so so many friends that i can tell stories about but as one of the two do i make sense? 
I never noticed any of that in myself until about 3 months ago one of the people on the website (that was a close friend of mine)  found out about all of this and told everyone and of course i was canceled and had to delete everything and quit. 

I swear i do not remember a lot of things I‚Äôve done with my friends my memory as myself is very foggy dream like. I feel unreal i truly do. Like i dont exist and i dont belong here.  My body doesnt feel right nothing feels real sometimes. I feel like i am fully just them they‚Äôre who i was all these years. I fully realizedbwhat i did is horrible and I reallize why my friends hated me but i cant think about it as just an evil thing i did I really was hurting all this time and losing everything. i tried to apologize and tell them that but all i got was mockery it was horrible.

 All i did daily in this 3 months is pretend like i still live in their world and progress their lives and act everything out. I feel like they‚Äôre still in me talking to me and guiding me through the day.

I feel like i have lost who i am and got destroyed so bad i cannot live myself as who i am. I have tried to kill myself multiple times before any of this was busted to the people and my followers. I don‚Äôt understand why did i do this why did it get so deep? I hAve a loving family and a great life but why I am hurting ? Why did i live this lie? Am i just evil or is something wrong with me? I am so embarrassed to tell this to a therapist nor can i afford it. Everyday i feel like my life as who i am becomes intolerable and half of me is missing.

I bonded with this little one, he was just the most wonderful little thing. He hugged me tightly whenever he saw me and would sit on my lap for hours in the evenings when it wasn't busy, resting his little head on my chest. I spent all day with him for months when covid hit and class was mostly empty, just us. I knew that I would miss him when I left that job but knowing that I'll never see him again hurts more than I thought, and I feel so dumb for it. He wasn't my baby. He won't remember me.

So, a few days ago I started cutting myself. The thing is, I never thought of myself as depressed. I have ocd, which makes my life fairly unpleasant, but I just thought of myself as unhappy, and I think one can be unhappy but not depressed? I have been drunk when I cut myself, and obviously that has something to do with it, I‚Äôm drunk as I‚Äôm typing this, but I was wondering if anyone has any advice on what to do in terms of seeing a therapist or helping myself in some way.

96,"I went back on Lexapro in January of this year after a few years break (currently 25m) and I felt so great, and it really helped my depression. A couple months go by and I need to up the dose age to get the same effect, and the same pattern follows again in about the same amount of time. My doctor switched me to effexor (no titration, unaware of titration myself) and I drive for a living and noticed vision blurring. He called it bullshit but set us up to get together shortly after that call. As he got his medical book I asked him if he vouched for WebMD having the results already up for it being a side effect. He also found this in his book, and recommended dry cutting the effexor to ensure that's where the blurring came from. I said that would be detrimental as I'm bipolar and work in the public, so he switched me to wellbutrin(again no titration) and then came the side effects

Memory lose, vitigo, migraines, and worst of all extreme bouts of rage. I'd been trying to get thru to my local csb for a week now with no call back (probably overwhelmed) and finally broke after 3 days of side effects and called the cope line asking for help to see a psychiatrist. They transferred me to a therapist, that also said she was having problems getting her clients through to the csb, but that she would expedite me

Not feeling any relief from this, I heard myself to the emergency room and they noticed immediately that I should have had titration and dosed me with Atarax and sent me home with the smallest doses of Ativan that... Well didn't help unless I double dosed. And I understand, they didn't want to have my driving on their conscious. 

Now, the doctor called me back after leaving him a message of my ER visit (I go to a care clinic so I can only go to the ER twice a year or I'll be dropped) and said he was sorry that had happened to me and hoped I got better soon.

99,"So basically I'm gonna ask you to figure out what I might have as Im waiting in queue to see therapist so it's gonna take a while to be properly diagnosed. Let's start with the reason why I decided to post this, my mother's wedding is coming and lots of emotions I don't like are gonna be involved or its probably only one emotion for me... Disgust. Now I love my mother but I'm only able to express love in words to people if I state it as a fact...it happens most of the time with most people... Situations when  I'm able to express it sincerely because I feel that way are rare. This applies if overemotional response is directed at me not only coming from me and sometimes even when it's directed between other people. Like for example, my mother wants me and my sister wearing matching dresses, I'm conflicted between not my style and surviving this because of her, after all not my wedding and I want she's happy, however, I tried to suggest different type of dress anyway and she responded with... U are my daughter and I want to show u off, that u are my baby by wearing this dress... Sweet right? No... I nearly puked from disgust when I heard this... Any type response like this make me disgusted and physically sick but I try not to show this, I'm from Eastern Europe, most mental ilnesses are labelled as bullshit here. Now if u think this is my response to my mother only u are wrong, whenever my ex would use words mine, belly, bellybutton (related to pregnancy) any other word like this makes me disgusted. Lately (I have 4 year old son) I been feeling disgusted that I even was pregnant in past and it makes me lash out to my son and my ex. These situations ( and there's more just this post is already long) have made me sick since age of 10 maybe even earlier...just around that age I finally realised it. I can feel emphaty , love etc, usually show them as acts of service or words of affirmation. Does anyone ever have experienced any of these emotions this way?",09Oct2020,1

I have some anxiety, a little depression and maybe some adhd but none of its diagnosed but my gf has some hardcore anxiety which she has some medication for and I have a big Q because I have no way of knowing if I fully understand what she‚Äôs going through. 

Every now and again she has a mental breakdown where she‚Äôll just start crying for what she says is ‚Äòno specific reason at all‚Äô and I just assume she‚Äôs feeling the uni/job/family pressure. 

When she breaks out in tears I do my best to console her and talk to her about what she might be thinking about (not trying to force an answer just being here for her to vent to). After a half hour to an hour of letting her talk to me about everything she‚Äôll be feeling much better she says. Sometimes after that we make out for a bit and have sex and it seems to make her feel better. Obviously I never force her to do anything I just give her a kiss and then go along with whatever she does.

104,"For the longest time I have had possibly a number of various issues including anxiety and depression (confirmed). Growing up, particularly from early teens I was made to ‚Äúfit in‚Äù by hiding any medical/physical/ mental issue so my parent would have a good social image. It took me a long time to realise how mentally/emotionally manipulative they are. They demanded me to be girly but also look and act like their husband and be a mother myself as young as possible (around 18/19) and in the army. It lead to roughly ten years to date of confusion, frustration and so much more. 

On a daily basis I have always fought to try and figure out who I am. All while trying to please my family but I could never please even after being the first one to go university. During my late teens I had problems with drinking, rebelling and making snap choices. 

I only started to see clearly after meeting my partner. They spent months going through hell to make sure I could run away and have a safe place to call home with people that love who I really am, not what they expect me to be. It‚Äôs been a little over a year since moving in and I‚Äôll be honest, things have more so had more visible changes in the last few months. My issue is having no idea what I am facing in terms of health in every way. As well as realising and adapting so many terrible habits/coping mechanisms so I become a better person. 

I still have a very long way to go and many dark days to get though but for the first time in my life I am finally recognising the reflection I see in mirrors. This is probably cheesy but I honestly cannot thank my partner enough for going though this scary journey with me and sacrificing so much to help me become better. It is insane how way they went for me and there is no way to thank them enough. 

By making this post I want to share a small part of my story to show people there is a way out. Yes there‚Äôs a lot to go but I‚Äôm slowly getting there. Take it one day at a time and I promise you will get there. We all develop in our own time as we are all different and unique. Have a lovely day and stay strong. There is always someone supporting you. If you doubt that, then I‚Äôll be the one to believe in you as I know you can do it.",09Oct2020,1

He has just been off work for a few weeks, his first day back this morning, and he came home after an hour because he just broke down.

He says he feels like he's failing everyone, me and the kids especially. He feels like he isn't trying hard enough and that it's all his fault he can't work. He feels as though work won't believe him, and they might think he's making it up just to get off work. 

I think he's wonderful, and to me, it's not a problem if he needs time off, or even if he has to leave work. Our benefits will be able to prop us up until he is able to go back to work. So it won't be a money issue. I'm currently not working due to having a baby, so I'm not looking for work until after April.

I asked a person out the day before yesterday, they didn't say no. Just that they're busy the forthcoming week and can't decide anything. Their tone in the text sent me into panic and I replied that I'm sorry for being so pushy and basically took a dramatic farewell because I thought they didn't want to hear from me ever again. I tried to make it seem really light hearted but I think my panic shone through. They didn't reply.  


So due to my extreme panic and uncertainty on how they feel about me now I ripped out my eyelashes. I have done this in the past when I feel like shit and kind of like a punishment to myself? Now my eyelids are red and swollen and I look unwell. I'm so ashamed. But the panic just SENT ME and now I look ridiculous. So not only did I punish myself for trying to ask someone out but I punished myself for their answer and how I seemed desperate and how I reacted. Now I'm angry at myself for looking like a naked mole rat. It's gonna take weeks before they grow back out but I wanted to punish myself for this.

I started getting mental health issues in middle school. I felt sad all the time, had major social anxiety, and never felt motivated to do anything productive. a lot of this stemmed from who i was surrounding myself with (lots of mentally ill people who put all their troubles on the one ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù friend). right when i hit high school things started looking up. i could talk to people without many issues at all. i even started ordering my own food again which was a huge milestone for me. and i wasn‚Äôt sad anymore. i mean obviously i got sad sometimes, but i didn‚Äôt feel like i was actually depressed anymore.

it‚Äôs senior year now and i‚Äôm a little worried. i‚Äôm still not sad, i‚Äôve surrounded myself with great people and i can still talk to waiters and interact with people normally. the problems are different. i cant shut my brain up at night and it leads to me tossing and turning for hours and never getting a good nights sleep. i have major hypochondria, which i don‚Äôt even need a proper diagnosis for because it‚Äôs practically running my life now. i‚Äôm still horribly unmotivated, in fact it‚Äôs worse. i‚Äôm constantly paranoid that i‚Äôm being watched at night, that i need to protect both sides of my body while i sleep, that i need to cover the bottoms of my feet in bed, things like that. i check on my brother every single night consistently cause i always get thoughts that he‚Äôs going to die in his sleep. i‚Äôm not religious but i‚Äôve started praying for the health and well-being of my family because i‚Äôm terrified of losing them and so paranoid it‚Äôll happen before i can say goodbye. 

i‚Äôm paranoid all the time actually. with my health, with my family, and just in life. when i go to the beach, i‚Äôm worried about creatures, drowning, undertow, tsunamis and more. the supermarket or the movie theatre bring up thoughts of shootings and robberies. i don‚Äôt feel like everyone is out to get me but i do feel like i need to be on the edge of my seat wherever i go.

Normally, I can just coast through the bad days. But recently, my thoughts have been just turning... you know. Final solution. And I hate that. I know, deep down, I don't really want to die. I have children, a beautiful wife, a somewhat dysfunctional extended family but we get along okay enough. I just find myself sitting up later, drinking more, forgoing my responsibilities to myself. And It's nothing to do with anything. I've distanced myself from everything and everyone trying to narrow things down... Nothing. I'm left with thinking the problem is myself.

When the work is done, when the hobbies are done, when everyone is asleep and there's nobody there to talk to or to maintain normalcy, I sink. And I sink so fucking far. I used to be one who could catch myself. I can't anymore, and it's terrifying. There is only one other mental disorder aside from clinical depression that I have, which is PTSD.

My father was an alcoholic deviant, and I suffered some... pretty dark abuse between the ages of 6-13, culminating in an event that obliterated me as a person so bad that I honestly never see myself getting over it. It produced a fear of sleep, fears of being alone, night terrors, and a discomfort when someone touches me unexpectedly. But, I've lived with that for nearly 13 years. That is something I am aware of and exist around. I've run out of options on what exactly is causing this sudden downturn. I feel like I'm taking a fucking nosedive, and in my cognizant moments, I'm terrified. Does anyone know of anything I could be doing to better the situation?

119,"hi. I never use reddit to post, but im really lost right now and I'm too scared to reach out to anybody I know.

i have been struggling heavily with body image. some days I feel so ashamed of my body I wear bigger clothes and hide in my room. it has been deteriorating my mental health a lot, but i had not acted out on my insecurities until recently.
it was around 3 in the morning and i had eaten leftovers. i felt like a pig, i was suddenly terrified of being overweight despite me being the average weight for someone my height and age. i had heard of making yourself throw up to lose food you had eaten, so i went into the bathroom and sat there trying to make myself vomit. i gagged multiple times, but i still couldn't make myself throw up. i sat there crying and shaking for a while before I gave up and left. now i feel ashamed and my mental health is even worse now. im scared I will eventually succeed in throwing up and will not be able to stop. I know how harmful it is for your body and mind, but it felt like I couldn't stop myself.",09Oct2020,1
120,i am currently experiencing the worst depression of my life to date. i keep eating shitty foods that make me feel worse and checking up on someone who emotionally abused me for a year because for some weird reason i think it helps to distract from my own thoughts. i really want to get better and i‚Äôm thinking of going back on anti depressants... anyway i‚Äôm not sure if there is a point to this but basically how do i stop self sabotaging with things and people that make me feel worse than i already do,09Oct2020,1
121,"Alright, I know this is a stupid f***Ing question, I'm sorry. I don't know if this is the right subreddit or not. Couldn't find a better one.
Is self esteem a mental health problem?
No, right?
I don't celebrate birthdays, normal right?
I don't celebrate because I think it's selfish to have a whole day where you put yourself on a pedestal and have people praise you and spend money or time on you.
I think my mother shouldn't give me a thing for Christmas or do anything for me.
I think I need to find a job at 16, so I can start paying my parents back for all the money they spend on me.
I walk into stores for one purpose or item 2 or 3 times before I decide to buy it or not. That doenst just go for clothing, it goes for buying bedsheets or water bottles because we didn't have any at home.

I spend weeks or (at my age) big sums of money for a lot of people for Christmas or birthdays, I am only good for serving others or making them happy.
I don't deserve sh**, I am grateful for everything I get and try to minimalise that amount.

I have been to therapy, though currently not.
They praised me for being mindful with spending.

My girlfriend and family tell me that I'm wrong.
They are agitated with me for not celebrating, don't bother arguing with me about it or explaining it on a way that makes sense to me. 
That makes me feel awful, I don't mean to make anyone angry or sad, I just don't want them to do anything for me.

Do I need help? This isnt an issue, is it?
If it is, then why did no one ever tell me so in my therapy sessions?",09Oct2020,1
122,"Hi,

I am a 31 yr. old Spanish and have followed therapy sessions in Italy and Online.

Normally I speak in English for 90% of my day and it's been like that for the past 9 years, since 2011.

I  have followed both therapy in Italian and Spanish and I am not sure if I  have a problem communicating in that language, or what is but I am  finding hard to move forward.

Do you think it's better for me tro do the therapy in English or in my native language? Does it make a difference?

123,"Hello I am an 18 year old male, recently I started trying to understand my personality a bit more and for a while now I have ben suspecting something. I don't really feel anything towards my friends, now these are okay friends nothing special or out of the ordinary just normal things but I just barely feel anything towards them, and whenever we hang out It's pretty underwhelming 90% of the time and I think to myself that spending that time on my own might have been a better choice. Now this (disability), I don't know if it's right to call it that but whatever, to feel things even goes towards my family a little bit. I have 3 siblings one of them I truly love and appreciate, the other one is just neutral and the last I hate from the bottom of my heart. My mother is the only person I am 100% sure I love but my father is eh, not so much. Now my question is, is it normal to be like this? I told a friend of mine about this and they have aspergers and they told me that not being able to develop deep connections and feel things etc is a sign of autism and that's why I'm here. 

Also some other interesting things to note I don't know if these will help, I think I am very strong mentally I don't think I have ever been depressed or even anywhere close to depression, It is very hard for something to bother me or offend me all that much (maybe just in the moment), I also rarely feel guilt which is something I don't like about myself.",09Oct2020,1

my parents were pressuring me into doing stuff i didn't want to do and calling me name and stuff and i used to tell them that I'm depressed and they used to laugh to my face. but its fine i don't blame them, the weren't educated on the mental illness matter. surely after that i told my parents a few months ago. they pressured me into talking cuz i wasn't well and they noticed cuts on my arm so one night i had a panic attack and i told my mom everything and they instantly called a doctor and educated themselves and they really changed for me and they treated me better and started showing love.



i was kind of pressured into going to my first therapist but i went anyway just to make them feel better. the first therapist really made things worst and she kept blaming me for everything and it just made me punish myself more and more. 


after some fights with my parents we left her and went to another therapist. to be fair he is more understanding and a good guy but its been 2 months now and honestly things are worst on my end..

128,"I've only recently got pills that help my depression, and for the first time in my life I can see a future. My motivation is still of thin ice and can be broken and repaired in a matter of seconds, and I'm still vaguely suicidal, but not nearly as bad as before.

Now that depression levels are lowered you can really see my ADHD. Its going to take some getting used to the change in behavior (strong emotions and impulses especially). The main problem right now is, I overthink loads and it doesnt help my already existing anxiety.

I currently live with my dad and now with motivation + more clarity in thinking I'm realizing just HOW toxic it is here. He yells a lot and gets mad and doesn't show much support. I'm sick of living in anxiety and fear and he isnt helping, it's like every slight improvement I can make will get instantly shut down. I want to move out, but to rent a place I need a job. And that's where I've been stuck for a long while.

In general I still have very low self esstem. I find it hard to send resumes and all because I keep thinking what's the point, they're not gonna want me anyway. And calling or texting is super hard. Going in the place itself and asking if they need employees is scary. I think I'm just super scared of rejection (or the less realistic laughing at me for even thinking I can qualify) and you just cant look for a job without being rejected every now and again. I have literary no reason to be so afraid over it because I know it isnt the end of the world but I am and I hate it.

It's like. What else is there? I went to a job helping thingy before and they talked about how much motivation you need to find a job nowadays because so many other people also want them and you need to work hard and I just got a panic attack because I dont know if I can do it (admitingly this was before the new pills but I dont think my way of thinking has changed that much. Like I have motivation but still a lot of fear and doubt I can actally pull it off)

Idk, I'm rambling like crazy. Basiclly how can I even begin to look for a job, as simple as can be, when I'm scared of messing up and being getting yelled at all the time? How can I work when I'm scared of the very people around me laughing at me?

Any tips?",09Oct2020,1
129,"TW: s**cide, dep***sion



last night i went on facetime with a (sort of) ex friend. i‚Äôve been trying to help him with his mental health issues because he claims it is the primary reason he has been treating my friends and i like shit this whole year. 
(he has been r@cist, h*m*phobic, degrading toward women, and a lot more.)

he told me that i need to own up to everything i contributed to during our arguments and i got fed up with him but did it anyway because given the context it was unavoidable.
it‚Äôs not only him though. all of my friends have their own mental health or family issues, and they turn to me for help and advice. this has been going on for 8 months.

it‚Äôs not that i don‚Äôt like helping my friends, but none of them are helping me in return. i have told some of them (including said ex friend above), that i have contemplated suicide on multiple occasions, and they said ‚Äúaww, i‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù when i was hoping for them to actually ask me why. i ended up having to explain it myself, and then they changed the conversation.

not only is it my friends, but my parents have been neglecting my mental health issues for this whole year, and twice even lied to me about getting me a therapist. 

for the past few weeks, i have spent so much time focusing on other people, school (which i‚Äôve been struggling with), and other general stuff, that i have not been thinking about my depression at all. 
i assume, normally, you would think this is a good thing. for me, it‚Äôs not. i am having an episode this morning and a wave of despair and discomfort have washed over me. and i‚Äôm scared that students and teachers will notice something is wrong. i don‚Äôt want to show this side of me to people that i barely know. i just moved here. i have another 4 years here, i don‚Äôt want people not talking to me because of something they don‚Äôt understand.
i‚Äôm really tired this morning so it‚Äôs difficult to interpret my thoughts to words, sorry this was so long.

I don‚Äôt think today will be a good day because i‚Äôve been bottling my emotions for so long, they are starting to show.",09Oct2020,1

137,"I just... do not understand anymore the value of working hard. I don't think I ever did.

I dunno, I just don't think that my human life is long enough for a good work ethic to be compensated. I already waste a third of my life sleeping and I don't want to waste another third or even more slaving away just to survive. We don't just die we grow old too. What's the point of all that wealth you accumulate when you're to old to enjoy it?

And working hard today is entwined so much with winning which always implies competition and fighting for resources. I've seen so much politics entwined with the work environment that I keep wondering who all this work is for. You literally made a meaningless war out of what is supposed to help mankind. What's the point? 

Ironically work today is hardly an ethic, it's a thankless job. People don't see you as people anymore you're just a resource and a tool to get something out of. Some people even degrade you for doing what you do whether it's white or blue collar. They're not interested in you unless you're top notch. And even if you are, you're nothing if you're not recognized as such. And that process of getting recognized is such a bloated useless package. 

The idea of ""do what you want to do"" is actually more insulting. I don't want to program. I don't want to paint or make games of my own, at least not anymore than doing what I really want to do, which is to play games, meditate and going on fun adventures that this world is yet capable of providing. Work is work. It's not fun, it just isn't. To say otherwise just feels like a cheap hypnosis that I just can't fall into no matter what. 

There's literally zero things good about what we've made of work. I'm not sure which is worse, the effort required or the people I have to meet in the workplace. There's just no pride in any accomplishment I make because of all this. It feels like a zero sum game even negative. 

Work is bad. It just is, all round. If it's not bad then it's not work and I envy those who don't have to ""work"" for a living if you get my drift; those who actually enjoy what they do being with who they want to be. I wanted to be a part of it but no matter what I do, work is work. 

It's bad enough that working is hard, not to mention getting it in the first place, but society makes you feel like a slave for working hard. I can't even count how many ways they've made it so degrading. 

Why even bother?",09Oct2020,1

140,"This isn't a brag post or a preachy one, I just want to share my recent story and maybe it'll help others, either way I'm excited about it

I'll try and keep this short. My landlords live next door and our gardens are connected so I'm quite close with them. Recently they've had a friend who is a medium over, I love this stuff so was intrigued. One day she offered me a coffee when she was there alone and I went up for an hour or so (turned into the whole day). We talked for hours. She also does therapy and she went through some techniques with me, I won't go into too much detail here as a lot happened. I left feeling excited but of course I didn't hugely expect much

The next day I was energised, something I haven't felt for years. It's been about a week now and I'm still pumped, I have my energy back, I feel less angry, and less stressed, my mind is finally quiet enough to focus on my reading and learning. She also kept correcting my speaking, I would say things like ""I hope my dog behaves better once he's trained"", and she would correct the ""hope"" to ""will"". And when I said how I'm stuck in a rut, she said ""right now""  I didn't realise how negative my way of thinking was until then

A little vague back story if anyone wants to hear. When I was very young (13) I dealt with sexual abuse from a boyfriend, I was so young I didn't realise it was happening. This set me up for a life of toxic relationships, which has now ended with my amazing current boyfriend. But for years I've not been motivated, I've felt stuck, I'm unemployed because if covid which didn't help anything. And I mean, I used to be funny (to myself anyway), but I became so apathetic and angry which was not an amazing feeling.

Now I've been reconnecting with old friends, setting up adventures, I've applied for 2 jobs so far, both will consider me when they need staff which is hopefully soon, and I've been getting my puppy to behave much better. It's great

For anyone out there who is angry, resentful, depressed or lethargic like I was, you can do it. I no longer feel angry about my past, we can't change our past, but we can let the emotion go and pick up everything the past taught us. The future is exciting and full of possibilities, if only I could show you like she showed me. You are amazing, and your current situation is not permanent. The first step is letting go, it isn't easy, but it can be done, once you do this you will finally be free forever. I love you all and I'm so proud of you ‚ù§",09Oct2020,1

**Backstory:** 

In 1st grade i got tested positive for ADHD and I was at few physicians to help me.

Four years ago my parents went through a divorce (Currently 16M). It affected me a lot. I held all of my emotions and struggles in and I never liked sharing them with others. In 2019 I took on Salsa dancing and bachata and I have felt the best I have ever been. I have gone to 2 Salsa festivals. 

When 2020 come and everything went to lock down I couldn't go anywhere. I was stuck inside and my grades fell because of it and I got barely any motivation for school. These have affected me a lot nut I never was good sharing my emotions and held it all inside me and I never shared my feelings with even my closest of friends and family.

I have finally taken a decision to talk to my dad about it and I'm going to therapy on this upcoming Tuesday.

I still find doing my assignments hard to do and can't find any motivation. I talked to my teacher about it today.

**TLDR:** Parents went through a divorce and mental health suffered Took on dancing and can't do that because of COVID-19. Going to therapy on Tuesday.

**Current events:**

I revealed to my teacher that I might have ADHD and that I'm having a lot of stress and being overwhelmed. and he just said that its all inside my head and I'm making these things up and my therapy is just a waste of money and that I should relax.

143,"I moved to another country for university just over a month ago. I originally came here with some people who lived relatively in my area, and I thought things would be great. I thought I‚Äôd have a nice group of friends and be mentally happy. Instead, I‚Äôve only sabotaged myself. I‚Äôm facing a relapse in my ED, and that has contributed to a lot of emotional pain and distress. Because of this, I had an emotional outburst one night while with them, and I let out a lot of sadness and anger. It was from me bottling up so much negative emotions, and it led me to just let everything out right there. It wasn‚Äôt kind or fair of me to do so. I‚Äôve apologized many times, and they have all since said that they forgive me me, but I think they‚Äôre hesitant about having me around, because I know the things I said were hurtful. 

Now I‚Äôm in a position where I don‚Äôt get invited out anywhere and I‚Äôm always too anxious to ask people if they want to hangout/if I can go places with them out of fear that they will say no. I get very depressed when I see pictures and videos of everyone just living great lives and happy with the people that they have by their side. Every night, I‚Äôm home by myself. Sometimes I‚Äôll even drink the pain away, because I just feel worthless. People back from my hometown have also done some very hurtful stuff to me, so I don‚Äôt even have many old friends to turn to. I even tiptoed around thinking about what might happen if I just removed myself off the face of the earth. I want to be clear when saying that I‚Äôve never gone through with a suicide attempt, but I do often have thoughts where I will look down from a bridge and think, ‚ÄúWhat would happen if I just jumped off the ledge, right now?‚Äù

I‚Äôve never been diagnosed with depression. I do suffer from anxiety, however. And as I previously stated, I‚Äôm trying to overcome my ED again. I just really want some advice as to what I should do. How do I make my life better? I have a very rocky relationship with my parents. I know from previous experience that talking to them about this is not the best choice I have. If anyone has something that they think could help me, please leave a reply.

146,"(Long post warning) I graduated college in 2014. For the past 6 years I have almost constantly thought about whether going to college was the right choice for me. My parents raised me with the idea that college was the only path to success and because of that I went to a school where I majored in something that I enjoyed but arguably had no practical use in post college life. I say arguably because there are days I convince myself that I did learn a lot from both my major and just the college environment, that has helped me succeed in my current job. 
Anyway, college was not affordable. I needed to take out loans in order to attend and I know I am not alone in having had to do this. When I graduated I struggled to find a job but my parents made it clear that I was on my own and would not be allowed to move back home. I ended up taking a terrible $30,000 job and living in a god awful run down apartment with a few Craigslist roommates. All in all though I thought I had it pretty good. I mean after all, I had a job and a roof over my head which was more than some people had. 
My anxiety began when I visited my dad for thanksgiving and he gave me a letter from my student loan services informing me that my first student loan payment was due on December 14th 2014, which also just so happened to be my birthday. I panicked. I had no idea how I was going to afford the ‚âà$600/ month payment when I could barely keep afloat now. Instead of talking to my dad to see if he had suggestions or taking to my older sister to see what she did when the services called to collect, I just shoved the letter in my pocket and pushed the thoughts to the back of my mind. 
Flash forward almost 6 years later and I had made a total of 2 payments on those loans. They were in default and my credit is sitting somewhere around the below average to average line. I have a great job now with a good salary and I pay all of my other bills religiously which has somewhat saved my credit score. That said, until this morning I had always had a dark cloud of guilt hanging over me and haunting my every thought. I was terrified of anyone finding out about my mistakes that had compounded over time and were only going to get worse.  
I don‚Äôt know what made me do it, but today I took the morning off work and I called the dept. of education who forwarded me to the debt collector agency that now owns my loans. I was terrified the whole time, for some reason I thought I‚Äôd be scolded or threatened with legal action but the opposite happened. The representative gave me my total debt $40,500 and asked if I could pay in full. I of course could not. She then walked me through several options and I settled on a loan rehabilitation program where after 10 consecutive monthly payments (for me it is $905) my loans will be taken out of default and the credit bureaus will be informed of that as well. 
I am so very far from paying off my loans, but now I have a plan in place and a light at the end of the tunnel. My mistakes cost me thousands and thousands of dollars but at least now I know I have control over this for the first time. 
For any of you struggling with a financial debt of any kind, I know how scary it can be, I know it‚Äôs terrifying to look at it head on and take the first step to get it under control but for your own mental health, take that step and keep moving forward. Thanks for giving me an outlet to share this development and thank you to all of you!

150,"I'm 25yo. My parents are separated and for the past 21 years I have hardly seen my father more than 2 times a year. My mom had a stable job. She my aunt and grand parents were able to provide for me when I was in school. 
My grandpa died a month after I graduated 6 years ago. My grandma got diagnosed with severe demencia and my aunt just recently got diagnosed with breast cancer. My mom lost her job when I was in 12th grade and got sued for not being able to pay her credits. She struggled to find any sort of job since. I was left on my own before I turned 19. Completely unaware and untrained for the adult life. 
I can paint the picture like this: Imagine a completely naked person at a fancy dress party. That's how it was for me back then. I developed a depression, that ruined me emotionally. In mid college I found a great job with great team and management behind my back and I was able to provide for my family. My depression didn't stopped there tho. 

After a few years I started thinking, well maybe this job I've been stuck to for so long is making it worse...why don't I try to change something, and so I did. I traded that wonderful position that provided me both with the inner piece and funds to live my life freely. I started a new job. I started a new job, higher on the ladder. Then the corporate truth hit me. I had imagined every possible outcome and how it would feel like on the upper levels but NOT that gray, monotone situation filled with spreadsheets and reports. I was crushed. I didn't want to live like this. I'm a colorfull, creative person and I do not work well with excell calculations and weekly 2 hour meetings. It is sucking my life away from me. 

Two of my best friends got terminated and lost their jobs due to the covid situation. They stood with no job for few months. They were not happy, living off their savings. Then it hit me...I have no savings, but I have a student loan to pay the next 10 years. And it got worse, I realised I am trapped in this position now, I have creditnto pay and insted of having working parents to fall back on for 1 or 2 months until I find a better place to work and be happy..I send my parents money so that they can live somewhat normal. I have never been envious, or jelaous person, but just thinking how there are people that have this little luxury of working stable parent home and they are taking it for granted makes me sick. Not sick of them, but sick of my destiny. That I never required much and the one thing that makes me happy - seeing my mom happy and stable is taken away from me and I gotta pay for it. The fact that I am unable to affort even 1 month of unemployment, that I gotta suffer through whatever I'm into now knowing I have no option to go get another life because there is nobody to keep my back is exhausting. I can't risk, I can't be bold, I can't BE because it is not only me myself and I on the line. The lifes of my mother, aunt and grandma, that has shown me nothing but love are on my shoulders as well. Some people lust for a luxury cars, watches ect. I lust for being able to take a rest. This makes me feel handicapped in life and is pulling me down.

She also says things like ""I only bought you Christmas gifts this year don't tell any of the other grandkids, you're my favorite grandson"" she also says things like this to my kids against my brothers kids and my cousins kids. She also says certain things to try to (we could be talking about the weather and it will turn into your mom wasn't that great) get me to say certain things so she can say hurtful things about my deceased mother. And if she does things to hurt you, and you try to set up boundaries so she can't hurt you but are still respectful about. She says that she is hurt.
 For instance I lived in Colorado for 3 years had a job, a gf, and a place to live. My gf of 2 1/2 years broke up and most of my friends were my gf friends so I decided to move back to IN to be around familiar friends and family. But I was going to wait until I had enough money to move all my stuff back to IN,  set up a job  and afford a place to live in IN. I was financially fine in CO and  had a place to live I was going to wait 6 months to move back to save the money. Meanwhile my grandma is telling everyone I was destitute in CO and didn't have a place to live in CO. So she decides to spend over a $1000 on new tires for her truck to come pick me up(while telling everyone I am the reason she has to spend all that money)
All while I never asked for my grandma to drive across the country to pick me up. I don't even enjoy talking to her because she is manipulative and says terrible things but I only call her because she has no one else in our family who will talk to her because of things she does. I know how she is, so there is no way to stop her so I had to quit my job right then because I felt she would have made a huge deal about me not coming with her because of the thousands of dollars she spent on her truck to come out there. I lived with her for a year in Indy after she picked me up while she tells everyone at church, her friends and family about what she did so she can say ""look at how great I am"". But everything was based on lies. Implying that I was a loser that lived with my grandma, I know because she would tell me that people in her church thought maybe I was drug addicted and had to live with his grandma.  I tried telling her that I was fine by myself out there she just kept saying no you weren't. Which doesn't make any sense how she would know that being across the country and having no ties to anyone out there. 

So a few years 
 passes now its summer 2019 and my brother dies she tries to buy me a $3000 riding lawnmower I said ""no thank you I am fine"" she kept trying to get me to receive it I kept saying no, she used one of her many  manipulative tactics and said you need to let go of your pride and take the mower, because of what she did to ruin my reputation in the past I absolutely was not going to take the mower I kept saying ""no thank you"". She was trying soooo hard to manipulate me. 

So two days ago Oct 7th I called her to see how she was and I was telling her about extra tools that I was going to sell so I could buy a different type. And she says why don't you just borrow them from your dad I tried not to answer it(because my dad is the same way as my grandma and all 3 of my brothers can confirm) but she just kept egging me on and I told her why and then proceeds to tell me that ""all of you and  brothers are making it up. Your dad wouldn't do that"" I told her that ""there is no way all of of us would be making it up if we have all separately had the exact same experience"" (also side note I had a good talk with my dad for the first time ever in the fall of 2019 about these things and he admitted to doing itand said he wouldn't do it again) and she proceeds to say that she doesn't know anyone else in her family that does what my dad does so we have to be making it up and  all of me and my brothers are messed up"". Then she pauses and proceeds to tell me "" you would have had a brand new lawn mower if you would have let me buy it for you last year, I'm really hurt that you did that"" and I told her why I didn't accept it and she went off on me telling me ""you're messed up, there is something wrong with you."" Everywhere I've looked these are all signs of a narcassist and I don't feel comfortable with her being around my children because I don't want them to be affect the way I have and everyone in the family has been by her. I've lost one brother to suicide another brother died, and my mom died of cancer. All of them have had severe mental health issues and I believe these things are huge contributers to that. I go to therapy because of these things because, I do not want to pass these horrible things down to my children. What would be the most sensible thing to do in this situation other than complete no contact with her?",09Oct2020,1
161,"Since starting [Heem Publication](https://heem.substack.com/), I‚Äôve had several conversations with others about my experience with therapy. One thing I‚Äôve realized from these conversations is that people find looking for a mental health professional logistically overwhelming. In fact, a lot of people don‚Äôt know where to even start.

If you‚Äôre in a place where you‚Äôd like to see a mental health professional, I‚Äôve broken down the beginning steps so that you can get started:

1. Figure out the finances
2. Leverage your network
3. Don‚Äôt get overwhelmed by the licenses
4. Figure out their speciality

# Figure Out the Finances

I‚Äôm going to be blunt. Seeing a mental health professional(MHP) can be expensive. Generally speaking, they meet once a week with their clients over a long period of time. Therapy is not something you should expect long-term benefits from within a 1-month period. A crucial part of therapy is the relationship you develop with the MHP which can take time.

The cost of a therapy session can range from $50/hr - $200/hr depending on their background, experience, and job site. Some MHP‚Äôs also use a [sliding scale](https://www.betterhelp.com/advice/therapy/what-is-sliding-scale-therapy-do-you-qualify/) to determine the fee based on your salary to make sessions more affordable. With that in mind, this is how much a year of therapy could potentially cost without any medication:

&gt;$50 x 50 weeks = $2,500/year  
to  
$200 x 50 weeks = $10,000/year

This may sound like a lot, but it‚Äôs helpful to view therapy as an investment in yourself. Your future self and those around you will thank you later.

# Leverage Your Network

If finances are an issue, I would recommend exploring the network of mental health professionals through your health insurance. Believe it or not, the [Affordable Care Act has made it so that most health insurance plans cover mental health services since 2014](https://www.hhs.gov/answers/affordable-care-act/does-the-aca-cover-individuals-with-mental-health-problems/index.html). I highly recommend leveraging this service because it‚Äôs something you‚Äôre paying for.

If you‚Äôre a student, another option is to look into your school‚Äôs health facilities. Many times a student can receive extremely discounted, even free, therapy sessions for up to 12 times. But keep in mind that the people you‚Äôd see would most likely be a MHP-in-training.

If finances aren‚Äôt an issue, ask your friends if they know a good MHP. The best recommendations come from people who‚Äôve seen a MHP before and found it rewarding. People who work professionally in the mental health field are also a great resource.

Finally, you can try using online resources such as the [psychologist locator](https://locator.apa.org/?_ga=2.38984673.33195680.1602176728-704519976.1602176728) offered by the [American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/). Other search engines like Yelp can also be useful as well.

# Don‚Äôt Get Overwhelmed By The Licenses

One thing you‚Äôll discover when you look for a mental health professional is a wide variety of credentials such as the PhD, PsyD, LMFT, LPCC, and LCSW. Here‚Äôs a very quick overview of what those letters mean.

## Psychologists

PhD‚Äôs and PsyD‚Äôs are psychologists. They have doctorate-level education of 8-10 years and have the most training of all the mental health professionals. Psychologists also have the ability to diagnose illnesses and even prescribe medication in some states.

PhD‚Äôs tend to be more clinically focused with the intention of producing original research. PsyD‚Äôs are more focused on the application of existing research. Both often deal with severe cases of mental illness in their line work.

## Therapists

Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists (LMFT), Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor (LPCC), and Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) are therapists and tend to be more affordable than psychologists. They have a Masters-level education, the ability to diagnose illnesses, but can‚Äôt prescribe medication.

Each credential represents a different licensing board for different states with various approaches to mental health. It gets a bit confusing, but here‚Äôs a quick synopsis:

* LMFT‚Äôs tend to focus more on family dynamics and psychodynamic therapy.
* LCSW‚Äôs tend to focus on therapy within the context of social work and government services.
* LPCC‚Äôs also tend to focus on therapy but can also engage in areas that aren‚Äôt related to it such as career counseling.

In my humble opinion, what really makes a therapist worth their salt isn‚Äôt the license they carry. It‚Äôs their method, style, personality, experience, and time they spend continuing their education. So don‚Äôt get too overwhelmed by the letters behind their name.

That being said, special consideration should be given when deciding between a psychologist vs. a therapist due to the level of education and experience of the mental health professional.

# Figure Out Their Specialty

Mental health professionals generally have an area of focus that they specialize in. This can be categorized in a variety of ways from age groups, culture, and mental illnesses such as anxiety. Knowing what a person‚Äôs speciality is can help you make a decision. If you are an Asian American and struggle with depression, then it makes sense to see someone who is culturally experienced and has thoroughly researched the field of depression.

Sidenote: If you come across a ‚Äúgeneralist‚Äù, that means one of two things: 1) They‚Äôre new 2) A red flag.

If they‚Äôre new and have yet to discover a specialization, it could be worth a shot to visit them. Someone who is new may not necessarily be bad. What they lack in experience can be made up through great supervision and their own passion/effort.

But if they‚Äôve been a practicing mental health professional for several years, then being a generalist is a bad sign. The world of mental health research is vast and rapidly developing. This indicates that they most likely haven‚Äôt done deep research on any single area of focus and are overselling their abilities.

But my latest session i started feeling really anxious an hour before, and even though i was ready sitting by my phone charged up when she called i just couldn't bring myself to tap the pickup button and then i put my phone face down and went for an hour long walk without my phone so i would miss any other calls if she tried to call back.

164,"Hi all, 

I think I really need some advice here.

This guy I dated for under a year broke up with me in January this year. He wasn't feeling happy with me, and I'm only understanding it now. I was really toxic and jealous once I felt insecure in our relationship while doing a long-distance relationship during my exchange. I often initiated fights, and he said that might be because I wanted attention and affection from him. It really makes me think that he might be right about it. I don't know what to do with all the guilt I'm feeling now. I did far worse to the guy I dated before him, and I'm only seeing all these traits now. 

He was truly a great guy that I really loved. He made me feel so loved and safe. Or I think I loved? I'm afraid I'm just obsessing over him since it has past 10 months already. We have even had no contact for 4 months now. But for some reason, I still feel so strongly about him and I want it to be over.  It's not like I constantly keep thinking about him, it comes on and off.  But thinking about him affects my days so much. It can really put me off and I'm not really able to do anything (I've skipped showering and brusing my teeth for several days, also skipped several exams this summer).

It came to a point where I considered suicide and had to go through a suicide prevention program online this summer. I've also had a weekly chat since March up until last month to get through the breakup that helped a lot with realizing some things here and there. At night I often come to think that there is no meaning to my life anymore. I feel like I have failed and that I'm a terrible person for being so blind to treat people like I did to my ex-boyfriends. I'm really not looking forward to a day, month, or even a year from now. The solution to ending these thoughts or feelings have just been to end my life, but even that makes me anxious to think about. I feel like everything will only be harder now, whether that is to find meaning in life or dealing with my feelings.

I thought that maybe because he made me feel so safe and at home is the only reason why I keep thinking of him. I don't like to think of him like that, so I tried thinking that maybe he is not the problem, but rather other small problems in my life?  I suggested family therapy at home recently, which is helping a lot these past 2 weeks (my family is not horrible to me, but just a whole lot of miscommunication). I've cut contact with unhealthy friends, deactivated my social media profiles, improved my skin, and keep searching for things to do. But my mind keeps coming back to him every now and then. I've tried just feeling the sensations, feel it through, write things down, and not push the thoughts of him away. Even so, the thought of him makes me feel so strongly throughout the day.

I've tried my best to get through this. I don't want the loss of him being my trigger to feeling so vulnerable. I really don't want to keep hoping we'll get back together, nor do I want to feel hopeless about love and life. I have new hobbies that I work with every day, like photography, hiking, cooking, and being with friends &amp; family.  I even tried dating another guy but didn't last more than 2 months because I realized it was just a rebound and I have to deal with myself on my own. I also moved back home to be closer to my family to save up a bit (although I'm not in economically unstable and can afford to live on my own). But I still can't laugh genuinely. 

I'm hoping to get some advice on how to deal with this whether it is some reading material or other communities to reach out to. My previous boyfriend before this ex told me I might have Borderline Personality Disorder, and I have followed the community for a while. But even after being at psychologists and psychiatrists 3 years ago due to a suicide attempt, I haven't been diagnosed other than depression and anxiety.  Even after the suicide prevention program, I haven't been told otherwise. Please tell me what is wrong with me beyond what I think I know... I'm genuinely feeling my worst than ever...

167,"Hello everyone,  


I hope I am at the right spot here.   


Ok this text changed a lot over the course of writing it. 

Essentially it boils down to two questions/problems I have:

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, I have a lot of problems with discipline and sleeping at the moment. Whenever ""nothing"" (=normal home office day) happens, I just sleep 9-11 hours. Yes. I can do that. Also multiple days after each other. I do even feel tired during the day then (But not more or less than when I sleep less - I guess I am just always tired at the moment).

When a day shows up where I have an appointment in the morning, my brain will do \*everything\* to stay in bed. Seriously, I feel like that is not myself. I am not even that smart, but my brain will think of excuses, lie to people, lie to myself (""its not that important""), look up alternatives on the internet, just to be able to stay in bed.

If I sleep over somewhere else and arrive at home early in the morning or I have to get up early ( e.g. for an online meeting) I will also often try to find an excuse to go back to bed then.

I hate it.

Part of the problem is that there is no real repercussions for sleeping, except me feeling bad. It's a bad habit, like drinking (Which I used to do a lot as a teen, so I guess you can say I just have 0 discipline. It's the reason I never buy sweets or frozen pizza, they don't survive long). 

Plans with having people call me to wake me up have so far all gone wrong, but if you guys have made good experiences with that maybe it would be worth another shot?

Also do you think I should get \[Some device??\] to collect my sleeping patterns? Would that help?

Any other tips or resources for sleep health and raising oneselfs discipline?",09Oct2020,1

I'm 21 years old and suffer from severe depression and social anxiety. When I wake up my negative thoughts, future anxiety and low self esteem start to kick in. In social situations I don't have any cognition (focus or memory) and can't find anything to talk about. I can't function. I don't have any personality I would say. I don't love myself.

What are some techniques to start loving oneself or maybe even becoming conceited? How can I start developing an own personality and get a role I can play/become? I know about fake it till you make it. But how, what are some tips and steps to go for?

Would love to hear about your experiences. Maybe also someone of you suffered from depression and/or social anxiety and somehow managed to fake out of it and by that develop a true self love, personality and self esteem/worth.",09Oct2020,1

171,"I‚Äôm a gay 25yo male who has been like this for my as long as I can remember. When I was a child I remember people asking my father if he did something to me and I couldn‚Äôt understand what they meant by that. After moving away from my parents I became able to distance myself from their habits and see how they weren‚Äôt normal at all. My dad was very hard on us about grades but that‚Äôs about it. My mother was extremely controlling and if she didn‚Äôt have her way hell would break loose. When we were kids and we wouldn‚Äôt do what she asked or ‚Äúembarrassed‚Äù her in public she would grove our crotch areas. It didn‚Äôt matter if people were around watching or not, it didn‚Äôt matter to her, because she had to have her way. I remember telling someone what she did and she blamed it on my father when asked. Me and my brother are 2 years apart and have never held a conversation together as well as with our parents. We didn‚Äôt develop socially until we became adults and never had any friends growing up. We‚Äôve both had at least 2 hospitalizations for mental health and it was all so that our mother could use it against our father in the divorce. To go into detail I never had sex and it seems as though I have no connection to my genitalia whatsoever. The anger from this is becoming almost unbearable knowing that me and my brothers heads have been distorted for her own good. Sometimes my thinking becomes homicidal because I think she truly deserves death. I Keep punching holes in my walls in an attempt to gain control over my mind but the pain still lingers. Speaking to a therapist might help but I believe the anger will still be there. Any suggestions on how to get over this would help, please and thanks!",09Oct2020,1

My reasoning for not wanting to be friends with her - I felt we had drifted apart, she was a bit toxic, I just didn‚Äôt wanna be her friend. She reacted to my kindly worded message with total rage and I panicked and blocked her everywhere (bad move I know). I eventually messaged her after a friend told me to since she was going to harm herself and we hashed it out for like two hours. I kept my foot down and explained that I didn‚Äôt wanna be her friend. She was angry for this coming out of nowhere (I had been feeling this way for a while) and me being unable to provide a ‚Äòproper‚Äô reason. She tried to get me to stay, claimed she was the only one who understood me, I eventually snapped and said repeatedly that I just want her to leave me alone. She did, but not before saying that the way I treated her being combined with another friend leaving her at the start of the year and her bf dumping her was a breaking point, and that she is at a complete loss of will to carry on.

Anyways, my girlfriend was diagnosed with depression back when she was in high school. I believe she took SSRIs to help. They didn't lol. Her depression slowly faded away, but I think a part of it still remains there within her. Over the past few months, our connection has grown considerably. However, she doesn't like to discuss how she feels much because she feels like a burden (we still talk about how she feels, just not much). Recently, she's been feeling out of place and not like herself. This morning, I texted her asking how she was feeling. She essentially told me she feels like shit. 

So now that that's all said, my question is, what do I do? I've never been in a relationship like this before, so I really am open to ideas. I know giving her space is important, and it's what I'm doing right now actually.  Should I try to talk to her more about how she's feeling and maybe pick her brain?

206,"I‚Äôve been going in and out of depressive episodes, each worse than the last. I was about eleven when I started developing my depression, and I didn‚Äôt look or behave like an I was depressed, so I didn‚Äôt get help early. At the time, my parents were constantly fighting over the smallest things, but it was my mom who was looking for something to get mad about. I don‚Äôt like using the word hate, but that‚Äôs the only word that I know of that can describe how she felt towards me. 

School wasn‚Äôt much better at the time. I was constantly being verbally abused by someone who moved to the same classes I took, just so they could tell me to kill myself those extra four times. He‚Äôs also flip me off every time he saw me, unless he‚Äôs hanging out with his so called ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. Of course when I get home from another trip through hell, I get asked why I‚Äôm failing classes I have no motivation to do, and my mom complains about how all I do is sit in my room, doing nothing. What she didn‚Äôt know is I was thinking of painful ways to end my life. 

Fast forward two years later, and I‚Äôm in a different school with divorced parents. I‚Äôm living with my dad, but my mom was trying to do everything in her power to get in contact with me, lying about how she misses me, saying she‚Äôs sorry for being ‚Äúrude‚Äù, and a few other things. It‚Äôs at this point I blocked my mom out from my life. Life is good, my depression was being suppressed, and I thought I felt happy. Near the end of the year, my friend blocked all contact with me for no apparent reason, and since I had no other friends, and I still don‚Äôt, I was left in the dark. Side note, I had been to the memorials of three family members, so I was still tender when I was stabbed in the back. 

After the school year ended, and there‚Äôs nothing for me to do that keeps me sane, I developed a cutting habit. It wasn‚Äôt the best way to relax, but unlike all the other strategies I tried, it worked effectively. Moving on to the start of my freshman year, I still have no friends, little family I trust, and a cutting addiction. I knew things were going bad, but I didn‚Äôt know how bad it was since I don‚Äôt remember much good happening in my life. It‚Äôs about the first month of my freshman year when I consciously think about suicide again, and I figured thing couldn‚Äôt get better. 

I talked to a school psychologist, and it helped a little, but I needed something more than just talking to help me out of the hole going as deep as earth‚Äôs core. I knew I wouldn‚Äôt get that help, so I attempted suicide by overdosing. I told the psychologist what I was doing, and he called emergency services to check if I‚Äôm alive. The pills didn‚Äôt kick in since my body was used to having it in the system, and it probably just blocked it out since it knew it would be deadly.

It was at this point I heard aggressive knocking on the front door, but I tried to sleep through it. They tried knocking again, even though I didn‚Äôt respond the first time, so I started making cuts for each time they tried to get me to open the door. Eventually I heard someone walking on the gravel on the side of the house, but I had my blinds closed. 

Fifteen minutes later, my dad showed up and unlocked the door. The sheriffs followed soon after him, and they tried talking to me. I talked since I knew it‚Äôs too late for me to die, and I wound up in the back of a police car on my way to the nearest hospital. I legitimately felt bad for wasting two sheriff‚Äôs time, and I stayed quiet during the ride. If I was asked questions about my age and health, I responded to those, but I didn‚Äôt talk just to talk. I was put in a waiting room for twenty minutes with the cuffs still on, and when I was finally out in a room, I had the cuffs taken off and I was asked to change clothes. 

The time between me taking the pills and getting back home was four to five hours, and I had my knives taken away for obvious reasons. I managed to fall asleep at about three am, and I was woken back up by my alarms at 6:30. I did my classes with heavy bags under my eyes, but people knew I had a messed up sleep cycle, so nobody noticed. 

If you‚Äôre considering suicide, get help, or at least let someone know. Even though it may not seem like it at times, people care about you. Suicide isn‚Äôt the way out of a situation, it‚Äôs the way to stop everything good later in life from happening, and trust me when I say this, things will get better. If you‚Äôre constantly being harsh on yourself for whatever reasons, focus on the smaller achievements you make. Even if it‚Äôs as simple as living one more day, focus on the positives in life and try to ignore the negotiate. I may be working on that last part myself, but what I have done has helped, and I hope it‚Äôll work for you too",09Oct2020,1

209,"I am not even sure this is the right subreddit but I am really confused about what happened. 

So as a starter I often gesture while alone when I do something that requires thinking (playing factorio or working could be an example). Maybe even try to self-explain something out loud. I consider this normal. What weirds me out is something that starts happening more and more often (happens like once or twice a week now). So basically what happens is: I, as usual, start self gesturing, but at some point, my gestures stop matching my mental state. An example could be one I noticed before making this post: I was very concentrated on solving a problem when suddenly made a gesture of boredom - I rested my head on my arm in a very casual manner. Of course, I can still control myself and change my position as I will. The problem is - the gesture happens before I notice it. This happens to my face aswell but in reverse: I am trying to calm down but my face just stays straight and concentrated.

This happened for a while and didn't bother me. What I just noticed before making this post was the following: I got the effect again and checked my body and found out that I couldn't relax my hands, legs, spine etc. It is slowly wearing off but I can still feel it (I made a pause here and tried lying down but even that didn't help completely). It sounds a lot worse than it really is but it still bothers me. If someone knows what was that please tell me))",09Oct2020,1

212,"They always have to be right and can only exist feeding off of my misery.

TL,DR: My parents force me to rely on them and then treat me like sh*t for relying on them.

I have been battling depression depersonalisation, hopelessness, anxiety, and feelings of low self worth my entire life. I remember that it got so bad in my teens that I just completely 'bottled up' and lost who I was, basically dropped out of school, and continued my warpath of hatred and feeling like cr*p EVERYDAY, mostly because if you spend this long in one state, you begin to accept it as normal.

I legitimately thought that feeling like cr*ap was a part of growing up and normal.

I've been struggling with staying in jobs my whole adult life, the longest job I've held down was for 6 months, every relationship I've had with a girl ive had has been toxic.

I'm 30 and because of the industry I work in, (cruise ships), I've had to move back in with the parents due to COVID.

Upon returning home, I snapped. COMPLETELY snapped.

It was then and only then diff I stay addressing why I am the way I am and I know it's weak to blame other people for things, but I know the reason.

My parents.

If I do ANYTHING won't, be it the slightest thing ie; I  didn't change the coffee filter this morning or I made a noise that woke my dad up, then all hell braid loose upon me. I'm not exaggerating, all hell breaks loose.

I am never at comfort because of this.

I remember the breaking point in my teens was this and I adopted the persona of, 'i can't live kind this anymore, so I don't give a f*ck, I'll do what I want'.

Now that Im starting to address this, things are becoming clearer and I don't deserve to feel this way.

I'll give you an example of recent events......

Since I've been back at home I've talked to my parents about everything, often they don't listen and the only way to get my message across is by screaming at them and getting angry, then they start to listen, otherwise I am taken for granted and treated life the 'meg (Family Guy)' of the family, but I've had enough.

So now as my parents are staying to come out of their ego driven power abusing bubbles, to which they apparently have no knowledge about, they are starting to ease up and I am feeling so much better and like my true self again.

But this doesn't sit with them. They are to egotistical to admit their wrongdoings and can't change, they won't change.

Therefore they try and find and exploit ANY weakness/wrongdoings I have/have done and when they find them, that's it until I break again.

There whole existence revolves around this.

I'll give you an example; I was feeling the best I had felt in years last night, as I felt my parents were finally getting them messege and easing up on me, after months of screaming to get my way across - I know this sounds childish, but it's the only way they would listen. I felt things were finally 'falling into place'.

We had a meal and watched a movie, life felt normal again, I felt relaxed and I could feel happiness starting to surge through me again, something that honestly, I haven't felt in over a decade.

Once the movie finishes, my mum goes into the kitchen to make a drink.

2 minutes later the door bursts wife open and there she is standing there staring at me.

She proceeds to yell in my face, like literally into my face that I had not taken my vitamins and that with the virus at large, I am being selfish and putting the whole family at risk. I had not taken my morning does, which she is insistent that I do, because we all know Zinc and cod liver oil is the COVID vaccine.

After she has finished screaming, she goes to bed.

Now comes my dad.

My dad knows my ticks, he knows how to get under my skin and like my mum, will strike at any given opportunity.

So he proceeds to invade my personal space, constantly walk in and out of the room whilst I try to relax, burp and fart as he walks past me. Embarrasses me on the family WhatsApp group, stomps his feet as hard as he can as he walks by me to try and intimidate me, coughs in my general direction, asks me really personal questions,  everything he can to try and make me feel uncomfortable.

My mum upstairs in her room (directly above the sitting room) stomps her feet as load as she can and keeps moving around to make me feel uncomfortable until she gives up.

This is a standard evening when they deem something has gone wrong.

As a result, I close up. I put a wall around me so they can't hurt me emotionally and we're back to square one

Here comes the worst part.......... gaslighting.

The next day, with both parents in a good mood, they come down on me like a tonne of bricks because I seen sad/angry/depressed. This over the years of them dismissing my feelings has been labeled as me being ungrateful for everything, bitter and disillusioned.

My mum, now pretending to be a sweet angel, says things like, ""are you ok? ""You seem depressed, you should see a counselor/psychiatrist, you've been depressed for years, you should go on antidepressants"".

Me not addressing the real issue before (them) has led me to spend thousands of pounds on psychiatrist and antidepressants and, and I'm being completely honest here, they have all discharged me saying that yes you have depression, but there is nothing else wrong with you. Despite telling my.parents this, they always want me to go back and spend my money.

They also have a go at me for not pursuing employment, when I clearly don't have the emotional strength to hold down a job because of them!

I feel so sh*t because I close up and have no emotional release so get messed up, I harbour everything because all I feel is anger towards them for the way they act, but any sign of anger and I'm immediately labeled as disrespectful and ungrateful.

It's like they have me in a trap: treat him like dirt, make him feel crazy for being angry/sad, make him apologise or flip out/treat him like dirt for flipping out or make him feel like it's all in his head for being sad/depressed and the cycle continues to feed their power trip.

Everything I've told you here I've explained to them, many times.

And every-time, they say that I'm dilusional and it's not true and it's all in my head and that I'm making it up. I know I'm not. My older sister went through the same thing.

They claim that I need to see a psychiatrist because I'm paranoid. I'm not, I'm starting to stand up for myself.

It's like they can't admit they are wrong.

What do I do?",09Oct2020,1
213,"Hey guys, 

Today has been probably one of my lowest points in a period of my life that seems to be the worst so far. Around 2 years ago I started to notice I was starting to enjoy life less. My job which I was very happy and actually loved at one point had just gone through a substantial change with new management and a complete role change for me. I now spent most of my days doing absolutely nothing most of my responsibilities were taken off me with the promise of more. Some I was happy with some I wasn‚Äôt. But I carried on and pushed through. It took a lot of effort and pain to get more work and actually have something productive to do, when I finally did the responsibilities I had were laughable and a embarrassing. I go to uni on the side too which used to give me a profound sense of achievement and belonging, I was only 20 years old and felt like I was really going somewhere for once in my life. But with my job going down so did that, my studies suffered massively and I‚Äôve now got a huge backlog of work I need to do. 

On top of that my now ex-girlfriend was in her final year at college and soon to move to university. This caused a lot of anxiety and depression, I couldn‚Äôt look forward to the future any more because of the uncertainty. She moved and we broke up and initially after the first coupe weeks, I took it initially a lot better than I thought. I didn‚Äôt linger over the thought of her and I wasn‚Äôt hopeless with getting back out there, in fact I was more confident and sure of myself. I even met someone new after 2 weeks and things with her were going great, unfortunately it only lasted a couple months. But then came an overwhelming wave of depression. I really couldn‚Äôt deal with simple life anymore and everything was so hard to do. I started to get better and I actually got to a high point in life, I was confident(ish) again, and I could tell. Then I met this girl, I approached her in a Burger King and it took a lot of courage to speak to her and I overcame a lot of overwhelming emotion to ask for her number. Things went great and we both seemed to be into each other. But then she started to distance herself getting busy with uni and stuff. But I kept noticing her replies getting substantially longer and the conversation getting drier. I had to stop speaking to her after a few months because I felt like she was getting bored, losing interest and I was literally torturing myself over her change in behaviour.

But what I‚Äôve learnt from that is I am relying on people to be happy and for security. Which is no surprise at all for me as I‚Äôve had a pretty strange upbringing. My mum is an awful person and hasn‚Äôt shown me much love or parenting my entire life. She split up with my dad whilst pregnant with me because they were both cheating. If I‚Äôm honest I think she had me so she had a better legal case when she was going to divorce him. I didn‚Äôt even see my dad until I was 4. He was a lot better of a parent than my mum though. But my mum tried to tear us apart, she took everything from him and left him for a much richer man. Then she used my new step-dad‚Äôs wealth as a tool to make her look like the favourable parent. She was such a terrible person, she closed me in and criticised me for not doing enough. She was the problem and the cause. I had to move schools because of the actions of her and my step dad, they rang up my headmistress after I got into trouble at school and started verbally abusing her whilst pissed. When I moved schools it was a much bigger school with about 10x more people in. I was very different to most of the people there and I had to adapt to fit in. I‚Äôm glad I did because it in a way was the influence I needed to grow as a person. She split up with my step dad around 2016 and when I chose to stay with my step dad. He isn‚Äôt a great guy if I‚Äôm honest but he has let me stay there for over 4 years and I‚Äôm very grateful for that. He really doesn‚Äôt know how to deal with my mental illness however because he‚Äôs very old fashioned. He actually has made jokes about me killing myself etc. But it was actually so good to not have my mum in my every day life, I was free to be a child and have fun. I‚Äôve recently cut her out of my life after she did some unquestionable and selfish things. It‚Äôs just so ironic that when I started working I‚Äôm 2016 and loved my job and she moved out it‚Äôs all gone now to being shit. 

I‚Äôve never been close to much of my family. I‚Äôm feeling very broken and shitty at the moment but being able to put this all in one place has made me feel better. Now we move to present, I‚Äôve been off work 7 weeks, now on anti-depressants and speaking to a therapist. I plan on moving out and getting a new job soon. 

I don‚Äôt really mind if anyone reads this or even comments but if you‚Äôve been in any similar place I hope you‚Äôre feeling better because I wouldn‚Äôt wish this on anyone.",09Oct2020,1

216,"I was fucking crazy, sometimes even psycho, usually sociopath or I was numb or depressed. I was dead inside, suffering more than it's possible, but I didn't mind, until I met her.

I got really bad at the September last year and I was about to end it. But I told myself I try it with this girl I really like, 'cause while I was just sitting next to her I was feeling fine... well I messed that up by being suicidal and SH, then I made it right and then she just start to be so cold, we don't even talk or chat, but now I just can't fucking kill myself, I can't even fucking cut, 'cause I promised her and I wouldn't stand if I made her feel bad again. I was suffering, but I was fucking free, I didn't care about anything, I just did what I wanted (mostly nothing, because of the depression, but that's not the point), but now... I can't do fucking anything. I loved to be alone, but know it's just not being with her... I loved videogames, tv shows, getting wasted, but now I just don't enjoy it. I started to talk to her, because she make me feel whole and also because she couldn't hide She like me. Well... she learned how to hide it, she was always closed and kinda cold, but eventually she always held me tight, but then from day to day she closed up nothing in nothing out.

Like I don't care I suffer (altho I feel a little pity and angry 'cause I could/should be better), but I am terrified of what is going on with her... these actions almost got me to a grave and she deserves better than that. Fuck that, why she just can't let me be there for her... fucking flying fuck damn it.

Point is she made me fucking care and it fucking sucks. All the physical and psychological pain I ever felt can't compete with the fear of what would I fucking do if anything happened to her.

230,"I am still trying to process all of this...

Growing up I had a bit of a weird but good childhood. I have an older sister and we both grew up on a farm with just about everything we wanted/needed. Our mother always made sure we grew up as kids and not have to worry about adult stuff like chores or working. Our mother was always loving and made sure we had everything we needed. There was a quirk though that we noticed about my mother. She needed everything around her to be perfect. I can recall literally falling down the stairs and her worrying more about the basement (non finished or even fancy) steps getting damaged while I sat there in pain. After she verified that the stairs were ok she asked if I was OK and acted like any other motherly parent. Another instance would be when my sister spilled wax on the carpet in the basement while playing. To my mother it was the end of the world. She was in so much trouble. Even when we were way little we never ate with our hands, we always used silverware and didn‚Äôt dare touch the walls. The house was always clean and she would slave away weed whacking and keeping up with the multiple barns we had. That was a ton of work to keep up with but everything was always perfect.

Through our teen years we all know she had OCD and thought that was the only issue she had. Even she would joke about it. My one teenage friend would always move something in the house a little bit to see how long she‚Äôd notice. She used to count the squares on the end table garlands to make sure the lamps were 100% in the middle. My friend would move the lamps one square over to see how long it would take and she would find it and say ‚ÄúDamn it Joe‚Äù. We would all kind of laugh. By this time she was certainly getting worse but we still didn‚Äôt process the severity of it. If someone would touch the walls she would notice the grease from our hands and paint the entire wall. Not just touch up because then she would see that too. Countless times she would be up until 4AM painting.

The past couple years have been way worse. Anytime something big happens in her life like moving she simply cannot handle it. She freaked out when my sister moved out. When she moved back in for a year, when I moved out, etc. The two recent ones were her moving to a smaller house since we no longer live with her. And her parents health is declining rapidly.

My dad is in the picture here but he doesn‚Äôt understand mental health issues at all. He was a high school dropout who worked on the family farm. I do not think he even noticed that some of the stuff my mom would do was not normal and how it could mess us up mentally. He seems to just be ignorant to it and lets her do whatever as long as she doesn‚Äôt bother him. He is part of the problem because he also enables her immensely. His health is also declining rapidly which is not good. He just had lung reduction surgery and still smokes cigarettes. He doesn‚Äôt seem to care enough about himself or to get her the help she needs.

The last two years my sister and I decided to kind of take charge and get her professional help the a psychologist for her OCD. The entire process has been not good. We have spent time and money sending her to different psychologists for help with her OCD. There have been a couple bumps in the road that we didn‚Äôt quite understand until last night.

The past couple years she has been further isolating herself. After she moved, she basically lived in the basement from sunrise to sundown. She would do her hair and makeup in the basement. She did this so she wouldn‚Äôt notice a mark on the walls or a stick in the yard. Because if she saw one it would mean painting and entire wall or going outside and having to clean up the stick. Anything out of line needed fixed right away otherwise it would drive her mad. She would make my father, who works out in the hot weather doing manual construction work 10 hours a day wake up at 2AM to go get a paint brush from Walmart. If she saw it, it needed to be fixed right away no matter what.

She has also started to grow hatred for my dad. They never really loved each other it always seemed more like they were just two partners raising my sister and I. They pretty much planned to get a divorce but my mom would never do when we were young because she didn‚Äôt want us blaming ourselves and end up having mental issues growing up‚Ä¶.. Instead they would act like nothing was wrong and tried to hide their fighting from us. Most the time my sister and I would walk around the farm exploring and playing as kids.

The past two years have been difficult for everyone in the family. My mom has continued isolating herself from everyone. She since moved from the basement out to a new smaller metal shop/garage. She wakes up super early. Goes up to the shop. Plays puzzles and games (solitaire) and then goes back to the house late at night to sleep day after day. It is getting harder for my sister and I to see her or even get her to meet us for lunch or visit.

There have been a couple recent events that my sister and I finally put it all together after 30 years,

About 6 months ago my dad went in for his lung reduction surgery. At this time my mom freaked. She could not handle him being gone for a week or even changing her routine for when he came home and needed care. The night he came home from the hospital she went nuts and yelled at him, screamed at him, and blamed him for everything. It got so bad my dad tried to leave with his oxygen tanks and she kept pulling them off the truck. I had to set up my basement for care and he lived with me for a couple months until he recovered. My mother could not hold it together to help my dad after having major surgery. In fact that night immediately after my sister dropped them both off from the hospital they started fighting immediately.

Growing up I was always my moms favorite. Every time I came home she would praise ‚ÄúMy son is home!!! Yay!!!‚Äù This is important to know for the next episode/event.

The night my dad came home from surgery I had to go over and get his medications, breathing tubes/devices, oxygen tanks, his clothes, wallet, etc. When I walked into the house I was already upset this situation even happened. Luckily I have always been super calm but I was not ready for what was about to happen. I walked in and my mother who has always shown the most upmost love towards me was not there. Instead she was yelling at me for doing this to her. She told me I was an awful person for taking her husband away from her. That I was killing her all while I was just trying to help my dad live and make sure he had the stuff he needed for care. She would ask me why I was doing this and try to get me to acknowledge that I was killing her by doing this. I got what I needed and left in a hurry.

The next 12 hours was not good. I finally got my dad situated on my couch with what he needed and went to bed. I woke up around 4AM to a phone call. It was my mother. Hesitantly I answered. My wife also woke up and was listening. My mother was manic. She talked in a super deep voice saying ‚ÄúI had to do it, it needed to be done.‚Äù ‚ÄúI did what I had to do to survive.‚Äù My took the phone from me, muted it and told me two hang up because she was playing games. I eventually hung up but whoever I was talking to was not my mother. She was referring to taking $600 out of their shared back account to ""survive"".

Then one night, while my dad was living with me recovering from surgery he was feeling better and took an opportunity to get away and go to camp for a weekend for some alone time. He did this behind my moms back as she has always been weirdly possessive of him and angry when he is happy. She called me to check in that weekend and asked how he was doing. I told her how he was feeling and she eventually asked me where he was. I am not one to lie or keep secrets in the family because I think that is toxic. And I previously warned everyone in the family that I am no longer keeping secrets from one another. So my mom asked where he was and I simply told her he was up at camp. She lost it.

At this point my mom couldn‚Äôt get ahold of my dad as service is bad up there and it was late at night. My mom kept calling my sister and was acting just extremely odd. Eventually we were all calling each other (my mom, sister, and myself). My mom threatened to kill herself so we called a mental health hotline and they recommended us calling 911. We called and went over there. The police and ambulance was already there. My mother was trying not to go to the hospital but eventually we all talked her in to my sister and I driving her there voulenteeringly so she wouldn‚Äôt have a 3 day hold.

She put on a face and basically said whatever she need to to get through the hospital doctors and make everyone think she was OK. The doctors agreed to let her be released and my sister and I reluctantly decided she wasn‚Äôt a danger to herself.

Last night my sister and I had a breakthrough. She had dinner with my dad and he told her my mom is now living in the shop/garage on their property from sunrise to sunset instead of the basement. She cooks up there, eats up there, and even if she forgets her cell phone in the morning she won‚Äôt go inside to get it. She plays puzzles and solitaire and probably gets lost in her mind. The last two times we visited she had us visit her in the shop. She pretended like everything was OK and didn‚Äôt even acknowledge it was freezing cold or not normal to hang out in there.

When my sister called me to tell me this my wife connected the dots. She has multiple different personalities. She plays who she needs to to get through any situation in life. Like when she called me at 4AM manic, she was not herself and even used a really deep and creepy voice. My sister and I were mind f#@&amp;ed (we still are). So much about our childhood makes sense now and we are even worried we may end up like her (terrified actually). We started discussing all her different personalities and the different person she pretends to be. They tend to come out when there is change in her life. At this point we don‚Äôt even know how long it‚Äôs been since our mother has truly been herself. Do we even know who she is? Under all the masks/personalities?

Once this realization hit my sister and I have just been processing the data and not taking action. Suddenly we understood why the OCD therapy and psychologist appointments for OCD was not working. We realized she is hiding something from herself. Probably from when she was young. I know my grandfather was not a great father figure and I wonder if he abused her.

If the realization hit my sister and I last night we can only imagine what unraveling all this might feel like for our mother. We need to know what resources we have available to help us. We need someone who is intrigued by this and is willing to navigate through all the layers of herself to get to whatever she is hiding deep down. She needs to stop running from it and acknowledge it and heal. Instead of going mad and into complete isolation. All the specialists we‚Äôve talked to (OCD specialists, we didn‚Äôt realize the personality issue until last night) never made any progress. I think she puts on a different personality when talking to these people. Progress does not seem like it‚Äôs being made. We need a setup where we can all sit as a family and discuss things.

I don‚Äôt want to try to talk her through this at all because I am sure it‚Äôs very delicate and I know I‚Äôm not a professional. We need someone who will spend all the time necessary to diagnose and understand her. Someone who really is fascinated by this and wants to really help her.

What are our options? What resources are available to us? Please we are running out of ideas of how to help her. We live in the US.",09Oct2020,1

I was ugly crying on his balcony while his neighbors were telling me to breath, I kept screaming back at them that I don't know how to. I kept apologizing to him and he kept saying it's ok but I just feels really embarrassed. I decided I am going to cut back on the drinking , but I know that's only going to help so much. I am setting up my first therapy session and hopefully I will get better soon, I just can't keep feeling this way. To be honest I don't know why I am posting this but I just needed to tell somebody.

I‚Äôm a 19 year old girl who has been dealing with depression since I was probably 12 or so. I‚Äôve had a really hard go with things &amp; it certainly doesn‚Äôt help that I am very secretive &amp; feel weak when I have to reach out for help. 

The first time I reached out specifically for depression I was 16 years old. The doctor wouldn‚Äôt diagnose me because I was young &amp; he thought it would ‚Äògo away‚Äô but did prescribe me. The medication really only made things worse so I stopped taking it. 

Fast forward to now, I‚Äôve spent most of those three years just taking it and dealing with it on my own. I‚Äôve had a therapist for some time but talking can only do so much. Finally she tells me that I need to go back to see a psychiatrist, because my depression is hurting my every day life. As well, there‚Äôs a potential of bipolar 2. I had high hopes for this, hoping that I would finally get some answers I needed and feel relief that I have a diagnoses. 

Instead, the psychiatrist essentially tells me that I have low self esteem &amp; that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm depressed. That i need to work on that. When I told him that I had been for some time, and that this feeling is still persistent he shut it down. Told me that if that was true I wouldn‚Äôt be depressed. Once again was told to go on medication without a diagnosis.

I am not usually violent but I was so upset and allowed it to push me so far that I slammed my office door hard enough that the outside frame completely flew off. The door itself was pushed outwards in the opposite direction of how it used to open. I was mad that it broke (????ü§®????) like as if I didnt do it myself. I know my anger issues are a huge issue. I have known for so long. I think I have spent the last year and some change trying to find a therapist. I found people who wouldnt take my insurance, people who didnt meet my needs, and others that just werent taking new patients. I have been feeling so defeated. So angry that I am the way I am. So angry that I watch myself repeat the same habits I hate most. Just angry. At me, at my life, at the world. Some days I feel like I am just going to spontaneously combust from anger. I need change. I am begging for it. 

But today, I am a step closer. Today I have officially secured an appointment with a physchotherapist that I feel good about. That I am excited about. I got the call back about setting up a new appointment while i was at work and had to go ugly cry in the bathroom.

I feel totally down. Occasionally I feel ecstatic for about 30 mins every week or fortnight but that's about it. By the way I don't do any drugs so if you're thinking it's that it isn't. I'm in year 2 of uni and I was supposed to be having a few drinks with my housemates tonight but I just had to leave after about an hour. It's not that I dislike them I just hated being there.

248,"Good evening everyone! How are we all doing today? My messages are always open if you‚Äôre in need to vent, share something, rant or have a general chat with. :)

We‚Äôre approaching the 10th month of lockdown and for some, it‚Äôs been incredibly painful and sufferable. But, at times like these, people forget to do ONE important thing: **checking up on others**. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, you need to be healthy also, but when you feel like you are, try your very best to check up on your family member and friends. Mind you, I‚Äôm not asking you to go see your friends, this can be over social media, a text or a simple call. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the suicide rates have skyrocketed. An example of this is the UK, The Guardian created an article that male suicide rates has hit two-decade high in Wales and England. 2 decades! 

Some people are not fortunate enough to have friends, which pains me to say. But, if you do have friends, be there for them as much as you can, you may never know the last time you see or hear from them. For example, a text you can send them:

- ‚ÄúHi. How you‚Äôve been? How are you keeping on?‚Äù

- ‚ÄúHello! I was just thinking about you. How are you and the family?‚Äù

- Or as simple as ‚ÄúAre you OK?‚Äù

It‚Äôs always the little things. Seeing that notification pop up on your phone and thinking that THAT person was thinking about you and wanted to make sure that you‚Äôre OK. That‚Äôs what friends are for! This can be different for families, especially if you live with them, but you can get to do these sort of checkups in person, rather than over the phone. Just a simple ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù, ‚Äúare you up to much today?‚Äù or as simple as ‚Äúhave you ate yet?‚Äù, it shows that you care enough about them, which I don‚Äôt know about you, it warms my heart. 

Usually, the friends who you may believe are the ‚Äústrongest‚Äù are actually the ones that bleeds n silence. It doesn‚Äôt matter how they are as a person, they can be:

- Loud
- Quiet
- Happy
- Creative
- Charming
- Charismatic 
- Always stressed 
- Strong

Check up on them. If you‚Äôre away from you parents or living in a different household from you brother, sister.... let them know you‚Äôre thinking about them and you always will. Life is too damn short to hold a grudge or not to tell people how much they truly mean to you. If they mean something to you, let them know, they will cherish it forever.

249,"My dad talks to himself CONSTANTLY-is it harmless? Or should something be said?

For as long as I can remember, my dad has always had a habit of talking to himself. Usually in loud whispers. He used to do it only when he thought no one was around, but my family and I would always be able to hear him whisper to himself from around the house. More recently, I‚Äôve noticed the habit has intensified. He talks to himself CONSTANTLY. It‚Äôs gotten more frequent, it‚Äôs gotten louder, and now he‚Äôll even do it when we‚Äôre in the same room with him as if we aren‚Äôt there. He‚Äôll even make facial expressions as though he‚Äôs talking to someone else standing right next to him. 

None of us have ever said anything to him about it, out of fear it would embarrass him or upset him. While it seems like a harmless habit, I‚Äôve become more concerned when I‚Äôve noticed him started to fade out during a conversation I have with him. He‚Äôll start making odd expressions as though he hears another conversation happening. I can see it in his eyes when his mind is elsewhere.. then he‚Äôll suddenly snap back and smile as though nothing happened. It‚Äôs also a little unsettling when he does it in front of other guests or friends when they‚Äôre with us.

I had told my psychologist where I was moving and when and that I do not want my mother involved at all with anything related to my mental health as she likes to play victim. 

It‚Äôs been about 10 hours since my mom has texted me and I don‚Äôt even know how to reply, no matter what I say she‚Äôs going to be upset with me. She‚Äôs so overwhelming and draining.

256,"There isn‚Äôt much to say... I‚Äôm extremely homicidal. Part of me wishes I wasn‚Äôt but most of me is consumed by it... I want to kill people. 

I posted here because I don‚Äôt want to feel alone. 

I‚Äôm not too sure if this is real or not. I think it is but I just don‚Äôt feel right. As if something or someone is pacing in a cage deep down below. And this-this person is unlocking the iron doors. It‚Äôs getting ready to release itself from captivity. 

Is it me?

Or am I someone else?

I‚Äôve killed pets before, starved them, beat them.
It feels normal to me.",09Oct2020,1

258,"So i've been pretty anxious about not being in a relationship for a while but my(m 20) friend(f 19) is always there to comfort me.
Now she is my best friend and of course i fell in love with her, this is the teen clich√®.
We still remained friends and she is very supportive about the whole thing.
There is another girl(lets call her alice) who i've tried to chat up a while ago, and today after a very drunk and emotional night, the two girls chatted for a while and alice confessed that she likes me and wants to break up with his current bf.
After some talk alone we procideed to kiss which was my first kiss ever, and i thought i would be a little happier after i finally find someone.

Well turns out i don't. I for some reason want to go back to the constant depression and anxiety about people leaving me.
The fact that i still love my friend as well is probably not helping, but thats something that i can't change. I've been trying for a year now.

I always break down my emotions and find why i act the way i do.
But this doesn't make any sense. 

Anyone has any advice?",09Oct2020,1
259,"I've just been so ehh about life to a point where its worrying. I'm in 2nd year engineering a varsity athlete and have ran a franchise over the summer, and all of the sudden I have no drive for anything. Deadlines have been sliding past for over a month now, I legit have not done one assignment for school and classes have been going for a month and a half. I've noticed symptoms of depression, I've considered self harm and have punched myself in the face enough to make my jaw ache for weeks, but am too much of a coward to severly hurt myself. I've never been emotional but now I cry every second day. I'm not suicidal and I've had one good day each week where I actually eat sleep and drink enough and start doing what I used to love again, but then the rest of the week is back to the same endless scrolling through YouTube and Reddit, sleeping, and debating how long I could go without food or water and if I should hurt myself. I'm so fucked up and confused. At the same time some part of me is desperatly wishing I could be diagnosed with something so that I feel validated in becoming a lazy worthless blob that has done nothing productive for the past 4 months, which is a disgusting train of thought I know. Why have I just become so apathetic to everything for the past 4 months, does anyone have advice or relate?",09Oct2020,1
260,"okay,,this is the first time I post so I'm sorry if I make any mistakes

basically I can't remember almost anything, I've struggled with depression for a long time and anxiety for most of my life I'm now 19 years old and I can't recall any memory apart from a couple mayor things that I've talked about again and again with my therapist. this is making things really difficult I'm going to a psychiatrist and when he asks me how I've been I just can't remember every day is a blur and since quarantine started in march everything is mixed together.

I'm sorry that this is all over the place I needed to get this out there and please if someone has any tips to help me I'd be really thankful!!

also sorry if I made any mistakes english is not my first language",09Oct2020,1

15 male (just in case its needed)


Alot of the time when i talk to people or do some tasks even post on the internet i feel like im just watching a movie in my own body. I often forget what i say since i label it as something someone else said that one time i never remember doing it or saying it. I feel like im just sitting there while someone else does all the talking and work. 


On some days i feel in control i feel like im the owner of my body. I talk when i want to talk i walk when i want twalk its not a set of unpredictable actions that just happen. Its something that im doing.


And when i feel in control people around me often call out how im acting diffrent today. I ussually blame it on being tierd despite me not being tierd.



It is stressing me out since i want to know if this is normal or not. I also want to know wich is actually me. The one who is ussually around or me atm.


i hate this feeling of not knowing who i am. Or why i dont feel in control fo my own fucking actions. Every step i ussually doesnt feel like its mine. 


Im posting this now cuz i know tommorow ill go back to being a passanger i really hope i dont become a passanger and actually know what im doing or why im getting out of bed. 





If its normal then ill stfu and deal with it. If i should be worried can some of you guys link an accurate online test or smth ? Therapist are hella expensive and im saving up for medical reasons atm so i really dont wanna waste money on smth thats bassicaly a teenager going through a phase.


Thanks for reading this far btw.",09Oct2020,1
263,"So, my sister in law is mad at me for having Brain Problems. She‚Äôs frustrated that my partner can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt leave me with our 1 year old to move in with their father, who is going to be receiving hospice care. He lives about an hour away, is currently in an assisted living facility but seems unhappy, so they‚Äôre planning on moving him back home. She is currently taking care of their mother in her home, so I guess she expects/wants him to take care of their father. 

I know she is going through a lot, and grief is weird, but man. What a low blow. I am currently processing a ton of trauma, dealing with panic attacks, repressed memories, extreme mood swings, intrusive thoughts... and I‚Äôm doing it all while being the primary caregiver to our child, managing a household, supporting a grieving partner and grieving myself... but that‚Äôs not enough. She literally wants me to put my life on the line. My therapist told us that me taking care of our daughter 24x7 is not a good idea at this point. She doesn‚Äôt care. She‚Äôs still mad. Still ignoring me. Still not understanding the toll of a mostly invisible illness. 

I feel terrible about the situation. I feel like I‚Äôm not enough for her, for my partner, for myself. I wish I was capable of managing things on my own, but I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm ill, and it‚Äôs being held against me, and it sucks.",09Oct2020,1
264,"I have Depression and I most likely have ADHD, a learning disorder and probably Autism as well but I have yet to have an appointment with a psychologist (not self diagnosing, just have a lot of symptoms and want to get it assessed)
So I explained to my s/o that I can‚Äôt handle how to deal with other‚Äôs emotions other than happiness and he understood. The thing is that my s/o has bipolar disorder and depression so he feels really down a lot of the time. Sometimes we get in arguments about him feeling that I don‚Äôt care about him and a whole bunch of stuff like that but I have trauma that started with specifically a man yelling and ending in a traumatic experience. Whenever he raises his voice or yells at me, I completely shut down, I don‚Äôt feel any emotions or anything, I just sit there. Meanwhile, he‚Äôs trying to make me show him that I care. I do care about him but I don‚Äôt know how to express it, I don‚Äôt know how to deal with anger and I definitely can‚Äôt handle arguments or conflicts and actually carry them out. I just want to know how I can manage this because it‚Äôs not helpful to my relationship. :(",09Oct2020,1
265,"Work, relationships, news, health issues, and existential crisis have been been annihilating my mental health. I usually cope relatively well with life now that I'm medicated, but negativity is just busting through my resilience right now. All I want to do is listen to sad music and cry in my dark bedroom all weekend. But wait, I did that *last* weekend.

I desperately want something to look forward to. I've been making some unnecessary purchases lately but I recognize that it's a behavior I fall into when I'm stressed, usually from working too much. What I really need is a vacation somewhere new to make me feel alive and connected to the world. But it's so hard to go anywhere right now.

I wish I had the energy to dedicate to finding a new partner. That would be energizing and exciting. I try to start using apps or whatever but my interest so quickly dissolves into listlessness and I just give up.

I know others are really struggling lately and I try to maintain perspective, but this week has drained me.

If I can muster up the will, I'll try to dive into some horror this weekend. Maybe open an old beloved anthology. Sometimes that can help me pass sad time. All of those feelings that good horror dredges up - fear, dread, misery, anguish - seem to buffer against daily anxieties and disappointments.

Thanks for reading my little anonymous diary entry. I hope you're all finding healthy ways to cope and are getting what you need.",09Oct2020,1

268,"When I‚Äôm sober, I feel like I make the decisions of a drunk person and when I‚Äôm drunk I feel like I make the decisions of a sober person.

Seriously my sober self has always fit the negative depiction of a drunk while my drunk self is actually happy and productive. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm achieving a weird chemical balance in my brain that I normally lack. I‚Äôm not stupid though - I know that‚Äôs not gonna last. The brain degrades like every other organ with alcohol use and I‚Äôm literally setting myself up on the exact trajectory for a downward spiral... but shit. What else am I supposed to so? How else do you fix a brain that normally can‚Äôt do jackshit when it‚Äôs important? I have shit to do and wealth to ensure so that I can even afford to live long enough anyway. Gotta grind while I‚Äôm young.

So am I self medicating or what? I got my brain scanned as a kid and the result was ‚Äúcomorbid something‚Äù coming closest to ADHD but not entirely like that.

Anyway, I know I can‚Äôt go on like this forever. It‚Äôll be bad for literally every organ in my body. I just hate being the boring incompetent buzzkill that I seem to normally be and would do anything to disrupt that. Where do I go from here?

I‚Äôm gonna start therapy next week so that I can maybe begin to figure out what the hell is actually wrong with me and why I am just so intolerable when my brain hasn‚Äôt been manually tampered with.

Anyway though, I am literally not shitting around when I say people like me better when I‚Äôm drunk, or that I get better grades, or that the music I listen to is better. However, it‚Äôs nothing more than a shitty, shitty coping mechanism and I know it.

I just feel like it‚Äôs either this or some cocktail of meds that would probably end up killing me when combined anyway. Like there‚Äôs only so much shit you can treat at once before you run the actual risk of lethally poisoning yourself (more destructively than alcohol, that is).

Anyway, sorry you had to read all that if you did. I am just struggling to find an actually viable solution to this problem..... if there is one that exists.",09Oct2020,1
269,"Idk why but almost every day I imagine my death or like hurting myself really bad, burning my skin or skinning myself. I get weird body aches that don't go away and happen all the time randomly. I can't focus on anything for longer than ten minutes, my attention is horrible. I'm always tired even if I sleep a full eight hours, even after a quick nap I'm still tired. Everytime I eat I feel like I overate and my stomach aches, either I skip a lot of meals through out the day or I binge eat a big meal and hurt for the next hour. I feel trapped in a way, I can't get anything done. I daydream so often I can listen to music for three hours and not notice. I feel like unlovable, and that no one has and ever will. I feel guilty because I want to talk to my friends about this but, I feel that it's selfish and I need to figure out how this by myself. I can't imagine my future, I try but I can't imagine myself seeing life in the next couple of years, idk I feel like I am better off dead. Also I can think about emotions but I can't feel them like they vanished I just feel nothing there.

270,"Hey.

I want to know if this happens or happened to you. 

Basically I try to do way too much at the same time (more than what is required) and I end up being overwhelmed and not doing the task right.

For example: they asked me to do 1 task at work. I did 10 and did them all wrong or regular because my mind was all over the place. 

I do this for everything, relationships, work, college, personal projects. Everything turns into a big chaos that I only made myself.

I think this comes from a place of being insecure and thinking I'm not enough so I try to prove myself to others that I am capable. And it ends up going all wrong. 

Did this happened to you? How do you take control over an insecure mind?",09Oct2020,1
