0,"I have severe anxiety with regular panic attacks, I have major depressive disorder, I have OCD and ADHD which has made me an extreme perfectionist who can never seem to get on track. I also am an engineering student (electrical) and almost all of my peers abuse alcohol or drugs just to keep afloat. And that’s the neurotypicals. 

If I have a drink or two (/*at least two) I feel “normal”. Not panicked, able to focus, able to think without constant barrages of noise in my head. I’m not “physically” an alcoholic - like, if I stop drinking I don’t experience withdrawal or cravings. I just miss feeling more grounded. I’m not saying I don’t have q problem, obviously I do, but It’s more mental than physical. And my metabolism is problematically fast and adderall kills my appetite so the calories mean absolutely nothing to me. 

I’ve been not drinking for a week and I’m absolutely miserable. I’ve been functioning (functioning alcoholic?) for about two straight months drinking every night. I don’t get drunk I just keep a light buzz going. I study at my best when I’m 2-3 in and not yet drunk. Also my tolerance is insanely high now so it takes a gross amount of alcohol to even get drunk anymore. I got almost drunk like a week ago and I had like four shots, six high-% ciders, two cheap beers, and half a glass of wine. I think the wine did it for me since I never drink it. My husband has half a cider and he’s ready for bed. 

My psychiatrist is obviously not happy about this and is trying to find a med combo to help but nothing is working. I’m on, at the risk of doxxing myself, Vyvanse, adderall, buproprion, prozac, blood pressure medicine, anti nausea pills, four vitamin pills, and then normal stuff like birth control and allergy pill. I take so many pills every day. He keeps upping the doses but It’s just not working fast enough. I’ve been stressed way too long to wait a week for results that may not even happen when I can instead destress for a few days for $30. 

I don’t want to have to rely on alcohol. I miss driving and not feeling slightly bloated all the time. Exercise feels gross after I’ve been drinking but I’m too panicky to exercise without alcohol. 

Psych said he can “emulate the effects of alcohol” with a certain combination of dose changes. Last week he said I’d see results in a week. It’s been a week. I haven’t drank all week and I’ve fallen back in school and my husband is irritable because I’m irritable, I’m pacing or laying down all the time and constantly full of guilt because of my lack of productivity. 

Idk why I’m posting this I’m just so exhausted. I want to sleep but sleeping is difficult when I’m so stressed. I had a minor surgery a few months ago and the painkillers sorta did the same things as alcohol except I was dizzy and uncomfortably fuzzy/numb. And they taste gross. Alcohol at least tastes good :P I mean Vyvanse is basically cocaine right? Why can’t I just take alcohol pills or something. I’m so tired.",10Nov2020,1
1,"Hi,

I'm an 18 year old part-time producer and I'd love to make music for a living. I started college in october and made one of the biggest mistakes of my life. I made the wrong choice. A few weeks in college and I already lost all of my motivation to work and make assignments. 

My school organizes a ""Qweek"" which is a week, after the autumn break, full of test exams of different courses to see how you're doing. I just had an autumn break which is a week of holiday and a week when you're supposed to work for school. Unfortunately I was so demotivated I didn't do anything during this week. While typing this I should be studying for my test exam that I have to make tomorrow.

I have already told my parents that I like making music and it is the only thing I love doing and putting time in. But they say it is a big risk and that I first should get a job. Totally agree with that but I don't have the guts to tell em that I hate what I'm studying at the moment. I have been going to information days of that college with my parents since I was 16 and they thought it'd interest me. Even I thought that for a few months. Because there was no other course that I was interested in, I chose the course I thought I'd like. BIG MISTAKE

Right now I feel like ass and don't want to do nothing but being unproductive and sleeping. I even cried today because of college and how bad my future might be if I keep going like this. I hardly ever cry so I shocked myself by doing so. I really don't know what to do, so I ask for your help 😢",10Nov2020,1
2,"I have a job but I miss a lot. Like at least once a week. I won’t disclose my I’ll eased but they qualify me for disability, which in my country won’t give me a stipend to live on, but will cut medical costs and afford me certain benefits, but none that really help me a lot. For example I can get help from staff riding a train or other accommodations. 

I have a mental health doctor and also a therapist
Who have been working with me and I have been on 30+ medicines, with little effect. My doctor wants me to take a few months off (it’s a right in my country for this leave) but I’ve done it before with my past job, which would not recontract me due to spotty attendance. 

My current job has been very understanding but I can hardly blame them if they did not want to recontract me either. I cannot seem to get better and would rather commit suicide than continue to live with my illness. The only reason I do not is my wife constantly reminds me how broken she would be if I did. The only think keeping me alive is the constant guilt. 

I don’t think I can hold down a job and due to my status in this country (expat) the types of jobs I can work is very limited. 

Please don’t tell me to go back to my home country (USA) as I have no real family and I would lose all healthcare and have no insurance or medicine at all. I am completely lost.",10Nov2020,1
3,"I’m 19 and had to come back home recently, some things didn’t go as planned when I tried to start a career in the United States Air Force. I feel like just posting this is taking a risk; I haven’t gotten much support from other platforms. 

Since I’ve come home, I’ve been anxious about what life has in store for me. It feels like there’s this huge mountain in front of me that I just cannot climb. I’ve since gotten a job - today was my first day. I keep playing on repeat what could’ve been. I think about what I’m supposed to do. I think about what I *want* to do. My mind has been racing since I was taken out of Basic Military Training (BMT). The first night I got home, everything felt so surreal. I wanted everything to end that night. Ever since, I’ve had suicide cross my mind every here and there. It feels like a brochure sitting in my back pocket waiting for me to pull it out and finally go. I think about life afterwards if I were to die. I think about my family and there reactions. I’m scared to reach out, I don’t know how to. I’m sorry if this story is a bit all over the place, there’s just too much on my mind and I can’t seem to organize it.",10Nov2020,1
4,"My mom doesn’t understand what having depression is .I have BPD and depression .She keeps taunting me for my mental illness and my use of medication .What she doesn’t understand is that without medication I would have a mental break down and never be able to leave my room .She keeps saying there is no time for depression that if I am depressed to go clean and all she does is criticize me and emotionally abuse me by calling me names and saying horrible things about me .Saying she can’t wait till I’m out of her hair .
I live here but I am calm and just stay in bed all day and don’t do much else other than that .She presses my buttons all day and I don’t say anything to her and then I say something after being criticized all day .I am not problematic but don’t meet her expectations so I guess that makes me a problem to her . She asks me personal things but when I tell her she uses it against me later on .I don’t know what to do .I want to move out badly but don’t have the money to do so and am not consistent with keeping jobs due to my lack of energy .I just changed my dosage so I hope this helps with energy for work .",10Nov2020,1
5,"so , this all started about three years ago. i was so young and had a boyfriend , we broke up , i started skipping my meals as a result of just feeling shit. It was to the point where i had to hide bread , tins of food in my drawers to make it look like i had been eating to my family. and so i eventually told my dad that i want to get help with it , he took it in a while different way and was bringing up was it to do with me not having a mother figure in my life etc, and at this point it wasn’t about my ex it was just i didn’t want to eat , i lost my appetite. and so he went out and bought me food 😐. i was really preferring he’d guide me in a path that would get me actual help but after that day we never spoke of it again. fast forward to last year , i went and stayed at my grandmas because my dad constantly takes his anger out on me and doesn’t let me have a say in anything. i told my grandma about my self harming and i was comfortable with her telling my dad , so she did. i returned home and he didn’t ask me about it , didn’t offer support , nothing. and recently i’ve struggled A LOT with self harm and i’ve been feeling very depressed and low moods as well as high moods , he’s noticed me be ‘moody’ which i wasn’t , i was literally doing nothing and he sent me a text complaining of how i act and that he’s ending my phone contract if i don’t start not being moody? i responded with , i’m just not feeling great recently and i’ve spoke to teachers about it and i think they’re giving me counselling. Once again he never even asked what was wrong , what was going on. and my teachers also haven’t followed up on the counselling they said they would get me. i understand i should also make an effort to seek help but i’m just really nervous about doing so , i can’t explain it. the thought of ringing up to make an appointment, explaining my problems and wanting to get a diagnosis for depression , i’m just worried incase there’s nothing wrong with me and that there’s no help available. i’ve just never been offered support i don’t know where to start.",10Nov2020,1
6,"I wasn’t childhood friends with this person. I just recently met him through someone else in college and he kept calling me every day to talk about his depression after the first meeting 
 Because he didn’t have anyone else to talk to I thought it would make his depression worse if I ignore him so I thought should try to be there and even try to help out so I kinda stuck around for months with him listened to his problems everyday and even connected him to psychiatrist and therapist in our college but it got to a point where he was calling me every day to talk about his problems and I kept listening  to him for hours and hours every day where it got to a point where it started effecting me mentally. I was very overwhelmed and started feeling depressed.
I cry every time I put down his call. 
I’m stuck on a loop and everything is overwhelming
I just don’t know what to do. I can’t just stop hanging out with him it would make his situation way worse and I would feel like an awful human because he doesn’t have anyone else 
What should I do?",10Nov2020,1
7,"I’ve been suffering from depression and anxiety for years and I’m almost 17. I’m pretty sure I have body dysmorphia too. None of this is diagnosed because my parents are really against me getting help because they think I’m faking. My mom is an alcoholic and I’m not close to my dad at all. I had to beg her to get me a therapist after I went to the hospital cause I thought I was dying. My 3rd therapist recommended me medication but my mom said no. I can’t keep living pretending like nothing is wrong when I’m suffering everyday. I can’t get out of bed, I can’t look at myself in the mirror without crying, I’m always anxious. How can I talk to my mom so that I can get help. I don’t want to live like this",10Nov2020,1
8,"It's been happening lately and it's scaring me. I'm 31, I have a healthy diet, I exercise and get good sleep. My fiance and I are getting married in 2021 (woop woop!) But my back is going out. I'll work three hours and then it just gives way and it's like someone is stabbing me up into my spine. 

So I cry on my breaks. It feels just like this natural reaction to fatigue, pain and.. what the fuck.. what the fuck am I doing at 31 working as an entry level fast food worker, pulling in nickels over min wage? 

I cry because it hurts physically, but also because my creative faculty is hitting a brick wall as far as my source of income. I haven't missed a day of work since January, and my back just isn't helping me out. 

I'm tired of constantly taking Ibuprofen, not being able to have sex with my fiance (huuuuge issue there). 

I'm stranded in a job that is breaking me physically, stealing alllllllll of my extroverted energy from me, so when I come home I just want to sleep. Like what. What am I doing? This is so unhealthy lol

I want to run away for six months and write a book. Because I'm fucking human. I'm a fucking human with thoughts and singularity. Not this ""hi welcome!"" In a fast food shirt and hat. A fucking hat. 

I'm not too good for this job, I'm thankful I have one. But I've lost my sense of self. I'm hat, uniform and sleep to Netflix guy. I used to rock climb, backpack, write poetry, act, was in a metal band. 

I killed it today with my Lyft driver. I was so sad and miserable, I just went the other way and made this guy laugh like I used to do in high school. But then came home and cried again. Just tired of crying.",10Nov2020,1
9,"I don't know what to do anymore. I hate everything little thing about myself. The way I talk, the way I act, the way I think, everything. For as long as I can remember I've hated myself. Even when I was in elementary school I hated myself. I'm 15 now and things are just getting worse. I'm living the same day over and over again. All I can think about is how useless I am; how I could be so much more than what I am if I wasn't such a pathetic piece of shit. I feel so stupid, even right now as I write this I feel like I sound stupid. I'm not being taught jack in school, which only makes my hopelessness grow. There is so much I want to know, in fact, I wish I knew everything just so I wouldn't ever have to work towards anything or ever be wrong. That's what I fear, being wrong. The idea of me never being right controls me. I daydream about being someone else to make it go away, but I still manage to find flaws in my own fantasy and thoughts take over again. I repeat to myself that I won't ever amount to shit, and it's true. All I know how to do is complain. Every word that comes out of my mouth is a complaint, whether I'm whining about school or how I feel It's always, ""woes me! my life is so hard!"" and it's fucking pathetic. It's kinda funny though because I tell myself that none of this matters; that there is a reality where I'm everything I desire to be, but that doesn't help. If anything it's just hypocritical. I act like I don't care, but I do. Even the slightest critique  drives me insane. I can't take it. I'm a little bitch. Nothing more than that. I just wish I could be normal. That I could live out my life without contemplating it every waking moment. I have a dream to work at NASA once I'm older, but I'm never going to make it. I can barely get up in the morning to shower. What makes me think that I could ever be a fucking astronaut!?! I struggle with the most basic shit! I thought that getting a reddit account and ranting to strangers would make me feel better, but the more I type, the more I realize that I can barely put my thoughts into words. I can't deal with myself anymore. What do I do? Where do I go? Do I off myself or do I just deal with it? I've been on this earth for 15 years and I'm already a failure. Everybody is better than me. I can't keep up. I am trapped in a box full of spikes. No matter where I turn, I'm still miserable. What really pisses me off is that I have no reason to feel this way. My life is easy; I've never had to work for shit, everything is handed to me. Why am I like this??? Why am I so useless and unhappy? What have I done wrong? All I can ask is why. I don't even know how to end this rant, I'm out of words. I know no one will probably see this, but please just help me. That's all I want in this moment. Please.",10Nov2020,1
10,"I just called my local suicide hotline, but I got nervous and hung up. How can I communicate to someone else that everytime some thing goes wrong in my life my first reaction is to slit my wrists or swallow every over the counter sleep aid in our house. I know I need help, and I was going to go to the hospital 2 days ago and get help but I wasnt sad then. It seems like I'm only ever sad, fine, or really really MAD. I can't keep a job because my brain doesnt work right. I can't focus and it feels like I'm in someone else's body watching. I can't seem to process complex thoughts anymore, I lose track of the beginning before I get to the end. My job(the I quit a week and a half ago) messed up payroll and I missed a paycheck essentially. I wont get paid for two week. So my couch is getting taken tomorrow and I'm pretty sure my car is right behind it. I really wish there was someone to help me, but I dont have insurance. I have scratches all over my legs because at least I feel the pain through the fog in my head. I really can't wait until I stop caring about taking care of everybody and just let go.

11,"Remove if this isn’t what this Reddit is for. I just need some advice on what I should do and if I’m overreacting. I am a 19 year old stay at home mom. I started therapy earlier this year and stopped going for a couple reasons. I wasn’t interested in trying meditation or using crystals. (My therapist was a county therapist so didn’t think that’s what she would advise) and I lost motivation. I have my medical card for ptsd which helps but I don’t use it as much since I have a child. But for the last year I’ve had horrible anxiety thoughts race through my head constantly. Over the smallest things. Like I think what if I’m being followed or my boyfriend and his friends the other night watched car crash videos and now I can’t stop thinking about what if that happened? It doesn’t stop ever. I think of scenarios in my head and can’t let them go. I was molested when I was 9 until I was 13 and can’t remember most things only major moments . I also have been going through phases where I will clean the house from 10am until midnight for weeks straight then all of a sudden I just crash and don’t want to get out of bed for weeks and have constant headaches. I live in Pennsylvania and I’m not sure if I need to see a therapist before I go to a psychiatrist. Is that a good idea? Or do I go to a primary care doctor. I feel like I’m overreacting and I just am putting thoughts in my head. Or if I could even be on meds since I have my marijuana card for ptsd.

18,"I've always been overly sensitive and an overthinker. My anxiety almost disappeared when I started finished high school in 2018. Now I'm 21 and doing online college for all of my junior year and I'm so terribly bored. I'm still performing well academically but it's so hard to care. I feel so isolated. I have no friends in my hometown of 1200 people. I had friends and an active social life in my college city and that had to end last March because college campus is closed until fall 2021 (thanks pandemic). I've been stuck at home with my family for 8 months with zero friends to meet and no job. I got a job 2 months ago and freaking lockdown happened the NEXT DAY before my first shift. That was my one hope at escaping my house this year and making some local friends. 

I had a strong romantic relationship with my boyfriend of 2 years who I met in college. We have been long distance and he burdened me with his mental health issues for most of the summer.  Some of the things it caused him to think/say caused me to cry and would ruin my day and cause me to reevaluate our relationship. My own mental health got so much worse, I even tried therapy! He wouldn't!! He's somewhat better but I have a truckload of resentment because this is the third time he burdened me for weeks on end with zero professional help. I've lost interest in sex/making out and I barely want to talk to him. I feel broken and I worry I'm not in love and I feel so guilty and like maybe this is what love is like and I have to accept it. I shouldn't be bored of the closest person to me outside of my parents. I feel almost hopeless, thinking ""yeah this is the what love is really like after the first 2 years"". I analyse our relationship like 3+ hours a day. 

I also have horrific health anxiety. I can convince myself I have every type of cancer you could imagine. My doctor must be so sick of me.  This only started when our relationship was crumbling last June onwards. I get panic attacks sometimes and I regularly only sleep 5/6 hours because it takes me so long to settle into sleeping at night. Does this sound like a rut or a legit illness?",10Nov2020,1
19,im 17M and throughout my whole childhood i would always cry when i talked about my feelings. one time i was telling my doctor about the problems with my depression i was crying while talking to him. he left the room for 5 minutes and i stopped crying and when he came back in i continued to tell him about the stuff ive been going through and again i started to cry a bunch. am i just a crybaby or really sensitive?,10Nov2020,1
20,"so right now im 17M in a transitional shelter and i just thought i would tell you what's happened throughout my life to end up here.

so before i was even born my mother left my dad because he was abusive and after i was born it was basically just the two of us living together. when i was around 7 or 8 my mom met my now step dad and we moved in with him. 


he had a son who was 3 years older then me and a daughter that was 3 years younger then me. i wasn't used to having siblings but i got along fairly well with my step sister. my step brother would always bother me by tickling and i hated it. i would shout at him and tell him to stop and when my parents overheard me yelling at him they would always get mad and yell at me. 


we would sometimes go to visit my step dads family and whenever we did my step brother and step cousin would always exclude me from whatever they were doing and whenever they did include me they would bully me by taking my stuff, push me around, locking me out of the room and just tickle me. whenever i told them to stop my parents would again get mad at me. most of the time when we visited my step dads family i would always just sit alone and do my own thing because i was always excluded. 


my parents are also hypocrites... my mom always used to burp during dinner and one time i had pop and i accidentally burpred and i got yelled at from both my parents. 


one time we were all watching tv together and my step dad smelled a fart and immediately called me out even though i didn't do it. i said i didn't do it and he got mad and thought i was lying and told me to go to my room. 


whenever i did homework my dad would always make me cry and feel stupid. he would yell in my ear and slam the table whenever i didn't understand something. 


my mother would always beat me whenever i cried about something or did something bad. one time she repeatedly slapped me in the face and my nose started to bleed. another time i wouldn't stop crying and my step dad barged in my room and pinned me to the ground and took a pair of socks from my drawer and shoved it in my mouth while repeatedly shouting right in my face to shut up. 


whenever i did something bad or cried my mom would always call me a peice of shit, slap the shit outta me, grab/pull my hair and whip me with a belt. i understand that is a type of discipline and she is hispanic and spanish moms usually beat their kids but she didn't know when to stop... she would keep going even after i begging her to stop and repeatedly apologized for whatever i did. 


i remember after every time i got beat or yelled at i would always cry myself to sleep because felt like the world hated me for some reason. 


one time the family went on a trip to a resort and my step brother threw my flip flops in the water for some reason and i got mad. my mom wanted to take a photo in the pool of us all together and i didn't want too because my step brother was there and i was mad at him. my mother got angry and i knew she was going to hurt me. she started to walk towards me in the pool and i ran into the resort wearing nothing but my swim suit. i was scared for my life because i knew she was going to beat me badly and she followed me into the building. i was crying and running as fast as i could and my step dad ended up calming her down but ill never forget the fear i had that night. I've never ever felt that kind of fear even to this day. 


my mom forced me to keep my hair really long. it went past my shoulders and i hated it because i would always be mistaken for a girl and bullied at school for looking like a girl. 


i never felt safe to tell my parents anything because they would always yell at me for things i didn't do. i didn't trust them and i believed that they wouldn't care. when i was around 12 or 13 my step brother left to live with his biological mother because he and my step dad had problems and a year or two later my step sister followed for the same reasons. so that left it with just the 3 of us living in the house. 


ive tried living on the street before but i always ended up coming back because i always got too cold (i get cold very easily). i was never close with my parents. the only time i would talk to them is when i said hi and we would only eat together. on a holiday or when it was someone's birthday we would do something together. i haven't said happy mothers day to my mom because i hated her for the way she raised me. 


once i turned 17 i got really depressed and suicidal because i lost some friends and i was already sad because of covid. i wanted to see the doctor because i was depressed and couldn't sleep. i asked my parents to book an appointment and when they asked why i needed to see the doctor i didn't feel safe to tell them because i didn't trust them. i felt as if the wouldn't care so i just told them not to worry about it. 


i then discovered weed and that basically numbed the pain for me. i canceled the appointment because weed helped me. it helped me so much that i was using it 2 to 3 times a day. my parents found out and my mom basically disowned me. she called me a peice of shit and said im nothing to her anymore. i heard her talk to my step dad about kicking me out. i heard her tell my step dad that i was going to become a drunk. 


after they found out about my weed they stopped talking to me so i decided to stop talking to them. they then decided to stop feeding me and for 2 weeks i was only eating 1 meal a day and just a bunch of candy because it was cheap and i was saving money to move out. i had a bad diet and i got really skinny. i wasn't allowed to cook because my parents said i would make a mess and that i wouldn't clean it up. even though i would if they would just tell me to. 


my friends said i should buy a mini fridge and a microwave and put it in my room because they were really concerned about my health. i went and bought it with my money and brought it home. when i opened the door my step dad is there and he says im not bringing that inside but i still go inside and he pushes me out. i push back and he gets mad. at this point im just sick and tired of all of this. i was having withdrawal symptoms from weed and i was hungry and angry/depressed. i was ready to fight him there on the spot. 


my mom brings him back inside and they close the door on me. i start to bang on the door with the mini fridge and i try to unlock the door using the code. i keep banging on the window and my mom tells my step dad to call the police. after i hear that i started to get furious and i punched the door and my hand started bleed. my mom said i don't live here and i took a rake and started smashing the door handle after a couple of minutes i cool off and sit down and a cop shows up and comes outside to talk to me. i basically tell him everything about whats been happening these past two weeks you know the not feeding me, the depression, weed usage ex.


a social worker comes and says that i should go to the hospital and try to get some medication for my depression. she says my step dad can drive me but i want nothing to do with him so i asked the cop to drive me. when i get there i have to wait for the doctor to come and talk to me. i waited around 2 hours and suddenly i got fucking depressed as shit and i was contemplating about suicide again. 


i couldn't handle it anymore and i just walked out of the hospital. i took a walk and went to this school and sat down and just stared at the stars while listening to music for an hour thinking about my life... after i decided that the best option was to go back to the hospital. 


i walked back and waited for the doctor to come and i told him about what's been happening my whole life. not feeling loved, the abuse, and depression. i asked for medication but he said that the cause for my depression was probably due to the environment that im in and he said i could stay the night if i wanted to. 


i decided to stay the night and in the morning another doctor suggested i go to a transitional shelter. i agreed that that was a good idea and the hospital called a cab to take me home and grab some clothes and essentials and then take me to the shelter. i have to self isolate in the shelter for 14 days so im missing a little bit of school but thats okay. 


im currently on day 3 and I've been doing a lot of thinking and i finally feel a lot better. im no longer having suicidal thoughts and im closer with some friends. after the 14 days im going to be moved to this other center that is for minors and ill be staying there for however long i need. after that they are going to help me with housing and i might be able to finally get my own place. 


majority of my life ive felt shitty and sad. i cried a lot when i was younger and the way my parents handled it definitely didn't help the situation and i ended up hating them. 


they say they don't remember beating me till i bled and shoving socks in my mouth but ill never forget it. 


my mom says that her mom beat her when she was a kid but she should do better then. she shouldn't have her kid fear for his life when she gets mad 


in this post im pointing out all of the bad things thats happened in my life. i did have happy moments with my family that ive really enjoyed but i keep getting flash backs of all the times ive just been taking shit from them.


i just wished that they would check up on me and ask if everything's okay once in a while.


they always talk about seeing a therapist but i don't need to see one. i just want to feel loved and wanted.


i still some what love them a little .and don't want to completely cut them out of my life and i think im willing to forgive them but im not going back to that household because according to my mom ""i don't live there"". i want to live on my own with my own rules 


p.s the link isn't actually my mom beating me but its a very accurate representation of how she did

21,"I almost jumped into a busy road before school in 9th grade. I've had a long mental health journey. I'm in 12th grade now and I'm 17. I have a job, I am doing somewhat well at school, and I have a good relationship with my family.

I've had several close calls for myself, where I had to go to inpatient. I've lost quite a few friends. I barely have any now.

I'm still depressed. I obsess over fictional characters to make myself happy and yet, nothing else really makes me super happy. Playing video games, drawing, making 3d models, nothing makes me really happy anymore. I don't even know what I want to do after high school. I didn't think I would make it this far. I could go to collage, I could just go work, I could do whatever. 

but why? What would I even work towards? Surviving or Living? Life feels weird. I might experience things I didn't get to when I was in my teens? I'm currently surviving to make others happy. That's all I do in life. 

I do my school and work towards graduation. I live for my family's sake. I think what others don't understand about me is that I live for my friends. I live for my family. Giving them gifts and love is what I do. Making a joke out of myself so they laugh is what I do. 

I'm the least liked person in all my friend groups. What even is the fucking point of being around anymore. I try to join random discords or group chats to make new friends but it never works. They're either too large for me to be apart of the conversation or not active at all. 

All I want is to make others happy. If I died my family would be sad, so I stay alive. Even if I have no reason to.

Sorry for this long nonsense,, just upset rn. I didn't know where else to put these words.",10Nov2020,1
22,"Ever since I was young, there are always these overwhelming memories triggered by songs I like, or sometimes I don't remember listening to. Until now, it still happens and those overwhelming memories coming back are vivid and sometimes I feel like I'm currently present in that memory. I sometimes remember the smell, the feeling, and other things I can't explain. It gives me a certain rush of emotions I can't control and it makes it seem like I'm dissociating with the present. 

I'm curious if anyone of you also feels the way I feel? Is this normal? I'm always afraid to ask the people around me because if they don't feel the way I feel, they might call me crazy or the like.",10Nov2020,1
23,"I’ve had my fair share of abusive relationships, family or romantic...but this is something totally different. I don’t cry 3 times a week because of him, he reassures me anytime I’m overthinking or experiencing anxiety, we communicate but we also comprehend well. Everything is so new and wonderful and my boyfriend is my safe space. And i’m his. 

I had dinner with him and his family a few times and they are amazing and really funny. I fit in with them. And I want to keep being a part of that, I value family so much and the fact that I get to spend time and talk with them helps me understand him more.

The sex is the best i’ve ever had, and the cuddles afterwards make me feel warm and fuzzy. 

Every ‘disagreement’ is us vs. the issue, not us vs. each other. It gives me more hope for our future together, the fact that we work so well and can be straightforward with each other. 

I’m just really really happy and I feel like I don’t have to be afraid with him, I’m not afraid that we’ll break up or have a horrible fight or anything like that because we both know what we want and we understand our boundaries and needs. 

Every mental health issue that we’ve experienced has been reassured and dealt with in the ways that we had discussed beforehand, so we know what we both need when those things happen and we can help or not help when we need to.

24,"How do I begin the journey of working on my mental health? I’m 20 and I’ve only recently gotten into a good place in life where I can seek help. 

I’ve been told to start a conversation with my primary doctor, but how would I do that? Maybe make a general appointment? What would I even say to them? 

The closest therapist is hours away, and I’ve always had issues talking it out; I always get frustrated and shut down. How would I even seek one out? I don’t think a therapist would provide much help, but again, I’ve never been able to get any help mentally before now.

The main thing is, I don’t want to self-diagnose. Ideally, I’d like to go to a medical professional and just rule some things out, and possibly see why I’m so nervous and scared all the time.

Sorry if this question is dumb, I just don’t know where or how to start. Googling hasn’t helped me at all. 

Thank you!",10Nov2020,1
25,I’m 17 and feeling pretty hopeless about life in general. I realized that I only live so that others don’t get hurt and I feel disconnected from everything. I can’t focus on anything because there’s always something bigger in my mind like thoughts of what I am or death. Anyway my dreams keep being absolutely horrible. This morning I woke up because everything somehow felt crazy real and I felt the anxiety through my whole body or something. I was engulfed. Then when I tried to go back to sleep I had the same thing happen and in my dream I started feeling like my stomach was upset and I had high anxiety in it. I woke up instantly and felt as if I slept only a couple hours. These past few weeks I’ve ben scared to go to sleep and when I close my eyes scary thoughts start coming in and I end up sleeping at 5am every night. It’s annoying. Has anyone else gone through this?,10Nov2020,1
26,"I’ve been experiencing this mental phenomenon for a few years now, and it’s really hard to describe. The best way to put it into words is that my brain is looping with false memories, or memories that I’m not sure about. Like, my brain will non-stop be replaying memories that didn’t actually happen. The “replays” layer over the top of one another, resulting in me hearing multiple thoughts at the same time.
As soon as one thought is done, I can’t remember it anymore, so every time I try to explain what I was just thinking I can’t. It can be triggered really easily, for eg if I hear a certain song, I’ll think “I remember hearing this song at Kate’s party”, then I remember there was no party, and Kate doesn’t exist. 

All of these thoughts are usually combined with an intense feeling of impending doom. But at the same time, while it’s happening, I can still walk and talk normally and on the outside appear normal.

I’ve been on 20mg lexapro for two years and have been experiencing this since before I started taking it, and do experience it regardless of whether or not I’ve taken it. I have depression, anxiety, and an eating disorder. No family history of any more “intense” mental disorders, lol.

I’ve tried to talk to doctors about this before and the one psych I mentioned it to smirked and dismissed me. I’m a 25 year old female btw.

I’ve learned to appreciate the good and bad days equally now because that’s just how life works. I’m only 20 years old and for once I actually see a future for myself. I found a girl who makes me incredibly happy and I couldn’t ask for better. I think she’s the one. I’ve started doing CrossFit every single day which has helped me tremendously. I just wanted to share this just so people know that there is a way out of depression. Please don’t be afraid to message me on here if you need someone to talk to.

29,"My boyfriend seemed to be having a mental breakdown; he was panicking and scared, very manic, and couldn’t focus his mind. That night he left the house while I was in the bathroom and drove off. He wouldn’t tell me where he was and then the next morning he blocked my phone number and all contact with me after telling me he needs space in order to get his mind right again. 
After three weeks of no contact or anything, I was extremely worried, so I drove to his mom’s house where I expected he’d be. He wasn’t there, so I parked down the street and waited for a bit. After a while, he drove up to the house and saw my car and pulled up next to me. He got out and screamed at me with so much anger and said he was done with me. He then called the police and told them I was harassing him, they came and questioned me and told me to stay away from him and cease all contact. 

Come to find out, after talking with his grandma a few days later, he is having paranoid delusions that I’ve been drugging him for the last few months. He also thinks my family is involved in drug trafficking, and that I’ve been on drugs for months too. None of this is anywhere near the truth, and I have no idea where these ideas came from. Neither of us do any drugs other than smoke weed and cigarettes. I’ve spent nearly every single day with him for the past few months and for a long while we were with each other all day long everyday; he would have undoubtedly seen some kind of indication that I was on drugs. This delusion is completely out of the blue and I have no idea what I did to make him think these crazy things. 

It’s been a month now since he left the house that night and I’ve had no more contact than those two events. I don’t know if he’s getting help or what he’s been doing for the last month. 
At this point I don’t know if I should keep waiting for the real him to be back. He’s made it very clear that he doesn’t ever want to see me again; but he wasn’t himself when he said that, I could see a crazy look in his eyes and he didn’t look like himself at all. 

Will he come out of this delusion and see the truth? Or will he believe these delusions forever?

Is it a waste of my time to keep holding onto the hope that he’ll be back to himself one day? I’d wait for him forever but I don’t know if that’s foolish or not. Since I have no contact whatsoever all I can do is wait for him to reach out, and idk if that’ll ever happen. 

I’m just looking for any kind of advice on what I can do in this situation. I want to help him so bad, but I have no idea how since I have no contact with him anymore. 
I don’t know if it’s best to keep waiting or just move on.",10Nov2020,1

I don't know where to start because I got so much on my mind but when I decide to write it down or think about it, it all comes to a halt. However I live with my siblings and parents and I don't like them, I'm the annoying one in the family because I can't handle my impulses and anger issues so I keep myself locked in my room and barely go downstairs because I get easily annoyed by people talking to me and it raises my hearbeat if I hear something stupid, annoyin,  lights and sounds like sneezing, annoys me af e.t.c. Im enrolled in College, last year and I'm interested in what im doing (International relations) but I barely have motivation to start and rather stay inside in my room unbothered by everyone watching documentaries, reading forums, news etc. I also exercise 5x a week just to get out the house. However I got some friends I hang out with 2-3 times a month from high school they're very nice but I still find it amnoying to be in a social setting because im Introverted as hell and it makes my merve tense when stuff gets too boring or slow.  Im always in my house overthinking about my future career (Can't find no real job except administration as a Pol Sci Candidate here in Europe), finding an apartment to get away from family and friends, overthinking about when next people gonna contact me and most of the time they're just asking for stuff which makes me hate friends/humans way more.  Don't get me wrong I can be social but I prefer my own company and can have a good conversation with people
on the internet, im not shy either but I dont like being bothered. Being inside most of the time also gives me more anxiety and overthinking but I got nothing to do outside except working out in the gym since I dont like friends (most of them just want to use me for stuff) and I love my family but I easily get annoyed by them. People always ask me why im so calm irl but in reality my mind is a complete wreck always overthinking, analyzing and being bothered by everything.

34,"I had an edible for the first time on Saturday. Saturday was my birthday. I got it near a dispensary near my house, because weed is legal in my state. I was told to only take 10mg since it was my first time so I had two gummies. When I got home I started to feel the effects of the edible and it was terrifying. I heard voices, felt like I was dying, and even had disturbing thoughts that I felt like I was going to kill myself. I called 911 and I was taken to the hospital and they basically kept me there over night until my high died down. As of Sunday and today I am experiencing losing touch with reality, and constant suicidal thoughts. I am currently in the emergency room and I’m so afraid that this is never going to end or stop. My doctor prescribed me something called risperidone which is only about 1 mg. I took it today and took a nap and woke up feeling super sluggish and slow along with feeling even MORE anxiety. I feel so unsafe at home, I feel like I’m going to hurt myself or kill myself. The day I took the edible I was wishing death on myself because my birthday was awful. My doctor told me the medication can cause weight gain but only for long term use. And he told me that I would only be taking it for two weeks. I’m so scared guys. I’m 21 and don’t want to die. I hate these thoughts and I’ll never take another edible in my life again. I’m just asking for advice. I don’t want to gain weight, I don’t want to die, I don’t want to feel like I’m losing myself.

He confessed to me that nothing makes him happy any more and life has no meaning for him.

I always try to be there for him and try to support him emotionally but it doesn't seem to be enough. I've also tried to talk about therapy with him but he is in denial since he things that's bs. I don't thing that his other friends worry about him as much as i do because he is always talking about suicide so most of them take it as a joke. Also he has a very bad relationship with his mother (doesn't have a father) and he lives with his grandfather who is very old.I took the decision to reach for help because today (he was drunk at our mutual friend's birthday party) got very depressed and wanted to end it all but almost nobody took him serious so i was next to him the whole night trying to talk to him and keep him company and that got me very upset and sad to be honest because it's the second time I expiriance something like that...

I always tried to be there for her but near the end of our relationship i realized that all the effort I had put didn't help her at all and that broke me psychologicaly...

39,"i suffer with bipolar disorder type 1 and psychotic features, just to preface. but ever since i was about 14 i've had really distressing thoughts regarding homicide. as a kid i was mostly good but i could be a troublemaker (hiding other kids belongings, talking when i'm not supposed to, getting up when i wasn't supposed to.) it mostly died down in middle school as far as i can remember but in high school i started hurting my friends. i choked a few of them on multiple occasions and always laughed it off as i didn't realize or care i had just hurt and scared them. i'm quite a quiet person nowadays, i have very explosive moods though, and i don't have any friends because i don't really care about other people, i'm fine not having anyone to talk to or any type of relationships. and it doesn't bother me, i broke up with my long term girlfriend and cut off about 5 of my friends in a 3 month span. back to the homicidal thoughts, the first time it happened was when i was 14 and i was unloading the dishwasher and grabbed a big butcher knife, my stepmom was sitting with her back facing me and an entire plan formed in my head about how i could execute it and i felt really strongly about my thoughts saying to do it. though, i pushed it away and forgot about it. she was very abusive towards me and i wish i'd never met her. last year though, when i was 19, i started to get very paranoid about people and had a lot of thoughts about killing my friends because i thought they were sent by her to get me to kill myself from being so miserable so that she didn't have to kill me herself and that she'd have my dad all to herself. i still have the thoughts and throughout my life i've remembered times and plans that i've made to hurt people, but i've never killed anyone because blood and all of that really grosses me out. is this concerning? should i bring it up with my doctor? it's been weighing on my thoughts for a while now. i don't take any medications for my disorder (i know, bad.) but i really hate how they make me feel.",10Nov2020,1

In honour of Movember, we're having an online event called TalleyTalk that will be focused on Men's mental health. Our TalleyTalks are anonymous, interactive discussions that we host over Zoom. Think of them like podcasts; we have a host and co-hosts and listeners. The difference is that listeners can also join in the conversation.

The year before I was in multiple quick ending relationships that well tore me apart and I quickly felt as though I was losing grip of myself. This ended after I met my now current girlfriend now been dating for close to a year and 4 months. 

I feel as though I am losing my grip again and slowly starting to feel less and less towards people each day. Dont get me wrong I love my family and my girlfriend but inside I get nothing. College now feels frantic and unplanned and well doesnt make things better.

I have thought of suicide before to clarify and find myself thinking of it again and stopping myself by thinking of my loved ones mainly my dog.

I'm tired of everything because no matter what I say or do nothing changes for the better. Most nights I feel as though I crave alcohol but I stop myself from it as I've had friends go down that route and I dont want to follow them. All I'm worried about is what if thinking about my loved ones doesnt do anything anymore. But most of the time I just want to go away and be with myself and all I get told is I need to talk and interact with others yet we can't.

I'm feeling so done in having to follow this path into what would be a dead end boring job having me sat at a desk then luckily getting 28 days holiday a year all to curl up in a ball and die with most of my earnings from a droning job to be given away to a government that does nothing but fuck pigs and call Muslim women letterboxes.

52,"So this is going to be a kinda long story with many variables to consider. So last year I joined the navy and was away from July 2019 to January 2020 and when I got back from training my girlfriend of 5 years told me she wanted to break up. I’m a very calm person so I was more observant than emotional and I knew something was off with the way she was doing it so we talked for a while and I could tell it almost seemed as though she didn’t want to but had to. I eventually convinced her to stay for a while longer so that she could at least make a decision after we were together for a while. She seemed relieved to hear that so of course that confirmed to me that something was off. 

A few months passed and I she was super emotional one day we were together so I asked her what was wrong and she told me that while I was gone in October that she was raped. This destroyed me mentally but I knew that it would be an insult to her and what happened if I let it myself become the focus and she begged me not to do anything so reluctantly I didn’t push who the person was because she refused to tell me (because anyone in my position would want to do exactly the same thing about it) and I knew it’s harmful to force a victim of that to report it if they don’t want to so I tried my best to just push it aside. 

I then found her a therapist and she steadily got better however I am under a mandatory reporting contract with my job so if I went to a therapist and talked about it, there’s a chance I could get in trouble for not reporting it or simply exposing something that she didn’t want exposed. After she was done with the therapy in August of this year she actually broke up with me. 

So now I was left in the dust with so much anger towards her, the rapist, and im stuck not being able to seek help out of fear that I’ll get screwed by the mandatory reporting issue or I’ll be diagnosed with mental illness and that will forever remain on my records. I have absolutely no idea what to do about this and it’s affected my life exponentially. Is there any way I can get help with absolutely 100% confidentiality? Or any other advice someone could offer me? 

Also I’m not suicidal because I’m way too angry to just lose like that. However I almost feel like every time I see a man I feel like “that’s the person who did it” and it’s destroyed me socially and I feel like I have anxiety and depression now.",10Nov2020,1

54,"TL;DR I don't believe in demons, but I'm thinking about being posessed so often I'm scared I will start believing it. 

Maybe I'm overanalyzing myself. I am not religious or spiritual, but every day for the past 2 or 3 months I have been obsessively thinking about being possessed.

When I was little I could not be alone at all out of fear of ghosts, I had nightmares and sleep paralysis/night terrors constantly. I would feel like I was being watched. Despite being so shy and fearful, I also had anger issues and I would often fantasize about being able to turn into a monster to scare people into leaving me alone if I felt they were mean to me. 

I would fantasize about terrible things. I never acted on these thoughts. In fact I would say I was especially sensitive about killing anything. I remember crying for days over a bug dying in a nature documentary and so I wasn'tallowed to watch them anymore. It was like there was a kind, hypersensitive side of me and a separate, control-obsessed little creep occupying space in my head as well.

Around the 5th grade I realized I was cruel and angry and weird, and suddenly it all stopped, I have not thought about any of this since then. But the nightmares have continued, albeit way less frequently, maybe once a year. I have terrifying sleep paralysis and see this horrible thing coming closer and closer getting stronger and stronger each time.

For some reason I have been thinking about all this a lot lately. I know I sound crazy but I am actually a pretty normal person. I have been in therapy since age 17 for anxiety, not related to the feelings of being watched, more like anxiety about school and struggling to focus. 

I was just diagnosed as ADHD (started taking 20mg adderall) about 4 or 5 months ago and that has pretty much taken care of my anxiety. I have a job, a healthy relationship with my bf, creative hobbies, good friendships and all that, I have actually never been happier since being treated for ADHD. What's with these memories of what a disturbing angry FREAK I was growing up?

I suddenly have this desire again to ""be scary"" and fantacizing about doing threatening things. I have also been fantasizing about being manipulative, seeing how good I am at it. Not to hurt anyone, just to see how much I can influence people (for example seeing if I can get jobs I'm not qualified for through manipulation). This creeps me out and I recognize these things are wrong. I have actually been considering finding an exorcist. The thought of being put through that excites me... like the ""entity"" feels excited inside me.

I don't know what to call this. I don't ACTUALLY believe in possession, so why do I keep thinking about it? Are these just intrusive thoughts? Just making vague connections? Is this what the start if psychosis feels like? I don't have hallucinations or hear voices, I don't think something will inhabit my body and make me do things, I don't have any desire to really hurt anyone, but these thoughts concern me nontheless. I have told my therapist that I was an angry child but not really anything else because I'm scared he'll think I'm dangerous. What the fuck is this and what do I do?",10Nov2020,1

62,"M17

Earlier this year I was hospitalized with severe depression and made a pretty good recovery. While there were other factors involved, one factor that has been consistent with a drop in my mood is when I like someone.

Things could be going absolutely great, I could be dating this person, I could be in love with them, things could be going meh, things could be going nowhere, or things could be horrible and yet seemingly no matter the situation, I begin showing depressive symptoms. This has been going on for years and I think it was a big factor with my severe depressive episode earlier this year.

I have so many other things that should be bringing me to a depressive state of mind, yet I have been denying for too long that the reason seems to be romantic relationships.

Just recently I thought a girl was interested in me and I held casual/flirty conversation with her. That same day I began feeling the way I was when I was at the beginning of the first stages of my last depression.

I had began eating healthier and I was pretty contempt despite the many stressors that I was and am experiencing.

As soon as that girl was in the picture (it was going pretty smooth and fine) things went downhill fast. I began watching videos on BestGore again that I thought I was never going to watch again, I stopped eating better, I had a fuck it attitude, I have drank alcohol 3 days straight and was so drunk yesterday I couldn't walk right, and my mood has been steadily declining.

I realized she likely wasn't interested and just cut ties and I feel like I may already feel a tad bit better.

Why am I so mentally incapable of having a relationship? I mean to be fair all of my past relationships ended bad.

The first ""gf"" I had I didn't even have a phone and so over the summer nothing happened and I broke up with her. She called me nasty shit but she was also a bit psycho (would sit in a dark room crying wondering if I actually like her... got out of there thankfully) but this was in middle school so whatever.

In middle school again I really liked a girl and always sat with her but she was older and not interested lol. That made me go a little weird and was around the same time I picked up the habit of watching really bad videos.

Then I moved (military) and got a ""gf"" in 8th grade. She paid no attention to me and never brought forth a proper reason for liking me other than that I paid attention to her. (Another weird emo type deal I guess) She also lied to me about going to a dance or some shit and that hurt my little middle school heart haha. I know it's all insignificant but that really hurt since I really wanted to go with her. Broke that off in Freshmen year of HS after I realized she is just there and not doing anything. Forgot my birthday, never did anything for me, etc.

Then in High School I dated another girl and we went too fast I think. We decided we were just better off as friends (I still talk to her today, she's cool and I like her as a friend) but what hurt a bit was when I called her to break up the first words out of her mouth were ""OH THANK GOD."" She right away said that's not what it sounded like but that it was just because she thought the same of me (as in just friends) but nevertheless that fucking hurt a little.

Then in Junior year a girl and I were actually doing really good but never dated. She had abusive parents (idk why I seem to be attracted to those girls, I never know their situation but almost all so far have been not the best in terms of mental health) and never had time. She kept manipulating me with stupid Tik Tok challenges, leading me on and then dropping me, leading me on and then dropping me, so on and on. That REALLY messed with my head. Add on top high school stress, no sleep, some trauma from watching really fucked up stuff (and feeling emotions I did not want to feel when watching those things), feeling a bit left out of the whole High School thing, and varying family issues, I fell into that depression. I looked awful. I stopped talking to anyone and anything. Ate lunch by myself and separated myself from everyone I ever talked to. Lost crazy weight, no sleep, pale as a mf, barely nudging myself through the hallways, just wanting to sleep or die (I had non stop suicidal thoughts and it drove me insane).

That puts us to now. Got out of that depressive cycle but now feel like I am going back in the cycle with that one girl I was talking to. I right away was scared of the depression coming back from it, I was overthinking things, and I had overall shitty mood day and night. Not depressive and not 24/7 per se but it was slowly getting there again.

Why? Does anyone else have this? I have been in denial about this likely being the triggers to my depressive cycle because I feel so stupid that a likely non significant potential relationship shifts my mindset so bad. I have a million other things that could easily throw me into a depression for legitimate reasons but a girl? Why? It's embarrassing to have that be the reason and makes me feel like some softy child and that's why I think I am in denial about the whole thing. I don't understand it. Is there some underlying issue with me? Vulnerability? Is it a result of bad experiences over and over again? I don't get it.

Any help, experiences, or comments would be really appreciated because I want to be able to function like a normal person. It'd be really appreciated as two other subs have not answered and one actually took down my post because it was a yes or no question?? Knowing that relationships trigger my depression is not great because that feeds the thought cycle of being single and alone my entire life, which adds on top of other depressive thoughts.",10Nov2020,1
63,"I'm almost 18 years old and I've been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for almost 10 years now. I'm applying to colleges and was going to write about struggling with this stuff for one of the essay prompts.  I told my counselor I didn't know if it was a good idea because I'm still struggling, but she told me that no one expects me to get over it and I'll have to live and deal with it for the rest of my life. 

Is this really true? I was already having a shitty day but hearing that just made it twice as bad. I thought that was only true for people who had chronic depression. How do I know if my depression is chronic? I don't remember if they told me when I was diagnosed. If I was relatively happy before the age of 8 that must mean it's not chronic right?

64,"Righ so basicalliy i think i might have adhd or some other mental illness but i dont know weather its me thinking i have it but im completley fine and im just lazy forgetful etc etc. i would never have thought of this until i started reading up on it and just to point out ive read that the more intelligent you are the better you cope with symoptoms/have milder symptoms somthing like that and im almost certain that while im not very school smart for apparent reasons that im pretty intelligent.

to note i also scored quite high across the board for multiple personality disorders like aspd scitzoid borderline narcassistic (I KNOW THESE ONLINE TESTS ARE NOT 100% FACT) WAY ACCURATE but i wouldnt assume anyone would describe me as someone with one of these disorders as im pretty calm and a in general good guy to be around apart from being pretty un talkative

what ive noticed:

Would always have partial attention payed in class i would be hearing whats happening and looking out the window or doodling or swinging on my chair lost in though and have to zone back in. i would almost always understand the topic if i payed absolute full atention and thats in Uk A-levels (im guessing UKa levels are USA your AP classes or whatever?) maths and physics but that was very rare

Would never revise for exams properly until the night before or i was \`constantly told by my parents

was never and am still never organised, never had a pencil case in school a ""borrowed"" pen and a small ruler was the most you would get on a very very lucky day and most of the time i would loose them within a day or two, always forget my clock in card for work, house keys

ive been at uni for 1 month and ive done a total of about 3 hours work and i keep telling myself ill do it later or (choose not to) forgetting then remembering and telling myself ill do it later repeat. i will literally be bored out of my mind and doing my uni work wouldnt even cross my mind

Would almost never do a homework until the night before or morning of due date not because i put it off but because it just never even crossed my mind that i might have homework or when it did i would think ok ill check in a minuite and then forget

Would never clean up not because i didnt want to but i would always say ill do it later and forget every time unless i saw a empty cup on my way out of a room for example

my memory is pretty general until someone reminds me of something i would probably never think of it

when speaking to friends i dont talk as much as most other people and if i do its usually sarcastic/witty comments or joking banter personal stories but very specific or interessting just to be a part of it i guess etc dont really get very personal with people unless they bring it up

when speaking to people 1 on 1 i would say im pretty interessting at first but then kind of become a background character because i can never keep conversation flowing i usually respond in a joking manner or i try to be interessted but just cant come up with things to say so i just say somthing like thats mad and try to think of a time ive experienced somthing like that but i usually havent so just say some lie nothing big just somthing to fill the gap and see if they say something back

i smoke alot weed vape cigs etc not because im addicted although i might be i just havent decided to quit yet i just do it when im bored which is pretty often sometimes i do other drugs but not regularly.

lots of careless mistakes in everyday life, forgetting keys walking into a room with one purpose and doing somthing else

other people are of secondary importance to me i wont go out of my way to be a dick and im almost always never meaning it on a personal level if i insult you but if i upset you  im really not bothered

sometimes people will say somthing right infront of me and i will hear them but i will have absolutley no idea what they said after

66," 

Diagnosed at 7 years old I have severe anxiety, for the past 8 years I have been dealing with it, sometimes getting worse sometimes it gets better. But I had daily panic attacks for a few years, I was 7 years old and worried about if I was gonna have a panic attack that day or not.

It was and has been one of the biggest things I've struggled with my whole life, In the past few years it has gotten worse but better. But this year has made me struggle the most, I am not one of those kids who claim to have a mental illness. It makes me mad people have the nerve to fake it, to use it to climb in the social ranks or whatever. To be quirky, but honestly if people knew what it's actually like to fear waking up and going to sleep because at night the knot in your stomach gets worse.

This last year things were alright and all of a sudden this year hit me like a bus, My grandmother passed away, my dog died a few weeks later. Then my best friend who is like a big sister to me left back to Germany and that's when I completely lost it, I had panic attacks, stayed up crying while kids my age were out being kids, covid hit us all we were locked up for 9 months and I was up for more than 24 hours because my sleep problems came and hit me. I was scared, I wanted out of my head I couldn't get away from it, I was scared of sleeping and being awake.

But this time I wasn't on any basic meds, I was truly terrified, I had no idea what to do, how to be a kid. How to be normal like these other kids, and I struggle to this day and have for 8 years. It is not easy, but it has made me stronger than ever, I struggle so much to this day and actually as were speaking I am very very anxious, but I know I at least have a space to vent. to anyone our there, our anxiety will never truly go away, but we need to beat it, be strong please I am begging you as scary as it might be never give up.",10Nov2020,1

70,"  

It’s oft-repeated that suicide occurs when people reach their ultimate point of depression, or when they feel they have no options. I instead wonder if suicide is more a fine point of time, and whether one can be too depressed for suicide, and if you hit that point, you are just doomed to forever live in a state where suicide is your longed-for release, but something you cannot ultimately ever accomplish?

My personal experience says it’s the latter, tells me that you can reach a point where suicide is the desired outcome, but where you actually don’t believe that the action will offer any release. As I seem compelled to do, I have to intellectually evaluate how I reached this point, what this point says about me, and must apparently exist long enough to evaluate whether one can actually ever break through that state in life, or are you doomed to stay in the orbit of that feeling – your path getting further from that “Sun” of depression, but inevitably being pulled back into the inner core as your eternal path brings you closer?

Interestingly enough, when thinking about the orbital path concept that just popped into my head for the writing of this, I can actually see its aptness for this discussion. If we are talking about bodies such as asteroids and comets, they do travel between getting attracted by stars and planets and do even travel between star systems. So, is there a point in the orbital depression where you can get far enough away from the Sun to break free – sure, but any astrologist will tell you that it takes the pull of another body to break you from that orbit. The odds aren’t necessarily 50/50 which path you will take, but there are options. 

On the more optimistic side, another star (let’s say happiness or contentment) comes close enough that it exerts enough force on you to break your orbit from depression. Now I am going to sail past the idea that it might just exert enough force to pull you from the orbit of the Sun, but not enough to bring you into its orbit, and thus may leave you in some potentially worse permanent state of “blah” as you drift aimlessly. But instead, pulled into your new orbit around happiness or contentment, you have a chance to live a life where you are fulfilled, and achieve your goals and desires. 

On the pessimistic side, as your orbit depression, and through the solar system gets close enough to one of the planets, one of them exerts enough force onto you to pull you into its orbit, and let’s say almost inevitably a collision with the surface (let’s call this planet suicide). 

In this situation, we see that the default orbit is a maintained state of depression, and it is only through an event (or series of them) where you get sucked onto a path where suicide is the destination. 

But where in this metaphor is the person who is beyond suicide? Theoretically, they’ve circled planet suicide at different points throughout their lives, so why wasn’t the inevitability fulfilled? To bring this into the realm of the tortured metaphor. I would say that this person is a kin to the asteroid which breaks orbit with the  Sun, heads toward a collision course with a planet, and has the gravity of the Sun or another body interact with it enough to pull it off a collision course with the planet, and have the situation simply end up with an altered orbit around the Sun, 

Note: Here’s where I have to distinguish between accidental and purposeful suicides, and simply say that I am focused here on purposeful suicides, and not on typically people with substance abuse histories who are trying to numb their pain, and do so too successfully. I’m focused here on the people who take conscious actions toward suicide. 

I am unable to trace the origins of my suicide fatalism, but it is this fatalism which has allowed me to survive numerous trips in towards planet suicide, just to have this fatalism act on me and tow me back to my depression orbit. Whether it was my constant sense of being in physical danger during large parts of my adolescence, or my general lifelong dose of bad luck, I truly feel like I’d survive any attempt, and simply do more damage to myself and simply wish harder for death because of the physical pain I’d have inflicted. 

To drop a bit deeper into my psychology, there is another reason I haven’t attempted to kill myself, but just like the one above, it does stem from me wanting to avoid more pain. Simply put - I don’t believe in instantaneous death. Look at those times we are doing something we truly love, hours can pass in the blink of an eye. Or, look at those days of drudgery at work, a couple of hours can feel like an entire workweek should’ve passed (you can also see LL Cool J’s definition of the relativity of time from “Deep Blue Sea.” 

So with this relativity of time, why would I ever think I could cause myself the level of harm needed to cause death without causing myself what could end up seeming like an eternity of excruciating pain? Now for those of you who are saying “why not take some pills and drift off to sleep” – If you dream about waterfalls when you have to piss, fire when you get hot, or showing up to school naked when you are stressed, why would you not dream about the slowing of your heart, the seizure, or other physical ailments which precipitate your death from the pills? And why would those be anything but the most realistic, long, and devastating dreams of your life?

The truth is that every time I truly contemplate killing myself, these fatalistic beliefs eclipse the suicidal ideation and pull me back to ceaseless orbit.",10Nov2020,1

BUT, BIG BUT, everytime i work on them im getting reminded that, by this age i was supposed to have cultivated some of these values and i way behind on schedule and it gets me depressed.

They are the values that i need to push on in getting better at them and i havent cultivated them at all

78,"I'm writing this while emotionally distressed, so apologies if this isn't a good place to post. I've never really posted on this site before.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm completely ashamed of myself. I can't change no matter how hard I try, or rather, it's that I can't even try at all. I procrastinate on all of my work. I can't bring myself to do it in a timely manner, but it's more than that. I can't bring myself to go get a haircut. I can't make myself say yes to playing a board game with friends. I avoid going out to places even though I know I'll have a fun time. I can't bring myself to cook food for myself. I can't make myself go to bed before 2am. I can't wake up for my classes. Oftentimes, I wake up, and I just go back to bed until 1pm. I can't bring myself to tell the company that I interned with of my future plans, so that I can have a job lined up out of college. I can't make myself work out for very long, I've only ever lasted 3 weeks. I can't even get a therapist because I give up after emailing them once. I've started so many personal projects, too, but I always give up on them before long.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't change, and I'm so tired. I want to be better, but I can't. I'm locked into this flow. I need help, but I'm such a lazy piece of garbage that I can't do anything to get it. I keep making the same mistakes over and over, and I can't stop myself from repeating them. My only motivator is fear.",10Nov2020,1

I don’t even feel sad anymore it’s all just really numb. I cried today for the first time in a while and it made me realize I haven’t felt anything that deep in a bit. I feel really weird about it because I used to vomit and have major panic attacks about things I do now without thinking twice. Like I go out and I’m happy but it’s an almost empty happy like I’m playing a part. I don’t even want to watch tv anymore I’m just super tired. I also used to be awake constantly it was a running joke that I was basically an insomniac and now all I can do is sleep. I’m still getting all my commitments done so I feel weird complaining. I have let chores and basic tasks pile up because there’s no real due date for showering or cleaning. I almost like it because although I’m not happy by any means it’s better than crying and anxiety attacks.

86,"I don’t know where to start with this honestly. Warning, mention of severely disturbing dreams relating to children, death etc.

Also reference the NHS and UK institutions as that’s where I’m based.

I’ve dealt with severe depression in life and found the help available to be of use. At this point I’d say I manage it reasonably well and in the healthiest way I can.

I’m on enough antidepressants that I don’t feel depressed. Honestly I’d love to try coming off them but I don’t know what would happen.

That said, I’ve dealt with a hell of a lot of shit in the past two years. My anxiety is through the roof, I’m not working for the first time in my life, I’ve had a recent diagnosis of ADHD and I’m beginning treatment but I’m still dealing with the aftermath of it being untreated for years.

I won’t bore you with the details but I (27F) have had ovarian cancer, dealt with medical negligence leading to me losing the chance of kids forever and seriously fucking up my head after a mishandled operation and a second one to fix it, I recently lost my beloved dog who was like a child to me in a violent distressing way, and I’ve got ongoing stress from toxic family I just can’t seem to detach myself from.

I don’t sleep without pills and when I do I have really traumatic nightmares in which kids get brutally tortured or killed in front of me, or a guy tries to cut me open with a knife and I try to cut him open first to protect myself. Often I dream of losing a pregnancy or something horrible happening to a child I can’t protect. 

These dreams are so fucking vivid. I woke up screaming and crying after dreaming about some Negan-style bad guys bouncing a little kid off the wall like a puppet, me picking him up to cuddle him and feeling his shattered ribs. I can still remember how it felt.

I remember how hard it felt dragging a jagged knife through a man’s chest and the knife getting caught on his organs. I remember the agony of him slicing me open but knowing I couldn’t stop to protect myself, I had to kill him first if I wanted to survive. I remember the blood hitting my face.

I’ve always dreamed a lot but they’re so fucking vivid it’s awful.

Plus I’m dealing with executive dysfunction. I always thought it was just depression keeping me from doing stuff but even when I’m feeling good it’s a huge fight to make myself do boring chores like dishes and housework. 

I can do interesting things like splitting logs no problem (even though it’s quite repetitive, it’s not something I do often so it feels new/interesting and oddly soothing) but load the dishwasher? Not happening.

I am working so hard to keep making myself do it anyway, it’s better than it’s ever been but only because I’m not working and not under huge pressure. The financial strain of that is another issue though.

Despite all this, I got rejected for PIP. The letter essentially boiled down to “you say you’re struggling, I’ve decided you’re fine, you don’t need help to cope, go fuck yourself” and it destroyed me. All my life I’ve worked my ass off and now I’m falling apart and asking for support left right and centre and they won’t fucking give it to me.

Saw a psychiatrist through cancer support charity. She said I seem fine cause I told her I have good coping strategies for certain things.

Doctor referred me to the hospital mental health team. Waited months for an appointment. Finally had it last week. Get a letter on Saturday - “we are referring you back to GP. You’re fine. Go fuck yourself”

I just...I feel that I’m failing. I can’t “do” life, I can’t handle the basic functions and the message I’m getting is I don’t need help. That means I should be managing this shit the way “normal people” do. I can tell myself it’s not that simple but the response I’m getting from mental health support is that I’m fine.

I feel like they won’t take me seriously unless I say I’m suicidal which I won’t do because there are people who actually are who need that help more than me. Doesn’t mean I am fine though.

The only agency that were any help is the private one I saw for my ADHD assessment; they were amazing but I was given the money for that assessment by a kind family member and I’m not in a position to use them ongoing. The NHS just doesn’t care and wants to pass me off.

I just don’t know what my next step is. I need therapy and I need someone who cares about helping me and not constantly passing me on to other support teams who tell me they can’t help me.

Guess I’m on my fucking own.

Sorry this turned into a long rant.

TL;DR: every time I ask for support, I get told I’m fine. I feel like giving up and I don’t know what to do next.",10Nov2020,1

He, unfortunately, forgave me, he’s being sweet, like nothing happened and I’m so angry at myself, I wanted him to yell at me, I wanted him to break up with me because I deserve it. I can’t live with the guilt, I’m constantly crying and he’s trying to make me feel better (which sucks because he’s the one who’s supposed to be sad).

89,"I don't know why, but I've always felt disconnected with the people around me. They can be laughing about something funny and I'll just fake smile along. On top of this, I lie and cheat on things very easily, I've taken money from my roommate with no remorse, and I don't really feel guilty about what I've already mentioned. I don't know why, but whenever I compliment people it's because I know they are people that will be of benefit later in my life. Even in big fights with my friend I never really cared in my heart, even though I cried at the time. I was never sad, just stressed. I just feel very empty most of the time, and I think there's something wrong with me emotionally. I feel like I have an skewed moral compass. All of these things in my life are true and there's not enough space to go into detail, but I want to know if I may be suffering from something else, because I'd rather not have an antisocial disorder, because the idea of being disconnected from the world is scary. Like, I've never known the feeling of being loved, or having friendship, or being comfortable, or happy, I am just alone and empty inside. Maybe depression? I just wish I wasn't so messed up, it would be nice to have a normal life. I know I need help, but I'm a broke college student.

90,"I'm a 20 M, Asian. Lately I've been suffering from health anxiety issues and depression. I had those from 2-3 year early but this pandemic and quarantine have triggered those immensely. 

I also went through a recent break up and to worsen that I've a pretty bad friend circle. My friends only think that if you go out and hangout with them regularly then only you are a part of that group. So for that sadly I've no friends to support me during this break up. I guess you have already found out that I'm introvert in nature. So for me hanging out once in a week is enough and apart from that I'm having 6-7 hours of online classes daily(except weekends). So I really don't get any time. 

Covid situation is pretty bad in my area. But my friends are going out and hanging out. I think they do it in a safe way but due to my health anxiety I can't go out, and because of that I'm feeling left out and alone and more depressed. Its likely a infinite loop that I can't break.

They have always told me I’m just too sensitive or that I have issues and that always seems to just make it worst and results in me crying and they just say I’m sensitive or a crybaby. How do I stop being so sensitive/feeling so embarrassed when stuff like this happens so I stop crying?

93,"Sorry if this post is a bit all over the place, I’m struggling and pretty much alone. I kinda just wrote whatever was going through my mind. Sort of like a journal entry I suppose. 

I just turned 22, I am in school full time and I just got a job after months of being unable to find one due to covid.

My life has never been stable, lots of childhood trauma and poverty stuff. My mother is shit, brother is just the same. My grandmother who was my support now has dementia and Alzheimer’s, and can no longer remember anything. My aunt who was never really around is somewhat available, but not really. As she says, she lives in her “pink bubble” and she doesn’t like to hear about anything bad in life, or how awful my childhood was or anything of that nature, she does take care of my grandmother and grandfather though, so she does know how irresponsible my mother is. 

Well, she caught covid, and my grandpa just got an infection and is now in the hospital. On Sunday I had to drive 3 hours home to take care of my grandma because no one else can. She asks the same questions every 5 minutes, poor thing. I feel awful for her. It hard for me to see her like this because she was basically my mom. I have to cook for her and take her shopping and tidy up and reassure her every few minutes. It’s a lot, on top of working remotely and doing classes online, as if all of the other problems in my life weren’t overwhelming enough. 

I had an unconventional break up about a year ago, (5.5 years). I recently got dropped by my best friend because of a silly argument I think? I don’t really know.   So now I’m all alone where I live, I’m doing my best to make friends, safely, it’s not going well. Dating is a nightmare, I finally found someone I seemed to enjoy and get along with and thought it could be something and then found out she was married, so that was a disaster. Dating sucks. 
I found a shitty minimum wage job at the beginning of October, but had to take care of a family emergency with my grandma so I had to call out, and they fired me, then proceeded to cuss me out on the phone and not pay me. I literally had to file a complaint to get my $139 dollar check because the owner was a dick for no reason. He got fined I guess, but it was still a month of stress that I didn’t need. 
My sleep is all over the place, I either sleep too much or not at all. Every time I do sleep I have outlandish dreams, nightmares, night terrors, sleep paralysis, or I wake myself up from talking so much, and often bite holes in my cheeks. Every single time I go to sleep. I can literally recall the dreams when I wake up, not perfectly, but it’s definitely unusual. Bill collectors call me 5 times a day because I haven’t had stable work. To top it all off my stupid trunk broke for no reason and now I have to somehow find time to get it fixed. 

Today I got the diagnosis from my psych evaluation that I had done a few weeks ago. I have sever depression, anxiety, OCD, and ADHD. 
This isn’t the first time I’ve been diagnosed, but it is the first time it’s been a psych evaluation. I’m in therapy, and I have scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist after finally receiving a referral, so I feel like I’m sort of on the right track to bettering myself, but I also feel like I’m not getting anywhere. The appointment is a month out because that’s the soonest available.

I struggle and fight to do everything I can to try and make it just a little bit stable and I am honestly ready to quit trying. I feel hopeless, and my own brain does everything it can to work against me and it makes it even harder. I don’t know what to do. I’m trying but I’m so tired of trying. I don’t know how to do all of this alone. I am overwhelmed and all I want to do is sleep but I can’t sleep peacefully. 

I just want to not be so alone. If I had one person who actually stuck around and cared maybe it wouldn’t be so bad. But I never get a brake. I can’t go hangout with friends because I don’t really have any, no matter how good a friend I try to be, no one cares to put any effort into the friendship. Relationships never work because people only see the outside and never care to get to know me. 

At this point I find myself wondering if there’s just something wrong with me. I know it’s not good to think like that, and it’s negative, but I’m just stuck and I can’t make my mind get out of that place right now.",10Nov2020,1
94,"My love needs love today

Smoke a joint in the evening and wander,
Unfocused, I roam the internet
I'm wasting precious time, don't do what's important
I'm drifting and need a lighthouse to find my way north

No one to watch over me, I can do whatever I want
Listen to what I want, go to bed when I want,
To be mediocre as I please, I have no account to give
Unattached, I'm free, and drifting
Long live freedom!

Alone in my solitude, I watch people through a screen
I sometimes feel like it replaces people, but not really
Can they hear me if I'm in pain and I scream?
In my apartment, what if the walls could listen?

I get up in the morning and ask myself ""why""?
Who am I doing this for? What is my purpose?
Why would I make the slightest effort if I only live for myself?
Why go forward when my efforts do not affect anyone?

I have a social life, but at a distance
Who are there for me every day?
Who is part of my daily life?
Who knows me? Both good and bad?
Who knows my tastes, my desires, my fears?
Who really knows me?

Where is the warmth, the intimacy, the love, the friendship?
A connection where we share everything,
Open like a book, I want you to be a co-author of my story
Let's build our world together

I need to be touched, on my body and in my emotions
I need to be kissed, encouraged, comforted
I need to experience emotions in all their nuances and varieties
I need people's love and support

A daily love, a reciprocal support
A shared house, some activities together
A supportive community, people to help each other
One for all, all for one

I need your loving gaze, your listening
From your hugs, from your eyes, from your mouth
To awaken my sensuality in me
And finally experience emotions, from tears to laughter to butterflies in the stomach

Cause I feel dead, numb, asleep
I feel mediocre and gloomy, looking for joy in my life
In a dead end that I am, I smoke and I forget myself
I need a spark to finally wake up from my sleep

Because my love needs love today ❤️",10Nov2020,1

98,"This year has been such a tough one and I never would have guessed for this year to go in shambles. Dec 2019, I had just resigned from my job and decided to have a 2-month rest to make up for the time lost as I used to work in retail which did not give me ample time to spend time with my family and for myself. I had decided to leave my job and country to pursue my studies abroad since I knew that was non-negotiable for my part. Then COVID struck, I got stranded in a different country for 2 months since by Jan i already knew that my original plan had been shelved. Months passed by and I was still very optimistic for my studies to push through in the latter part of the year which obviously did not. The news in the earlier stages were extremely polarizing to the point where I did believe what I wanted to believe and undermine the severe stories. I got very disheartened and was dismal for the most part up until I've come to accept the reality and settled to push my original plans further.  It's been almost 2 months were I've come to be aware that I'm genuinely fine (not happy nor sad). I've been spending a lot of time watching television and in all fairness, I have been learning a lot culturally. However, since this has just been my life for the past 8 months, I've sunk into my comfort zone. With all the time I have in my hands, it is inevitable of me to ruminate and ponder my life especially the bad ones even the minute ones. I've become too comfortable that my anxiety is at an all time high. It's like I'm scared to live, to make mistakes, to regret things which sounds delusional but yeah it's given me so much anxiety and I couldn't shake it off that easily because of my current sedentary situation. Adding salt to the wound, is my plan to move and it wasn't like before where I was just up for anything. The world has changed drastically which means I have to leave home with the pandemic going on albeit good thing it's decreasing and to deal with homesickness which I got a taste of early on this year which was tough AF, to reset a new social circle in a different country.

99,"

I have been thinking about it for a while, but I saw a post on r/relationship_advice about this kid who stays after for 30 minutes school and talks to his teacher. And this made me decide I kinda want to open up to my teacher. She is really the only adult I really trust. She is really the only person I trust enough to tell any of this stuff to, not even my friends. Idk why I trust her tho, I just... do. But I can’t find his post anymore

Anyway, she is nice and caring and seems like un-judging if that makes sense. Like she won’t judge me. And I’m actually quarantined rn. But I hate it. Being home makes everything worse for me. Even though I try to distract myself with video games, my OCD, depression, and stutter always get worse when I’m constantly home. 

And my teacher knows I have OCD cuz we did this thing at the beginning of the year and it said “Anything I should know about you” so I put something like “I might do weird things with my body, especially face and hands, so if you see that, please try to ignore it cuz it’s just my OCD.” And other than that, I’ve never really talked to her about my mental health. 

But I NEED to tell someone I think. And I feel like she would be the best person. So after all this bs, let me just ask the question, how do I ask her for help? Bc I’m very scared and nervous. And I’m debating if I should ask her online, or if I should wait until I’m in quarantined",10Nov2020,1
100,"I have a few issues that need to be resolved in my life. It's a bit of a shame that I feel rather empty despite having a great job, big house, big savings, and a loving family that is still close. It feels almost like it's all a hollow shell. Like buying a racecar just to look at it. Or staring at a picture of Jamaica and calling it ""vacation"".  


Anyway, here are some of the issues I have been dealing with:

&amp;#x200B;

General  
\- I have ADHD (inattentive) and Depression. So my life is unorganized and unmotivated.  
\- I feel generally ""numb"" like I'm watching my life happen and not FEELING it happen.  
\- I'm feeling my brain slow down.  
\- I feel like I'm behind where I should be, despite being objectively further than I expected.  
\- I probably need to cut my internet habits and organize my free time. I have basically no regular patterns in my life.  
\- I have frustrated and competitive feelings towards my brother that prevents us from getting too close. He might catch up to me career-wise and this makes me feel more frustrated than excited on his behalf.  
\- I feel I need to get out and socialize more. Nearly all my hobbies and interests are introverted.  
\- I tend to push people away if I feel my freedom being intruded. I tend to dodge responsibility for things like pets because the idea of anyone being dependent on me terrifies me.  


Relationships  
\- Was threatened and ""assaulted"" due to false accusations of sexual assault in college  
\- Had a relationship right after with a girl who had me always apologizing for being a man. My friends say she was abusive, but I'm not so sure.  
\- Have trouble forming such relationships because I fear women view me with fear or hostility due to the above. I feel as though I am feared and doing women a favor by not bothering them. Yet the pressure is on ME to initiate things. And girls I liked said they wished I had said something to them.  
\- Have been single and haven't really dated in the past 5-6 years. Never been sexually active at almost 30. Not ashamed of it, just concerned about it.  
\- The issue could be none of the above and I'm just self-sabotaging myself with paranoia, too picky, or simply not getting out there. I just need to get sorted in general.

So the thing is, I don't even know where to get started. I mean when I think about sitting down with a counselor, I think about having specific, plannable goals with obvious symptoms that can be measured. This doesn't jive with the feeling that I just need to get a lot ""sorted out"". Not to mention, I don't even know how to filter who I would see for such things. The relationship stuff especially feels like I would just be wasting someone's time, or would be dismissed as viewing myself as ""entitled to a relationship"" or something. Yet this is where I feel my life is missing the most.  


IDK. I would love to hear ideas from people who have seen counselors as to what to look for, what to expect, or what to do. Or any discussion of the issues themselves is appreciated.",10Nov2020,1

I was diagnosticated with depression three years ago. Never took meds because of reasons out of my control and eventually stopped going to therapy because I couldn’t open up to my therapist and felt like it was pointless.  

I haven’t felt well in the past years. I don’t want to assume that I’m depressed right now but I feel the same as I felt at that time. I really can’t get out of bed and I have difficulties concentrating and dealing with my emotions, and failing at school it’s what ultimately made me see that maybe something was wrong again. I feel like I have lost the things that I appreciated the most. Right now I’m dealing with some self-destructive habits that come and go from time to time. 

I want to get better. I’m living with my parents and I economically depend on them so I can’t get a therapist right now, however, I’m planning on doing so as soon as the pandemic is over and I can go back to uni in another city. But the damn thing seems to get longer and longer and I feel like I should do something in the time being. 

So, my question is, What would be a good thing to do to in benefit of my mental health? are there any books that I can try to read or any advice that can help me to get out of bed or get back my life, especially on the academic side of things?  Right now I feel like I’m wandering without direction and I know I should just google it or something but I feel genuinely clueless. Anything helps.",10Nov2020,1

106,"Hello all, 

I am new to the mental health community on reddit. My purpose in writing this post is really just to vent and get off my chest...the reason I am choosing to post this publicly in this group is because I am truly open to hearing any thoughts and opinions about my personality and anxiety I face on the daily. 

I am currently on the process of signing up for online therapy/counseling considering I am a full time online student and work full time with children. 

Here is my story - 

My childhood was alright. I say that simply because , I wish things could have been better. At the end of the day, things can always be worse and there are many people out there who would have killed to have had the childhood experiences that I had. 

I am the daughter of two immigrants. I am Filipino American. I was born here in the states , as my parents both immigrated to the states. I am the oldest. We grew up poor, but I had a roof over my head, food, and toys....my parents were always tight on money so I witnessed financial stress and it’s effect on my parents relationship. For some reason, I always always longed for a sister, because I wanted to have someone my age who understood my family dynamic because I had Filipino parents while my friends had white patents....and for those of you who are unaware, Filipino (Asians in general) parents are strict/critical of their children. 

Anyways, I grew up with a neighborhood friend since we were about 2 years old. Her dad was Mexican, her mom was white. Our houses were the same exact model, but I saw how much fuller there house seemed and our seemed empty. It seemed like a happy home and her mom was just your typical nurturing mom who made dinner and all that. My mom was always yelling at me for being whiny and so, and I always so badly wanted a family like my friend did. I just felt like my parents didn’t understand me and neither did my Lola who lived with us at the time. 

As I got older, sometimes I would think how cool it would be if some of my teachers were my mom because I wouldn’t be as tense and I would have a mom that was more warm and understanding and non judge mental. 

I feared my dads anger more than anything. I still do to this day. I have had separation anxiety from friends, past lovers, family members all because it was frustrating to me that it seemed like people I was comfortable talking to and would engage with me thoughtfully with what I had to say  didn’t live with me. I wanted my house I lived with my parents to feel like a home where I can go to people and they are dying to know about my day rather than the normal “did you eat today” 

At one point, I had an issue with wanting older men’s attention. THIS SICKENS ME. And I wish I could have stopped the impulse. I’m convinced to this day that it is some form of daddy issues because although my dad WAS AND STILL IS in the picture, I was scared of him because when he was mad, he was mad and it showed...that and he always would say things like I was only doing certain things for attention and and didn’t have friends even when I thought I did...it fucked with me and my mom agreed with him and it made me feel so embarrassed with myself because I know it’s true and I would always want attention because I never felt like I got it and felt sure of myself. 

I have been in two relationships and they were both toxic because of me. I used everyone of the relationship as a punching bag. Once I was single for the first time in my life because I always dated and never lived a life without being intimately involved with someone...I noticed I was a lot more confident in myself and optimistic when I was single. 

I’m in a relationship now if a year and a half. He’s amazing. Patient with me. I want to keep him but I’m fucking up bad by using him as a punching bag. He is urging me to get help. I feel terrible because his father died of suicide years ago and I know dealing with some who has thoughts of self harm (not suicide)...more like cutting and lack of self care..it stresses him out because I know he worries about me and we have gotten into fights about me getting professional help.

I’m sorry if this post isn’t all tied in correctly. I’m really just venting and am open to any opinions and thoughts to better myself. 

Thanks for reading.",10Nov2020,1

My depression is a lot better than it used to be (it was more situational than anything else, and I'm in a better physical and emotional place now). Still, I worry about having kids. I still have days where I struggle to take care of myself, let alone a helpless child.

I'm not sure if my hesitation is legitimate or if I'm looking for a cop out.

109,"For the past 5 or so months i have been really deppressed. I believe my friends, the people i live with are lying to me. At night i hear them on Phone calls and or talking amongst themselfs about me, i dont hear it all i only hear parts but still drives me insane. Ive confronted my friends and the people i live with multible times about it and ask if everything is okay, and if im doing anything wrong or something, they say its all in my head, and say its fine you havent done anything wrong. But i think if that were true they wouldnt be talking about me the amount that they do. I try to talk to other friends amd family about this but i always feel like a burden and annoying. My family has been telling me to ignore it but i find it so hard to. It has gotten to the point where i dont wanna live anymore but i also dont wanna die, i dont wanna hurt the people i care about that way and i also dont wanna do something ill regret. Im so scared to end my life but i cant keep going on like this.",10Nov2020,1
110,"I've been trying to type out why I feel this way. And without doing an entire recap of my life, I'm just here in the dark. 4:30am. I feel like I have a horrible reputation. Some people call me a Legend for what I've been through. Others hate me or probably want to harm me for mistakes I've made. I was never a social person, but I've isolated myself in my parents basement since I was 18. Abusing drugs, creating identities to cope with reality. Making music, playing video games, using dating apps to feel better. Unknowingly living a lie in the pursuit of moving on from everything that happened to me as a child. Trying to forget about what caused me pain. I dissasociate non-stop. My sense of self is a complete nightmare. I have no identity. I have my GED but have never held a job for more than a year. I have no education. I notice my brain latching onto different things as if they are ""me"", hoping I can embody a thought instead of staring blankly. I just float through the ether, expressing momentary feeling. I'm ashamed and mortified of the person I have been. It feels like I have a personality disorder. Some decisions I have made were not made by me, but by a feeling. Almost as if I was possessed. I know the acountability for my actions rests on my human body, but my brain would change so often. It never felt like me. 

On the other hand, maybe I am not as bad as I think. When you know better you do better, and I've never made a mistake with malice or intent to harm someone. Though I have had many psychotic episodes. Perhaps this is just a part of growing up, and a result of isolation and self neglect. Maybe people would like me if I only liked myself. Probably not though. I just need help.",10Nov2020,1
111,"-Initially posted in r/advice, using multiple subreddits for a swift answer-

I’m not depressed, I figured I’d get that out the way given the headline; nor am I suicidal in any way.

Now that that’s out the way, I need help. I am a 25 year old male, I am in my last semester of college (which thankfully is all online during this) and I went to the hospital for what the doctors chalked up to be an anxiety attack. That worst one, the one that sent me to the hospital, happened the day before my birthday so it’s easy to keep track of.

Now, whenever I go outside, get in a car, or even get too stressed out I have the feeling all over again. I was able to get an over-the-phone (telemed) appointment with a local doctor who has prescribed me two types of medicine. Unfortunately the medicine prescribed is reactionary and not preventative, such that it helps end the panic attacks (or whatever they are) whenever they start, but they do not prevent them. I was told that I would have to go in to the doctor to get any stronger preventative type medicine. 

I go to my state’s university, where I study law. Thankfully, my parents traveled from my home town and attempted to bring me to a doctor. This was fruitless, however, as the last time we attempted my panic attack was ferocious on the ride there (almost on par with the hospital visit) and when we finally got there COVID seemed to have caused a line to get in the door (yes even with an appointment) but who am I kidding, I could barely stand the car ride much less get out into public. So we turned the car around back to my house in my college town, the place I feel safest.

Luckily, COVID has made my final semester exclusively online. A girl from my past started talking to me again and we really hit it off, she understands what’s going on with me and helps me through it, and I am lucky to have her in my life. My grades are good, my roommates are two of my closest friends. I keep myself busy with an old 2007 MMORPG, youtube, and schoolwork. Cooking helps clear my head. I have consistently told my parents and friends alike “yes I’ll schedule a doctors appointment, I’m just busy with school right now”. Not entirely false, but my inability to take a car ride also stems there. It’s crazy, horror movies are my favorite; but this real life fear, the feeling of pure dread I experienced the night before my birthday and on the car ride to a doctor, scares the daylights out of me.

Now, it has been almost 3 months that I have not traveled more than a few yards from my front door. The lack of energy exertion throughout the day has also turned me into an insomniac. I need to figure this out. Prior to this occurring, I was Superman. Charismatic, bright, outgoing, very social; I’ve never been one to shy away from my colleges bar scene in exchange for a night in. As stated, the COVID pandemic is a catastrophe, but if this had to ever happen to me I’m glad it happened now. But I am about to graduate and have to make my way out into the “real world” soon. Christ, this girl wants to date me, and nothing was more sad than to tell her I wouldn’t be traveling back to our home town an hour away to meet her family on thanksgiving; simply because I can’t. Like I said, she does understand, though. And I am surrounded by great friends and a supportive family.

So, Reddit advice board, what can I do? Do doctors still make house calls? Do I ask a friend to see if a family member of theirs is a doctor? I am a firm believer in science, and however this started, I know I can begin to stop it by seeking further medical help. The first problem still stands: the get out the house.

And trust me, I’d like nothing more than to do just that.

NOTE: this is the first time I have used this board, I ask that if anyone feels it should be moved please inform me before deleting this post. As it took me quite some time to type it, and it a huge issue to me right now.

But I cant enjoy it, I just have feelings of numbness, Fear and Sadness. I dont think I've ever felt more supported, yet i feel alone in the world, I feel unable to relax even when locked in the safety of my flat with my pets.

If I do happen to go meet people I'm nervouse, no matter who it is im nervouse I think any second I'll be picked on or someone will hurt me. Or that no one wants me there and they just feel bad for me. I even avoid talking to people my age I talk to in private in public, just incase they get shit for talking to me.

I cant even enjoy sleep without scenes of the worst moments of my life going through my head. I cant go to the doctors about illness without being pushed coz I always think I'm lying even when I know better

113,"I used to be such a happy person. Super social, and always doing what it takes to do well In School. The end of last semester and especially with this semester my mental health has taken a complete nose dive. I’ve always been know as the kid who can be funny and make light of things, and I still try and portray that, but inside has become a much different story.

I just feel completely lost. I have lost so many of my social anchors, and without them I am losing any sense of purpose and sanity. I haven’t had the best of luck with girls lately, my self esteem is down, I’ve gained about 10 pounds, and overall just feel like complete shit. 

I don’t really know how to totally make things normal again. I’ve even started to question my major, my family relationship seems strained, and same with my friendships. I haven’t felt quite like this is my life. Just the feeling of being so lost, so helpless, limited reasons of hope. I don’t know why exactly, but just every class being remote, all of my friendships being basically internet based besides a few. It just feels like in the last 7 months, all it took was one pandemic to completely turn my life upside down.

My hometown is completely shut down again, and I can’t go home because I can’t risk my parents being a contact to me and being out of work for two weeks without pay. I am once again for the second time this semester a close contact with someone who had the virus. I don’t know if I can take another two weeks in complete isolation watching my poor plant die a slow death to the lack of sunlight.(Had to add some depressing humor to this right?)

I guess I just never realized how fragile the fragments that held my life together truly were. Sometimes I wish my family consisted of more then just my parents, my sister, a a couple of friends. Would be nice to lean on other family members if they were in my life.",10Nov2020,1

115,"Hi all,

Though about posting here and give it a try. I (27M) recently experienced a difficulty with in the relationship my fiance, we almost broke up. Eventually we managed to resolve the issues, but something deep and dark has opened inside my mind. I realized how dependent I am on her, to fulfill my emotional needs. When losing her became a real option, it was terrifying. I lost sense of purpose, joy and well-being. It made me reflect on my life in general, and since I'm working with a therapist, I managed to figure out that I experience abandonment anxiety. When I think about it and reflect about my childhood, even on the past few years, I realize how much I was dependent on my friends and other people thoughts. Always searched for validation, always pleased people, was anxious when I though someone is thinking something bad about me. Never lived for myself, always on guard and making sure my actions are valid by others, always looking on the other side of the fence. 

I was eager to start the healing process. At first I was looking on emotional dependency, and started to be more independent, which is extremely difficult. I doubt every step, but try to reassure myself. Sometimes it feels like I need to rewire my brain completely since it is so used to the old ways.

But yesterday, during a session with my therapist, he mentioned my inner wounded child. A child which experienced his parents divorce at the age of 5, that was feeling very lonely since his mother needed to work a lot and wasn't emotionally available for him. That was looking for father/mother figures, tried to do his best to be a good child and please others. Of course over the years things subsided, I had many friends and hobbies, and I functioned perfectly (with some downs along the way of course). The wound appeared when the break up was on verge.

By looking online I find many ways to ""heal the wounded and abandoned inner child"", by self-parenting, or reparenting. Does anyone has an experience in that field? Maybe it's a waste of time and won't solve the real issue. I really don't know. Will be glad for some advice.",10Nov2020,1
116,"This year has been challenging but starting in September everything just went downhill. My grandfather died of covid. I’m a bundle of stress and anxiety from full time caregiving for my mother who is unable to take care of herself (she has cancer and her health has decreased significantly over the year), my on and off again ex ended things with me which left me completely heartbroken, rejected and abandoned. That relationship in itself was toxic but it has made me lose all sense of self worth and dignity. Because of covid, I had to go on unemployment barely scraping by to pay for my bills. My depression has gotten so worse and my anxiety has grown. My entire family is overwhelmed with taking care of my mother and I feel completely hopeless with no light at the end of the tunnel. I’ve thought about suicide more than I can count on both hands because I feel like there is no way for life getting better. I’ve called multiple therapists and psychiatrists off the list from my insurance provider and literally every one I call either won’t take my insurance anymore or they’re not taking new patients. I’m so miserable. I have no one to talk to. Recently I got into a fight with my dad who knows my financial struggles and is constantly telling me to leave the house and how he wants me to move out. I don’t feel wanted in this house but have no where to go. I contemplated suicide that day and instead of my dad calling a hotline or the number that my sister gave him for instances like this, he instead called the police in which they took me away and literally dropped me off at a behavioral urgent care. It was a literal prison and I wasn’t placed on a 5150 but my dad got what he wanted and it was me out of the house. I eventually went home the next day and he pretended as if nothing happened. I didn’t have a bed, I had to wear a prisoners uniform and sleep on a chair in a cold frigid room with the workers laughing all night till 4am. 

With all of this combined my self worth is shot. I feel hopeless. I feel invisible. I desperately want a therapist and psychiatrist but I can’t get one without paying out of pocket. I can’t get the help I need. I don’t know what to do at this point anymore. I had asked my dad for help multiple times and his way in helping me was the shittiest possible way ever. I’ve asked him to help me call places and treatment centers. I was willing to do an inpatient but he literally did nothing when I asked but instead called the police.

I am a 36 year old combat veteran and a recovering drug addict. I have done 2 tours of duty to Afghanistan. I was wounded there and come home a completely different man. I met the love of my life and soulmate 5 and a half years ago. She was and still is my everything. I think of her everyday. We still speak and have a 3 year old son together. She got really sick about march this year with a heart condition and I supported her and visited her whenever humanly possible. The problem arose when it all became too much and I had a complete mental breakdown. I have not been the easiest of husbands. I have severe PTSD and combat stress, I have been hard work throughout the years. I know that. During her 3 month stay in hospital I began using again. I felt like I could not cope. I feel weak for making this stupid decision. Since then being March of this year in 2020 I had 4 attempts on my life. Due to my relapse she broke it off with me but she tells me she still loves me. I believe her. I am giving her space to process all that's happening and has happened but wish I could turn back time. I have been so lucky that my 4 suicide attempts have not left me brain damaged or dead. But I don't feel lucky. I feel Cheated. My head and my heart just desperately wants her to take me back and make it all better but I know I need to take responsibility and have faith. I have severe co-dependence issues as I have never been in love before meeting her. She is my soulmate. We still talk a lot and I know I have hurt her with my behaviours. I am reaching out as I still feel suicidal. I am completely shattered. I am currently clean from drugs and alcohol. I am showing up and being a responsible man.

125,"I was in hospital following a suicide attempt.

First off I hate how they assign a nurse/ healthcare assistant to watch you and follow you at all times but don't say anything about it just pretend they aren't there like it's something super subtle. It made me feel claustrophobic I guess and was just frustrating.

The guy who was assessing me had seen me at the beginning of october. He didn't remember me which is fair enough but I didn't have the greatest memories of him or that trip to hospital which probably wasn't good.

At one point he asked me if I was seeing messages like in the TV that I think were for me and I said no. Then I thought I should probably be completely honest so I mentioned how I watched Donnie Darko and then after that thought everything was connected. He basically scolded me for watching that film. I already knew it was a mistake after I watched it, I didn't realise the film would be like that or I never would have watched it when I wasn't feeling so good. Anyway apparently that film is supposed to make you think everything is connected so that parts fine.

I remember telling him directly ""I want to die"" I might have even said it a couple times.

Anyways he then decided I would talk to my parents about going home with them for a while and I should contact local counselling.

After that I ate my cold lunch and after already feeling trapped because of the nurses and now being upset I decided to run. I didn't get very far because they closed like all the doors and I accidentally ran past the stairs and got lost. They then took me back to the ward and the doctor talked to me and I told him I wanted to die etc.

I had another visit from the psych team, the man and a female colleague. The thing that stands out most from that was the woman said ""you told the doctor you felt trapped and you want to die and those two things **didn't** come up in the meeting so I was wondering what changed"". I only explained about the feeling trapped. I should have said something about how I had told him I wanted to die but I didn't.

Now the moustache has grown and it looks horrible and i want to shave it. But i cant, i feel like this is the only thing that reminds me of him or something.
Because i had this moustache when i spent the last seconds with him and it feels wrong if i would shave them.

130,"What a year 2020 has been. I was furloughed from work in March, then my auntie passed away of an aneurysm in her heart, then 2 months later, my grandmother (who was bed bound) fell out of her bed because of neglectful carers and she broke 4 ribs which punctured her internal organs and she suffered a slow painful death. Then I had appendicitis and I was hours from it being ruptured, then I had complications from the operation and I had to stay in hospital 2 extra days. I also had quite a few issues with leaks in my house due to shoddy grouting and pipe work in the bathrooms and then my washing machine broke down. I became very stressed because of all of this and so I attempted suicide. I told my employers about this, so they gave me a disciplinary.
They accused me of self medicating, falsifying medical records and my mental health diagnosis of OCD. I then pursued legal action, which I am currently in the process of and was forced to resign my position. On a brighter note, I started a new job yesterday as a teaching assistant and I had a seizure of unknown origin and when I fell, I fractured 4 vertebrae in my spine, which is consistent from a fall from a scaffolding.

131,"hey so i dont really know where to start this, or where im going with this to be honest, but i wanted to share how i feel and see what others have to say i guess. so im 20 right now, and my childhood and what went down mentally and emotionally has me confused and conflicted. so i was adopted at birth cuz my biological mother couldn't raise me and i was raised by a moderately wealthy family. we had money struggles, but not often. anyways, my childhood was normal until my dad was disabled in a car accident when i was in 4th grade i think. i didnt know what that meant at the time or how it would affect him. a lil later, my parents adopted my now 13 year old sister, from vietnam. around this point i started experiencing what i had believed to be audible hallucinations. it started as a voice saying weird and disturbing negative things, and i thought it was normal. but the thing is, i dont know what voices in your head are supposed to sound like. i didnt know if i my brain was just thinking really weird things, or what. anyways around 7th grade i had manic/psychotic episodes that were dangerous and unpredictable to say the least. i began going to inpatient therapy for 1 to 2 weeks at a time, they began medicating me and as time went on, i thought i was getting better. around mid highschool i picked up a klonopin addiction, but that is what i truly believe to be what saved me. i rent to a rehabilitation center for 40 or 50 days, and while i was there i experienced purity and peace of mind i had never felt before. i felt healthy all the way round, mentally, physically, and spiritually as well. i gained a new perspective and understanding on the importance of mindfulness. after i was discharged i have stayed sober from hard drugs, and only indulge in occasional psychedelics. the reason im saying all this is because after rehab when i was around 17 i leaned off my meds because i hated being dependent on them, and also feared for the health and long term effects they would have on my brain, considering ive been on antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, depression meds, anxiety meds; i pretty much had a pharmacy warehouse go though my system over the course of about 6 years. sorry if this is hard to read or understand i kinda suck at this stuff lol. but i have grown into an adult who lives in his own apartment with a roommate. i suck at holding a steady job (had that problem since i was 16), terrible commitment issues and cant stop cheating on girls if i date them, i think i manipulate girls subconsciously tbh. i think its cuz of all the porn i watch growing up, all this shit has probably had a terrible effect on my developing brain. idk tho, maybe its normal? it doesnt seem normal. i also think that the ""hallucinations"" i experienced where a result of a lack of attention i received as a young kid since my sister was adopted around the same time my dad was born. looking back now, i learned there's this thing called internal monologue, and i think that the voices were actually just that. the voices were my voice in my head, and when i think to myself now, it sounds the exact same as what i thought i was hallucinating. im so pissed cuz literally i just couldn't handle the lack of attention as a little kid, acted out and started a whole thing for nothing i think. i dont know completely but about a year before i stopped taking my meds i wasn't hallucinating anymore, i think maybe hormones could have been a factor too? idk man. but i have a lying problem now too. but i try to be my best as a person and benefit the community i live in. i work on cars, have plenty of loving and caring friends and family, im just curious if my mental health today, and my issues of cheating and lying are a result of this, if im normal, if anyone else has experienced the same things? i think imma narcissist too idk but i could go on for hours ab the issues my parents had and how i think i ended up inheriting their social/mental issues. cuz for instance, my dad never finished anything and had issues like me, my commitment issues go all around the spectrum from girls to finishing jobs or half-assing things yk? i worry for this girl im talking to now cuz ive cheated on her a few times and she loves me and we have wonderful times together, but idk if i wanna be with her or not and every time we break up i end up convincing her things are different when in reality they aren't. idk man i hate myself sometimes, but i do my best to stay happy and healthy, because i understand the balance between mind, body, and soul, its just extremely hard to balance these things. btw this is my first time here idk if im doing this right &gt;.&lt; ty guys for taking ur time to read this, love you all and hope the best for everyone. endo#8138",10Nov2020,1

 I(20 y/o; Male)'ve sufferd from depression about two years back up to the point that I was standing above a railway a wanted to jump. Since then things got better: Got myself a half decent job, got accepted to uni and found a GF.

Now as you can tell this year was pile of s\*\*t. My GF broke up with me about a month ago but we split in a ""good"" way as we both saw that it wasn't working and we remained friends. Since the breakup I was feeling a bit down as expected but recently I observed on myself the same signs I observed two years back. The typical: every day seemed the same, nothing fulfiled me and every morning I am wondering if it's worth it to get out of bed. I knew I had to do something about it so I started running almost every day and focused on uni work.

135,"This is long and about my mental health as a male teenager, read if you want

&amp;#x200B;

For 2-4 days every week, I feel kind of depressed. When these days occur, I don't want to do anything. I get extremely disinterested in everything and I question everything. I've caught myself looking weirdly at my peers being happy and laughing with me just sitting there like ""I wish that was me"". And I start to not care about my interests and get super unmotivated. This happens for a few days, typically most weeks, then it goes away for a couple of days again.

I am 17 years old, and I go to a type of boarding school in Denmark. It's pretty nice. But I don't feel like I am enjoying it as much as I should. I'm there being unhappy a lot of the time, when everyone else feels great. I hate feeling like this. 

We also only get around 7 hours of sleep most days, so I suspect I'm sleep-deprived. But it's not possible for me to get any more sleep, and this can't just be the case. Everyone else here is sleep-deprived too, but they're having a blast.

Some days i get a few hours long rush of extreme energy that I can't contain. When this happens, I want to beat everyone up for the fun of it, and I want to workout, I want to party, I want to do everything at once. Like my energy is extremely unbalanced. And when this happens, I suddenly find more value in everything, and I actually want to do stuff. But this returns to normal after a few hours max, and a few days later, I'm back where I am now.

This stupid cycle is causing me some really bad difficulties in my everyday life. Many people are saying I look numb, and I feel like some people are distancing themselves from me.

I also have a really low self-esteem. I never feel like I should say anything, but I mostly still do, and I feel like other people would be better off with me not being here. Sometimes I isolate myself because of this. It seems like the worse my self-esteem gets, the worse I feel in my small bouts of whatever is wrong with me.

I know I'm just a stupid teenager, but is this normal? I feel like most people at my age are happy and want to live. Can I do anything about it? Or should I just pick myself up and stop whining, or whatever? I seriously don't know what to do, because I'm more unhappy than ever in a more happy place than I've ever been. Maybe it's too much to post it here. Do you have any idea what's wrong with me?",10Nov2020,1

I’ve been waking up to nightmares every night, where I relive a terrible accident I was apart of about a year ago. This has had a massive effect on my sleep.  I’ve also started to get super jumpy, to the point where a bicycle riding past me gives me a hard attack if I don’t know it’s coming, or even a skateboard riding by.  To add on top of that I’ve been having girl trouble, someone who I thought really liked me but is super busy and this we haven’t been able to much of anything together the past week, and I feel like she is slowly just distancing herself from me, though I can’t blame her I guess.  I feel like I should go to therapy, but I can’t bring myself to tell my parents or anyone that I need to go. I went to therapy for suicide thoughts when I was in middle school, and I always tried to improve myself since then, but I think I’m going back down that path again.

144,"
I (27F) work part time and i go to school full time. I’m physically and emotionally exhausted. I haven’t been able to sleep for more than 2 hours straight. My thoughts are scattered, my speech is slurred, I can’t focus, and I’m struggling to read and write. I can’t read a page without going over the same line twice at least. I’ve tried everything to help me go to sleep, but nothing works. I’m losing my mind. Sleep deprivation has triggered a series of panic attacks. Flashbacks are another thing that keeps me up at night, and i’m not sure what to do at this point. I just want to shut my brain off and get some rest. 

I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD and body dysmorphic disorder. My body dysmorphia is debilitating and it has gotten worse over the years. I have no idea what i look like at this point. I was trying to attempt painting a self portrait the other day, and I legit couldn’t figure out how to do it. I stared at my reflection and the more i did it, the worse it got. I also relapsed and started self harming again. It started out with strenuous exercise to get some release, but now it’s full blown body mutilation. I can’t stop. I stay up at night cutting, burning myself with cigarettes, punching and hitting myself. I don’t know how to stop. I tried seeking help, but nothing works. I’m suicidal and I just want to end it. But i feel guilty because of the few people who truly care about me. Life is not worth living and i’m only here for others. 

I don’t know why whenever i get overwhelmed i push people away. I’ve been doing this my whole life and it’s hard to go on like this. I feel immense guilt and shame for dragging people down with me. So i push them away. I don’t want to be an emotional burden on others. I have zero contact with my toxic family, pushed my friends away, and now i feel trapped with my demons. I haven’t been in a relationship for years, and I can’t see myself being with someone when i can’t even love myself. Whenever someone slightly shows some interest in me, i get freaked out and panic about all the potential disastrous scenarios i played in my head. I self sabotage before giving anyone chance to get to know me better. I don’t know if i’m doing it to protect myself from getting hurt, or doing it because i don’t want to drag someone else into this miserable existence. I wish i could love someone and let them love me back. I wish could let someone in without fear and guilt.

Hope this belongs here

I am a 25 year old male and currently feel like I'm having my mid -mid life crisis. In short about me; my parents are Muslim and raised me a Muslim. I decided that I disagree with Islam so became an atheist, I'm unable to tell them this because of the fear of getting disowned. I lost my mother when I was 7 years old and my step mom is a nightmare. Currently I am living together with my gf of 7 years and just started my first job.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to my long relationship and religious background I have never been able to do stuff. I haven't been able to date around (which at the time, I didn't really mind) but I was also not allowed to live by myself or in a dorm to discover what kind of person I am by myself due to my parents.  While at home my situation was horrible thanks to my stepmom and -sister being narcissistic.

&amp;#x200B;

This has led me from living with my parents to moving in with the gf, and now I feel like it's going a bit too fast for me. I still want to live a bit more individual by moving in with a friend. Besides these points, I am in the most difficult positions mental health wise I have ever been; I do not feel certain emotions ( such as regret) due to all the lying to my parents I have done over the past years. I am unsure about if I want to be in a relationship and I am unable to have people depend on me without freaking out.

&amp;#x200B;

There is so much I still want to do by myself but I feel like I have skipped that phase of my live and I am in fear that I might regret it so much later that I kind of broke down. It is al becoming too much for me so I keep snapping at people that try to help me. I know they want to help but I can't tell my family half of my real life so I get so irritated when they give me advice which comes from a religious view.

We decided we should see new people and I cried and cried and we talked our feelings out and I realized I had been making her do this for months, maybe years. She made me come to the self actualization, that I am not who I thought I was. I think, no, I was emotionally abusive (I'm just going to own it). And although it wasn't my intention, my failure to address myself was our downfall. Over the years things happened that killed my confidence, self esteem, and most importantly, my emotional connection to her. This was never the person I wanted to be, I am absolutely against the person I am today. I do not say this to excuse my actions, I say this to understand my actions, so that another day, I will not make the same decisions.

I had never tried to be a better listener. I just threw out excuses for why I was a bad listener - I was born deaf, or videogames, or that I'm an engineer. And then my actions showed I did not want to listen, I did not want to better myself. I have always been a bad listener, I've known this, I didn't care. I thought a person could learn to love me as is. They did, but they were never loved in the way they loved me.

I had become emotionally cut off from the world losing my ability to sympathize. I was not there for her each time she cried due to her mother passing away. I was not there when she cried herself to sleep. I did not feel bad for it, because I did it so many times. If I had seen a man doing that to a woman I would have told her get away from him. Thats its not healthy. I did not seek help, I did not seek to address my own internal struggles, and I allowed it to hurt the most important person in the world to me.

Finally, I came to the realization, that I am indeed a very selfish person. I look back, and she showed her love in every way possible. I read the book the 5 love languages and I realized, I had never tried to love her in the ways she felt love. I have always been a selfish person, only looking out for my own goals, ambitions and wants. Its been a life long thing, I've never been aware of how selfish I am until now. Even in our break up, everything I did was for me to try to get us back together. I was serious when I told her I wanted to change though.

I decided to pursue a path of redemption. Not to redeem the man she fell in love with, but the man she should have fell in love with.

My focuses are as follows.
1. I am reteaching myself how to listen
2 I am teaching myself self awareness in communication
3. I am trying to show sympathy for others
4. I am giving in to the act of selflessness

I will be approaching new people, and applying principles in the pursuit of these things. I will do so with only the intent to better myself. I have already proved I can be a good listener, I have proved I can sympathize, I am now self aware, and I am determined to work out my selfishness.

Only once I have completed my path, will I allow myself to fall in love again, as right now, I am an incomplete man, and I would only be hurting another woman if I dated again.

I think we as men do this a lot. We lack a self awareness that would make us much better people.

My parents keep scolding me for the smallest of reasons without actually asking why that happened now for some reason i am never able to tell them why it is happening mostly because i cannot communicate to them my problems very well since 1) they don't really listen to anything and say i am to young to have those many emotion 2) i am not able to stand up for my self and tell them this is happening. Keep in mind in our online school there is no way i can contact a school councilor.,10Nov2020,1

162,"Heyy! So my spouse has depression which has been pretty long term. I've known him for about 3 years but he's had it for most of his life. He did quit his meds a few years back as he improved for the most part however it's definitely back almost in full swing? Anyhow so we've definitely been managing together and getting things done however my biggest concern is weight gain and his overall physical health. Due to the lack of movement (works from home as well so he rarely leaves the house) and exercise, I'm worried about how weak he may actually be. Like oddly enough I do most of the heavy lifting which I don't mind but it's just that bad for him. I feel like I've been very lenient in our marriage in terms of just not forcing him to do anything cause I totally understand, it's difficult. But in this situation now considering we're both young, would it be wrong to show some tough love at the start to improve his physical health which could also impact his mental health positively once he gets going?",10Nov2020,1

The added frustration in knowing that everything in your life is ok: you have a roof over your head, food in the fridge, a bed to sleep in and a handful of people who care about you, but yet, the crushing feeling like you’re  mourning someone or something wins over the rational part. 

It makes me even more confused and bitter because it makes me feel inadequate of living my life like I should. Because trying to hold it in while I’m at work and spend the rest of the evening and night curled up in a ball crying until I have splitting headaches and then repeat it the next day is deeply exhausting so say the least.

165,"(Sorry for the long post, new to reddit. TLDR at the end)

All my life I've been a very good student, good grades, kind to others and hardworking. It meant that I was usually overlooked which caused my depression and anxiety to go unnoticed (officially diagnosed not speculation). Lately I've been struggling a lot with attention, I fidget in class, I haven't payed attention for months (currently writing this in class), never make eye contact and zone out and daydream all the time.

I asked my therapist about it and she dismissed it as a symptom of my anxiety. I would be fine with this but none of the strategies I've been presented with have worked. I know you are supposed to be showing signs of it from a young age so because of my good grades everyone assumes I wasn't.

The thing is, I might have. I've always had to work very hard for my good grades (I'm a perfectionist who can't stand grades below 90) and I've always had lots of homework to catch up on. I'm a chronic procrastinator and I forget everything. I've always drawn in class instead of focusing, I'm just lucky I was smart enough to figure things out on my own.

I have lots of habits common to ADHD/ADD, bouncing leg, picking at nails and chewing lips, these are also common to anxiety too though. Lastly, I spent my entire childhood confused, I never knew what was going on and just went with it. I'm starting to think I just never payed attention when things were being explained to me.

Please help, it's starting to be a real problem!

TL;DR I show most of the common signs of ADHD/ADD but everyone passes it off as anxiety. I need to know what it is.",10Nov2020,1

167,"Hey everyone, first time poster here. I was born in Austria but have lived in the United States for pretty much all my life. I’d like to preface this by saying that I in no way hate America, but I’ve always felt out of place.

Ever since I can remember, people have always asked me what culture I identify more with, and I’ve never wanted to choose. I’ve struggled with this all my life as I had the mindset that I’ll never be able to move somewhere else (which I realize is irrational). 

Flash forward to when I visited Scotland a few years back. I have never felt more at home than I did while there. It was incredibly beautiful and I simply fit right in. I could go on and on about my love for that place, but you get the point. As I’m still a high school student, I can’t make the decision to move anywhere yet, but I have these phases where it’s all I can think about.

I can’t pay attention in school on those days, and everything I see reminds me of it. It gets pretty unbearable to be homesick of a place that is not your home and I honestly am lost on what to do. Does anyone else share a similar feeling or have any advice for me? I’d really appreciate it and I’ll answer questions ASAP.",10Nov2020,1

172,"I am a person who has Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.  I was diagnosed when I was around four years old after my mother noticed that I could barely function in public, noticing that I tap things or blink my eyes an x-number of times.  By the time I was six, my OCD had gotten to such a severe point that just walking into a public place would cause me to panic, doing plenty of different compulsions if something like a person not turning left happened, since my mind would tell me that if I didn't, people I love would get hurt.  Luckily after therapy, my OCD got to the point where I could function in public, though I would still have times where, for example, if I do not tap my pencil five times on the desk within two seconds, the next morning my mother would get extremely sick.  I went to university to study mathematics, statistics, and computer science.  I was able to make friends and do sports like rock climbing and lifting weights without having to wash my hands or do any compulsions or tics.  I felt normal and among people like me for once.  


Skip many years to the present day.  COVID-19 has swept across the United States, and has hit my area especially hard.  Because I have been allowed to take my courses online, both the previous semester and this one, I have been secluded in my house since March, only having left (save for walks) six times.  I have not physically seen my friends except over video calling and phone calls.  My OCD has gotten severely worse.  When I am in my home, I feel fairly safe.  We get groceries delivered, and despite my dad going to work each day, barely any of us leave the house.  When I am not doing schoolwork, I like to help my parents out around the house.  They are older in age, so they appreciate the help.  However, I no longer feel safe touching doorknobs, so I have to use paper towels or my shirt.  Anytime I have to open the refrigerator or a cabinet that is not in my room, I have to reach up to the very top and pull it using the door itself, since I know nobody but me can or has touched it.  I stay in my room doing homework 80% of the day (which is definitely a plus for my grades), and the rest of it is spent outside sitting on the back porch with my family.  This is fairly livable, but when I go outside it is a different story.  


Like I said, I have left a total of six times when you do not count walks each night.  I have gone to a dentist appointment, bringing my car in for service and a flat tire, and helping my parents by gassing and washing their cars for them.  Anytime I go out, I wear a mask the entire time and keep a bottle of hand sanitizer in my pocket.  I do not touch anything with my bare skin.  I have to wash my hands numerous times after doing something simple like picking up the gas pump using a paper towel, even though I do not touch anything myself.  When your OCD involves thinking that if you do not do something, yourself or people will die or get hurt, it can make you do things to the extreme.  When something like that is a feasible reality, especially with having older parents, it makes it worse.  My hands have gotten to the point where my skin is peeling off from how much I wash them.  Anytime I return from being outside, I have to take a shower.  My mother has been getting extremely concerned recently, and has said I should try phone counseling.  The breaking point was when I came home a few days ago after gassing both of my parents cars.  I did my usual things; pull up to a gas pump in the sun, make sure I am completely away from anyone, use paper towels to touch anything (including putting my card in the machine), and wash my hands frequently.  However, when I was out, I would see people without masks.  Because I was outside and away from them, it was in reality no problem at all.  But I couldn't stand it; thinking that there were people without masks (and this applies anywhere I go), makes me think that I could have caught it, and so it increases my tics and compulsions to make sure I wash my hands.  After seeing this, I made sure to get out of there as fast as I could.  When I came home, I took off my shirt and pants and ran to the bathroom, washing my hands in a frenzied state.  Anytime my parents would ask if I am okay, I would yell at them to get out of my way and leave me alone.  Afterward, I felt terrible; in that state I was so concerned with making sure I cleaned and got everything disinfected, I was yelling at my parents.  My mother and father were extremely concerned, and said I should really try phone counseling.  My mother also said to try to start controlling my thoughts.  So whenever I do something now that involves me being outside, I tend to mutter to myself reminders of not touching anything and staying calm.  I had to pick up my car today from an appointment, which was my sixth time out, and after using Lysol to disinfect the air inside my car and wiping everything down before getting in, the entire way home I was talking to myself saying ""Do not touch your face.  Do not touch any dials.  Roll down your windows.""  This was not a constant thing, but I would tell myself that every minute or so.This was mostly a vent,",10Nov2020,1

i have really bad social anxiety and that’s something that i have been wanting to work on. because classes are on zoom this year, i’ve been slowly making the effort to unmute myself and answer questions. it’s a lot easier because you’re not seeing everyone in person, but honestly it’s still a huge struggle.

every time i want to answer something, i go to click unmute but then i stop myself. what if it’s wrong? what will the class think? they already think i’m dumb, why should i make them think i’m dumber? thoughts like these keep flooding my head and i can never let myself speak in class without knowing 101% that the answer is correct.

179,"Hello everyone, I am a grad student pursuing Clinical Mental Health Counseling. I have narrowed down my therapeutic approach to positive psychology. Although I am still early on in my educational path, I have implemented some of the strategies I have researched into my daily life and have experienced amazing benefits to my mental health. 

One of the strategies is ""gratitude walks"". Fresh air, exercise and gratefulness are all ingredients to leading a better day! The walk usually starts off with obvious things you are grateful for but soon blossoms into full conversations with yourself that allow you to recognize how much you really have! After implementing this myself, I have noticed how much my willpower has grown just due to the idea that ""I have achieved so much already, I am capable of achieving more.""

 I made a youtube video defining it in my own words and describing how to embark on your own gratitude walk. If you'd like, please check it out! I hope this finds you well! Sending light, love and positivity!

181,"I don't even know where to start but as the title suggests I'm lost on what to do or how to continue or get better I currently have what I'd call physical impairments/disabilitys wich are IBS/IBD and lactose intolerance these two things make me feel like a high maintenance or a huge burden on others cause they can just walk into any restaurant and order anything and I have to customize my order to fit my needs wich is fine if I'm paying but if its like pizza or a group thing they can get whatever but I have to customize yet again wich cost them more money they always say its fine or don't worry about it but if they could be saving money I usally tell them I get something else or don't worry about it I don't want to take the money from them they earned it, It feels like I'm stealing from them everytime they go out of there way to do something I just can't figure it out. The other issue is my mental health wich I do go to a therapist/phyc for but they consists of to my knowledge Severe: Depression, Anxiety, ADHD and emotional disorder and I have anger issues ( they didn't elaborate on the last one tho) according to them ive had it since grade 4 so about 9 or 10 years old the teachers back then treated me like absolute shit Imma start with grade 4 -6 as I was saying the teacher littery picked on me if someone lost there homework they would be like no problem but if Iost they'd walk over to my desk Yell at me and then flip my desk/ empty my desk onto the floor and tell me to look for it while the whole class watched wich is also why kids fuckin bullied me everyday they probably saw the teacher do it so it was ok i was also forced to to presentations when I couldn't I had and still have in iep cause I was gifted I literally cried while doing the presentations and the the class did was laugh the teacher also told me I'd be in the kindergarten room while they taught the rest of the class sex ed cause I was immature so I walked out and then they proceeded to lock my bag in the classroom so I wouldn't be able to leave so I called them a retard and they got mad and took me to the principle wich thank fuckin God sided with me and he got chewed the fuck out after that the teacher stopped his bullshit to my knowledge I think he had a disorder wich makes them feel powerful I don't know if that exists or if they were just bullshiting the entire time I still want to break his legs lets see who above him when he's in a wheelchair( i have nothing against people in wheel chairs I'd treat them just the same as normal people im just ranting) but now going into grade 7-8 it was pretty chill until I swapped classes to this other teacher that littery didn't care either I was in HSP for most of my classes wich the teacher there was chill and gave me high-school level work to prepare me and snacks and cool stuff I also was the tech person I fixed all of the schools laptops they had internet issues wich was easy during  class time as per request of the guidance counselor and the librarian and my home room teacher flipped there shit saying I wasn't allowed to skip class to fix every laptop that the school uses wich our class was also using the next day (ur fuckin welcome) cause we had a test but the other teacher wich was nice offerd for me to come in at lunch to help me with my missed work wich I did but it still felt like punishment cause you   could here all kids having fun outside while I was catching up on work after saving the schools laptops on top of that in grade 8 I with the same ungrateful teacher and still in HSP since according to the home room teacher I wasn't able to do grade 7 level math the HSP teacher wich switched started to give me kindergarten to grade 4-6 math wich once I figured out the grade level  wich is at the top left of the paper I flipped my shit saying that I was doing high-school level math in grade 7 and told her I wasn't re doing the work I did fuckin 4 years ago cause I already passed that shit so I didn't do anything but I did help this girl with the math I didn't pass in grade 7 with her work for grades 7 and 8 but In the end close to graduation for grade 8 I was rocking a nice 20 to 30% in all my classes propably due to the fact I had a headache for 2 months wich was probably a mental health thing but my Iep manger or whatever you wanted to know why I was failing I told her and then she went to the guidance counselor and the said that they would boost my marks to passing grades wich was 70% for everything amd the teacher wasn't having it but who cares fuck them and for the record I passed high school with flying colors all passing grades if I ever meet that guidance counselor I'm gonna thank him I did then and I will again. The only bad experience in high-school was the math teacher yelling at me for finishing the test and quizzes in 5 to 10min wich I got 90% on all of them for going on my phone quietly while the other student wich didn't do the tests or any of the work blasted music in there headphones wich everyone could here while they were on there phone the entire time amd the coop teacher yelling at me saying I'm shit beacuse me with engineering experience wich they knew and sent my off to a web design placement wich then I told the employer I couldn't do it and told them I told the teacher the same thing saying in there terms I burned the bridge of opportunity with that company for student that wanted to do it so I told her to go fuck herself and that maybe they should listen and not make promises to employers before hand and then I went to guidance and dropped the course wich meant I couldn't graduate with the special course load I was doing wich was SHSM/ICT thanks coop the other coop teacher also said it was unessasary for me to drop and told her to fuck off to cause she was the one who help the other bitch teacher boasting 20+years experience both full of shit.

I kinda went off topic but onto why I made this post I lost my cat a couple years back to cancer it was the first time I've seen something die I watched them put him to sleep it was very painful i got to hold him one last time I didn't want to let him go the vet stayed there sorry for our loss but she probably says that every day so i didn't care (not in a mean way but generally speaking) I blame myself there was no signs of pain if I did something sooner maybe... but he was old so it was going to happen but I didn't want to happen in pain like that but a year later my great grandfather died before that thou he was the greatest person but as his health got lower he started to forget people he remembered me out of everything he was going threw he want me to visit but I couldn't handle seeing him I that state I hate myself for doing that he wanted to see me on his last day but I couldn't do it i went to his funeral and it hurt even more it still dose (fuck this hurts to write i never told anyone this im crying as I write this) moving on my great grandmother is doing good currently but everytime my family goes to visit her im the only one who doesn't go i basically told my self if I don't visit her anymore when her time comes it will be less painful to deal with. To me emotions are a weapon and seal them away cause they can used against you when your most vulnerable so I'm at the point where if someone dose something nice I can't say thank you although i want to say it deep inside I can't to me thank you is to submit amd please is to beg I hate it I hate almost everything now im currently 20 and threw out my entire life I don't have even one girl friend and I  this day and age its kinda hard to trust a girl cause of all the bullshit media and false rape accusations and other shit I want to have a girlfriend but what if I goes south like if she cheats or marries me and and gets a divorce and half or all of  everything I worked up to is gone I don't know. I'm also having really bad nightmares I collect knife cause there cool but I've had to lock them up cause I don't trust my self with them anymore but I've bought one of those anime body pillows to keep me company and comfortable when they happen. I'm also into drawing anime girls surprise but anyway I'm going down the mid set of ""who needs freinds when you can draw them they'll be perfect cause I made them and they'll will never leave you ever they'll  be with you forever"" I recently got to cats so I'm still lonely anymore but it helps

So far family doesn't feel like its helping but if they are im not seeing it other than  the bs you don't need those meds just because ur brother has doesn't mean you do ur just copying for attention, fuck that 
On top of that everytime I told them I signed up for a job  them just say ""you signed up looking like that"" you'll never get a job looking like that well the fuck else im i supposed to look i gotten to the point where I can't look my self in the mirror mind you I do manual labour currently but thats besides the point.

I feel so high maintenance and I've lost all confidence locked all my emotions away so I don't care about anything and distanced my self from people so I can't hurt them and feel responsible and they can't hurt me I just don't know where to go or what to do who's gonna wanna date someone with 2 physical impairments and 4 mental ones and be happy for the rest of there life with me im just so lost 😔

186,"Do we ever know who we truly are? Our True Purpose of Being on this Earth? How can we even come anywhere near resonating if we don't try? If we don't taste? Taste various forms of passions. ""Trial and Error"", when Really it is ""Trial and Learning"".

Why is it that when we as a society have a passion for something we are so quick to think of what to do, or maybe the first moves but it takes so long sometimes for the action to come in place? Why do we care about other peoples opinions so much that it allows us to stand still? Instead of trying, either being successful with our idea, or learning what we liked about that said focus, what we didn't and what we can do better next time.

I believe truly that when the Knowing tells you what your next move should be, FOLLOW IT. Remove the need of thinking about your friends, family, guardian, partner, acquaintances etc. They aren't you and most definitely you aren't them. Why Worry?

If you want to start a business, Start. If you want to use your voice to make change in the world, Start. If you want to start doing yoga outside in the park, Start. If you want to write a book, Start. If you want to dance in the rain, Start. More importantly, DO. Act on what you feel is right for you.

We have 1 life. 1 chance with many chances to learn, fail (learn), grow, evolve and be our true authentic self by becoming fearless.

Fearlessness is not the fact that you don't fear things, but even though the fear has come into your eyesight, you still PERSEVERE. IT feels good as well. The pain, the fear, of yourself, societies ""judgment"", the unknown, can be scary, but the most beautiful part of life is that when YOU follow through, YOU do what YOU know is right for YOU, You will look back and say to yourself, ""I was scared of doing that?"" and laugh. With Happiness and Empowerment that you have started your Journey, which we ARE ALWAYS ON........ but thats a conversation for another day.

Today: Start. Do 1 thing that you have always told yourself YOU wanted to do. Make 1 move towards it. You are WELL on your way already. Its your TIME Now, to Begin or to Continue Working Hard on whatever it is that FUELS your Flame. Sister, I love you. I know you CAN.

187,"i’m so scared. i’m only 14 and my boyfriend who i was extremely close with broke up with me a little over a week ago. it crushed me so hard and i was depending on him for my happiness which is so wrong and i know that. i struggle with ocd and i struggling with handling my emotions and they get so intense and those things affected him everyday so he broke up with me. things have been like a roller coaster of emotions since then. one day we were planning on getting back together soon in the future but i think it ruined it. i let my emotions get the best of me again and i dumped my problems on him and i didn’t even want to. all of this morning i felt so happy and i felt as if we were dating again even though i knew we weren’t. i started doing so many good things and kept a schedule and did my school work the way that i should be. i was confused about where this happiness was coming from and that started to upset me and i told him about it. we argued and he told me i was being manipulative. i hate the word manipulative i don’t ever want to do that to anyone and it makes me feel so awful. it’s hard not to do things that are considered manipulative when i feel everything so strongly. i felt so bad and i tried so hard to stop talking to him after that i even said bye but i just kept talking even after saying i would stop as if i had lost control. all i want is to be with him it’s all that i care about right now. i have completely given up on doing the things i should do like schoolwork and basic self care again. everything hurts so bad. no one around me seems to understand this pain. i can’t talk to him anymore and it feels like i have no one else. i know i have other people in my life but i only feel truly comforted when i’m talking to him. so my mind keeps telling me over and over that there’s no one else. i feel so scared and alone. i feel like there’s nothing left for my future. he told me that the fact that my emotions are like this is part of what made it so hard to date me. i know he wasn’t trying to hurt me when he said that but it just hit me so hard. i’m sick of hurting him. i have never tried to hurt him before ever but i do it almost everyday. i care deeply about practically everyone that i know but i can’t stop hurting people. when i get close to someone i just hurt them. i’m sick of being this huge burden to everyone. i don’t act like the people around me. i’m sick of feeling things so strong but then feeling completely numb like 10 minutes later. i just need help and no one can help me but i can’t help myself either. it feels like  i’m drowning. i get lifted so high up that everything feels amazing but then everything crashes back down with a single sentence. it’s like reality keeps coming back and hitting me again over and over. it feels like we break up over and over again every single day. i can’t escape it. it feels like i have nothing and it’s always felt that way. my feelings for him are so dangerous. i know that if he were to abuse me one day then i would just let it happen if it meant i could be with him. that’s so messed up. i know it’s messed up, but what else can i even do? yesterday i didn’t even want to get back together with him but then it became all i could think about and then it felt like we were together again for some reason. i felt so happy everything felt happy again. i kept replaying old memories with him and pretending like they were real. when i texted him and told him how weird i felt about all of this he told me we were not together anymore. of course i already knew this and he knew that i knew it but reading it in a text just slapped me in the face and made it all come back. i don’t know if i’m a horrible person but i don’t want to be. i want to be good and i want to make people happy but i just can’t seem to do that.",10Nov2020,1
188,"I can function fairly well most of the time, but my mood seems to be utterly dependent on how others treat me in a given day. The past few days I was even doing mostly alright and functioned fairly well, but today I got mildly criticized at work for making a mistake and suddenly it's like I fell into this black hole of misery. I became extremely anxious and felt like the worst piece of shit on earth.

I also got extremely pissed but kept that to myself. I simultaneously felt like said criticism was unjust and like I was a hard worker who just happened to miss a minor detail, while at the same time feeling like I'm actually incredibly lazy and only pretending to be a diligent worker. Whenever something like that happens it's like my thoughts keep spinning, but said thoughts make me angrier and angrier. I keep imagining getting berated by higher-ups and by my family and it just makes me increasingly mad.

This happens pretty often and always leaves me so anxious and nervous that even after work I can't bring myself to do anything. Eventually I went back into drinking heavily too, even though I told myself I'd quit, but I only manage to not drink when I feel good.

Man, I shouldn't be this easily upset. I'm on waiting lists for therapists too, but it's still gonna be a long time until I actually get appointments and the shit I'm describing keeps happening.

Do you have any advice perhaps? Anything is greatly appreciated.",10Nov2020,1

190,"TW for suicidal thoughts
Life seems sad. Really fucking sad. It's trying not to fall off the mountain, just for the sake of being alive. Financially? Badly. Health? Badly. People? Badly. In home? Badly. Outside? Badly. Death is definitely peaceful, you are just not aware anymore. But I cry, that  if I find a way to kill myself now, it would all be for nothing. I haven't achieved anything, but every effort I made was for nothing. I am trapped. The fucking guilt. There's so much guilt from one side, and suffering from the other. I just don't know what to do anymore. I want some peace. And I never get to have it. It feels like death is all that exists for me. And it's too fucking sad that I couldn't have something else. I am so fucking sad that I can't have something else.",10Nov2020,1

194,"Covid destroyed my anxiety..please read, please help

26 year old, healthy active male, but with terrible anxiety. I got covid with very mild symptoms. I recovered, but the whole time I was googling what potential long term effects could happen to me. 

Two days post quarantine, I was laying on the couch and I just started to quiver/tremble, with sudden random twitches in my legs. It was right after a google spurt where I was looking up mental effects. I haven’t really had much relief from this shaky feeling. I just keep googling. And googling. Now I convinced myself I developed ALS because of the twitches... or Parkinson’s. I’m a mess psychologically. I know how unlikely all of that is. But I can’t shake this feeling. My head feels light, sometimes my neck twitches. And my legs just feel weird. 

My anxiety has been bad my whole life, but never had symptoms like this. Is this normal for anxiety? Or is something else going on?.. the shaking and twitching hit me all of sudden, one second I was fine, the next I was not. I wonder if the stress I put myself through caught up with me. But I have no idea truly. Please help...",10Nov2020,1

196,"Hello all! I am 18/f and have struggled with anxiety and depression since the 4th grade. 

I had been off of meds for a while when quarantine hit. About a month in of not leaving my house or seeing my friends (especially a bad experience since it was my senior year of HS), I had a complete mental breakdown. This resulted in me going back on meds to treat the anxiety and depression. The medicine worked, but since then I have been stuck in a continuous dissociative episode for 8-9 months. There was never a day I wasn’t. Everything and everyone felt like they didn’t exist, like I didn’t exist, like I was watching my life through a TV screen, constantly on autopilot. I couldn’t connect to anyone. 

This past Friday night I had another breakdown, which I believe to be an episode of weed-induced psychosis, as up until then I was self-medicating with weed for anxiety. This landed me in the hospital Sunday night. 

I talked to the mental health assessor there who wasn’t much help (he told me to get a self help book or find a religion) but when the doctor came in, he gave me some Xanax to calm down. I did, and by the time my mom drove me back to the house, I was very, VERY sedated. 

Monday I woke up. Both physically and mentally. The moment I got out of bed and stepped outside, I realized that I was real. The world no longer was flat and bland. I felt like a human being for the first time in 9 months. Everything from the trees to the grass was so much brighter, I could smell the flowers and hear the birds and it was so wonderful. 

I went back to school today (Tuesday, first semester of freshmen year at Uni) and my friends look so beautiful. They’re real, they’re 3D, my love for and my connections with them are so real and I am a person again. 

I don’t know what the Xanax did, or maybe it was the fact I got all my experiences out there, but I am free. I am holding onto the hope that this will last. 

I am free. I am happy. I exist. I am here. 

(If anyone else has had a similar experience, I’d love to hear it.)",10Nov2020,1
197,"Today before taking a shower I started to trim my beard. I had it for maybe a year now. I was doing some simple shaping but I fucked up and ended up with huge patch on my left cheek. So i decided I need to trim it down with hair trimmer. As soon as shaved my beard, I noticed how pathetic I look - weak chin, chubby cheeks, weird head shape. I always hated how I look without a beard but fuck... It's worse than I remember. I feel so stupid, like I'm some pathetic excuse for a human being. Worst of it all is that every family member, for the longest time said that the beard doesn't suit me, that I look better shaved, but I don't think so. I feel naked. Not just physically but also mentally. The beard is like a shield for me, I feel more confident, braver  and overall happier. It has been just around one hour that I shaved it and I already hate myself. I don't wanna step out of my house until it grows back.",10Nov2020,1
198,"So long story short, a couple months ago I was losing my mind feeling trapped inside my apartment with very little to do. Like many of you, probably. It was just me and my roommate going about our usual routine, and life just seemed so... bleak. Then my friend asked if I could babysit his kitten and it was a game changer. I found out cuddling, nuzzling, feeding and caring for a cat was so rewarding and realized how special the bond between cats and humans are. So I adopted my own kitten a few weeks later, and we fell instantly in love with each other. I have so much time to appreciate the little moments between us, to watch him grow, and to witness our bond grow stronger everyday because we spend so much time together. Not only that, but I feel more confident in reaching out to my friends and family on social media/phone again because I don’t feel alone anymore. I would say if you are feeling alone or you are looking for a sense of purpose during this time, I highly recommend getting a pet, because this is a rare occasion where your bond with your pet will be stronger than ever. If you want to follow my cat on IG, I post almost every day and you can watch him grow too. @finn_the_feline_._._

TLDR; Adopted a cat during quarantine, and our bond continues to grow rapidly day by day. Very rewarding experience and eases the pains of quarantine.",10Nov2020,1
199,"I've in the past posted about my father going back to binge drinking after being clean for 15 or so years. In march, I possibly contracted covid. Since I'm in the US and during the beginning they weren't testing unless they were 100% certain you had it. I wasn't coughing or anything I lost my sense of taste and was having very intense bouts of vertigo along side an absurdly high fever (105.9F being the highest). I missed 3 weeks of work in case I did, shortly after my father quit his job. Leaving us with only my mom's income as the source of a steady paycheck, which honestly isn't a lot of money. 

He doesn't help around the house at all despite him being the only one without a job. My brother is a full time student, my mom is a shelf stocker at a grocery store, and I work just about full time at a coffeehouse. 

Since he does nothing at home and is bored. He took to drinking again. In the past when he drank, he raped my mom and threatened her multiple times. I cried in my closet until i fell asleep numerous times when I was 6. On good days he would disappear for days at a times, and on bad days my parents would battle for hours and I would come back after running away from home to a living room that I didn't recognize. The worst I remember was the couch flipped over and clothes littered everywhere. My mom would tell him that she would divorce him and he would retort back that she cant live without his money cause she doesn't have a high school degree.  

I then, usually get the brunt of his amnesty. His exact words being ""your brother is my only son, and your sister provided me grandchildren. You...well..."". To my suprise later that year and completely clueless that I was constenting to this, my folks emancipated me from my family at 18. Meaning, I declared myself as independent and had to find my own insurance and they were no longer financially supporting me. The only financial support i was recieving was the roof over my head which was enough for him. Oh I forgot to mention he wanted to make me (and only me) pay for rent under ""his roof"". Since I'm ""old enough that I should be married by now."" He never asked my sister and he admits he will never ask my brother for rent. Just me. My only saving grace is my mom who screamed at him for treating me different.

Anyway I bring this up because since my dad quit his job my mom and my brother dont have insurance now. I asked them why they don't they emancipate him so he can earn state insurance (since he's a student with no income). And they literally looked at me like I had 5 heads. ""Well we dont want to do that to him"". 

To try to earn my trust again he's forced himself physically into my personal space, which I kicked him promptly in the chest. I was sexually abused in the past by an ex friend of mine which explains my actions. It doesn't justify them, I acknowledge I over reacted and I feel horrible for behaving that way.

He also turns around at openly makes jokes about having sex with my mother. Every time he brings it up I feel physically nauseous and want to throw up. I've told him this and he just ignores me. He's even cracked jokes at my boyfriend about ""railing me"". 

Why I make this post ultimately not only to get all this steaming pile of shit off my chest. But to share what the icing on the cake was:

I heard him talking shit about me to my mom after his alcoholic episode about ""knowing that i have issues"" the context being my fascination in paganism where he's a ""wholesome Christian proud boy"".

Apparently an apology through my brother was enough for him because the magic words ""I'm sorry"" fixes everything. Even if its through a 3rd party.",10Nov2020,1

I can’t take living here like this anymore, everything’s always my fault, I get the blame for everything, I get accused of being lazy despite the fact I do more here than my dad.

My mum won’t let me get a new doctor despite the fact mine does nothing to help me (I’m disabled, mentally ill and have autism) My mum constantly talks to me about her problems (how she’s in love with the neighbour, and she thinks he’s cheating on his wife with my mums sister) my mum n dad constantly argue, (mainly cause my mum is accusing him of cheating) My mum also won’t let me do my hobbies cause I have to do em in the kitchen and it makes a mess (I always clean up) My mum also always likes to twist my own Heath and problems around to suit her, for example when I want to move out it’s “you can’t take care of yourself, you’re autistic and ill ect” but when she’s having a go at me for something it’s “you need to grow up and start doing more, there’s nothing wrong with you ect” 

I don’t know what I’m supposed to do anymore? Like I can’t cope, i spend every day alone, (mum stays in bed till 3 in the afternoon, dad doesn’t come home till 5 and my bf doesn’t finish work till 7) I’m alone everyday , I have no friends, no other family.

207,"Everything used to feel so real to me (20F). I could feel emotions, time seemed to pass normally, I had no worries that the things around me weren't real. Starting late last year, I lost that ability. Everything just seems so blurry to me in life, everything seems to be happening to me instead of having choices, and I blink and suddenly four months are gone. I have no more emotions about anything, nothing makes me happy, and nothing makes me sad. I have no clue why.

At that time I was on a new medication called Welbutrin for anxiety. I began to notice this while on it around month two, so I weaned off and quit it, but this effect still remains one year later. I definitely have some depression as well as some trauma, but I can't pinpoint what would be causing this. I don't drink, I smoked weed for a couple of years but not heavily and I quit when I was 18, and I don't use any other anti-depressants/ pain-pills/ anxiety-meds/ etc. I exercise sometimes, I don't live alone, and I have multiple jobs and activity outlets.

I would really like to gain my feeling in life back, because all of the information I have seen about derealization says it is really short term or could be a part of a larger psychosis problem. I don't have any symptoms of any psychotic disorders that I could find, and nothing runs in my family besides bipolar. Has anybody else experienced what I am going through and got out of it? My therapist is useless, I have a master's in Psychology that cannot help me, and I genuinely feel hopeless and that I have somehow lost my mind. Thank you kindly.

TLDR: I have very strong derealization and cannot seem to figure out why or how to end it.",10Nov2020,1
208,"I need help. I don't know if this is normal or not. 

My whole life I've lived for other people. I never actually did what I wanted to do, ever. 

My therapist reccomended I join dating sites to try and pursue a relationship. Something I have never done before. I'm 30. I did so and about a year later I found someone and started talking to them. Things we're moving along but something happened to make them distrust me. I spent weeks trying to make up for it, they kept insisting that I could never do it but made me feel obligated to keep trying, because of promises that I made to them. 

Weeks later I decided to visit. We had fun but fought all the time. The relationship was moving fast, so fucking fast. But I was willing to keep going because I wanted to be there for them and it felt like I was building something. Over time I started to realize it wasn't what I wanted. That a relationship was something I started to hate the idea of. It got to the point where every day I felt nothing but pain and fear. I tried to end things but they wouldn't let me. They made me feel like I was obligated to stay and keep trying. Because they loved me. I kept telling them, begging them to let me go. They never did. 

They told me to take a week of seperation and see if I still felt the same by the end of of it. We were officially together almost 2 months. But it felt like years. I can't perceive those months as actually happening. The world feels like it's in a constant fog and I feel seperated from myself. I feel like I was living someone else's life. I can't convince myself sometimes that the world around isn't orchestrated. I've noticed little things and they bother me to no end. 

And example being that yesterday my mom made ramen soup for dinner. But she gave us all spoons to eat with me. I asked her how we were supposed to eat it with spoons? It's impossible. She looked at me like I was crazy. And began to try and eat. Eventually I got up and got us all forks. What the fuck? It makes no sense. Nothing makes any fucking sense anymore. I don't know what is happening to my mind. I feel so lost. Last night a horn was going off in my neighborhood at 3am. It kept going on and off for an hour until I fell back asleep. When I woke up for work at 7am it went off one more time and stopped. I asked my mom if she heard anything and she said no.

I'm becoming unhinged. I keep waiting for my world to fall back into place but it won't.",10Nov2020,1
209,"So I was never formally diagnosed with an eating disorder or even met a phycologist over it. But I am sure I have one. I gained 5 kilos (went from 55 to 60 kilo) in less than 5 months and this is where my ed started. First I was only doing it to lose weight and I was patient but then I got happier seeing the number on the scale go down and I was devastated when it went up or stayed the same. I start using exercise as a sort of punishment and skipping meals, favourite food and more. I ended up eating less than 1000 calories per day over a long period of time, most days another 900 calories. I lost 10 kilos in less than two and a half months, and obviously not in a healthy way.

I am trying to recover on my own without sharing it with anybody but my family is making it really hard. They also played a small but important part in my ed, from their small comments or looks. My dad is on a diet, but he doesn't really talk about it more than needed. But my mom, she is causing the most troubles. She is getting on a diet of 1200 calories to lose weight. She wants to get to weight 56 or 57 knowing that my weight was not so long ago 55, and she is talking about it in front of me. She constantly using the scale to measure her food and even points out at my food. Sometimes estimating the calories (which doesn't help) saying I should take a healthier option and more.

But on the other hand, she cooks most of her food with oil and a lot, and thank you to my ed I don't eat it. Which causes me to take something else with even lower calories for dinner.

I am trying to fix it, but it feels almost impossible to do it on my own. And my parents sometimes unknowingly compliment my body like ""You are so thin!"" ""When did you get that thin buddy you look great!"" or ""You are so skinny!"" and they encourage my ed even more. And everybody (besides my dad) gives me a sense of judgment when I eat with them. I don't know what to do. I am currently trying to get to eat 1400 calories per day but right now I barely make it 1200 with my activity level and age is obviously not healthy at all.

210,"My first post here. I have an issue. I've never seen a therapist my whole life. I am 32M. Happily married to the love of my life who I've known since I was 12. 

I got hired in a very large company at the beginning of this year. A dream company, I am a little under qualified for my job but I usually am for any job that I took in the past and in a span of few months I become very competent and performed really well. I have moved up the ladder pretty quickly in my career and I've been told that I am intelligent and quick learner. 

This job is the highest paying job I ever earned, it is great financially. 

Parents still alive. I am doing well in all aspects. Life is great, right?

Pandemic happened. 2 months into the company and got sent to work from home and still do. I didnt get a chance to learn from people or even to get to know them since there are over 6000 people in my office. I wouldn't know them all but at least the people that I would dealing with which I only got to know my team. 

Since I am underqualified but landed this job I didnt get the chance to fully learn it, which is fine in theory. I should be able to learn it on my own specially that I am working from home.

I have work tasks that I just neglect and not do anything about them. I am sitting infornt of my laptop watching some youtube, reddit or just doing nothing.

I like video games, i dont play them anymore because i just cant enjoy it.

I play the guitar, I cant hold it for more than 10 minutes. 

I tried different new activities. Nothing is intriguing. 

I cant do anything for more than 10 minutes. I am lacking interest in everything. Even my wife who i am very comfortable with i force my self to enjoy my self with her unlike the past. 

I just don't feel motivated, no energy. I don't enjoy anything. I took a break and came back. Nothing changed. 

I am worried about my job because it is the best opportunity that I have ever got in my life but I seem to let it fall off of my hands. 

I dont know what is happening to me..",10Nov2020,1
211,"I'm tired of this. When I was a kid, one of my caretakers died and only one was left to raise me. It got to a point to where she was unable to take care of me due to her own mental problems and I had to raise myself. Little discipline, couldnt talk to her or ask her for anything. Didn't have a car so the anxiety of taking care of my 2 pets and not having reliable emergency transportation was terrifying. Took me to the doctor only once for my depression and never took me back. Any physical pain I felt didn't concern her so I always had to wonder what was wrong with my body. Couldn't connect to her emotionally. Everytime something was wrong with our finances she refused to try to figure it out until we talked her into it and we would go long times without supplies because we couldn't buy it. Now I'm an adult. In trying to take charge of my life. It's getting extremely hard though. It's hard to care about anything. It's hard to not get distracted. It's hard to not feel dependant. It's hard to feel motivation or like any of this matters. I love her, and I know it was due to her own medical condition, but I just hate this situation. I'll make it through this and I can keep going forward. I just needed to say this to someone.",10Nov2020,1
212,"(Sorry this is lengthy, I feel I need to explain fully AND get it off my chest)I (26F) work in a legal office as an administrator and returned to work last week after 7 months on furlough. I understand it's natural to have anxiety about going back to work and for it to feel difficult to get back into work life however I feel like im really not coping with being back.

All of the office are working from home due to covid-19 except I was asked to go into the office every other week on rotation with the receptionist to be there physically for no other reason than to accept the post. This means being alone in the office for 8 hours, 5 days a week. 

My first day back my manager informed me of a change of plan. I would be in the office constantly, not working from home at all and have to move from sitting on reception where couriers/visitors would come in, to sit on the office floor alone indefinitely. This is due to a coworker insisting on being in the office to sit on reception to deal with visitors and couriers and answer the phone calls.

On top of this my job has changed completely. I have lost all my responsibilities of maintaining the office as all staff are at home, the office is not in use and I no longer have the reception duties to carry out. All I have been given to do is scan 10yr old documents stuffed into 50 archive boxes for the next few months until things go back to normal. 

It making me feel extremely down about being back to work. I've expressed my feelings to my manager who can't give me anything else to do as the work has been given to staff who were taken back before me and I have been told ""stick it out, you're stil getting paid"". I can appreciate that in the current climate lots of people have lost their jobs but what about support for people who have been off for months and personal circumstances have changed due to the pandemic. Usually when people are off work for so long they get a phased return and support throughout the return.

I've gone from being outdoors, walking my dog everyday, doing exercise at home, doing artwork and having ""freedom"" to suddenly sitting alone in an office constantly with nothing to do. It's a huge struggle and I feel like every little thing makes me cry or get stressed about the situation. I feel trapped because I know that trying to find another job with the same pay and hours I need is next to impossible right now.

216,"I’m almost afraid to reach out for help again.

5 years ago I started my mental health journey, got a psych and a little therapy, threw me on an ssri, benzo, and eventually a stimulant. This combo kicked ass for a couple years but 3 years in things started getting weird. First psych moved to another state so I went to a new one with these increasing side effects/issues, and decreasing functionality. She took me off the benzo and the stim without thinking I’d have any withdrawal...after being on it for 3 years....well now she knows because she put me through a traumatic 6 months of withdrawal.

Left her ass 8 months later, started tapering off the ssri, got back on the stimulant. Now a year and a half later I’m still struggling greatly, haven’t been able to drop the ssri only got to the lowest dose. Still having increasing memory issues, depression/anxiety/suicidiality etc.

Ever since the horrible benzo withdrawal, I’ve been obsessed with the idea of getting off all meds and it’s still my goal, and I’m afraid the minute I step foot in another psychs office they’ll shove pills down my throat again. But at this rate I feel I haven’t improved (in any way shape or form) in the last 8 months that I’ve been holding out at the lowest dose of ssri. 

I feel scorned by the psychiatric establishment and want to stay as far away from it as possible... and yet the only way to go forward safely I feel is to be given the greenlight by one of these doctors to continue my taper. It’s such a catch 22… Why do these doctors seem to just make things worse?",10Nov2020,1
217,"I have beyond a Masters

Over age 45

Local reduced fee to no fee places in my State are predominantly in areas with a larger concentration of black and Latinos.

It meets the needs of that community 

I've had counseling psych in my studies

Cultural fit is important. 

I visited the clinic. I was the only caucaian woman there. The therapist was black. I told her I was born in the Gramercy Park area of NY. I went to prep school there. 

And she stopped me. 

She said she deals mostly with patients who were generationally poor.

I told her why I was pushed down to where I am, and she and I both agreed that we were not compatible because she kept saying, ""I do not know what to tell you. My clients never had what you had growing up, your current situation is unfortunate.""

That is WHY not all therapists or sliding scale places can help.

They arent designed to work with ALL people. If the only common piece is lack of income, then it limits the client to ONE or FEW options, and that doesnt meet all the different needs that walk thru the door.

In a therapeutic context, one needs to feel understood. I was understood from the standpoint that the therapist admitted that I was going to the wrong places (despite being free or low scale) because I wasnt raised in the demographics where they primarily are located.

Going there would not help because their solutions are disability or welfare, snap and low income housing supported by low income work and childcare.

I can't get work. I've posted this here before. That doesn't register with a lot of people who can get work, and exist on any income.

I can't live on just any income.

219,"Hello everyone! Today, I am sharing some things that been bothering me a week now. So basically, I've been feeling light-headed and I don't have any appetite to eat even the ones that are my favorite. I thought it could be cause by my antidepressants because I didn't took it after an incident that broke me to pieces. Idk if it's normal after you ate your antidepressants you feel like you are being control by something and you aren't aware of it happening. Btw, I was not supposed to stop eating my pills until my next section with my doctor.

The incident that cause me to stopped eating my pills, was when I triggered my bf and I wasn't aware until I realized when he ended our face time. That's when I regret everything I said. By eating my pills, I nearly broke up my friendship and my relationship.

Back to the main point, when I stand up or sit normally, I would feel like I'm going to faint or my eyes started to loose control and can't focus. When that happened, I would usually make sure that I can lay down or lean on something. So, my question is that, is everything cause by my pills because of me suddenly stopped eating it? Or something else? Btw, I've not yet get my period. It's nearly been 3 months.

Struggling with eye contact at the moment and it is crazy, also struggling with social anxiety. 

I had really bad time in my life where my mam died (I found her dead), I then did really stressful masters and then moved away from my friends and family to another city.

What’s you’re purpose all day long?
To make people strong,
Or to make them feel wrong,
For ever believing they can be saved,
Cuz’ child,
I’ve come back from the grave.
I’ve felt your pain,
My tears became rain,
I’ve wanted it to end,
But then I saw you my friend.
I saw you my beautiful child,
And I saw how life became defiled. 
So I lived,
And now your mistakes can be hid,
Your soul can be forever clean.
If you had only seen,
All the pain I went through for you!
So you could return to your home above,
Because child,
You are loved.

Light from the loving one,
Life has just begun, and continues to tick,
Until the truth sticks,
And you realize,
You sympathize,
Because you don’t have what they do.
So search in you,
Find what’s true, 
And soon you’ll have the light too.",10Nov2020,1

239,"Hey everyone, 22F here with pretty anxiety/panic disorder. These past few weeks have been hell and recently, I've been finding my voice. I grew up always being told that my opinion didn't matter, so i grew up silent and became an adult without a voice.

I didn't grow up with my bio parents. To this day, i don't know my mother. I just know what her name is and what she looks like. My parents were meth addicts and i was taken away as a baby. I knew my dad as i'd go visit every now and then. I grew up with my cousins who i treated like my parents. I have 2 half sisters from my dad's side and he's always been verbally abusive to all 3 of us and would use intimidation on us if we didn't obey, he's a scary guy. In 2018 i moved from the US to the UK and he didn't like that one bit, and would gaslight me about ""abandoning him"" every time i called, so i stopped calling so often. Apparently he was doing the same thing when my sisters stopped coming over so often, and so they started calling and coming over less too.

Today it all came to a head when he posted some political bs on facebook on his public feed, and i commented on it. A few minutes later he then called me in a rage that i dared to comment on his public post, and it quickly spiralled out of control into a full on screaming match about personal matters i'd rather not post about, most of which was verbal abuse hurled my way. I worked up all my courage and told him he was the most unsupportive father i'd seen, and how could he be so bitter that his child had accomplished her life dream at 22? Would he rather me be sitting around unsuccessful in life still staying at home with my cousins just so i wouldn't be in another country? I told him how he was never there for me growing up and how he never cared when i was being passed around from family to family, watching said family members die. He said to me ""funny how you hate your sh*t mother so much because you're just like her"". He then went on another pity party about how i ""abandoned him and the family in favor of some damn Brits"", and he crapped all over my marriage, my life, and told me he never gave a crap about his son in law, my husband.

This man always threw pity parties for himself, always expecting his 3 kids to put in all the effort in our relationship while he sat there and did nothing, putting in zero effort and then scolding us when we couldnt be bothered to keep up this one-sided relationship full of gaslighting and verbal abuse. Despite being 5000 miles away i was still terrified about confronting him over the phone and was shaking the whole time, but i stood up and told him how i felt. I forwarned my sisters that he planned to call and scream at them too, to which they promptly blocked him. I hope he enjoys his new child-free life as he has no more kids, and I've learned to cut toxic family members when i see it. I had a massive panic attack after hanging up the phone, but i'm fine now more or less. My dad is dead to me now.

I guess what i'm trying to say is don't keep toxic people in your life just because they're family. ""But family-"" is nothing more than an excuse for toxic behavior and giving a pass for abuse. I cut off many of my family members this year, one told me to kill my child while another was just constantly full of bs. Kick them out of your heart for your own mental good. It feels freeing when they're gone, trust me. I cried today, but not for my dad. I cried over the illusion of my dad, i cried for the good memories and fun times i had, not for the toxic manipulative person my dad was and is. It's hard to cut these sorts of people out, especially when you look back at the good times but do not keep these people in your life over the illusion they've created. To anyone out there dealing with toxic family, take a stand.

P.S. i also sent my cousin a lengthy appreciation text thanking her and her husband for raising me and being everything my real parents failed to be. I know my situation is probably pretty mild compared to others but the point still stands, do not continue to deal with toxic family members ""because family"". That is bs.",10Nov2020,1

242,"So some background info on me, I have dealt with depression for the past few years, and the past 2 months I’ve been experiencing almost daily what feels like me disconnecting from reality. It’s really hard to explain but it feels like when it happens, I lose all emotion and if I’m driving, the thought of me getting in an accident didn’t affect me. I almost feel like when it happens I’m in 3rd person. Any help would be appreciated",10Nov2020,1
243,"Good morning, afternoon, evening! 

So, with the last few posts, I have been discussing Mental Health within men. As it is November, the *Movement Movement* is currently on-going to help and progress men’s health. But, today, I will discuss further about women and their Mental Health, which is as equally important. 

It’s been known that Mental Health is more common within women. It has also been known that abuse is often the main factor that causes the Mental Health problems. Down below, I will be discussing topics in greater detail, from women who are experiencing depression/anxiety to carers, from social support to dementia. I will try and cover as much information as possible. 

Women tend to be busy people. Let’s face it, they have a lot in their plates. From being to mothers to working full-time jobs, it’s not always an easy time to be a woman. Traditionally, women tend to look out to everyone in their family to ensure that they are okay physically and mentally. When it comes to working, there are millions and millions of women carers, who are doing a tremendous job. Women tend to care more for others, for example: *their children, parents, partner, family and friends*. Statistics have shown that women who work as carers are more likely to suffer with anxiety or depression, rather than women who work other jobs. The statistics also shows 3/4 of people who care for a person who has mental health difficulties are women, and the average age of the women carers is *62*. 

*So, what needs to happen when a women is struggling with Mental Health*? To gain as much support as possible. Luckily, women tend to loyal friendships with one another. By having that group of friends it helps to protect their Mental Health, they are provided with a source of support, for example during hard times or a loss of change. Men and women, at times, can be completely different. Women generally talk about their feelings more freely than men, and typically have a stronger social networks of friends and family. Women are much likely to tell someone when they are trouble, usually a family member, a friend or partner. This is very, very good to do. A good social support can help greatly in the long-run, it plays a massive part in Mental Health illness and it can also help people to recover from it. 

Thanks to https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/a-to-z/w/women-and-mental-health, here are a few statistics about Mental Health and women:

- Women are more likely to be treated for a Mental Health problem than men (29%, while men are 17, which is incredibly low). 
- 25% of people who die from suicide are women. (If you’re able to do the math, 75% of them are men). 

This brings me to my next question, why is the number of men so much greater and higher than women? When I mean greater, it is a *huge difference*. As you all know, women have a bigger emotional literacy and readiness to be able to talk to other people on how they truly feel inside. They are more likely to talk to others, to gain emotional support and seek help from suicidal thoughts. There are also the **social factors** that comes into play... for example:

- **Women have more on their hands than men**. For example, taking care of their children, care for other relatives and much more. Due to this, it can affect a women in different ways, such as physical health, emotional health, it will take away their social activities and become a financial issue. 
- **Women are more than just a person**. They are a mother, partner, carers... also, working full-time and running a household, which many are doing by themselves. They will simply get no more “*me time*”, as they are constantly busy throughout the days. 
- **Women and jobs**. It has been established than women get payed much less than men. For example, look at the sporting world... not only that, but a regular 9-5 job, they will get payed less. What does this mean? Low status jobs = low income. Women are more likely to live in poverty than men. 
- **Physical and sexual abuse**. Women are more likely to be abused, physically and mentally, than men. Due to this, it can have a long-term impact on women’s Mental Health. This can be made even harder when they have nobody to turn to and express how they feel. 

Women experience depression more than men. In their lifetime, 1 in 4 women will need treatment when it comes to depression, while men are 1 in 10. Both are troubling numbers, which is why there is many places and people that offers help and support. It’s not about gender, it’s about coming together, helping one another and becoming the best version of ourselves. But, that being said, why do more women experience depression more than men? This may be down to many things, such as the social factors (which I briefly explained above), poverty, isolation or even biological factors such as hormonal changes that are experience by women. Statistics have shown that women’s increased life expectancy means that they are more likely to outlive men and move into a residential care, which isn’t taken likely. Due to move into care, the risk of women experiencing depression grows. Estimated figures have shown that 20% of older women who live at home have depression, while 40% older women who live in care are living with depression, a rise of 20%. **Depression** is a big problem within women *AND* men. While expression depression, the temptation to self-harm increases. Within the UK, research has shown that between 1 in 12 women self-harm, while 1 in 15 young people self-harm. Also, **anxiety** is a problem within women. They are twice as likely to experience anxiety disorder than men with the stats backing that up. 60% of people with phobias or obsessive compulsive disorder are women. In the UK, phobias affect 22 in 1,000 women, compared to 13 in 1,000 men. Next on the list is dementia. Two-thirds of people who live with **dementia** are women, which is a worrying fact. As well all know, typically, the chances of getting dementia increase when you grow older, which is why women have a greater chance of having it. As I stated previous, women have a higher-life expectancy than men. Lastly, **eating disorders**. Eating disorders are more common in women, than men. Women have a 1.9% chance of developing one, compared to men at 0.2%. 

This post is *NOT* to compare women and men in any way, shape or form. It is to show others how hard times can be for women. Usually, we tend to have early warning signs when we think, feel or see differently. Down below, I will note down a few early warning signs to look out for. People experience different early stage symptoms, which are:

- Suicide thoughts
- High or low moods 
- Constant feeling of sadness or hopelessness 
- Misusing drugs, alcohol or both 
- Weight change
- Constantly on the edge, feeling of fear or worry
- Hearing or seeing things that are not there
- Socially withdrawing from people 
- Change in eating or sleeping habits 

If you’re currently experiencing any one of these symptoms, speak to someone. These NHS have provided a list of different Mental Health charities, such as: **Anxiety UK**, **CALM**, **Bipolar UK**, **Mind**, **No Panic**, **PAPYRUS**, **Samaritans**, **SANE** and many more. Remember, you’re not alone, far from it. There are hundreds and thousands of way to receive help and support out there, try your very best not to keep everything to yourself, let it all out as much as you can. 

If you feel like you need a little nudge to motivate you and get the help and support you need, my PM’s are open for a chat! We can talk about anything and whatever you want. We can talk about how your day has gone, your favourite things in life, your past or anything else. :)

As I said, if you have the opportunity to receive help, please take it, you will not regret it. Be brave, be strong, be fearless. You’ve got this. 

Thanks for reading! :)",10Nov2020,1

15m. Hi, so as the title says, i tried to kill myself again. I’m sorry. I have been feeling really sad and depressed for ages now especially this year. I tried to overdose. I passed out lots, threw up, i hoped i wouldn’t wake up. I tried it again last night. No one believes me at school. My friend heard me say it and now he told people and they are kinda making fun of me. 

I started crying in school at the end of the day during mock GCSE’s. I was crying when i got home and i’m crying alot now. I’m trying to stop. I can’t calm down. I want to try it again so people won’t make fun of me again and to make the people who told me to kill myself happier because they are better. 

I am a burden to everyone and everything. My mental illnesses have took over me. I had anti depressants until i tried to od on them and i tried lexapro for my bad anxiety which i still have and my ADHD meds. I’m sorry. I guess i need someone to talk to. Idk anymore. I’m really sorry. Fuck. I’m sorry.",10Nov2020,1
245,"Hey, I'm not diagnosed with anything but I hope posting here is still okay. There is this one thing I never told anyone, and I thought I had made my peace with never knowing what others would say or recommend, but here I am.
 I'm a female in my early twenties by the way. So basically about two years ago I was mentally in a weird headspace. I was really struggling at Uni, and not sure whether I chose the right subject, and also just struggling with organising myself in my studies, and under stress from just feelinglike a failure. (my uni is close to my hometown so I'm still living at home btw)
 In my second year I really tried to pull myself together, wake up earlier, lose some weight and meditate 20 min each morning so I would focus more. I'm not sure whether I was not in a good headspace before meditation or whether an unpleasant experience with weed just pushed me a bit over the edge. I think i had a panic attack smoking weed, just felt very detached and it scared me too death. I thought I had lost my mind. I felt weird the next two days, and managed to calm myself down since I knew it was depersonalization and that it was fueled by fear.
I kept on meditating and would generally feel more than before. More gratitude, more hope, more calmness, but also sometimes more detached and paranoid. A bit foggy and dreamlike. I started having horrible nightmares, and sometimes I would get hypnagogia. Hearing people talk just as I fell asleep, like radio chatter. Again I knew what it was and never thought they were real outside voices, so it didn't concern me much.
Every now and then especially after drinking coffee I would feel this sense of strong detachment and fear, or sometimes just an intense dejavu. It would be terrifying and I would quietly try to calm myself down and forget about it. trying not to fuel the fear of eventually losing my mind.
Theres been to incidents in retrospect that I would maybe  classify as psychotic. Once I sat down at Uni and had a coffe and suddenly realized my laptop was gone. I looked all over and contacted several lost and founds. When I got home it was there. It never even occured to me I left it there. I wrote it off to me being tired.
The other one a couple months later was quite intense. I think I had a coffee. I was on my way home from uni, and running to catch the subway that would take me to my next stop. I got into the subway  and there was a woman in a niqab. And it really hit me like a train. My heart was racing my body was in full panic mode and somehow there was this thoght in my head that I KNEW that a terrorist attack was going to happen. That god or fate or the universe had given me the chance to save myself.The whole ride was maybe 3 min but it felt like forever my thoughts were just racing. There was one stop between where I got in and where I needed to get to aI for whatever reason thought the bomb would go off. I basically debated in my head most doesn't make any sense to me now, but ended staying in the subway thinking there was a big chance I was going to lose my life. The alternative seemed just too scary. The bomb going off or not and the police asking how or what i knew, and me having nothing plausible to say.at that moment I thought they would lovk me away forever and that I'd be disconnected from reality forever.
So I stayed and the closer we got the more my head started calming down. I left drained exhausted and a little in shock I think. I remember sitting down in the next train and the distinctive feeling of not having any blood in my arms and legs.
Nothing like that ever happened again. The feeling of unreality came back a couple times when I was under stress, but lately basically never. Same with the nightmares.
I can't believe this text got so long, sorry about that, its just nice to finally just ""say"" it out loud.
I guess I just want to try and make sense of it, and know whether you can have that kind of paranoia during a regular panic attack, or whether I'm under risk to eventually develope psychosis and not telling anyone was a mistake.",10Nov2020,1
246,"Please hear me out on this. 

I was dating this girl in college. During the early days of our relationship, she confided to me that she has had problems with her mental health and suffered from severe depression. Honestly, at that time I was naive and did not know much about mental health illnesses and assured her I will be supportive. I did my best to learn about depression and used to encourage her to go to therapy which she did. I really did enjoy most the time I spent with her. However, there used to occasions where she would display completely erratic behaviors with wild mood swings. She usually attributed these incidents to her depression medication. These incidents did put me under a lot of stress because she would go from being completely normal one moment to discussion of suicide. I tried my best to help her with whatever support I could provide. One time I went out to pick up food for us and she ended up calling 911 before I got back, so I did deal with a lot of stress. 

During this time, she had several guy friends and I never really had a problem with that. She would stay up overnight at the library sometimes working on her assignments and I would never really suspect anything. But this one time, maybe two years into our relationship, I picked up her phone which was unlocked (probably the only time I ever saw it unlocked), I see a message from one of her guy friends. To my disappointment I find that the dude was more than her friend. I close the chat and see there were so many other threads which were eerily similar. She was sleeping with at least 3 other guys who I thought were just her friends. I was crushed. I don’t think I was so attached to anyone else in my life before and making that snap decision to end things was not easy. I immediately ended things - there was a lot of crying from her end, but I was extremely angry so I left without even collecting my things from her place. I went back to my apartment and texted her never to talk to me again and pretty much blocked her out of social media. 

A year or so goes by, and I hear she is with one of the guys she was cheating on me with. I was kind of over her then so it doesn’t bother me all that much but it stings a little. I also learn that she had been suffering from bipolar disorder. I had to look up what that entails. It was at this point that I realize she had known about what she’s been suffering from and had kept it from me. Not fully comprehending why she’d do that I moved on. 

Fast forward to yesterday, she creates a new account on one of the social media sites I use and messages me saying she recently was suffering due to mental health. She realized that she misses me and hopes I would talk to her because enough time I passed. I replied saying, I am sorry to hear about her struggles, and hoped she’d get better soon. She is not letting up however and is insisting on a video chat. She says she needs help and I’m the only person that could help her. 

On one hand I want to cut her off again- the months following the break up were not easy on me and it took loads of time and effort to get over and I don’t want to fall back into those patterns. On the other hand, I see people with bipolar disorder are more inclined to cheat(?). If that’s true and given enough time did pass is it ok she is seeking help and I talk to her?

What do I do here?

TL;DR - Bipolar girlfriend cheated on me few years ago. She is trying to get back in touch and seeking help. Should I talk to her and help her or should I block her?",10Nov2020,1

249,"I've been bullied most of my life and had extreme OCD and Anxiety diagnosed by my doctor and a therapist at 12.This led me to become very depressed over the years to the point where I went to bed and hoped and begged to just not wake up. 8 months ago I've finally worked up the courage to go to the doctor because I couldn't go on like this, I wanted to change. My OCD got so bad to the point where if I messed anything up(my rituals) I'd bite my arm where I ended up drawing blood, out in public when I was anxious id scratch my arm without noticing, again, drawing blood. Sometimes I'd feel like fainting. Anyways, the medication helped so much and even though my symptoms aren't fully gone they're so much better than before! I even have job interview tomorrow after struggling to find somewhere due to Covid (my stomach is still doing backflips as I'm very nervous) and I'm going to be getting an electric guitar soon! I love music, it helped me a lot over the years and now upgrading from acoustic to electric is awesome. So yesterday as I was going to sleep I cried, not because I was sad anymore it was because I was happy, after years of wanting go to sleep and not wake up I was scared I actually wouldn't this time, after all these years of wanting to just end it all, I was finally happy to be alive!",10Nov2020,1

251,"I heard that bullshit since I was young. Since I assumed I was an idiot and hated myself, I also thought the people who told me this were right.

So I pretty much put no effort into what makes me happy. I put no effort into understanding what brings me joy. I put no effort into developing myself. Happiness comes from inside - so I shouldn't put effort into external things like music, sex, friends, literature.

They were all wrong. My happiest moments weren't some bland inner peace, but were spent in the company of people or whenever I achieved something in a passion of mine. I don't know what the fuck 'inner happiness' is, but no matter how hard my clinical depression is - I did know moments of joy.

Fuck inner happiness. Let's party.",10Nov2020,1
252,"Hello everyone! I'm making this post as I was curious about the topic of personality disorders. There are a few questions and I'm hoping I can have at least one answered because my curious ass needs answers haha

So, here we go:

1. If someone has more than one personality disorder, and they're contradictory in some fields, how does it affect the person and the disorders themselves? Does a trait from only one show or is it a complete shitshow? Or does it depend solely on which disorders it's about specifically? 

2. How does it look like when there's a combination of for example AVPD, HPD and BPD? (I know, this is very specific)

3. The other thing that makes me curious, how does it look like when it's a combination of BPD and Bipolar disorder? These two do overlap in some fields, but at the same time they have slight differences in for example mood swings. I was wondering on how does a combination like this work, especially with BPD's daily mood swings and bipolar's longer episodes?

4. I was also wondering about the causes of personality disorders. Can you be born with it? Or does it develop in childhood or on some point in life? Or maybe both are possible? I don't know too much about this topic do I figured I'd ask about it too.

5. Which personality disorders overlap the most? Or which do you think overlap the most? And which do you think are the most different ones from each other?

253,"Whenever something bad/traumatic happens to me/my family, somehow I feel like I'm the best I've ever been, like everything is going well and the world just want to please me, but actually things are bad.
And it's not like I don't feel for these events, I do but for some reason I'm feeling better than usual.
For example: my uncle died last week leaving behind 4 kids(2 of them are autistic)+1 to come soon with a widow now on 8 or 9 month of pregnancy, my family got there to help them with everything cause the only one who can do something there is only 16 y/o and has to somehow take care of the whole house now.
So my family is there helping them with things and I'm home alone.
When they told me about all this I did even cry but now that I'm home and alone I'm really feeling so good, don't think I ever felt like that in my life.
It makes me think that maybe I'm weird.

255,"I've been following the symptom that I've named ""carbonation grimace"". It is an aversion to soda (an automatic grimace with every sip) that is popularly known to come with use of migraine medicine Topiramate.

But some people, like me, are just *born with it*. We can't drink soda. And I've come to suspect that means we have glutamate hypofunction, which is [linked to schizophrenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_hypothesis_of_schizophrenia). What's interesting is that I've tested a few confirmed schizophrenics, and it seems that they have a different spin on it.  **There may exist a simple test for schizophrenia in the ""invocation"" of carbonation grimace** via simple facial exercises.

The test is as follows:

1. Put your fingers on the tops of your cheekbones and find *that* muscle there.
2. Flex that muscle and everything above it in the face. Loosen everything below it.
3. You can now loosen *that* muscle too. Just hold everything else.
4. Sip a soda (or more precisely, use a straw to drop it into your mouth). If you experience a grimacing aversion to the drink such as you've never had before, **you have glutamate hypofunction** and may have schizophrenia.

So far, I've tested four paranoid schizophrenics and my own self, as well as myself with glutamate supplementation. And I'm 5-for-5 on the test (6-for-6 if I can count myself twice).

And as a last note: you'd be amazed how many symptoms of schizophrenia people will put up with without ever guessing they've got the disease.",10Nov2020,1

260,"Not sure if how I feel is depression or not. 
I'll try to keep this short but good luck, lol. 

Anyway: I'm 39F. Have a boyfriend for a year and 1/2 now (prior marriage ended).  Completely head over heels in love. He has a 7yo girl with his ex and I get along really really great with his daughter.  His co-parenting with his ex goes relatively well and aside from a few things here and there, his ex is ok to deal with.

We don't live together, yet.  We're making plans to next year after our leases both end, they end at relatively the same time which will work out really well.  I spend my weekends at my boyfriend's house.  So we spend from Sat afternoon (sometimes Fri evening) through Mon morning (sometimes Tues morning) together and then I drive home for the week.  I'm completely comfortable at his place, we have a lot of fun together whether we are doing something or sitting around doing nothing.  We are great together and I'm happy happy happy.  We are pretty much like a married couple already sans the marriage, but I'm pretty sure we will eventually get engaged and married and I'm super excited just thinking about how that's going to eventually happen. 

The issue is once I'm home for the week.  I work from home due to Covid since March now.  During the week I'm not social at all.  My boyfriend and I do talk every night when we're not together, but that's it.  With work we do have an online chat going amongst all the coworkers but I see the amount we all talk is dwindling.  A few times I've tried to engage with those I've been closest with and had a few long conversations but sometimes I don't get much response and these conversations are very seldom.  So I don't get that interaction with all my colleagues I used to have.  While I have work, it's a little slow.  So in between work I can't keep myself busy with household chores like dishes or laundry but there's a lot of other chores I can do, that I just don't.  I see them and I feel overwhelmed at the thought of doing them and getting them started, so I just don't.  Then, as soon as my shift is over, all I want to do is go to sleep. Like I feel like I just have nothing better to do, I have no motivation to do those chores I just talked about.  I used to sometimes go for a walk after work, but now with the time change and it's getting darker earlier, that's becoming less of an option.  Even though I know I have things I can and should be doing all I do is procrastinate and then sleep.  Funny enough when I'm with my boyfriend at his place, if I see chores need to be done I have no problem getting up and doing something for him or helping him with something but I can't seem to bring myself to do my own home chores.  

Also like a lot of people, I've been overeating during quarantine.  Luckily I haven't put any weight on really, but my eating habits have gone to crap.  The fact that I go to sleep once my shift is over, for me it's like, if I'm sleeping, at least I'm not eating and is how I justify going to bed at 5pm in the afternoon.  

Anyway I just feel like 2 completely different people.

261,"A little about myself,  I'm  a 30 year old male who has decided to go back to school and get out of crappy construction/general labour, I've  spent the past 3 semesters upgrading my high school marks, and have applied to a few programs to start next fall. I was a high school dropout twice, kicked out of my moms house when I was 15 and it was a downward spiral from  there, filled with drugs and alcohol. At the age of about 25, i quit drinking  and doing hard drugs  (i still  smoke pot but that's it) and also quit smoking cigarettes. As well, i have been  on a fitness journey for the past 3 years  which has been great.

Now, i must say, when i got kicked out of my house, my best friend took me in, i lived with him for a couple years and when we were about 20, he passed away from cancer. About 5 years ago, my father also passed away from a motorcycle accident on fathers day which I have always blamed myself because I never  phoned him, and I always pictured him getting  on his bike, drunk, because I didn't  see him on fathers day.

Its safe to say I'm ""headed"" in the right direction, and people always commend me for everything I've been doing for myself. (Years clean from cocaine  while surrounded by friends who still did coke and drank  all the time and i still  had self control). But I don't feel good. Almost  every day I want to end my life. I know my anxiety is super high these past few years, i hate meeting new people, my girlfriends upset i dont  meet her family (she understand though and is just trying to accomodate) and i have this ""all or nothing"" attitude. When I was looking at programs for school, I spent 2 years researching careers, ONLY thinking of the end goal. Bachelors, masters, so on, that I could never  make an actual decision.

School is so stressful, I'm upgrading my grade 12 classes and 3 at a time right now, all online. Allbeit, I'm sitting in the 90s for all my courses but I'm so scared to fail its ALL i do now. I've been sitting at 100% for physics,  and today I got 82% on my unit 2 exam. Honestly, I'm crushed. Yes, it was a simple mistake (i had the right answers but put them in the wrong boxes). But I don't  know why I'm hit so hard by this. My head is pounding right now  with a headache (i never get headaches) and i feel like crying.  So scared to start an actual program, even though  I'm top of my classes right now, in fear of failing. I want to quit just so I don't  have to stress anymore. 
My heads in a pretty dark place, where its been for years, and my girlfriend tells me I should go speak to someone about it, but honestly, I've never  spoken to any one about it and my stress  over school makes me fear that, time spent talking to a professional, is time spent not studying. Not to mention I'm broke so I dont  know where to even get proper help for free.

I apologize if I'm rambling, I've  never really reached out before, and i don't want to kick the bucket, just yet. So ill test this out atleast. I dont know if this is a vent, a ramble on, a cry for help, who knows, but here i am.",10Nov2020,1
262,"So as the title said, today someone hugged me. I didn't expect it, and its fair to say it shook me up. I've got a pretty nasty past experience list when it comes to being close to other people in any way and have been dealing with anxiety and OCD relating to these past experiences for over 18 months at this point.

Initially it felt good and it was nice to get some actual human contact for once given the utter state of the world at the minute. But throughout the day it's just felt worse and worse. First it was the fact that someone (who I value more than most) had actually just shown me any kind of affection. That felt great. Then I realised that as far as everything is at the moment, that's considered a crime. A crime to actually feel appreciated for once and have clear proof of it. Then it started to drag up some repressed memories of my Ex from close to 2 years ago, when we'd just cuddled up on the sofa and played mario cart for hours whilst my entire family sat there and judged us. Obviously remembering things like that hurts, but I'd repressed it to the point of thinking that today was the first time anyone outside of my family has ever shown me affection like that.

Since that long list of realisations I seem to have gone I to panic mode and very nearly self sabotage multiple friendships out of fear of being close to them, I can't seem to forget said repressed memories and my anxiety has gone through the roof. All of that from a simple, innocent hug.",10Nov2020,1

264,"In my past Ive struggled with OCD/anxiety leading to hardcore dp/dr  and I think my mind is deteriorating. It now for whatever reason feels so uncomfortable just simply existing and everything around me suddenly feels/looks weird to me. Human beings look so strange to me and its now blowing my mind how we use language to communicate. My ability to properly speak and hold onto a conversation is almost destroyed because something in my brain isn't where it needs to be. The difference between how I was before this happened was that what used to fascinate me now scares the living hell out of me. I'm questioning my existence almost constantly now

267,"TW: Suicidal thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

I have had bad mental health since I was a young teen (maybe younger) and now I am 20 years of age and have almost finished my third year of university. 

I have always avoided thinking of the future because I never really planned on living that long and even now that my day-to-day existence is feeling suicidal but knowing I will not actually kill myself I never really planned past university.  I only went to university because I have always been pretty naturally academic and my family just kinda expected it of me so I went. 

Now I need to think of my future. I need to figure out what job I want hopefully in my field of study or another job. I have no idea what I want to do but all I know is that the idea of doing a non-creative, office type job for the rest of my life makes me want to kill myself again. I do not think I could go on living a life of having a non-creative job. My sisters both work in these types of jobs and I just do not think I could keep on living if I had these jobs. 

But creative jobs are often luck-based and I have no experience in these areas. I love to write, but I'm not that good at it and can never finish a story. I love to draw, but my art is not great and I have never taken an art class in my life. I am working on animation projects, but I am very much a novice. I love to sew and do cosplay but that is not a viable career where I am from. I love gaming and watching streamers, but I would have to be so incredibly lucky to even make a livable wage doing that. 

I don't know what to do. I need to figure out what I want to do with my life sooner rather than later; I have only around 6 months of university left. My family and university lecturers keep asking what I want to do with my life but I don't know. And not knowing means I will have a job like my sisters have and I could not keep on living like that. 

I just would appreciate any help or advice or anything.",10Nov2020,1

269,"So for the past few years i have done everything in an evenly way

Examples:
Walk evenly: if one side of my foot hits the floor but the other doesn’t i have to make the other side hit the floor by itself 

Eat evenly: I can’t eat 1, 3 or 5 bits of cereal at once i have to eat 2, 4 or 6 

Say things evenly in my head: say something? Oh i say it again on my head so i say it twice or four times 

Blink evenly, breath evenly, do a certain movement twice, accidentally hurt myself? Oh hurt myself on the same spot again

You get the point now hopefully and i just want to know why i do this and if you have any ideas then please let me know",10Nov2020,1
270,"Hey guys! I have heard the term trauma bonding a couple times &amp; have always seen it used in reference with an abusive relationship. However, I’m wondering if trauma bonding can also occur from going through a traumatic experience with someone as well? Or is it strictly from abuse/traumatic relationship?

I was discussing how one of my now good friends &amp; I went through a very stressful, emotionally/mentally traumatic pregnancy scare (we were FWB at the time but are good close platonic friends now) but I was talking about how I am recognizing I have really strong feelings for him after we experienced all of that together. Someone stated how it might not be genuine feelings but instead trauma bonding?
I was wondering if someone could explain exactly what trauma bonding is &amp; if not genuine feelings what I could be feeling?

If one night i have the urge to do it but i don't then the next day it comes back stronger than the

I’m speaking with a medical professional tomorrow, i’m just trying to get my thoughts in line. 

I have periods of time where my anxiety kicks into overdrive, I get really upset and very long story short,  my mind will convince myself that no one loves me, i’m a burden and the only logical thing to do is kill myself. I know this isn’t true when i’m not in that state of mind. But when i’m in that state of mind, its very true and theres nothing that can be said or done to convince me otherwise. The real kicker is that I then proceed to get really upset because I can’t bring myself to do whatever extreme thing (usually kill myself, but sometimes cut the tattoo thats says “enough” off my arm) my brain has decided is the logical answer. This usually last for a few hours before I make myself fall asleep.

I constantly feel alone and like nobody understands me or wants to listen to me, even my friends. I usually prefer to be alone, but being alone has started to really bother me lately. As much as I hate to admit it, and at risk of sounding self centered, I feel starved for attention and affection. My family never asks me how I’m doing or really even talks to me beyond small talk. I feel horribly isolated. I just want someone I can talk to in real life, who will actually care about me. I can’t imagine anyone loving me or caring about me or even finding me attractive. I feel ugly and gross at worst, and painfully average at my best. It hurts me so badly to think that maybe nobody will ever truly love me and care about me. I don’t know how to deal with these feelings. I have begun to harm myself recently and paradoxically I worry that scars will only add to my unloveability.
