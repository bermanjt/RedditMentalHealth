1,"So I am currently in a rather deep depression, which makes me often overthink things that happened in my life.

But sometimes, when certain memories come up or even when my head is completly empty, I get that uncomfortable stomach feeling. I can't really describe that feeling, but it makes me anxious and it makes me feel like there's something I have to regret and be ashamed of, even tho my head and mind is completly empty. That feeling makes me unable to sleep and it never has gone on for that long.
It started yesterday night when I had a mental breakdown and it appeared throughout the day. I can't describe this feeling and I can't find anything about it. It's not a stkmach ache, it's not cramps, it's just an extremly uncomfortanle feeling. I also know a few people who have that aswell and we all have no idea what this means.",28Apr2020,1

I currently have 11 plants growing currently. 
‚Ä¢7 succlents
‚Ä¢ Cheyenne pepper
‚Ä¢ Tabasco pepper (I think)
‚Ä¢ Strawberry bush
‚Ä¢ White onions

These have helped me keep my mental health up during these times. I‚Äôm often sick but I can manage to make it outside to water before needing to sit down again. At the end up year all these plants will have grown strong because of me. Some will be used to propagate new plants, some will reap food for me. All of my own doing. I‚Äôm happy with myself seeing the process of growth.",28Apr2020,3
3,"So I (23, F) have been diagnosed with the good old borderline personality disorder for 7 years. It‚Äôs been fucking rough. I‚Äôve been in and out of psych wards 58 times in the last 9 years. The last 16 months however I calmed down quite a bit and my BPD seemed to stabilise quite significantly. I‚Äôd previously gotten stuck in kind of a revolving door before and would lose my shit, get admitted to the ward, not have to deal with my problems so feel better and then get discharged and feel like shit again and the pattern continued. Anyway. For the last 18 months I‚Äôve only had one admission. But 6 months ago I was suddenly diagnosed with a rare brain condition (idiopathic intracranial hypertension, 1:100,000). I didn‚Äôt have any indication I had this illness but it‚Äôs turned my life upside down. I had brain surgery 4 months ago and I‚Äôm potentially looking at having a second one within the upcoming months. As a result I lost my drivers license and am realistically probably going to lose my job soon with the second surgery, I had to drop out of university and lost my degree, I‚Äôve lost my friends and there‚Äôs no one that I know that can relate to what I‚Äôm going through. And it‚Äôs really really taken a toll mentally. After being inpatient free for a year and a half I had another hospitalisation. And last night I tried to kill myself for the first time in 2 years. The problem is no one understands how much this has affected my mentality. I don‚Äôt even feel like it‚Äôs my BPD atm I just feel genuinely miserable and depressed. But everyone just brushes it off when I try to tell them I‚Äôm not coping with ‚Äúyeah but you‚Äôve done so well in the last 18 months‚Äù ‚Äúlook where you were before vs. now‚Äù or will tell me how well I‚Äôm doing which makes me feel guilty and like I can‚Äôt talk about it because I‚Äôm being manipulative then. And when I try to tell my psychiatrist I‚Äôm suicidal his response is just ‚Äúyeah but you said you wouldn‚Äôt kill yourself because of your parents‚Äù. That last comment was true 2 years ago and I meant it then but my headspace is so low I don‚Äôt even know if that‚Äôs still true. I feel like a burden to my family, to my friends, to everyone I know and I feel like they would be better off without me than having to put up with my shit for the rest of their life, and mine. It feels so hopeless that my life will ever change. Everyone told me once I got my bpd under control my life would come together and I was dumb and believed them and it improved for a month or two but then this shit happened and I feel like it‚Äôs the universe telling me I aren‚Äôt meant to be here. I don‚Äôt even know how to talk to my psychiatrist or psychologist about it because I‚Äôm aware they both think it‚Äôs just my bpd fluctuations and that I will be feeling different within 24 hrs. I feel like there‚Äôs a light at the tunnel but unfortunately that light is a train. I dunno. I just feel so lost. As a kid I had this idea of how my life would be, and then my bpd ruined it. Then my bpd settled and I started to get hopes and dreams only for my brain illness to again ruin it. I‚Äôve been told outright that I will never have a normal life, I will probably go blind, and I have two stenosis at the back of my head they think will cause a stroke within the next 10 years and I may turn into a vegetable and that will be that. I‚Äôm not eligible to get stents because of my self harm and the need for blood thinners post op.
What do I do? How do I get help when everyone just tells me it‚Äôs my BPD and I will be fine? I don‚Äôt feel fine, I feel like I‚Äôm already dead but for some reason I still have a heart beat. They won‚Äôt admit me to the psych ward because my management plan says hospital is unproductive which to a degree I agree with. But I‚Äôm basically still a kid. Life shouldn‚Äôt feel this surely? I don‚Äôt want to get out of bed, I don‚Äôt want to go to work, I don‚Äôt want to even talk to anyone. I don‚Äôt know where to go from here.",28Apr2020,1

5,"(this is a copy paste of a post I did in r/abuse)
I just wanted to get this off my chest, i haven't talked about this with many people, just the 5 therapists that I visited since I was 6 years old. I was a happy child until six, when my father, after a travel to the US, suddenly changed and stared to abuse me verbally and physically, always when I had homework, he made me do it with him, and if I got wrong one answered he beated me pretty bad, this made me very anxious when I had homework because I knew that I will get beat up. Anxiety made it worst, one day he beated me until I got unconscious because of a wrong answer, I was very nervous and I didn't think well. This made me very depressed, and kids at school started to notice that and began to bully me, I changed school and still the heavy bullying was there and I was sexually abused by classmates, something that made me have a kind of PTSD, imagine living hell in school and at home my parents didn't believed me when I said that I had been though a lot in that school, I always told my mother to change me to other school, she didn't listen until one of my sisters got bullied too and my father saw the whole thing... I got a very hard depression when my grandma died, I was 12, she was like my mother to me, because she was the only person of my family that didn't treated me like shit. That same year I attempted suicide, my parents stopped me and they sent me to a psychiatrist, and a psychologist. My parents constantly blamed me in front of the therapists because I didn't speak to them, because I was lazy and exaggerated. Both my parents are very narcissistic, when the therapists told them, that their attitude with me might be part of the problem, they just looked for another therapist that told them what they wanted to hear... They never found that therapist. I remember that my father beated me because I was depressed, one of the things he said to me was ""be happy or I will beat the shit out of you more"" I'm not joking. I hate my father since then, he has been always a piece of shit with me, he has a construction company, I had to work with him since I was ten, he is very narcissistic and I'm thinking that maybe he is a sociopath. I attempted suicide seven times in my childhood, the psychiatrist told me that I might have maniac depressive disorder, and began to treat me with pills, my mother (that is very abusive too, but at least has empathy, a big difference with my father) she didn't want me to have medication for whatever reason, until I began to have terrible anxiety attacks and other suicide attempts and I started with medication, that made me very numb. When I was 15 I changed school, and they treated me nice, but I was very out of touch with reality. I began to be happy there, have friends and even a girlfriend. But abuse at home wasn't over, my father beated me until I was 17, because of grades, I have never been a great student. Father and my mother now abuse me verbally, and very constantly. But I was very lucky that I found a good psychologist that helped me a lot, I managed to stop using medication last year (I'm 23) and I felt that my depression was something past. But nothing is perfect, I study psychology ironically, just because I wanted to understand myself a bit more... My motivation in the career stared to go down, I realized that I'm a patient, not a therapist. This made me depressed again, my future is uncertain, I have no motivation for anything, and coronavirus just made it way worse, now I have to deal with my parents constant verbal abuse everyday, I can't have therapy... I only rely on my girlfriend, who is sick with this fucking virus, fortunately, she doesn't have bad symptoms. I am thinking of suicide again constantly, and even thinking about doing terrible things to my father, I really hate the guy and with his abuse it's making it worst... I'm scared if I snap someday, I hope not... I live in a third world country, mental health is taboo, and the virus is hitting very, very hard so quarantine could be all year for us... I don't know anything about my future. 
I just hope things change, I just want a peaceful live and get out of this family, I want peace, just a bit...

6,"For about the past 2 or so years my (m21) mental health has begun to worsen, and now we're having to stay indoors for a prolonged period of time I feel it's becoming a real problem in my life and is being noticed by my housemates (one of whom is my girlfriend (f20)).

Its important to note I'm also a third year university student and am currently working towards finally finishing my degree. the prospect of actually finishing university life I find terrifying, not to mention the added stress of finishing my final assignments ontop of the current world situation.

I've generally struggled a lot with a lack of self confidence since I can remember really. Everyone would describe me as an extrovert but when it comes down to it I'm really not that confident and have a lot of self doubt as to who I am, what I make and what I do. I feel like everything I do gets judged upon to the point of feeling like no matter what I do my friends think I'm a joke.

Because of this, whenever people make jokes about me / have banter with me I can take it way too personally only driving my confidence further down. I also tend to overreact because of this, becoming upset and angry and often storming off or shutting down and becoming quiet. I've always been the ""scapegoat"" of sorts for most of my friendship groups, usually getting the bulk of the stick most likely due to my angry outbursts and my easy to wind up nature, but recently I've become increasingly unable to cope with my emotional responses, getting more upset and more angry the more this lockdown goes on for.

Change has always rattled me, however I feel this change has really taken a toll on my mental health. my girlfriend luckily is mega supportive and understands a lot of my problems, however after an argument we had today I feel less confident in talking to her about my feelings.

TLDR; Need coping mechanisms to combat stress, low self esteem and anger.",28Apr2020,1

8,"My mental health the last couple of months have gone from really bad to Really Fucking Bad and it hurts to continue like this.

Due to a shitty childhood and losing my father, I've self-harmed and had suicidal thoughts since I was 10, if not younger. 
And I was supposed to die at 13 but I was found before I could do anything and to this day I still think that was my golden chance to end it all without doing to much damage to other people.

Now I'm stuck here with severe depression, extremely bad social anxiety, probably PTSD, OCD, paranoia, eating disorders, insomnia and probably a 100 other problems that are eating me up from the inside.
I've tried medications, exercise, CBT therapy and it hasn't done shit and now there's not even any help to get anymore because of covid19 so there's literally nothing I can do. 
And i just want it to fucking stop, i dont want to be here i want to be at peace.

What's the meaning for staying here when I'll probably die from covid19 if I don't kill myself first, like there's no fucking point

9,"So I need to rant and this seems like a good place to do that.

I've had depression pretty much ever since I hit puberty, and I'm 21 now so that's 8-9 years. I grew up religious and outcasted in my schools (primary school and high school in the UK). I've always had that sense of being different, because it was drilled into me from the moment I was born that everyone around me in school and the real world was a sinner and I shouldn't associate with anyone, unless they were religious too. (Long sentence, sorry.)

I left the religion fully when I was 16, but still had a disjointed view on the world. I was paranoid, and felt like I had no place in the real world, but going back to the religion wasn't an option. After years of studying and trying to prove God's existence ended up in me proving that he didn't exist, and I lost my faith because of that.

I feel like having that pressure on me as a child, believing that I will literally die by hellfire if I leave the religion, and that the same would happen to my few friends in school, really boosted my spiral into depression. It's a horrible feeling, looking around you and imagining your friends and peers dying, and unfortunately the religion I was in is a very doomsday-oriented religion. It was repeated in every meeting and study session that we were the only ones who would live through armageddon.

When i was 17, i started therapy. That lasted about 12 weeks before they decided that i was too much for my therapist to handle and that they had to pass me onto someone more qualified. That would take about 18 months. I remember when I got the call saying that i could finally start seeing a therapist and I told them I was feeling better and that I didnt need help anymore, which was true for the time. I was on medication for anxiety and depression, and I've been on and off meds since then. Well, I've really hated meds since I found out that my doctor was giving me the dose for anorexia, and not for depression. The meds he gave me weren't working, so instead of changing them, I kept going back, and he kept increasing the dosage until I maxed that out and it still didn't work. I've had a bad relationship with meds since then, and I've taken myself off them several times which I shouldn't have.

I've since moved out of my family home, and I'm still welcomed back there, but the conversations always end up leaning towards the religious side of things. It always turns into an argument, so I try not to stay there longer than a few hours. I live with my boyfriend now.

But I've noticed that I'm still depressed. I'm out of that house and away from religion and everything that sent me to that downward spiral. I dont feel like I can talk to my boyfriend about it because he never actually offers solutions, and instead tries to reassure me that everything will be alright. In itself, it isnt that bad, but i need someone to help walk me through those bad times and point me in the right direction instead of just a passive ""you'll be alright"" if that makes sense.

This is a big ramble. I'm trying to include info that would help.

Basically, I feel like I haven't been through enough trauma in my life to be this depressed. I'm fully aware that other people have it worse than me and that just fuels this voice in my brain that's saying I dont even deserve to be depressed. Im writing this whilst sitting next to my boyfriend, and I dont feel like I can talk to him about any of this. He knows about my depression but I've never gone in depth about where it stems from and how it really effects me. I still feel disconnected from the world and the people around me.

I know we're all depressed in quarantine so this may come across as another whiny post. Sorry about that. Just a rant. Any advice is greatly accepted. TIA.",28Apr2020,1
10,"I'm nineteen and I'm alone i have no family or friends nearby that i could talk to, or just any to talk to anyway.

I'm feeling extremely suicidal but also cannot stop thinking about killing other people. It's 2:30am for me so I can't make a doctor's appointment and I can't go to a&amp;e because of Corona - and I can't call a suicide hotline because I'm extremely paranoid that everyone hates me and talks about about me behind my back so if I do I feel like they won't take me seriously, no matter how much they say they will.

None of my normal coping mechanisms are working.

I've gone to a&amp;e previously (before Corona) for mental health crises, and they just tell me about the same things that I can't do plus I have to wait for hours to even be seen normally so I can't imagine what it would be like now.

12,"So idk what's going on right in my head right now. I'm 22, i've been dealing with anxiety and OCD for about 5 years no (really my whole life, but it didn't become a chronic thing until 5 years ago). Like the dumb, naiive person I am, I have left it untreated, convincing myself that a regular meditation/exercise practice (which I haven't even done anywhere close to consistently) would be able to cure me. There is a bottle of Lexapro 2 feet from me right now that I have yet to touch; due to my own stupidity and carelessness. But i'm not really here to beat myself up, I just want somebody's input, maybe advice, idk. 

These past few weeks I have really been struggling and i'm not sure why. I think it was because I smoked weed about a month ago. It wasn't the first time I smoked, but I smoked with my friend (probably too much lol), and I started feeling really paranoid -- leading to my first panic attack in years. Since then i've just been feeling...off. I've had some mild intrusive thoughts, and last night I had another panic attack while I was feeling paranoid, alone in bed at 3am. I ran to my parents' room (luckily I am living at home due to the virus), and talked to them, and it went away, but today I am feeling even more paranoid, like I am on edge and close to another panic attack at any moment.

I'm not having delusions (I think), i'm not hearing voices, but I feel like im in a haze, somewhat disconnected from reality, and I am still paranoid. Part of me hopes this is just my OCD making me obsessive over the \*idea\* of myself developing a deeper mental illness -- psychosis, schizophrenia, etc. But at the same time I really just don't feel ok. I'm worried that i'll have a psychotic breakdown at any second and my life will just spiral down. I've been at a somewhat functioning level for years, though untreated, and I'm not realizing I may have neglected my mental health for far too long. I'm worried it's too late to really save myself from something worse. 

And this is all further compounded by the coronavirus -- I live with my two older parents, and I don't feel comfortable going to see a doctor right now (though OF COURSE i will if i have to). I have half a mind to just take a pill of lexapro right now, but i'm worried about how that would go over if I really did have a worse illness coming on than just anxiety.

So someone, anyone, please give any input you can. I'm not sure how I will make it through tonight without a panic attack or something worse. Sorry if this is so long, I just feel so lost and worried right now. 

Thank you.",28Apr2020,1

I know I'm a Sociopath, like textbook tendencies except I'm not nearly as ""ambitious"" or ""entitled"", I'm more of a Nihilist in that way. There is alot else wrong with me, but my overall personality is that of a sociopath, probably bordering psychopathy. 

However! I don't kill animals or deep down want to cause harm, &amp; there are MANY successful sociopaths. I've felt lost &amp; distraught since about 15 &amp; maybe it's because I wasn't using my ""skills"" in a productive way?

I have 2 options: Embrace my sociopathy &amp; use it to become a writer or otherwise, OR Continue to fight against those tendencies along with my PTSD from being in a fire, and fight to be a ""normal"" person.

16,"my boyfriend (18) lives alone and we have been self-isolating in separate houses (in the UK) but he has quite bad mental health issues and his lows can be unpredictable, he describes it as him moving to the back of his mind and helplessly watching the self-destructive things this impulsive thing that takes over him does. in this past month he‚Äôs attempted suicide three times (i had to call an ambulance on him the first time after he OD‚Äôd) and been in and out of hospital (after escaping the emergency room) as well as spending time on a mental health ward until he was discharged a few days later. during that time, he was heavily abusing unprescribed benzodiazepines and opiates to the point where I didn‚Äôt even recognise him, he was saying and doing things out of character (including saying very hurtful things which he has since apologised for) despite insisting they were helping his anxiety.

he has the worst insomnia and can often go several days without sleeping, so the nurses gave him antihistamine sedatives which helped both his insomnia and anxiety, but have since taken him off them to ‚Äúsee what happens‚Äù. inevitably, his anxiety and insomnia came back so he felt as if he had to resort to self-medicating again with a cocktail of drugs similar to the benzos and opiates he was abusing before, including xanax, morphine, codeine, diazepam etc. he insists he‚Äôs in a better headspace and will be more careful but after facetiming him i noticed he could barely speak. i hung up in tears hoping he just passed out from exhaustion and not something more sinister.

it sounds selfish but this constant trauma of living with the constant anxiety that he‚Äôs no longer alive is really taking its toll. i know i am his girlfriend and i really would do anything and everything for him, and have done for the past month ‚Äì there are no boundaries. but being in such a relentless state of dread, helplessness and anxiety is making me truly ill. i haven‚Äôt been looking after myself and been neglecting my studies, and can‚Äôt sleep without horrible dreams of him self-harming or killing himself. i just don‚Äôt know what to do, but refuse to give up on him, even if it means at my emotional, physical and psychological expense but i am also torn by the fact that he is not my responsibility and that i can only help so much.",28Apr2020,1

22,"I can‚Äôt fucking stand Dr. Phil. Not only does the show not help anyone at all, but you can argue that it ruins the lives of people that get on the show, and ignores mental issues and problems that guests have.
Other than the many cases of abuse of guests and workers on the show, ignoring the fact the show basically made people like Danielle Bregoli famous, (though it isn‚Äôt necessarily the fault of the show and more of the fault of a shitty meme and whatnot, but you can still argue that if she hadn‚Äôt been on the show, she wouldn‚Äôt have gotten so famous) and the fact that Dr. Phil is a con artist that leeches off of mental illness and family issues to get famous and to get money, and the fact that he‚Äôs not even a licensed doctor giving medical advice, and is an idiot (just his comments on the coronavirus proves that), but you can also argue that the concept of the show does more harm than good, and doesn‚Äôt help anyone.
Just looking at Danielle, if she wasn‚Äôt on the show, she wouldn‚Äôt have ever gotten famous. It‚Äôs very obvious that she loved the exposure and the fame that the show gave her, and it just made everything worse. Her family life was shit, and the show didn‚Äôt even do anything about that. She was still let go to her family, despite her home life being the most obvious and glaring problem that caused her to be the way she is.
Anyways, going away from Bhad Bhabie, the show doesn‚Äôt help kids in general. It‚Äôs obvious Dr. Phil doesn‚Äôt care about mental illness or how someone could be affected by being shoved into a spotlight like the show could give. He just wants money and fame. The show doesn‚Äôt help those with mental illness at all. While there were a few cases of the show legitimately working, it isn‚Äôt true for all the cases.
Just posts like this; https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/20oge2/redditors_that_appeared_on_dr_phil_what_do_you/ gives a lot of context into just how corrupt the show is.
The people on the show, often times troubled teenagers, are people who struggle with mental illness, trauma, or a shitty home life. Shoving them onto TV where they can be watched by millions around the world doesn‚Äôt help people. Unless it‚Äôs one of the rare cases where it‚Äôs a delinquent kid with parents that actually care about the kid, in which case, it can work, but most of the time that isn‚Äôt the case. Although you can argue, well, it‚Äôs the person‚Äôs choice to be on the show, well no, most of the guests on the show are usually children and teenagers, who legally can‚Äôt do a thing about it, since it‚Äôs up to the parents decision to force them on the show.
There was an episode, titled ‚ÄúProfessional Transporter Helps Family Bring Daughter to Dr. Phil‚Äù. In the episode, the daughter is taken from her home by complete strangers that work on the show, and was forced to go on the show. In the episode, she was protesting and lashing out at her parents and refused to be taken away, and had to be carried out. The worst part was that the parents recorded the whole incident for all to see. So not only is this a huge invasion of rights and privacy, but they basically kidnapped her. I don‚Äôt know why this didn‚Äôt cause any huge controversy or wasn‚Äôt investigated or anything. The episode was very hard to watch. Not only was she yelling at her parents but she was being manhandled and obviously didn‚Äôt want to be on the show, because obviously she didn‚Äôt want to be publicly humiliated by millions of people. The episode is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIWGfmnNMSQ&amp;t=62s
There was also an episode that basically broke the last straw for me. It was an episode, a very basic episode for Dr. Phil, that being a teenager going crazy and the parents are sad about it and whatnot. A 15-year old girl continuously lashed out at her parents in many ways, like hanging out with the wrong people, stealing cars and shoplifting, etc. Typical Dr. Phil shit.
Eventually, the kid brought a pregnancy test to her parents. The thing was, this was after the parents discovered she had condoms in her room and took them away, so no shit she got pregnant, or so we thought.
It was very clear that the parents were giving off major red flags. It was very obvious that they were just making things work. It all just adds up. The parents are clearly the problem. Especially the mom. The mom is clearly a dumbass, especially one comment she made about how ‚ÄúGod told me to bring my daughter to Dr. Phil‚Äù like no the fuck he didn‚Äôt. You just wanted to humiliate your own child. She was also taken to a hospital and was forced to take another pregnancy test to confirm whether it‚Äôs true or not. The fucked up part of that being, was that she was crying and refusing to take the test. It was obvious that she really wasn‚Äôt pregnant and was just lashing out at her parents.
The even more fucked up part was that the nurse in the video wouldn‚Äôt let her leave and had that annoying, strict mom attitude, and not only that, but they locked her into a room until she finished and kept shoving the camera in her face as she was crying and begging to be left alone and protesting to not take it. Again, it was very obvious she wasn‚Äôt pregnant, and as it turns out, she wasn‚Äôt. The part that really broke it for me were the comments on the videos. They were basically filled with boomers and Karens, basic fans of the show, and with comments you would expect from them like ‚Äúshe needs a good spanking is what she needs‚Äù or ‚Äúif she was born in a black or hispanic family she would be disciplined quickly‚Äù (that discipline being having her ass beaten and typical boomer comments like that). And the comment section for the videos were all filled with people laughing and sharing hate for the kid.
It is very clear that the girl has huge mental issues, possibly depression or something along those lines, and is lashing out for reasons we possibly don‚Äôt even know. There‚Äôs probably something the kid doesn‚Äôt tell us. And yet people are quick to judge and harass and condone abuse to this girl who probably isn‚Äôt at fault. Now, I don‚Äôt know the family. Who knows? Maybe the kid legitimately is just a brat, but that still doesn‚Äôt condone the invasion of rights or privacy.
In one episode she was put in a room with her parents and Dr. Phil, and it was very clear she didn‚Äôt want to be there. Not just the crying but the way she carried herself as well. She obviously didn‚Äôt want to be watched by millions of people. Just the way she was scrunched up in the hoodie made it extra hard to watch.
Here are the videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D304_IDsp5Q https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeWlsAiLsJ4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltI4qF_9Uxs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dURIh5WuwBk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_OCH41CWag

23,"# Value pleasure again and learn to read the signs! Dont let artifcial pleasure ruin you!

 

One of the Key lectures to get better is to distinguish between pleasure and happiness.

Pleasure is a Drug. A Drug popularized by commercial driven companies, organisations and yourself. It is waiting for you in every part of your life. Advertisement, music, food, movies, pornography.

Happyness is created by a wholesome longterm relationships. Through human interaction, through finding people you can connect with. Happyness is wholesome, fullfilling and deep to your heart.

Pleasure gives you a temporary feeling. Something that needs to be renewed and something that you can always achieve through several ways. Sometimes even without external input. And that makes it addicting and interesting for commerce. But Pleasure is closer to pain than it is to wellbeing. Philosophers even called pleasure an antidote to pain, a bridge over the temporary feeling until you can feel well again. Now that theory puts pleasure between wellbeing and pain but it would not be necessary without the pain. And the pain usually should come from you doing something. Why would you do something? Because you want to achieve something!

Pleasure should be a tool, a tool to tell your body that you did something right. Technically speaking the pleasure that comes from sex is the validation that you fullfilled your goal of reproduction which technically speaking is the highest achievable goal when you look at it us as species trying to stay alive.

And the addicting character of pleaure is important because it makes you drive towards the things that pleasure you which naturally would be part of your journey towards discovering happyness, discovering fullfillment.

But with modern technology modern scociety and all the offerings that you dont have to work for anymore. Pleasure through eating? Maybe still a thing in from starvation suffering countries! Pleasure through sexual activities? Free pornography has your back! Pleasure through victory? Videogames are there for you!

And I am by far not saying that you should stop doing all these things but you are here to better yourself! And listen carefully into yourself. When was the last time you experienced pleasure through the natural way towards happyness? When was the last time you felt good not because of the pleasure of internet pornography but through the happyness that comes when you kiss and hug your partner afterwards?

People are so ruined these days and search for pleasure through destructive ways. Drugs, Rape, disgusting taboo kinks in internet forums, sexting. Because they have exhausted their potential for natural pleasure. Read the signs and act when you feel like the pleasure you are feeling is artificial.

Act immediatly and make it your goal to feel real pleasure again.

24,"I think the main reason I can't get over it is because I live in the same house as him. I actually just got a case worker to help me find housing, but I'm not sure how long that will take.

&amp;nbsp;

My dad has been abusive my whole life. For some reason my mom won't leave him. I think he's a sociopath. I blame him for my mental issues, because I believe they were set off by my childhood trauma that he caused.

&amp;nbsp;

Every time I see him rage boils within me. I fantasize about punching him in the face or keying his beloved car. I actively wish for his death. I realize that probably sounds horrible. I can't stand to even be in the same room as him. I ignore and avoid him. I haven't said a word to him in months, since his last blow up (where he said he was going to put a gun to my head and blow my brains out.) He takes up so much space in my head. I just want him gone. How do I stop hating him? I obviously don't mean I'll start liking him or anything like that, I just want to be indifferent. When I move out I intend to block him from my life for the rest of mine. But what do I do until then?",28Apr2020,1
25,"My ex girlfriend and I were together for over four months, and, up until last week things had been okay, tense but okay. We got into  an argument and ended up not talking for a a week. Over that period, I sought after advice on whether or not I should continue the relationship or not. In all honesty, I didn't want to continue the relationship because I knew it was getting toxic, and I knew that my ex is stubborn and, if it were to have continued, it would not have been the same. Last night, we talked about it and came to the decision to end things. It was mutual and mature, so I can't complain. However, after only one day since the break up, I'm freaking out. My mind is telling me that I failed as a boyfriend, that the relationship probably meant nothing to her and it would only be a matter of time before she forgets about me completely.  I feel plagued by these negative thoughts and these ""what if we had stuck together? Think of all the things we wanted to do, but never got the chance."" Typical breakup stuff, I guess.

For context, we started dating in December and red flags really started showing up only weeks later. She would isolate herself from any inconvenience and would only flock to her friend. I would ask her what was wrong and she would only ever answer with ""I'm fine."" Anytime I tried to talk to her she would get upset and think I was ""prying into \[her\] personal life."" There was little to no trust, and I felt alone at least 85% of the time. I put up with it because I didn't want to be alone, but I know that it was not worth wasting more of my life over with this. But now I am alone and I can feel myself starting to slip.

Part of me is still trying to come to grips with everything that happened, but the other part of me wants desperatly to fill that void again. I know that seeking after any type of relationship right now will only result in more heartbreak as I'll just be trying to get someone to replace my ex, but I've always struggled with the feeling that I don't exist unless I have someone to tell me otherwise. I know it's just my feelings and the reality, but I need someone right now. Not a friend, not a family member, or anything like that. I need a hand to hold. I need someone to hold me close to them and tell me that ""everything is going to be okay."" I need someone to keep me grounded and  knowing that I can't have that makes me feel like I'm dying. 

I'm planning on meeting with my counselor next Friday so I'll be able to get professional help, but I am stuck right now in a feeling that I'm a lonely, devoid of life, failure. And I need any help I can get. Does anyone have any advice?",28Apr2020,1
26,"I'm going to start from the beginning, which is around 3 years ago. After school, I would always be tired, and want a nap. I didn't care whether it was 4:00, or 5:00 pm, I felt like I NEEDED to rest. Whenever I woke up after those naps, I would always get this weird twitching in my arms that I would have no control over. It would always go away around 15 minutes later, so I felt like it was nothing to be worried about. Fast forward to the day of my winter vacation, 2017. I got up at 4:00 am, and I felt this twitching again. Every time I would go to grab my phone, I would drop it due to the twitches. My parents asked what was wrong with me, and I just said that I was fine. My parents decided to put off the trip, and to bring me to the hospital. Doctors couldn't diagnose me with anything at that time, so we all had to go home. I went to Santa Barbara later that week, and we had a blast. First time visiting west coast, yaddah yaddah. 

The night after the trip was very hazy. I remember being super tired, and going to bed at around 8:00 Pm. I wake up at around 1:00 Am to find myself in an ambulance with a paramedic, and my parents by my side. If you've a movie with those cliche scenes where a dude blinks a couple of times, and finds himself in an ambulance or a hospital, you know what I'm talking about. It felt very surreal to see myself wake up in that ambulance, and I cant believe I was so calm during those moments. Anyways, i get to the hospital and am then hooked up to an iv. The doctors couldn't diagnose me with anything without taking an EEG (Electroencephalography), so one again, I was sent home without any answers. I was told to get an EEG the next day, so I do it, and it takes about an hour long. On the spot, the test doctor diagnosed me with JME. Well whats Jme you may ask? It stands for Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy, and although it is a more mild type of epilespy, it has somehow made my life a hellhole. 

After 2 BS medicines (that had terrible side effects), and 1 kooky neurologist, we arrive to the beginning of this school year. This school year was DREADFUL to say the least. I had been relentlessly bullied, and I had been getting Low B's -High C's in most of my classes. Its weird because I was a straight A student, getting on high academic honor roll for the entirety years straight. I have also been struggling with depression through this year, so I think that might've been part of it. My saving grace this year was learning the tenor sax. I don't think I would've made it through the year without it. Well then, what does this have to do with you not trusting your parents? I'm glad you asked, because I have always been quiet about my parents. My sister has book smarts, but if there was a street smarts class, she would get an F-. She is currently in college, so she always goes to my mom to get social advice. I feel like talking to my mom and my dad about my social life lets them in on things I want to keep private, so I never have said anything to them about it. The truth is, there's a lot of things I don't want my parents to know. I've taken credit where I shouldn't have, I've been offensive to people that I know personally, and I've watched some things that is normal for kids my age, but is weird to say in front of my parents. I never get how my sister is so comfortable saying things to my parents, but I also feel like I don't have to. Many of the things I come out and say to them, they re-use whenever I get into arguments with them. I'll update you guys a little later.

I know I've spent over an hour on this scuffed story that most likely wont make it to the page of this subreddit, but to the people who've read this, thank you. I truly do appreciate it, and it would make my day a bit better if you could comment what you think I should do about school and my parents. Any piece of advice is helpful,

29,"I was raised by my mother who was a single parent, who was a professional artist. 

My parents got divorced very quickly because their marriage was through mass matchmaking. 

I remember them fighting and throwing houseware into a wall, usually done by my mother. 

She still kept me and my brother to get child support, he paid them for over 20 years which is insane, I don't think after 10 year he even had to pay us at all.

Through my life I was never loved or actually taken care of, I've gotten humiliated in public, got violently punished for her stress relief, so my memories of her are nothing but a headache and severe depression.

Before I ran away from my home, she told me ""Make sure you take care of me when I'm old, and I still have bit of debt so you need to take care of that as well"", ""For my retirement get me a house in the forest where I can draw all day""

Now I am far away from her, and I do not contact her and probably never will, the only person I love is my little brother who had gone through the same experience and was the latest victim of her experiment to raise a ""Genius Artist""

I will still send money to her once she is old because I do pity her and do not want her to be poor.

35,"First of all I'll apologize for any ignorance I'll probably end up displaying with this post. I'll try to keep it short.

My closest friend has been dealing with some serious mental health stuff for about the last year. Namely anxiety and depression. It began right around the time she started experiencing serious marital and other health problems, but also right around the time she started messing with the meds she's already been taking for mild anxiety. Since then, its been basically controlling her life.

I question whether or not this severe anxiety and depression is actually resulting from the meds she's taking. I sometimes think the small uptick in anxiety and depression last year began with the marital problems, but the meds have since blown them out of control.

My question is, has anybody gotten off meds and actually began feeling better?

It's a chicken and egg situation, I know, but I'm wondering if it's and avenue worth exploring under the supervision of her doctor and therapist of course. I'll try to find the meds she's on now and post them in an edit.

I‚Äôm also a compulsive porn/masturbation addict and hypersexual, which began when I was 9 years old. It‚Äôs the most shameful shit in the world.

I have OCD, which used to be very, very debilitating. Today I‚Äôm still stuck with minor compulsions, but it‚Äôs nothing compared to those dark years of my life. It became incredibly prominent in my early teens, so I battled OCD alone because I was afraid to reach out. I‚Äôve never had the control I need to function. I was kept from learning control. For my whole life my actions have been governed by one rule: get rid of the anxiety as quickly as possible.

Since then anxiety in my life hasn‚Äôt decreased, I‚Äôm choosing drugs and porn to relieve the stress instead of actually solving my problems.

I have absolutely NO self-control. I can‚Äôt control my actions, impulses, emotions... I‚Äôm so scared. I don‚Äôt know the next step, what‚Äôs helpful and what‚Äôs harmful.

This has taken me a long time to post, but I don't really feel like I can ask anyone I know (I've been to the free counseling at my school but I don't know if that really helped idk).

I always keep wondering if I have have a mental health issue, or if I'm just weak and too sensitive and can't handle normal emotions. I truly don't believe being mentally ill is to be weak, but what draws the line? If I don't have any kind of mental illness, does thinking that I might make me a bad person?

Some context (it's a mess of words I'm sorry):

I haven't really had any kind of hard trauma in my life. As the youngest of an immigrant family, I was shielded from a lot of things that would've been trauma growing up, and after realizing that I hold a lot of guilt about it. That's about it. Even if there were things that should have affected me, I don't think they did as much bc I find that I don't really pay attention to things I should Over the past year, I've found myself having a harder time socializing with people and overanalyzing things, but it doesn't keep me from meeting new people, it's just really hard and scary sometimes. But a lot of people feel that way. I have my down days and periods of time where I don't feel like I can really do anything and feel worthless, but then it fades and I feel okay within a week or two. But who doesn't? I often spiral down dark holes of negativity and again, feeling kind of worthless, but maybe I just overreact. I find myself pulling individual hairs out because a strand feels rough, or the ends are scraggly, but not enough for me to feel like I have trich. I want to say I have anxiety, I just don't think I suffer enough for me to say that I have a mental illness, but I don't feel like I can be the type of person that's like ""be positive!!"" and can find comfort in that. I've had the ideas of wanting to just end things and disappear, but I truly don't want to die. I hear friends and others talk about their mental health and the amount of suffering they've endured because of it, and I don't think I've felt that, and my family has endured so much worse than I ever have, but have never struggled the way I do with things that aren't even as difficult. I've seen a counselor in training for a few sessions, it was nice to talk about things but she never mentioned anything out of the ordinary about me.

I don't really know how to feel, and especially with the pandemic, emotions were all over the place, but so were everyone else's. So am I dramatic and weak? Or is there some other underlying contributor to the way I feel?",28Apr2020,1
43,"It seems like I can never be truly excited or happy over something without it being taken away from me. Whether it's taken away from me by either life, my parents or myself.  All these feelings  came when college applications became a priority. Late 2019 and 2020 have honestly I can say been the worst time of my life.  I kind of got out of the funk in December  2019, but it hit me again when ivy day came. L's from all across the board. Everytime I went to sleep, phrases such as ""you aren't good enough"", ""fucking stupid"", ""of course you didn't get in"", etc. would play in my head. This went on for a week with a massive sense of disappointment in myself. But, this went away slightly when I took time to completely rethink my current future. On the schools that I did accepted to, I found 1 that I believed would be a very good choice for me (I also had a 2nd choice that was close). But that 1st choice of mine has constantly been judged and basically been said me it's a waste of time. Unfortunately, money is a huge issue for me so it's been difficult for me to commit officially. But a ""talk"" with my parents tonight has made me feel like complete shit. It felt like any choice I had in my college decision has been taken away from without me even speaking a word. Pretty much, I was told there was no point in me  giving me any information to the 1st school for financial aid because I would never be able to afford it and it's a waste of time. They tried to mask their tone when I called them out on this by saying they never know. But they pretty much said to me there was no point in trying. Anytime my dad says it's time to realistic, it makes me feel like a child. It actually crushed me on inside that any opportunity that was there was gone. Any choice I had was slapped out my hand, again. I honestly just want enroll in the 2nd choice school rn because I'm tired.This whole fucking year and last year was just disappointment after disappointment. I cry a bit over it and then I just turn emotionally numb. But I'm tired of feeling disappointed over everything that happens in my life. I'm sick of my family downplaying any disappointment or hurt I feel over issues. They make it seem like it's all in my head. I can never have dreams or ideas that are for me, they have to be for everyone else.  I don't think I've truly happy for a long time, this school year has just been blah for me. Disappointment seems like only comsist thing rn for me. I'm just tired and I wish I wasn't.",28Apr2020,1

2) After one year of my graudation finding my full-time position was successful but I managed to find two through personal connection.

3) Now I am looking a full-time position again but everytime I look at job postings I get so anxious that my heart feel overwhelming to complete the application, like adjusting my resume to the job and writing cover letter.

53,"Skip to TL;DR at the end if you want to read just that! 

This is probably gonna be long but I thought it was so interesting how differently 2 countries handled my mental health concerns

So a little background:
I‚Äôm a 20 year old girl and I lived most of my life in Canada but have dual citizenship in Korea and Canada. 

I have had symptoms of depression and anxiety ever since I was very young but never diagnosed or saw a doctor. But I knew I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. I also have schizophrenia in the family so I knew that I had a chance of also having it. 

Middle school: It started off with imaginary friends commenting on my life and having conversations with me. I had repetitive violent dreams that I would confuse reality with. Sometimes I would have one specific dream everyday for 3 months. In high school I was very suicidal, self harmed, purged and pulled my hair out.

First year of university comes and I start vividly hearing my dreams irl. For example if I‚Äôm driving the man in my dream would sit in the back seat and cry. 

This went on for about 2 years when I finally couldn‚Äôt stand it and talked to my family doctor. 

He booked a psychiatrist for me and I waited for about a month. He told me that  it usually takes 3-6 months but he put me as urgent considering my situation of being sad, suicidal, paranoid and afraid of sleeping because I didn‚Äôt want to dream.

Psychiatrist was very understanding and non-judgmental. We talked for about an hour and later on she was able to diagnose me with depression, anxiety and prodromal schizophrenia with a likely chance of developing into full on schizophrenia if not treated. She prescribed me antidepressants for depression and risperidone for my schizophrenic symptoms. 

It‚Äôs May 2019 and I start my new drugs. 
Side effects: sleeping 20 hours a day and gaining 50 pounds over 7 months. 
Positive effects: less suicidal thoughts, less hallucinations.

My doctor and psychiatrist suggest I get regular therapy so I start to look.
Psychiatrist wait list: 1 year
Psychologist wait list: 6 months 
Counsellor/therapist wait list: 3 months
The app BetterHelp: no wait list

So I put myself under a wait list for a therapist and get betterhelp.

Review of betterhelp:
Do not recommend. There is no guarantee that who you get matched up with is a professional or an expert on the field of your concerns. The woman I was matched with had no idea what she was talking about in regards to schizophrenic symptoms and her questions were often triggering. Betterhelp advertises themselves as ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù but texting for 30 min to get so little ruins the purpose of it being affordable. And, it‚Äôs not even that affordable! But I see why it‚Äôs a good option for people who cannot get a local therapist and I‚Äôm sure others must have had good experiences. There must be better people with more experience.

So I cancel after about 2 weeks and lucky enough my sister finds me a therapist with no wait list. I see her for the first time. She‚Äôs 100 times better than the lady on BetterHelp. She has experience with people with schizophrenia, depression and anxiety and is familiar with the drugs I‚Äôm prescribed. I see her weekly. I feel so good when I see her but I feel like shit and anxious on the days I don‚Äôt see her. But we talk about the past a lot. Maybe a little too much. Talking about trauma makes me cry every time I see her but I feel better. But I always leave wishing I had more time to talk about my current situation, about how I should cope with my 3 diagnosis. But she helps me cope better with trauma and I feel less sad when I think about it.

It‚Äôs August and my symptoms are back. I‚Äôm sad, suicidal, hallucinating more than ever and confuse reality and non-reality all the time. Family doctor doubles my antidepressants and increases risperidone by a mg. 2 days later I lose sensation on my face and I can‚Äôt smile. I suddenly remember my psychiatrist telling me to go to the Emergencies if I have numbness anywhere in my body. My mom and I quickly go to the ER. I have a panic attack in the car. When we get to the ER they tell me to wait 2 hours. 4 hours pass by and I feel like I‚Äôm about to faint. I‚Äôm crying, shaking and numb all over my body. No one is helping and the nurse just tells me to wait a little more. My dad meanwhile calls a doctor friend in korea and he tells him that I should just go home and see a doctor the next day if my numbness isn‚Äôt worsening/spreading to other parts of my body. So we go home and I see my family doctor the next day for ‚Äúurgent reasons‚Äù. He lowers my dosages and my face goes back to normal. But I‚Äôm feeling like shit! Hallucinating, delusional, psychotic, suicidal etc.

My dad is so disappointed in the ER healthcare system of Canada and begins his research on better options for me. 

From August to December I see my therapist weekly, stay on the same drugs and have family and friends surrounded at all times to make sure I don‚Äôt drive away or injure myself or kill myself. I also use suicide helplines whenever I feel the need. I have people that encourage me to always seek help.

August is also when I started noticing my weight gain. I gained about 35 pounds. I go back to my old high school/university habits of throwing up or starving or looking at thinspo on tumblr all the time. I tell my therapist and she says ‚Äúbut you don‚Äôt look fat don‚Äôt worry‚Äù

September comes and I go back to university, third year in sciences. I go to classes and write my first midterm. My score is bang on the average mark of the class. We have a class talking about schizophrenia. I get triggered and feel a panic attack coming. After that day I start to have no confidence that I‚Äôd do any better on the final and cancel all my classes and quit the semester.

November comes and my dad tells me he found a doctor in korea for me. The contract is 3 months. He would give me counselling and control or prescribe my medications as well. I‚Äôm terrified of speaking in korean about my trauma or symptoms because they just sound so much worse in korean in my opinion.(Korean is my first language but English is my preferred language)

December comes and I leave to Korea.

Korean mental health doctors have no wait list usually because people don‚Äôt like getting help. There‚Äôs a lot of stigma around mental health hospitals and it‚Äôs very taboo. Some companies, you have to write on your resume if you‚Äôve ever been hospitalized for mental health reasons. South Korea is also the country with the highest suicide rate in the world. 

I see my new doctor for the first time. He doesn‚Äôt ask anything about my past. He doesn‚Äôt ask anything about my symptoms. All he knows is what I‚Äôve been diagnosed in Canada and what drugs I‚Äôm taking. 

He simply asks ‚Äúare you satisfied with your current life?‚Äù 

I say no

‚ÄúAre you motivated enough to change that?‚Äù

I say I‚Äôm not sure

He tells me for the next 3 months he‚Äôs going to help me WANT to be satisfied with my life and change to achieve my goals. 

He‚Äôs so challenging. Nothing like therapists and doctors in Canada. He doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúbaby‚Äù me. Everyone in Canada always said ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not ready or don‚Äôt want to, you don‚Äôt have to‚Äù. My new doctor tells me ‚Äúyou have to or there‚Äôs no point of our contract‚Äù

He makes me sleep and wake up at the same time everyday. No more naps, no exceptions. I HAVE to eat 3 meals, even if it‚Äôs just a banana as a meal at the same exact times. I must have at least one snack. 

He tells me I‚Äôm doing such a good job showering and doing my makeup everyday. Every time I go to the hospital the nurses compliment my makeup and my outfit.

He gives me his cellphone number and the head nurse gives me her personal cellphone number as well. I message them every single day about anything I want to talk about.

I visit him 1-2 times a week and call with him 1-2 times a week. 

If I‚Äôm feeling suicidal, I text him that it‚Äôs urgent and he calls me right away even when it‚Äôs 1AM. If he doesn‚Äôt answer, I‚Äôm told to call the head nurse who also helps me right away, anytime of the day. 

Other than controlling my sleep and eating, I do whatever the fuck I want. I watch tv for 12 hours a day or be on my phone for 10+ hours. I shop like crazy because none of my clothes fit me due to the weight gain. 

He tells me ‚Äúif you gain weight, it‚Äôs 100% my fault. I‚Äôm your doctor and nothing you do that causes you to feel bad about yourself is your fault‚Äù 

I feel so much better and I eat whatever I want. For the first time in my life I eat a whole pizza and go back to drinking regular non low fat milk.

He tells me that the hallucinations I see can‚Äôt do shit to me. I was always afraid they would hurt me but he helped me realize that they cannot touch me. ‚ÄúThey are bullshit‚Äù he says in perfect English. He partially went to med school in the United States

Whenever I talk about how I think about the past or the trauma, he tells me you‚Äôre so young, you can‚Äôt waste your time thinking about what already happened and you can‚Äôt change what happened in the past. Fuck the people who hurt you. They can‚Äôt hurt you anymore. You‚Äôre too strong for them to hurt you. 

He makes me focus on what‚Äôs bothering me right now, never about what had happened in the past. He also doesn‚Äôt let me think about the future, or when I would go back to school.

It‚Äôs January 2020 and I do my first weight check in a month. I gained 10 pounds. In total, I gained 50 pounds since May 2019. 

He asks me if I‚Äôm ready for a big challenge and I say yes.

He tells me at my weight, under supervision and regular blood work and blood pressure checks, I can go without food for weeks. I have already tried starving myself in middle school and high school so I love that I get to starve with a doctor‚Äôs approval. 

I don‚Äôt eat for 3 weeks. I drink at least 3 litres of water everyday. I go swimming and play/run with the dogs all the time. I feel completely fine. He tells me I won‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm starving or feel sick if I believe in him. It works and I lose 18 pounds. 

NOTE: do not starve yourself. I had blood pressure tests around every 3 days. And if I had requested, blood work was ready to be done whenever I wanted. Doctor was ready to stop me if the test results were ever bad. 

I feel so much better about myself. My old jeans fit and I finally fit into some oversized clothes that regular stores sell. (Korea‚Äôs sizings are very tiny compared to Canada. I‚Äôm a L in Canada but XXL or bigger in Korea)

It‚Äôs February and he says ‚Äúok let‚Äôs go off of your pills‚Äù I‚Äôm SHOOK. I say I‚Äôm scared and he says but they aren‚Äôt doing anything for you. You‚Äôre happier because you are sleeping normally, eating normally, lost weight and doing whatever you feel like. And risperidone? You‚Äôre still hallucinating and sometimes delusional so what‚Äôs it doing?

We slowly go off. 0.5 mg at a time over the course of 3 weeks for risperidone and halfing everytime for antidepressants. I start feeling reallllly impulsive. I scream for no reason, I want to jump off of my apartment balcony or I want to chug my dad‚Äôs alcohol and run away. I cry everyday and message him every night about how I‚Äôm crying.

He tells me then cry, keep crying, you‚Äôre not done crying, you need to cry more.

I start crying all the time for about a week. Then I stop. It feels like my body literally can‚Äôt produce anymore tears. I feel so much better and I just magically stop crying one day. (Today, I cry whenever I want to. I never hold back. I cry in front of anyone and anytime because he told me to stop giving so much shit about what other people think. And as a result, I cry a lot less now)

I maintain my weight by eating a lot less than I used to and drinking lots of water. I also go swimming and play ping pong.

It‚Äôs March. Corona hits :( no more swimming no more pingpong. I leave to Canada in 20 days. I accept the fact that I‚Äôll keep seeing my visual and auditory hallucinations. But they don‚Äôt bother me because he helped me on how to differentiate between fake and reality.

I‚Äôm about to leave to Canada and he speaks to my parents. He thinks we should continue the contract for another 3 months because when environment changes, many patients have a downfall. Everyone likes the idea and I go back to Canada.

We decide to call with him 3 times a week.

I go back to canada and jetlag hits real bad. I‚Äôm forced to stay home for minimum 2 weeks since I just came back from overseas (COVID-19) and it ruins everything. My sleep schedule, my eating schedule, how much I eat, my exercise level etc.

It‚Äôs early April and I‚Äôm done with jetlag.

My doctor stops going easy on me again and makes me go back to eating 3 meals and ‚Äúalways eat 1 less spoon than yesterday, everyday‚Äù. I realize that I gained about 5 pounds during the 2 week quarantine and I‚Äôm disappointed.

He makes me go outside, even if it‚Äôs just a 5 minute walk around my house twice a day and drive at least once to wherever I want once a day. I still message him whenever I want to. 

We make a promise to keep myself busy. Try my best to never be on the bed unless it‚Äôs night time and instead sit on the couch or even just sit on the bed. Never lie down. Never watch Netflix in bed during daytime. 

I don‚Äôt miss my antidepressants and risperidone anymore. 

I only take alprazolam (xanax) for panic attacks which can be anywhere from 2 days in a row or once in 3 weeks. 

And now current day, late April.
I hallucinate, have delusions and have my bad days. I even self harmed but my overall satisfaction with my life is so much better because I never lose the motivation to want to get better. He reminds me how nothing is permanent and that one day my hallucinations will simply go away, like it did with my family members who had schizophrenia and depression. And sometimes, it really feels like it‚Äôs gone. Sometimes, I don‚Äôt hallucinate for a whole 3 days and I kinda forget about it. When it comes back, I‚Äôm ok with it. 

He‚Äôs the first doctor to tell me it‚Äôs ok to talk to my imaginary friends and hallucinations. He‚Äôs the first to tell me that self harm is never the problem, the problem is always what led to that point. Never focus on the fact that I self harmed. It‚Äôs pointless. Think about what I can do next time to not get to that point. (As in how to not get that anxious and calm down before self harm happens)

Sometimes, I wanna quit and I miss my Canadian doctors because he‚Äôs never easy on me but I know I need that push to get better.

Conclusion: both countries definitely have its pros and cons

Canada:
PROS:
Canada is gentle, respectful and relatively affordable. 
I paid around $70-$100 CAD for medication per month and $120 CAD weekly for my therapist. (For comparison it was around $2000 for 3 months) They let you take your time with things. Really process everything and cope and manage slowly, at your own pace.

CONS:
Soooooooo slow!!! Everything has a wait list. I miss my doctors and therapists when I can‚Äôt see them. I have to rely on suicide helplines if I want to urgently talk to someone. And the helpline scared the crap out of me when all of the sudden the cops showed up at my house to make sure I was ok. And they planned on having me on risperidone for MINIMUM 5 years which I hated because I didn‚Äôt want to keep gaining weight.

Korea: 
PROS: 
Speedy. Easy to find private hospitals suitable for your needs. So many doctors, so many options. 100% of therapy I know in korea is never once a week. At least twice a week. 

CONS:
They never baby you. Very straight up even if it hurts your feelings. (My dad had a different psychiatrist and he was also very straight up and never gentle) Some people are simply not ready for this. Expensive. 3 month contract was around $5000 CAD. I‚Äôm lucky to have my parents acknowledge my mental illness and help out. Suicide helplines suck. I tried calling and I was on hold for so long I hung up. 


And so... today is April 27 2020 and I honestly didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be still alive but here i am. It was super sunny out so I walked my dog around and did yard work. I felt super shitty waking up this morning but I sent a message to my doctor and I feel better. Do I think I‚Äôd be alive if I just stayed in Canada and never saw my korean doctor? Yes. But I probably would‚Äôve felt much more miserable because of weight gain and I probably would‚Äôve still been on all my drugs. 

This is way too long I know but there‚Äôs so many differences in how they treat people with mental illnesses that I thought I‚Äôd share my experiences. Remember, these are very personal experiences and I‚Äôm sure not all canadian or korean doctors are the same!

TL;DR: I was very fortunate to have had the opportunity to go to Korea and try a different system. Korean approach was about structuring your life. I dont think it is for everyone since it is quite demanding. But if things haven't worked for you and you need to try something new then I hope the methods my doctor told me could have a positive impact in some of your lives.

If you skipped to the TL;DR and just want to know what my Korean doctor suggested, this is a brief summary:
- three meals a day, no matter how small, always at the same times
- never sleep more than 8 hours and never nap 
- don't focus on the past, what's done is done, the present is what matters
- try to spend a good amount of time outside
- be more accepting to your hallucinations. It doesnt have to bother you

It's very hard for me to summarize my experience since I am still getting through it, I really recommend you to read the wall of text above if you want to know the full story about how the Korean doctor approached things differently.

Hope you had a good read :)",28Apr2020,1

55,"Used to be very emotional, and it got me hurt a lot, so I numbed out about 10 years ago...decided emotions were bad.
Slipped into worse and worse depression and instead of feeling situations I just analyzed them like a robot.

I used to be terribly lonely, but I don't remember the last time I felt lonely...but on the flip side I don't remember the last time I let myself be vulnerable enough to feel an emotional connection...including my wife of five years, all family members, and all friends....not one person have I paid close attention to how they make me feel, just intellectual concepts of how I should view said person but knowing that I don't actually feel that towards them.
I'm not a sociopath, I care very much how my actions affect others, and I still have feelings under the surface...I just don't pay attention to them or let myself feel them strong enough to know what they are.

Just started reading ""the power of now"" and realized I stopped experiencing being, and only identified with my thoughts.

So I have tried practicing meditation to get out of my mind and feel again, but it's very hard to do without the help of marijuana.

56,"(Copy/Paste of my TrueOffMyChest post)

I just got out of a terrible friendship that affected me really bad. Now, whenever I see their name in very certain situations, I get a sick feeling, like I‚Äôm going through it all again.

It was a friendship that shouldn‚Äôt have lasted as long as it did. It was full of manipulation and gaslighting, and I only realized it now. Full of identity crises and anxiety attacks. Full of me thinking I‚Äôm not enough, and everyone hates me.

We got really close at one point, then drifted off a bit more. She, in a way, helped me see who I really am, which is one of the only good things to come out of that whole ordeal. But we drifted a bit. Then we fought. A lot. Over petty things. Mostly. She would get upset over something and get details wrong so it made me the bad guy. Me, being stubborn, would not let down until she corrected herself. These would go on for up to a week, with me always apologizing and thinking that maybe I did have details wrong.

When I would get upset with her, it would be over big things. Things like ‚ÄúYou just told me that i wasn‚Äôt this sexuality, I was this‚Äù or ‚ÄúI have severe anxiety around these people, and you forced me to stay‚Äù. The last one really hurt, and was when I realized that often she would manipulate my care for other people and terrible confrontation skills to her need. I hate confronting people, and she used that to her advantage. It was a terrible time.

She would constantly make fun of me, telling me (and other people) that I looked like that fat girl from scary stories to tell in the dark. Belittle my anxiety. Tell me that I‚Äôm wrong, or that I was a terrible friend. Talk about me behind my back. Make fun of my weight (5‚Äô5, 170 lbs) and everything. I stopped eating because of it. I was already eating healthy. Whenever I would say I was annoyed, she‚Äôd tell me to ‚Äúsuck it up, quick being a brat‚Äù then constantly complain to me. 

Now, I‚Äôve met another person with the same name (gender neutral, think something like Alex or Charlie, pretty common). This time, they‚Äôre nice. We play online in a group, don‚Äôt know each other well, so we use a chat app to talk. They just go by their name. Thing is, it‚Äôs the same chat app and name. Every time I go to talk to the group, I see that name. Then I remember what I went through. Now, it‚Äôs gotten to a point where I can barely talk to them on it, but I really want to.

When speaking to friends, my parents, professionals etc. I find my depression (feelings of flat mood, tiredness, lack of interest) far easier to discuss and be open about than my anxiety (fear that I‚Äôve done something wrong, nearly constant feelings of being tense and uncomfortable, that something is wrong).

My anxiety tends to be linked to self esteem.

66,"I was recently diagnosed with MDD (major depressive disorder) and I am 21 years old, although since I can remember I have been haunted with grief and suicidal ideations since I can remember. I wrote a suicide letter to my family when I was 6/7 years old and got caught before I could ""attempt"" (i don't remember how I was going to do it). Their reactions was very mixed, they were shocked and upset and didn't really know what to do. My dad yelled at me but was also very emotional and that was it, I think they brushed it off hoping it was a one time thing. (By the way this is a good time to add that my family immigrated to the states from Eritrea and we have been in this country for 19 years. Mental illness unfortunately is an extremely taboo topic to talk about and isn't really understood thus there is a lot in IGNORANCE that surrounds it.)

I'm a very happy person in general especially as a kid but I realized that all the external things such as friends, family, tv, school ect were distractions for me, in those moments I am genuinely happy and laughing but when I am left alone I would deal with my emotions that overwhelmed me with guilt, grief, and pain. I think this added to the confusion that I was ever depressed bc ""how could I be, I don't seem depressed"" There was never a time since I can remember that I didn't want to kill myself. All that time of my younger years I didn't understand why? Why? I thought it was my fault and it was just me. I then in my early teenage years researched depression (thank God for the internet üôåüèø) and realized that depression and sadness are completely different; that there is such a thing as mental illness. I was absolutely floored and wondered what could have caused this ""mental illness"". My father had exhibited the same symptoms of MDD and would sometimes allude to being suicidal. He would say statements such as ""what's the point of living life"" ""if we could live forever I would rather not"" ""I hate this life"". I also learned at the time that my fathers mother (my grandam) who passed away, was described as a mentally unstable woman by both my parents. It didn't sound like she had depression, more like she was erratic, but what I had gathered from all of this was that I was possibly mentally ill because it runs in my family. I was really happy as a 13/14 year old to find this information. Although I knew what I had researched may not apply to me, it gave me hope and made me realize that there is help out there and that I wasn't alone.

As you all know most of these websites that discuss mental health/sucide always encourage you to tell someone that you trust such as a family member. I got inspired to say something and I decided that I was going to tell my mom. My mom is the most hardworking, motivated, awesome savage who runs on batteries üòÇ. She doesn't understand mental illness from a personal perspective she doesn't relate to it so when I wanted to bring my depression to here I wanted to ease her into it and not just shock her. I started off talking about my grandmother her mother in law and her ""mentally unstable personality"".... In my head at that age this seemed like a good idea, I was trying to have her connect the dots like I did. And well.... I backed out... I got a weird vibe and chickened out. In retrospect she knew where I was getting at and was really uncomfortable. During ""my teenage years"" my depression was getting worse and those distractions I talked about earlier were not really working. My mom could see this and I think she misinterpreted that as me being a moody teenager. Maybe I was a moody teenager who also happened to have depression ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Not long after my failed attempt to discuss my depression she brought it up without out bringing it up ü§î. I told my mom I wasn't interested in going to this event with her which is unlike me we usually go as a family to this ""event"" every so often. She snapped at me and asked me why and I made up an excuse. She was really confused at what was going on with me bc at that point in time I didn't feel like I had anything to live for and wasn't really hiding my depression as much. She proceeds to let me know that this ""attitude"" I have has a lot of ppl talking behind my back and that no one would tell me to my face. She goes on to use metaphors like how if there was something on our teeth wouldn't we want someone close to us to tell us before we walk out the door because if the ones who are close to us don't tell us than who will? When I saw where this is going I acted like I didn't know what she was talking about. I started to force myself to laugh and smile, it was that fake it till you make it situation for me. It was then and only then that I realized that my mom was not receptive to hearing about my mental struggles. I felt incredibly alone and it caused a huge shift in how I saw her. She went on to tell me that I should avoid medications at all cost bc they effect you more than they help you and you will only become dependent on them. She goes on to use this man that we knew as a reference for an example of what meds can do to you.( he was a bit off when you talked to him, and was known for having a ""mental issue"" and took ""medications"")

I never ever told anyone what was going on in my head since then until this past February 2020, I participated in a research about depression at UCSF. This is the thing it's been almost a decade since then, and my mom is a decent person, that ""talk"" she had with me was really a crappy moment for her but besides that she's a good person. She just doesn't understand mental illness and I think she was struggling with her own issues of having to deal with a husband who himself deals with mental illness while balancing a crazy life in the states with 6 children. its just absolutely crazy üôÉ

i Moved out when I was 20 about a year and half ago , not too far from my families home and It really made my parents communicate with me in ways they never had before. They ask me how are you? how's life going? what's new? I grew up with 5 other siblings so we never got this kind of attention. I think my parents are realizing the hard way what the more important things are, such as having a relationship with your kids as oppose to chasing that dream job ect ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I'm not one to be disingenuous, I may not be comfortable with telling you how I feel, but I certainly will not lie to you by saying how awesome out relationship is. Does that make sense. My point being that When I moved out question were asked such as Why did you want to move when you can have free rent here? And I said that there was a toxic environment here and that I wasn't happy. Moving out was the best thing I could have ever done for my relationship with my parents. Now that everything with them is calm and they are getting older I wonder if I could ever tell them about what is going on in my head.

70,"A while back I ended up in a situation where I generally found myself in at some point. I was not doing well with my untreated bipolar disorder but I was doing very well managing the issues in my head and living my day to day life. Inevitably someone started an argument which snapped the sinew that was holding myself together and I had a situation where I felt the need to use a knife in self defense. I have a long history of almost 20 years of abuse from my family, from my mother violently pulling my hair and slamming my head into walls at the age of 7 to my brother choking me for pushing him away when he got too close, knowing he was going to hurt me in some manner. In all of these events, even as I asked and begged for any one of the 7 other people in the house to make the abuse stop, either they would join in or simply watch and do nothing.

So at the age of 25, I had enough. I dont trust them. I took a knife and repeatedly said it was for self defense only. Telling them repeatedly that it was only self defense and to stay away from me. Police were called and I was arrested for criminal threats and brandishing a weapon. I have severe ptsd from the 4 days I spent in jail from being forced to drink out of a toilet to being manhandled by officers. As someone who is already mentally ill, I have gone days without sleeping or eating because of what they did to me.

My mother bailed me out after being denied access to me for 4 days. My family has already said they won't press charges to the DA but the DA refuses to drop the case. I go to court the day after tomorrow and if the DA doesnt drop the case, I'm going to kill myself. I cant keep living this way. I started medication, I'm doing what I need to, i see my therapist every other week (it used to be every week but i really started getting sick of her) and my mother saw the event as a wake up call. She thought I would be hospitalized, not arrested, after I got out (sick with an infection from the conditions the officers put me through) she realized what she had been doing to me and her role in why this happened from years of built up physical, emotional and mental abuse.

But it's like, too late. If I face charges after this hearing, I'm going to kill myself. My brother owns a gun, ironically my mother once threatened to shoot me with it. I cant deal with this. I cant live like this.",28Apr2020,1
71,"I get really attached to peoples voices, and it can be really annoying. I can want nothing to do with someone, but for some reason really miss their voice. I have peoples voices memorized from years and years ago and i don‚Äôt know why. It‚Äôs not everyones voice, just some peoples. I have an ex, who i no longer have feelings for and honestly never have and shouldn‚Äôt have dated them, but when i was going to break up with him all those months ago, i almost didn‚Äôt because i knew i‚Äôd miss his voice. I did leave him though, and now, months later i still find myself randomly thinking about his voice and nothing else about him really, just his voice.  

Could this be a symptom of anxiety or depression or maybe ptsd? I have all of those, diagnosed by a medical professional because i was neglected and abused when i was younger ( sometimes my mother would lock me in rooms and not let me out unless i needed to go to the bathroom or school, and when i was out of my room she would always yell and swear and call me names n stuff )

72,"I've been struggling with my mental health for nearly a decade at this point. I did ask my parents to get me to see a mental healthcare professional years back but failed terribly and their reactions to it further shaped my distrust and anxiety and I worsened.

As a result, I lived rather recklessly in secret. On top of my existing issues from the environments I was in growing up, I'm now suffering from anxiety due to the reckless things I've done.

On normal days, it's tolerable. When I'm menstruating, I completely lose control. I get extremely paranoid, my anxiety spikes, and unlike on normal days when I can control my urge to self-harm, I'll find myself doing it without even realising.

Recently, I've been keeping logs so that when I do get help, I'll just give them to the therapist/psychiatrist/psychologist or anyone I see for professional mental healthcare. They contained incidents of my traumas since kindergarten - bullying, sexual harassment, the self-sabotage and the like. All the things I never brought up to them. 

My memories are awful and I don't remember most of kindergarten, primary, and secondary school except for those certain events. Additionally, most of those bad memories only came to me recently in one go, all of a sudden like a torrent. It doesn't help that I got rid of my old social media accounts which recorded those events as they happened so I'll never be able to remember things. 

A month ago, I told my mother I needed to get help but she never brings it up. A few days ago, I sent my mother a link to those logs I wrote as were confessions. She never opened them. She doesnt ask me about them either. I'm always the one initiating it and it doesn't seem like she has any incentive to find out what's wrong with me. I gave her a solution but she doesn't believe in it. I don't even know if she bothered to.

I feel like I'm never going to get help or their support and I'll never get anywhere. I feel like I'm going to lose control again. I'm starting to feel more aggressive but still holding it in.

77,"Sorry if this is considered too minor an issue or something that everybody does.

I'm pretty sure we all have those thoughts about those embarrassing things we did a few years ago. I have those, but I've suddenly started doing this new thing. Basically I think up random situations that could be potentially *very* embarrassing and feel embarrassed even though nobody, including myself, ever did them. This happens a lot, mostly when I'm bored or don't have anything to think about.

Here's an example of one situation that I frequently think of: Like a lot of other students, I have online classes with a chat. I keep imagining myself randomly saying a racial slur in said chat and then everybody gets mad at me. Of course, I'd never do something like that in real life, but I imagine doing it. When I imagine it, I get really nervous. I start to blush heavily, get angry at myself, and usually curl up in the fetal position on the floor near my desk. It takes anywhere from five seconds to two-ish minutes to recover my composure completely.

I used to only do this sort of thing very occasionally, and I reacted much less strongly - usually just feeling a tiny bit embarrassed for a few seconds - but I've noticed it becoming much more frequent and stronger recently.

It's starting to impact my sleep schedule. I stay up late at night writhing in my bed, thinking about these situations. It can take an hour or so for me to completely calm down when this happens.

I've also started to tug at my hair more and sometimes pull it out. A few years ago I did this - I ended up with a bald spot on my head and that gave me the motivation I needed to stop - and I haven't done it since then until now. The hair near the left part of my forehead where I pull most is starting to be noticeably shorter than everywhere else on my head.

78,"Hi there!

I have a lot to fill you all in on, because I need a lot of advice. 

My current situation and past situation:
I have been living in a household with an emotionally abusive and hateful parent who has basically turned everyone into shut-ins who stay in their rooms all the time. We are all numb. A lot of my siblings are hateful and have anger issues, along with my parent. Both of my parents have drinking problems as well. So for context here let's just say my home life isn't too great and could play into what I'm about to say.

What I need help with:

I feel jealous. All the time.

It's ridiculous and honestly completely irrational on my part. 

My boyfriend and I are in the same friend group, we all play games together and stuff like that. But he and I have both have always been more or less the 'last ones invited' to things. We've always felt very disconnected from the group. And I think part of the reason (the other reason is definitely because my friends can be inconsiderate at times) is the fact that we are both jealous of each other. 

I can't completely speak for him, because he sort of plays it off, but I notice signs of jealousy in him when I'm doing  things with our friends, so I feel as though it's a problem in both of us.

However, I know for a fact that my jealousy is much worse. Basically, my friends all had a discord server that they were in for a few months that I didn't know about (my boyfriend was in it too, yes he didn't tell me about it either). It was mainly for a game that I didn't play so I blew it off when I found out about it but was still sort of hurt. Then eventually they started playing other games while in the server and they still hadn't invited me. This is sort of when I started to become really really upset and angry over the situation. Yes I know it's just a discord but  I honestly just wish my friends would at least try to include me. My boyfriend ended up inviting me much much later on. I don't know why he took so long. Either way, when it's my friends hanging out without me or my boyfriend im usually okay because then I at least have him, but when my boyfriend is with them I get overwhelmingly upset. So much so that I will cry for hours. (I do my best not to message him when he's with them because I don't want my jealousy to get in the way, it would be unfair to him) If see my friends on discord and my boyfriend is in the call, I get extremely upset unless someone ends up inviting me to the call. I get incredibly upset about all of this so easily as well, even if it's just a one of my friends asking my boyfriend to play something and not asking me while we are both in the call I get so angry and sad over it.

All I want is to stop, because I know that I can hurt his relationship with our friends. Please tell me how.",28Apr2020,1

82,"For context, I am a 16 yr-old male (soon to be 17 in a couple weeks) with ADHD.

With the current pandemic cancelling school in my area, my district has moved to online classes. This has given me a lot of time to self reflect and some things I think I might have been subconsciously suppressing have come up. For a while now I felt that the version of me from my childhood (elementary and junior high mostly, but also some of high school) has been very different from the current me. I originally attributed it to just changes with growing up but recently I‚Äôve been worrying about it for no reason whatsoever and am going through some kind of crisis I believe. However the issue if anyone can help me understand what I‚Äôm observing, is that my character up until now has greatly changed over time. In junior high I was confident; had a girlfriend, was the class clown kind of person, craved attention. But that‚Äôs all I know, I remember very little, if at all of those years, and it feels like it was someone else. Come freshman year of high school; I was starting to change I guess more and more, I know that I went through a couple months of some sort of depression episode and during the summer had split from my only real friend group consisting of people I had been good friends with in junior high and some of even my best friends from elementary. I won‚Äôt get into that unless it‚Äôs necessary, but I will say I surprisingly remember very little of it even thought it was a significant change in my life. I had spent almost the entirety of my junior year alone, with little friends besides my teammates on my school‚Äôs cross country team. These past two years of my life where all these significant things happened and you‚Äôd think I‚Äôd have some kind of significant memories, I have zero or the one‚Äôs I can recall feel almost like a dream and out of character of me. It felt like yet again, another stranger‚Äôs story that I have a summary of but know somehow that stranger was me. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just that I have very horrible memory and every few years I have a blackout of some kind, but it seems like even stuff from months ago, when people tell me about things, I only remember it to an extent or if I do for some reason remember some details, it feels just different I guess.

My husband always jokes I have selective memory. I have good photographic memory for certain things (cooking, moving furniture in my head aka design and art) but when it comes to memory for studying. I‚Äôve also notice that sometimes he tells me to get something and sometimes I forget and I have to ask again. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong I am in therapy but it‚Äôs like a joke for my therapist who doesn‚Äôt believe me. My parents don‚Äôt believe in mental health so I didn‚Äôt get tested till college for ADHD and they did wire my brain and did studies. But my therapist is currently still checking on the results. I do have depression and anxiety, I do get anxiety test. But I‚Äôm done with school. 

Now let me get back to the studying. I want to go back to school but my memory retention is so bad. I‚Äôve tried flash cards, note taking and other methods  but I have no memory to keep it. I‚Äôve always had to do extra credit to get an A or B, hard classes with no extra credit are C or even a D. 

I don‚Äôt want to go towards medicine because I feel like I do get addicted to it. Apart from being a weirdo, it also affects my work habits and learning new information.

Whenever i try to think back on it, i feel intense mental pain, and i slowly get dragged back into the feeling, music that i listened to from that time is unbearable, and i dont even know why.

And to make matters worse, i have been mood swinging like never before, i feel intense hatred to anyone who looks at me for too long (thats a BIG can of worms that ill explain if prompted) that isnt family, and i dont even know how to tell anyone the full extent of what i went through, i still dont want to post every bit.

I guess im posting this to get a bit of clarity, for the foreseeable future i wont be getting therapy, and i dont want to burden my friends with worrying to much about me

89,"I am drowning, I am rotting, I am alone.

I am undiagnosed and all my attempts at getting proffesional help have failed. 

I smoke weed every day because I need to numb the pain but no psychologist will help me until I stop smoking. When I tried getting proffesional help with the addiction there was no room to talk about my mental health which is intertwined with my addiction. So that failed..

My body is in pain every day because I gained too much weight for my back to carry properly so even just doing household chores causes me pain. This is because I am an emotional eater too.

I have no friends left because I stopped contacting people who I wouldn't hear from if I didn't text them first. I was done with onesided relationships. Now no one is left except my bf. Anyone who I reached out to for help (because everyone always tells you to reach out) has dropped me like a brick. Now I can't help but scoff every time I read something like "" reach out. You are loved and people will help you."" Without fail everyone who I've told I was/am suicidal has dissapeared from my life.

My relationship with my bf is ofcourse also suffering. He has issues too and they're killing me. He is incapable of talking about anything even remotely emotional. He'll shut down and not have anything to say for DAYS! All he can muster is ""I don't know what to do."" And every time, 100% of the time, it's up to me to put my emotions aside and work things out or things will stay broken. And I have been doing that because he doesn't do it on purpose, but it's eating away at me. Whenever I want to talk about something he ""doesn't know his opinion"". How do I even handle that? There's just no way.

My family is extremely bad for my peace of mind as there was abuse in my past. Emotional and physical. So we are NC. I have no desire or energy to deal with them.

Some days I don't even want to make an effort to do better... most days. There is no way things are going to work out. Why waste the energy? I just want to curl up, fall alseep and quietly stop existing.",28Apr2020,1

One time in high school I went to confessions and I don‚Äôt remember what I had said, but the priest had sent me to my schools therapist because I thought I could have adhd.. and the therapist just asked me a lot of questions and he said I probably have it. When I talked to my mom about it she said that when I was younger sometimes she thought I had it, but then she saw people with extreme cases of it and thought I was fine. But now I am in college, and I have a really hard time getting my work done. I open my laptop and sit in front of it but can‚Äôt seem to get any work done.

I need your help, especially by someone who knows a thing or two about psychology. Sorry if this is post unrelated to this subreddit, but it's been like 2 years since I discovered a new way to f' myself up, when I feel like I'm going through something difficult and nobody can help me. 
Since puberty I can recall, whenever I felt overwhelmed with myself, my environment orost specifically my emotions, I'd choose destructive ways to ""deal with it"".  Like once I lit up a cigar ( by the age of 16) , grabbed me a vodka and listen to music in the cellar because I felt misunderstood. 
Now I'm a little grown , I meditate everyday and I like to think my treshhold for self sabotaging actions has increased, but these days it's sexual contents or phone addiction I use as a valve for my overwhelmed. And I do it with exactly the same intentions, which I had a teenager: To damage myself! I don't even enjoy it and yet I find myself jacking off from time to time, merely because I feel overwhelm. Sometimes, I look up sites where you can find hookers , because I know I shouldn't. Do you guys get the feeling? I don't know if it's me being an attention whore, or just self sabotage, but it sucks and it gotta stop.

95,"I literally just joined reddit so I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm doing everything right. But I just need to vent.

It all started when school began in 2019. Before summer I had really bad anxiety issues. But during the summer I overcame that and I can say that I was actually happy with my life. I had moved away from the shitty small town I had lived in and I was going on vacations, playing video games, and overall just enjoying my life. Then the school year started and I began going to my new school. It was so great at first, I thought my life was going to be perfect. I quickly became popular and made lots of friends. And I met a cute guy and we started dating. I felt so happy. Then my boyfriend broke up with me. That was when things started to take a turn for the worse. I became unpopular and I started losing friends. And the friends I still had were so toxic to me. And to this day still are. Then I got depressed. I didn‚Äôt realize at first because it wasn‚Äôt that bad. Then I started to notice I was crying a lot and experiencing symptoms of depression. Then I started crying myself to sleep, crying whenever I‚Äôm alone, deleting social media posts because I‚Äôm insecure, and feeling like no one cares for me. Worst of all every single moment that I bring my attention of what I‚Äôm doing I feel like committing suicide. That‚Äôs all I think about. I‚Äôve been standing on a chair with a rope tied above me and my neck in the noose, contemplating whether not I should do it or not. What really fuels my depression is the people around me. The problem is no one truly cares about me more than other people. What I‚Äôm trying to say is that people care more about others than me ALWAYS. My parents care about each other the most, my sister doesn‚Äôt care about my family that much, my friends have best friends, my ex just gets back with me whenever he breaks up with a better girl, and even my own dog likes my dad more than me. I feel empty. I see no point in existing. And if you are wondering I don‚Äôt wanna ask for help because I‚Äôm afraid people will look at me even worse than they already do. My plan is to commit suicide whenever I can‚Äôt handle life anymore. Or when I‚Äôm in my late twenties because that way I won‚Äôt have to deal with the burdens of life. But part of me has hope. I have hope that my life can get better. But I really don‚Äôt know. Committing suicide would be like a gamble. If I do it I would be put out of my misery. But on the contrary my life could have been better. I don‚Äôt know what to do and I think I‚Äôm actually losing my mind. None of the bullshit advice I see online helps. All I wanna do is die. But that‚Äôs the point of death if all we do is live. What the point of living if in the end we just die. I‚Äôm confused and scared.

I have had social media since I was 11/12 years old, and always posted my life online etc. In my college years, social media was a place that I found motivation to study, to do better. People on social media motivated me to dress better, to workout more, to do my make up better. 

I have suffered with anxiety since I was young, but since starting Med School it became a lot worse. I have less friends, I socialise less. My university is prestigious and I am now surrounded by people who have had a very different upbringing to myself, I feel like this knocked my confidence a lot. They're better than me at everything; socialising, dancing, working out, eating habits, intelligence.

Also, I can't bare social media anymore. I feel inadequate. I feel like everyone has more money than me, a better relationship, better skin, a better body, more confidence. I find it very overwhelming, toxic, negative. When I delete all my accounts, I feel relieved and at peace. I don't like how I look, I don't dress up, I don't take pictures of myself. I just feel so worthless. 

I have developed a hatred towards my toxic family. I see my ""best friend"" as annoying, I don't even wanna be her friend anymore.

105,"I was in a relationship with a girl a few years ago and then moved back to my home country to study in summer 2017. The plan was to have her move to be with me after a little while. There were visa issues and I asked her to marry me to avoid those issues and then we could have a ceremony at a later date. She didn't want to do that and then the long distance thing took its toll and we broke up in summer of 2018.

It took me until the end of that year to start dating again and I started seeing somebody else in about march of last year.

Is it because I am insecure? I am, inside I am, outside no one would ever think so.  
Is it because I want to prove that I can get the girl, and when I do get her the cycle continues? Am I avoiding failure because subconsciously I don‚Äôt believe in myself? Maybe I always think I can do better? How does one give himself confirmation instead of seeking it from the outside world/females?

I‚Äôve hurt so many women along the way, and I hate myself for doing so, even starting every interaction by telling them that I am not 100% ok in my head, that in my perfect future there is no woman involved, that I don‚Äôt believe in relationships (romantic happily ever after type), that I never had a long term relationship except being married to a wonderful girl but without loving her romantically (and yes, feeling like a piece of shit for it aswel of course).

I KNOW that I am damaged emotionally, and fucked up in my head.  
Ridiculous childhood, emotional &amp; physical abuse as a child, sold drugs, regular sex with hookers between 13 and 15, the list goes on and on.  
Normally I stay away from women knowing that I end up hurting them, but after a while and with some really just not giving up on me I decide to try, and tell in advance that I am messed up‚Ä¶ and the cycle continues!

111,"I wanted to write so much yesterday about the process of my thoughts and what I have been through. Check my very first post if you‚Äôd like to know the details.

I have one more sexual health appointment. The Nurse was absolutely amazing and with my first appointment it was a smear test, pregnancy test and hepatitis C vaccine. In theory that could have taken 15 minutes, but she was with me for over an hour. My first appointment was just before the pandemic and we talked through a lot of things and I cried so much.

She knew I wasn‚Äôt looking forward to the smear test, the thought of having something inserted into me freaked me out. To this day, even when I go to the toilet, I shiver when I have to wipe. I cried when she did the smear test but I told her to carry on because I knew it was going to confirm if I had contracted anything. Everything came back negative even the pregnancy test. So that‚Äôs a bit of burden off my shoulders. 

My second appointment, it was with the same Nurse and she commented on how I looked better. I did at that time, I had a better day that day.

My most recent appointment was difficult. I had more tests and they came back negative which was great but with quarantine happening and being on Furlough leave I was feeling vulnerable. The same nurse saw me again and this time she had an apron, mask, gloves and goggles on. She didn‚Äôt like that she was presenting herself so clinical during a vulnerable time in my life. All I wanted was a hug but I live with a housemate and I don‚Äôt want to hug him. She asked me if I‚Äôd try meditating. Unfortunately the guy who sexually assaulted me was a big fan of meditation so meditating makes me even more stressed out.

I‚Äôm struggling to find my thing that will calm me when I have bad days or I have panic attacks. I become agitated very quickly.",28Apr2020,1
112,"I'm (18m) not very good at writing things like this but here goes. When I was little, I was always a happy, energetic, supportive, and positive kid. I would always do everything I could to love and support those around me even if it impacted me negatively. Over the years, however, my life got consistently worse resulting in a large personality change. My parents got divorced when I was at the age of 6, which I honestly don't remember minding all too much, but i didn't know the path that it would ultimately lead me down. For years after their divorce, my father developed a horrible drinking habit. My mom kept leading him on, making him believe that someday they could get back together, until she met my stepdad, Jason, when I was 9. At this point, I was too young to understand most of the turmoil going on in my life, but that was soon going to change. Once Jason got added to the picture, everything got infinitely worse. My dad got so depressed that he started drinking until he passed out drunk every weekend, even while he was watching us. He had already been to the hospital once for his drinking and was clearly drinking himself to death. Once I got to around the age of 11, I started to realize this. I would fight him every time I found bottles. Yell and scream at him that he was my dad and I didn't want to lose him like this. He always wanted what was best for me, but even that couldn't help overcome the pain he was going through with my mom. He was always loving and caring, no matter what. Around this time, my stepdad also started tightening his hold on my moms side of the family. He slowly became more and more comfortable with my mom to the point where he was able to say horrible things to me and my brother, and my mom would pass it off as ""harsh but fair parenting"". Everything seemed to just be getting worse and worse, and I didn't know what to do. For years things just kept going like this, until I was 13 and my dad went to the hospital for pancreatitis. This acted as a huge wake up call for him. He was court ruled to start going to AA meetings and to stop drinking all together to get his kids back. After this happened, my dad fought every day to be a better father to me and my brother. He stopped drinking, went to AA every week. Everything was finally looking up, aside from the things going on with my stepdad. This lasted for a year. Then, everything went to shit. One week before my freshman year of high school, my dad goes into the hospital for the flu. They said it was nothing serious, and that it would blow over within a week. The next day I get called downstairs by my mom and I see that she was in tears. I knew what it meant the second I saw. I refused to believe it but I knew. She broke the news to me that due to my dads alcohol use, his liver had become so weak that it was no longer functioning properly, and that he had less than a week to live. I was devastated. My life was turned upside down. A half of my life was ripped away from me. My father was everything to me, especially after I had seen how much work he put in to get better for us. After this, everything about that kind, caring, and helpful kid disappeared. At first all I had was pain and sadness, but eventually it fueled my anger. I went into my freshman year with no consideration for those around me. I had entirely lost my faith in the fact that good people will get good things and abandoned all of the principles my dad had taught me about being kind and outgoing. This all happened about 5 years ago and nothings changed. I carry around this immense hatred for the world and I just want it to stop. There are times where I look at myself and think ""what the fuck am I doing?"". I've become such a negative and hurtful person and I don't know what I can do to get who I used to be back. I haven't been happy since everything that happened and i'm beginning to think I never will again. I know this is not what my dad would want for me but I have no power over my negative impulses. I fight with people sometimes for no reason and its come to the point where I only last with groups of people so long before they can no longer tolerate the person I've become. I've gone from being accepting and supportive of everyone to being judgmental and wanting to change them for my own personal benefit. I know that's selfish, but I don't know how to get better. I just want to bring back the kid I used to be.",28Apr2020,1

115,"A year ago, I felt ashamed of choices I made in life. Before this incident I laid in bed for a week, barely eating or drinking, getting up each morning vomiting from the anxiety of just being alive.
After months of being depressed and not receiving much support from my significant other I planned my escape. It felt like I was rushing myself so I would truly go through with killing myself. I disassociated so hard in this trance but as soon as I felt keys in my hand I felt grounded.... like there was a reason I shouldn‚Äôt do this. Why hadn‚Äôt I done it before. Call it the weird innate human drive to always push forward, or just my soul reaching out saying I should ask for help.... 

I confided in a friend who I rarely would talk to and he told me I could leave the relationship I was in. I can change my life if I need to and theres nothing set in stone. He asked me not to kill myself. We talked until 5 am. 

I felt trapped and unappreciated in my relationship, didn‚Äôt feel successful in my job, felt like a burden to friends and family and I was constantly cleaning up other peoples messes when I could barely wake up and function day to day. 

It has been a year and Ive spent this year working on me, there were a few bumps in the road but its all smooth from here on out.  There have been so many beautiful moments in the last year and even with all the chaos going on in the world I know its good that I am still here. Sometimes I cry when I think about the moments I would not have had. My depression doesn‚Äôt blind me from these moments anymore because I don‚Äôt let it.  I choose to see beauty instead of sadness. every. day. 

Ive built positive habits, like putting myself first in all situations (making sure I have the energy to help others before committing to it). Saying no when I need to say no. 
When I wake up in the morning I feel grateful that I took myself out of a toxic situation. 
I have bad days here and there where I feel worthless but then I remind myself:

Life just is what it is. We are only here for a short time so I might as well make the best of it. Nobody is perfect, and I need to stop being so hard on myself. 

Ive found peace, and that is what makes me happy. 

Most days I take just a few minutes to find some new songs, happy or uplifting music or hardcore music. Music is therapy, I surround myself with it. Once a week I utilize a hobby of mine. Once a week at minimum I plan to see friends (this is my favorite one as just talking to my friends makes my brain feel goooood) if you don‚Äôt have friends maybe this could mean connecting with others online. 
Once a week I do some type of chore or organization to make myself feel productive. 


Please if you feel hopeless, there is still life to be lived and you are in control for the most part. 
You are worthy of love even if you don‚Äôt feel you are right now. 
Don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself.

116,"I was in an abusive relationship for two years. Now I feel like I have some kind of brain damage that makes me lose control over myself. It's scary to me when I think of athletes that suffer big hits suffering the same symptoms.

I am having a very hard time controlling myself in general. Saying things I don't mean. Getting more upset or angry than I normally would.

And the worst is the sexually acting out. Anything can turn me on pretty much. I'm getting aroused and masturbating to all kinds of things I never normally would have. Staying up all night to satisfy it. I just can't gain control over myself. Often it's very sadistic or very masochistic stuff, and I really don't want to participate in it.

I was working at a different centre than usual (it‚Äôs a big chain of centres across my city) and so I txt messaged the manager of all the centres to let her know and she was pretty rude about it and told me that txt messages are not acceptable notifications for absences - I have txted my regular boss before when I‚Äôve been sick and it‚Äôs never been an issue. 

I called up the centre and left a message that I was sick and wouldn‚Äôt be able to make it. I assumed they had got the message (they hadn‚Äôt), which is my fault, but anyway as I wasn‚Äôt feeling well I slept through my alarm and their phone calls asking where I was.

120,"My mother - to put it lightly - is quite a slob and seems to be mostly unaware of her surroundings. I keep my room clean, but her room is a mess and often has an awful smell coming from it. The rest of the house could use some TLC, because it's clear she will not be the one to administer it. My only fear is that by taking these jobs on, she will wind up leaving it all to me.

Bit of background on myself and my mother: My dad was abusive. My mother was verbally abused, cheated on countless times (and knew it, and even know many of the women), and occasionally physically abused. She stayed with him until I was 17. I was not spared abuse either; the abuse I received was verbal/mental/emotional.

As a kid I adored my mother, but the moment I hit 11 I seemed to have a light-switch moment because suddenly I couldn't even stand her presence. This has only intensified over time, and I'm now 27.

My mother insists on doing everything, so for the most part I've let her; however, recently considering my age I decided to foster some independence, starting with making my own breakfast. I remember researching how to use a cafetiere to make coffee, and followed the instructions. Annoyingly my mother was hovering around me while I made it, and as soon as I did the first instruction she said ""You're doing it wrong.""

My mother is someone who refuses all advice and continues doing the same thing, even if you demonstrate that it is wrong. Despite me explaining how to use a cafetiere properly several times, she still does it the same old way which leaves half the coffee and sugar sunk in the bottom of the cup. You end up basically drinking coffee-coloured water.

More to the point: I would be much more comfortable taking more ownership and initiative under this roof if she wasn't around. Additionally I refuse to express myself whenever she is near and I've developed almost an alternate personality which I implement whenever I'm stuck with her.",28Apr2020,1

122,"I have written this for like 5 times already and I am still not sure if it's going to make any sense. So I apologize in advance if it doesn't.

I have been in therapy for a number of issues, none of which got a formal diagnosis, at least as far as I know, since last August. The sessions were bi-weekly, until the end of March, then my therapist became unavailable. Initially it was supposed to be until the end of June but due the coronavirus was shortened until the end of May. The therapist has told me about his absence in January, so I knew in advance.

I thought it wouldn't be a big deal. I've been without therapy for years and I survived, what is 2 or 3 months?

Except, it is a very long time.

I am slowly spiralling down emotionally and mentally and I just feel like I can't deal with daily life anymore. Everything takes just so much effort and sometimes I can just sit on the couch staring at the wall and the only thought I have is: ""I want this to end..."" 

I guess I have become dependant on the therapy as sort of safety net, or a rope that helps me get out of the abbyss of disastrous torturing thoughts. But now it is gone and I have no way of accessing it. And I am worried I'll just crumble into pieces and won't be able to stand up again.

This was made worse last week when I was at the clinic where my therapist has his office, seeing a different doctor and I saw him actually being in the office and working with clients. And for a brief moment I thought about reaching out to him and beg him to please have a session earlier, but I couldn't bring myself to do it.

It's like I probably could. And he could always say no and I'd be fine with that but I feel like I deserve not to have this opportunity. I mean, I am already so lucky I have found a therapist that actually listens and the therapy is helping me. And the others might be in way more trouble then I am. After all I am still functioning, going to work, taking care of household things like that...

It's a deep-rooted problem of mine. I just can't ask for help. I cannot admit things are bad. Because as long as I don't admit it, I can just pretend they're not. It's not helping but it is what I know at least. And I also know where it's going to lead in the end, but I am hoping I won't reach that point before the next session. 

Although I am not sure. The therapy has made me slide faster than ever before, which wasn't a problem when I got my bi-weekly sessions, because I can't slide to the abyss of deathwish in mere two weeks especially when nothing out of the ordinary happens... but two months is just too long.

I wish I knew how to deal with this. I wish I could at least pick up the phone and call the therapist to at least ask if he doesn't have and opening in his schedule. But I just can't...

For me, I personally just wanna get this off my chest and hope someone has some good tips to offer for this issue, after which I'm gonna see if I can help some other people on this subreddit.

We've been in lockdown for over a month now, and I'm starting to notice my mental health deteriorating. I'm trying really hard to stay busy and try new things (like new games, painting, learning Japanese) as well as maintaining my health by trying to exercise semi-regularly. This went pretty okay the first 2 weeks, after that it started deteriorating, because I felt like despite doing all of these things, I wasn't achieving anything ""relevant"" (I tend to have this issue a lot already but let's just say it's flaring up now).

I notice that along with this, or maybe because of this, my habit of comparison has increased a lot again, driving my anxiety up like crazy and killing my motivation to do anything. No physical distractions leads to more browsing of social media leads to more anxiety about not doing enough, and so on.

I'm trying to stay off of social media but when times are already this lonely, it's really hard to find a balance between staying in touch and up to date, and not focusing too much on others and more on myself and what I want. The drive to be as productive as possible during this time (which I know a bunch of others also struggle with) is really getting at me and enjoyment of a lot of things is rapidly decreasing.

Tl;dr does anyone have any tips to focus on yourself more and learn to feel more accomplished doing present activities, or stop compulsively comparing yourself to others?

128,"[I had a dream, which I feel describes these cyclic experiences down to a T (metaphorically speaking)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/g9l55s/trippy_nightmare_after_some_cheese/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

Its like, I have this build up of certain emotional ideas of certain people, I can become dilusional and stupid, always getting angst driven ideas about their intentions, etc.

And then there's  my almost cyclic, reoccurring thing with my perspective on reality, sometimes I worry to an extent where it might be called paranoia. 
I used to think I was possessed by a demon, for one.
Another thing is that I have had times where (not quite hallucinations, more imagination, projected onto my visual reality) I would see scary things, sometimes mundane ordanairy things, and drive myself insane, sometimes into tears because of the fear. I thought it was all real from sometime. But my logical brain managed to reason with itself. In that majorly troubled period of my life, I think it was caused by a combination of emotional/regular stress overload, and a lack in certain bvitamins(I researched allot into it).

Another time, with the added encouragement of another dilusional person, after seeing a prism extend from a warm coloured star, I thought there were bad stars being planted in the sky. 

Another one is that 3 times, in different places I've lived, I felt like I was being watched, and began inspecting EVERYTHING in my bedroom, inside locks, I genuinley looked EVERYWHERE.

Oh and then there was that time, after I learned about the simulation theory, having connected it to my experience as a child(I thought most people and my family were aliens in disguise, growing humans to harvest, and that they would discuss it secretly when I was gone, and that even the teachers at school were in on it, except for a few)...

with the delusions of reality, I can deal, resolve and handle them myself, using logical thinking and reasoning, and I don't have it anymore so much, since I've trained myself to reject illogical, unprovable ideas, and understood that my imagination isn't real, just a projection. 

With people, it's a problem, I hide my worries and angst, and let it build up and up, and I never feel I can mention them because I KNOW they are unreasonable and not true, but then I have mild to severe episodes where I believe it to be true, and then I become emotional, and burst out, either explaining, expressing, or forming words almost in an accusatory way (unintentionally), and ruin any platonic, romantic relationships I have. Especially since I tend to push people away while I'm convinced, and only realise how dilusional I am in my thinking after the event, which distressed and makes me even more upset with myself/the situation. Or I push them away after I'm sound of mind again, to save them from my inconsiderate nature.

I'd just like to hear some suggestions from people who have similar problems, have issues with dilusional thinking, etc.

135,"This has been ongoing for months. I'm not a doctor and I have zero experience in diagnosing or dealing with people who have mental illness, but I suspect they may have some kind of paranoia (?). Here's a quick description of the situation.

They live alone and are constantly talking, screaming, and cursing to themselves and anyone who happens to walk by their apartment. It happens at all hours of the day and night, accompanied by banging on the walls, while slamming doors and cabinets. At times they throw things at people from their balcony. 

We share a wall with them and when I say they talk to themselves I mean they are having full conversations, complete with different voices and tones that make it sound like other people are there. This person lives alone, confirmed by the leasing office and police. The conversations they have are never ""pleasant"", they are always loud and hostile, and mostly arguments. It's all nonsense, usually accusing people of being robots or terrorists. Somebody is always ""out to get me"" also.

Cops won't come out anymore to do wellness checks because they won't answer the door, and they say they're not in a position to ""kick in their door"" and force them to get help.

They are outside walking around the complex right now screaming and yelling. Somebody asked them to quiet down because their baby is sleeping, but this only made the situation worse.

My fear is that this person is a danger to themselves and others. About 3-4 weeks ago they were screaming ""I'm gonna kill you!"", But I don't know if they were screaming this at an actual person or to nobody/themselves. We called the cops when this happened, making sure to tell the dispatcher we think they may be a danger to themselves or others, but I don't know if they ever came. 

We don't know what to do at this point, and their mental state seems to be deteriorating. These episodes (?) Didn't used to be as frequent as they are now, but now they are happening daily.

This person needs help and I'm just looking for advice on how to get it to them. If anybody can offer resources by way of a phone number to call or a website to visit or anything, really, I would appreciate it.

My mental health is something I‚Äôve become more aware of over the past 3 years.

Currently i‚Äôm a 20F, completing her final few months of a nursing degree through the coronavirus pandemic. I have struggled through the past 3 years of my degree with highs and lows of my mental health. In Feb 2019, I planned my own suicide, but never  managed to go through with it, due to my anxiety telling me otherwise. I get less intrusive thoughts now, and haven‚Äôt thought about suicide recently, but still have fleeting thoughts about self harm. I never go through with any of it, but it‚Äôs something at the forefront of my mind. My ‚Äòdepression‚Äô has never been diagnosed and I doubt it ever will be, but I am constantly anxious. I‚Äôm writing this in bed, feeling sick to the core, scared and feeling like something bad is gonna happen. Nothing is. I‚Äôm safe, and have nothing to be anxious about. But recently i‚Äôm more and more anxious and I really don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve started to suffer with panic attacks for the past 6 months or so, having horrific nightmares causing then, having panic attacks mid run in the park, and then sometimes having them completely out the blue. I‚Äôm sick of this now, and I really don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel stupid going to get help at the doctors and feel embarrassed and ashamed and think they‚Äôre gonna think it‚Äôs nothing and tell me to go away.

I think a couple months ago I had seen my doctor who put me down for a referral to camhs which is a mental health service here  and I've still been waiting for a good while and I know that I shouldn't complain about that because these things take time but at the same time I just feel so shitty and lost? Camhs was what seemed like my only chance at receiving counciling services and finally getting a diagnosis as to what the hell is wrong with me but now with this quarantine I don't think I'll even get a chance at camhs now, I'm not really sure how much longer it can wait if that makes sense because it's hard, it's really damn hard to cope and wait and not know what the hell I'm supposed to do to try and help myself. 

I'm not exactly sure if I can ask my doctor about considering the fact I may have depression as many people around me, have told me to consider it as a possibility alongside bpd??? can I ask my GP to consider them as possibilities and if so how do I ask that and is it okay to say that people in my life have told me to consider this???

really don't want to speak to my gp and act as if I'm self diagnosing Because that's really not the case, I just want to consider it as a possibility so I can get help for whatever it is that's wrong yk?",28Apr2020,1
143,"Since I have been like 11 years old I've had serious brain fog. I started failing school, well getting straight Cs and Ds, then mostly Ds the next year, then all Ds, by 10th grade I failed it twice and dropped out. People think I'm retarded. I can NOT figure out whats wrong with me. I had an alcoholic abusive mother (emotionally, not physically, except one time she threw a clock that slammed into my head but I only had a bruise.) I have been on something like 7-8 medications for depression, anxiety, OCD, etc. I have seen like eight therapists in my life with 3-4 different therapy methods, all completely useless. I also used to slam my head into things when I got angry as a kid. The weirdest thing is that sometimes, very, very, VERY rarely I will wake up with much more clarity in my head and its like I'm no longer mentally retarded, but its like I'm still sort of half asleep or my eyes are closed usually. My brain fog goes down and I can think better, its like I'm normal, my anxiety and stuff is more normal, I can think more logically. It lasts maybe 30 seconds before I fully awaken and am back to normal, all f\*\*\*\*\* up. I've also had times where I've woken up and I've felt like a robot, not human. Other times I just wake up feeling better, most of the time its after a nap, not a full nights sleep. Does anyone have any idea what in the hell this could be? Should I get a brain MRI? I can't think straight and this is hell living like this. People think I'm retarded, I can't explain how I act in real life but its like I can't understand basic things, but then in that rare clarity half asleep/half awake thing, I'm more normal and can see in that moment how messed up I usually am. When I would look down at papers in school its like an invisible tornado or something was in front of my face, like some silent noise in my head was deafening me to where I couldn't concentrate at all, maybe its my OCD making my mind very strange I don't know. Another weird thing is I woke up about a half an hour ago from a nap and woke up more confident, its like I can understand myself better when this happens, its like EVERYTHING IN MY HEAD works better from this weird post nap clarity, mental issues down, understanding of myself down, connection to humans better, logically smarter,etc.,etc.,etc. - - Also I don't have ADHD I've been tested at a medical center.",28Apr2020,1

146,"I'm stuck in this cycle of thinking I've got the answers to fucking everything and then feeling like I'm the worst person in the world.

I'm stuck in lockdown with my parents and I'm completely ripping myself to pieces. I think my father has always emotionally abused me, but then I'm not sure.

The thought of having to deal with him stresses me out a lot. Speaking to him brings out the worst in me. I feel resentful and distrusting of him, but I can't help but wonder sometimes if it's all in my head. It drives me crazy.

I can't escape from it. I'm just want to get even further away from people. 

Every time I share an opinion, I feel like a cunt. How can I even believe any of the shit I say to people? How can I preach my opinions to people when I see so many flaws in myself?

I forgot my mother's birthday today and I feel like a complete waste of space.

I spend so much time thinking about myself and my problems that I missed my mum's birthday.

I feel like to other people I must seem so full of myself, always sharing my opinions like they fucking matter. But then nobody says that I bother them.

At the end of last year I came out of the only relationship I've ever been in. It was horrible.

I don't know if I'm really like what she said I'm like. I know she hurt me a lot though. She said I was controlling, self indulgent and toxic. She rarely made me feel loved. She made me feel like the worst person in the world. 

From my perspective I only tried to help her. I tried to help her with her addictions, her mental health. I was always there if she needed me. Apparently she couldn't rely on me though, apparently I manipulated and abused her. 

Is it manipulation and abuse if I'm trying to make decisions in someone's best interests even if it's not in my best interest to do so? 

I tried to show her how she was hurting herself but she didn't want to know. I just didn't want to watch her slowly die because she hated herself.

I don't see how I was the villain. I sacrificed so much of myself for her. She still felt as though I was though.

I just don't get any of it. I don't know if I'm completely delusional. I know for sure how I feel about these things, but I can't help but feel like I'm wrong somehow and I can't figure out why.

How can I be right at all about anything? I know fucking nothing. The life I've lived so far hasn't been right. I haven't had the social life that others have.

I just want to have a normal family and a happy relationship with someone. Something that so many others seem to have. 

It just never comes my way though.

I'm 22 and all I've ever known of family and love is just pain. 

I've always wanted to run away from it all. I don't want anyone to live in pain. The world doesn't owe me anything. I want to help people and make them happy.

I want to feel appreciated and loved but I can't even love or appreciate myself.

I feel like I let people down.

The only thread I'm hanging onto is that I'm alive for other people, but now I feel like I can't even do that right. I'm letting myself down.

I self refered myself to a local mental health service and had a phone appointment, they said they'd sort me out with some therapy and were supposed to send me an email.

I still haven't got it despite me reminding them over a week ago.

I just don't know what to do.

I don‚Äôt know why my almost 20 y/o self thinks about cutting when I‚Äôm very distressed, to say the least. To give a brief backstory, when I was 13 I got ‚Äúbaker acted‚Äù (I say that in quotes as I‚Äôve come to realize that other states besides Florida don‚Äôt use that term): baker acted being you‚Äôre either voluntarily or involuntarily admitted to a ‚Äúmental health center‚Äù (I guess) for 72 hours minimum. Usually this happens when people are threatening suicide or homicide. For me, it was involuntarily and it was in the middle of a school day when I was in eighth grade- quite frankly my parents didn‚Äôt even find out until they got home from work at 5pm that day, but that‚Äôs another story- and I don‚Äôt really think about it too harshly now. I don‚Äôt mind talking about it and it‚Äôs not like I trigger myself seeing/hearing/speaking about those kinds of things. That being said, I can‚Äôt remember the last time I cut but it was probably over 5 years ago now. 
Even when I was 13 and wanted to ‚Äúdie‚Äù-I say it like that because do I really think I could go through with killing my self? No, probably not- I didn‚Äôt see cutting as my sweet escape. To be honest, I have no idea why I cut I think I just kind of did it cause that‚Äôs what I had seen everyone else on the internet in 2013 doing stuff the time. I guess maybe it satisfied my slightly but I always regretted it after. Especially sitting on my bed holding a blood soaked cloth on my fresh wounds and wondering how I‚Äôm going to make sure my mom doesn‚Äôt see these. 
But now, I don‚Äôt know why the thought crosses my mind ever. Cuts, ACTUAL blood, organs, people‚Äôs insides; ALL of that, grosses me out in the present. I work in the food industry and I can‚Äôt stand when my coworkers try to show me any cuts they get...gross... put a bandaid on that and don‚Äôt show me please. On the flip side, when I‚Äôm extremely upset, all of that doesn‚Äôt necessarily gross me out as much anymore. Specifically cuts. I get this urge to just do it. Not like I have no other way to cope and I know 10000% I will regret it immediately, but I just get this urge. It‚Äôs not like a sexual urge, or any urge with the intent of making me feel better... I just want to. It‚Äôs very strange and I don‚Äôt know how much sense this all makes after I‚Äôve typed this out but this seems to be a reoccurring thought. Certainly, only situational, but still strange to me considering I‚Äôm so ‚Äúwhy would anyone cut in 2020 I thought we grew past that as a society,‚Äù sorry if that sounds crude! Either way I just wanted to share my thoughts on here. I‚Äôm in a terrible mood and I thought it‚Äôd make me feel better, which, Infact it did.

I haven't been feeling well physically (I have severe anemia and that has been messing with my health something awful) and I probably had COVID-19 too (I am getting tested no worries and my symptoms are gone now after coughing up a lung for over a week) so I have been sleeping 12-15 hours a day or more.

However, I woke up at 8 am this morning, after sleeping for nearly 12 hours, and I felt wonderful! I actually had the energy and strength to help my hubby with the laundry at the laundromat and we actually got something to go for dinner.

Well...sorta free lol. You know you've been in Quarantine for a long time when...a trip to the laundromat sounds like an interesting adventure (even though it is as boring as hell and it isn't anything really ""new"", as we have to do laundry weekly lol)...

162,"FAQ:

1- how?

overdosing painkillers. the first time I did it was before eating, I threw up after trying to hold it for around 6 hours, I thought my empty stomach was the reason I threw up as to doctors always telling us to take the pills after eating.  
the 2nd was one year later, I ate, took the pills and threw up one hour later, apparently eating doesn't make a difference, not a doctor but I thought that the reason might be that the pills taste bad for that reason. or some psychological effect due to me being afraid.

2- how does it feel?

nothing at first, but after throwing up you'll feel like you cannot move, pretty sick if one may say, for about two days you'll feel dizzy and just sort of sick, it goes later on.

3- why?

nothing in specific its kinda like how mountings are formed, a small rock from each side just formed in the shape of a mounting on my chest, family, friends, love, etc.",28Apr2020,1
163,"Long story short, I have a friend working on the front lines at a hospital in the IT department. Some team members have died of coronavirus, and in the last 24 hours five people resigned and two died by suicide. Some team members have literally been in the middle of working on a patient's medical equipment when the person died before their eyes - and these patients were children because it's a pediatric hospital.

The hospital where they work is (finally) providing counseling to the team. My friend talked to a counselor and tried to have an open mind, but said it felt invasive and extremely uncomfortable. From what my friend said, it seemed like the counselor tried to go too deep too quickly. This friend has been resistant to counseling because they've been abused by a family member who's a professional psychiatrist, so I can understand why any and all counseling would be particularly difficult.

I don't have experience with mental illness or therapy, which is why I'm asking. From what I understand, counseling/therapy is a slow approach and requires a) finding the right counselor to fit your needs and b) developing a relationship with the intent of progress over time. Please correct me if I'm wrong or missing important details.

How do you know when a counseling session is uncomfortable because it's working and/or the patient isn't used to opening up to other people, versus the session or person simply not being the right fit/unhelpful? What kind of advice can I give my friend? What should one expect when starting out with counseling/therapy?",28Apr2020,1

This started when my parents would throw parties with their friends when I was younger, and living with them, at first I was fine with it, but a couple of violent incidents happened, all the adults would be drunk, and I found it very frightening, and eventually the music and the noise of it all would send me into the fit of trying to drown out the noise, including the hurting myself part. I hated doing it. I hated it so much. I wish I could just ignore it but it‚Äôs hard.

I‚Äôve been absolutely alone in quarantine for over a month now, I haven‚Äôt seen or spoken to anyone I know in person, so I‚Äôm already feeling this dreadful feeling of loneliness and sadness, and every night some house in the neighborhood plays such loud music, I try to fall asleep but it‚Äôs useless with the noise, and it just makes me more panicked and upset and almost every night I‚Äôve been shaking and crying and screaming into a pillow, and I‚Äôve been feeling the need to throw myself against the wall, and the music doesn‚Äôt stop until midnight or the early hours of the morning. Reading, watching shows, anything to try and distract myself isn‚Äôt helping.

173,"A little back story. 

Her behaviour has never been normal. She can be nice as pie one minute, but should you say/do the wrong thing  (even trivial stuff) she unleashes a whirlwind of abuse. 

I‚Äôve found our relationship over the years has deteriorated. I can‚Äôt tell her anything about me bc she‚Äôll use it against me in future rants, even personal stuff like my having to have seen a therapist for serious issues (anxiety and depression) I had, telling me I should go back to see her to fix my attitude. She often criticised my dress sense, friends, partner and hobbies - especially video gaming. She sees it as a total waste and sad thing to do, despite her watching 6 hours + tv a day. 

Her birthday happened recently, big age milestone. She‚Äôs super self conscious about it, so much so she fills her face with Botox she can‚Äôt afford. She blamed me for her birthday being ruined because it was getting close to 9pm, dinner was getting cold and I was starving so I ate the starter after complaining a little about my hunger to my dad while she was on a zoom session. 

This triggered a downward spiral and has culminated in my dad throwing trays and shouting and my mum saying I ruined it all. I hadn‚Äôt said a word of anything since I ate the starter as I went out the room so had no idea where this all came from. I‚Äôm so confused...I tried to give her the cake I got for her, lit up my candles but she said it was pointless, I‚Äôm selfish, I don‚Äôt care etc. It all seemed like a big thing was made out of a little thing. 

However, everytime it‚Äôs my birthday she fights with my dad and ruins it, yet I‚Äôm not allowed to get upset about it...she‚Äôs never in the wrong and always a victim it seems. Been fired from multiple jobs, one on grounds of racism (she is a massive racist omfg it hurts) but it‚Äôs never her fault. She‚Äôs hit me several times before I could defend myself, never got an apology as it wasn‚Äôt her fault. 

None of her sisters, nieces or nephews talk to her, her in-laws don‚Äôt like her either. Honestly I‚Äôm surprised my dad hasn‚Äôt divorced her yet bc it‚Äôs one drama after another. She‚Äôs keyed peoples cars, brawled in the streets, stolen from shops and is downright bitchy. She even takes the toys the nextdoor neighbours kids accidentally throws over the fence and gives it to the dog. 

She‚Äôs an obsessive clean freak too and will get super pissed if there‚Äôs one speck on the floor. She works like 3 short days a week so has so much time on her hands but wants everybody else to do the house duties despite us all being in full time work/education. 

Yet she can be very giving to us. Says she wants us to have the best things and can show what looks like real affection. But I honestly can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs real. Who is the real mum? I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs like she‚Äôs two different people. One minute preaching taking Buddhist calm ways towards life, to the next minute being super racist about Asians and going into a frenzy. 

I need advice real bad bc I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing wrong here...am I blind to how I am? Am I selfish too? I honestly don‚Äôt know what to think anymore.

180,"Ok so this actually just came to my attention recently- I was never diagnosed with OCD but I get lots of obsessive thoughts for some reason. I have ADHD but I‚Äôm not sure if that has to do with it. For a while is used to have obsessive thoughts about murders (not like mystery murders or real life ones, but I‚Äôd get really upset at people and start thinking about murder, especially towards people who I don‚Äôt forgive).

182,"TL;DR - the title.

I live in the USA. For my entire life, I have been fidgety and thought it was normal. It's only been in the past few years that my symptoms have gotten worse. My thoughts are scattered and it is hard for me to stay on topic. I have sought counseling at a few places and haven't had good experiences so I stopped.

I'll try to keep this short since I will ramble otherwise. My symptoms?/behavior are

* scattered/racing thoughts  
* inability to stay focused on something that isn't digital entertainment
* inability to plan ahead
* unorganized
* poor time management
* can't focus on multiple tasks
* chronic anxiety and depression

I have been very hesitant about seeking help due to a lifetime of conditioning from my parents telling me that I don't need medical help. A university doctor prescribed me citalopram? and clonazepam? years ago, but I stopped taking them after I started to drive sleepy and almost crashed a few times. I was not diagnosed with any clinical condition, but I'm pretty sure I have some kind of ADD.

Since the pandemic lockdown started, I've been playing more video games and watching more movies on netflix. I can't help but wonder if I'm being overstimulated and making it harder to concentrate when I need to. I'm pretty sure I was hyperactive as a child, so video games helped to calm me down and focus on one thing. However, it's not working as an adult.

I'm stopping now because I'm rambling.",28Apr2020,1
183,"I've been thinking about making a post like this for a while. I recently broke up with my gf and that's made me take a good, hard look at my past so here I am. 

Sorry for formatting, am on mobile. I'm using a separate (throwaway?) account. 

I am a 16M in northeast USA, growing up in an upper middle class home with supportive parents. I have adhd and generalized anxiety disorder, both diagnosed by a professional in December 2019. In May 2013 I was diagnosed with PDD-NOS but that diagnosis went away with my most recent neuropsych exam (May 2013 and December 2019 were the only times that I have taken those tests). I scored highly on the iq test that the same professionals gave me (score of 137). I do well in school but struggle with paying attention, taking tests in a reasonable amount of time, and doing homework in a reasonable amount of time. I am currently taking Cymbalta for anxiety, and Intuniv and Focalin for ADHD. Other than ADHD and GAD related issues, I have low self-esteem, what I label ""chronic and pervasive perfectionism"", trust issues, I'm slow at everything, violent thoughts, and I am socially unskilled, unaware, and inept. Maybe it's just a symptom of anxiety, I'm not sure. 

My gf of well over a year recently broke up with me because she lost feelings in the span of about 3 weeks. I cant help but feel like it's all my fault, like I could've saved the relationship if I sent more paragraphs, made more phone calls, sent her more stuff, and paid more attention to her. My adhd meds (as of right now, Focalin) make me feel like a robotic zombie without a personality and I feel like that was a part of it too. I think it was the end of the honeymoon phase, she thinks it was the end of the relationship. I feel guilty, inadequate, broken, pathetic, annoying, and I feel like a burden. I've felt this way since ~13 and while it's been better at some times, it's generally a feeling I experience all the time, especially with a break-up on my shoulders. I blame myself for everything bad that happens to me and I put way too much pressure on myself for everything to be perfect. 

I'm a perfectionist and it's ruining my life. Everything has to be perfect, otherwise I get very anxious. I HAVE to finish my homework (this, in combination with adhd, makes staying up until 3am b/c of homework very common), I HAVE to buy the right router/computer parts, I HAVE to make sure my phone is charging and push in where the cable connects. Often times it's unreasonable thing that I have to check or do. I feel the need to save every post that I find even remotely funny on Instagram or TikTok. It's pervasive and I cannot stand it. 

I am not very skilled socially. I have a hard time deciding what to say in conversation and have a hard time interpreting verbal and non-verbal signals that others do subconsciously. I have never been connected with everyone else and I feel like most other people are countries on this one big continent, and some other people (like me) are islands off the coast of the continent. My mom especially noticed my lack of social skills when I was younger. I was maybe 7 years old, at the playground. Since I was 5 I've been very interested in geography. Since I was about 6 I could point out where a country was on a map and tell you it's capital if given a country. Anyway, at the playground, I went up to someone, and asked him ""wanna hear something funny?"" and he replied ""yeah"", so I said ""Mozambique!"", which is just a country in Africa. I thought the name sounded funny. My mom thought this kind of behavior wasn't normal so I'd like to add it here. I used to play basketball and often skipped on the court instead of run like everyone else (age 9). At the time, I didn't realize that was weird. As of right now, I feel completely out of place when I try talking to people I don't know very well. People say ""Hi [MMHT15]"" in the halls like they do to some of the special needs kids and of course this makes me wonder if I'm one of the weird kids, one of the ones who just doesn't get it. Sometimes they chuckle when I give an answer in class like I'm one of the awkward kids. It's very very frustrating and I don't know how to deal with it. I have a supportive group of friends and family but other than them I find it very difficult to connect with or talk to anyone.

I'm slow at everything, and I mean **everything**. It takes me double or triple the amount of time that it should to complete my homework (6 hours per night is not unusual) or complete any type of test, I take an hour to do the dishes, I take a long time to shower, I'm usually the last one out of the locker room for gym class, I'm usually the last one to finish a test, etc. I take such a long time to complete every minute little task and I'm absolutely fed up with it. I feel like I don't have a sense of urgency. I'm only motivated by stress or things that interest me and that makes me feel very lazy. 

I have violent thoughts and dreams and it freaks me out. I am not actively suicidal nor depressed but whenever I feel down or anxious - like I am right now - recurring images of me dying appear in my mind. Getting my head smashed in with baseball bats, being shot in the head, being swung against a building with a crane, getting run over by a tank, getting my limbs ripped off by a machine, those kinds of things. My dreams are very violent and often include themes of mass murder, rape, death, power, greed, apocalypse, and other things like that, where I am the one committing the acts. I am a fairly docile person and have absolutely no intentions or desires to do those things in real life yet they still appear in my head or in my dreams. A few years ago at summer camp, I did this clicking thing in the back of my throat and a part of my mind kept telling me I was communicating with the devil. It kept bothering me throughout the week-long camp. I used to be DEATHLY afraid of dogs from birth to until i was in 6th grade. (I have a dog now, so that's no longer an issue). 

Along the lines of being extremely afraid of dogs, I used to do some other very odd and peculiar things as a child. I used to ONLY go to the bathroom with one of my parents asking me ""do you have to go to the bathroom?"". Otherwise, I wouldn't go, and I mean, **I wouldn't go**. I was often constipated and wouldn't pee for hours. I HATED trying new foods, even though they were completely harmless. When I was in 3rs grade, my mom recorded a video of me crying when she said I had to try at least one kernel of cooked corn or else I wouldn't be able to have dinner (this was to show my psychiatrist at the time - she only did it that one time and has always been supportive of me and never been abusive). 

I have trust issues as well, and my break-up only makes it worse. I often tell my friends ""Please don't steal"" when I go to the bathroom and have food. I double, triple, quadruple check everything to make sure it's good (sort of like my perfectionism). There was a time in February 2019 where I thought everyone faked happiness and did it to seem like a good person or to not be negative. I was genuinely convinced that nobody was truly happy and that everyone faked it. I don't believe that anymore but I still have issues trusting people's true intentions.

If you've made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read my post, it means a lot. If you have any suggestions to handle these issues, please let me know, it would mean a lot. I am struggling.

I was getting paranoid and was reading about long term cardiovascular effects and early deaths from drug abuse. The numbers used in the infographics are numbers that I constantly see and think about. At that time, the thing my friend was watching had someone with my name and what was being said directly applied to my life and what was going on. I‚Äôve abused a lot of drugs. Everything from multi week binges on nitrous and meth, to repeatedly abusing research chemicals and mystery drugs. I‚Äôve done every category of drug, but mainly have abused cannabinoids( synthetic included, daily cannabis user), stimulants, psychedelics, but have done a little of everything including bath salts and spice. I‚Äôve mixed many different drugs, and I think I should be worried. I feel like I may die early. 

I quit doing drugs right now, no more smoking weed and no more doing any drug for now. I think DMT possibly helped me, but I‚Äôll hold off on doing more for now. That‚Äôs the only drug I really want to do, honestly. I know I‚Äôm contradicting myself right now, but I‚Äôm typing as I‚Äôm speaking. The only drugs I haven‚Äôt done are pcp and it‚Äôs analogues. I‚Äôll hold off on that until I‚Äôm old. 

Sorry for not providing a backstory, but it‚Äôs way too much to put down. My mental illness has progressed to different things. I was a very intelligent child with autism. I even taught myself to read at 5 and began reading textbooks. Everything was fine and normal for me until my life started getting harder. I‚Äôve been exposed to a lot way too early, and grew older than needed to be. I‚Äôve been homeless, arrested and kicked out of school, and even had a kid at 17. I‚Äôve done a lot of stupid shit and have come to regret a lot, but not my daughter. Now that I think about it, I might have PTSD too. My family and I have been involved in a lot of events involving guns or shooting. Just last year my brother survived a drive by while in his car on our street because of a robbery gone wrong. He‚Äôs not a bad person, just a tough brother growing up. My half brother though tried getting me to lick his penis when I was a young kid, but no one knows that.

Should I not be posting this?) I‚Äôm getting off but will probably get back on to reply to messages.

So for a bit of context, I live in Brazil, and I have a girlfriend who is 21 years old and lives in another state, let's call her D.

Well, D has a schizophrenic mother who swears at her, threatens her, says she's going to throw her out of the house, has already taken iron bars (yes, iron bars) to hit her, slapped her and an extensive list of verbal abuse and physical, just to give an example I once heard her mother saying that D was impersonating her on the internet to prostitute herself for men from another country and that she would write down her periods to check if she is not pregnant.

I know that schizophrenia is a disease that can literally fuck people's brains, when D was 16, her mother put her out of the house, just like that. Here in Brazil the age of majority is 18 years old, D's father is a total idiot, he doesn't care and does nothing to help.

If I hadn‚Äôt met, I‚Äôm afraid she would try to commit suicide last year because she‚Äôs tried 3 times before and she couldn‚Äôt, Once she tried to drown, once with an overdose of medication and the other she didn‚Äôt tell me.

I'm a teenager who's struggled with mental health issues for a long time. My parents will not allow me to see a therapist anymore for reasons they've kept to themselves. (I have a bad relationship with them and they're traditional.) I have diagnoses of depression and anxiety.  
For a long, long time now I've developed feelings that someone's watching me, or more specifically, seeing through my eyes. Like they can see, hear and experience everything I'm doing and they can leave my head and return at will. It makes me panicked and very uncomfortable, and I've tried gouging out my eyes and some more unsavoury stuff on the more extreme times. The feeling ends up going away after anywhere from five minutes to 2 days.

198,"**Short version:** I've dealt with graphic imagery/discussion daily for the past couple of years (crime scene photo/video, video of murder, detailed accounts from victims/criminals on horrific crimes, etc.) as part of my educational experience. I've only ever experienced the victim accounts firsthand, though. Everything else has been in a classroom. Still, over the years I've developed regular nightmares about the imagery and my perspective on things has changed dramatically (from relatively  optimistic to nihilistic). My counselor suggested we look into PTSD as a result of vicarious trauma. Is it possible for someone like me to have PTSD having only experienced this kind of thing in a classroom setting?

  
**Longer version:** As a student/employee at a university, I deal with graphic imagery (crime scene photo/video for analysis, videos of murders being committed, etc.) and graphic discussion (mostly detailed victim/offender accounts) as part of my day-to-day routine, and have done so for the past couple of years. However, it's purely in an academic setting. I'm not a police officer, nor am I ever physically experiencing any of this firsthand. Still, I've always found it disturbing, and I've never been able to distance myself from it emotionally (as I've been advised to do). I've cried at the end of a workday more than a few times thinking about the videos/photos I worked with that day.  


For some added context, I also come from a police family, where I was always being told about some pretty horrific things taking place in my city as I was growing up. I've also lost a few friends and family friends to unnatural causes over the years (overdose, murder, fire, etc.). I only mention this because ever since I started dealing with the graphic imagery/discussion daily, I find myself thinking almost obsessively throughout the day about the terrible things taking place in the city, as well as the deaths of people I've known and the apparent frailty of life. Frequent nightmares about the graphic imagery developed over time, and I spent awhile drinking heavily to take the edge of the dread I was feeling (a habit which has since stopped, thankfully).  


Regarding my issues, my counselor suggested looking at PTSD as a result of vicarious trauma. Is it even possible for someone like me to develop PTSD having only dealt with things like graphic imagery within the confines of a classroom?

200,"After years of being numb things were finally coming together, with COVID everything has been shattered and I‚Äôm left hopeless. I was in my first healthy happy relationship in a long time, was planning future schooling and getting my life together. I have now lost my job permanently, my relationship (which has been devastating) and am stuck isolated with my parents at 26. I see no light at the end of the tunnel.

I wake up in panic and feel the heaviest anxiety I have ever felt in my life. Most days I can‚Äôt even sleep. Im trying so hard to keep my head up but I‚Äôm really losing my mind.

201,"If someone is taking medication for ptsd/anxiety, needs to review the medication with a new psychiatrist, and is interested in therapy/non-pharmaceutical approaches looking for the actual diagnosis, is it better to set an appointment with a psychologist as well, set an appointment with a therapist, or wait until the psychiatry appointment?",28Apr2020,1
202,"She started when she was enrolled in a hyper competitive sport; about two months ago. Our parents found out and they had her stop the sport, but she did it about a week ago again. She had difficulty explaining why she did it, and there was a lot of shame associated with us finding out. We discussed it with her, but she did it again just two days later. It's like bringing it up with her brought it to the forefront of her mind. She's a very physical person; she deals with things/activities immediately/physically in front of her and forgets everything else. 

My parents are asian and don't understand mental health...my mom brings things up like ""you know those scars will never fade, right?"" and ""You have a great life, why are you doing this?"" They truly want the best for us; they just don't understand it. I would push for therapy, but we can't really afford therapy at the moment. 

I would talk to her privately, but if bringing it up just makes it worse, I don't really know what to do. I also don't know if it's a factor of her age. I don't doubt she's dealing with some intense, real feelings, but teenage years ARE hard anyway, and I know many teens simply grow out of self-harming behavior. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",28Apr2020,1
203,Hi I'm a 16 year old Male. I'm from l.a and when I was 13 I got into a car accident that killed 2 people in the other car and had me and the other passengers in that car in the hospital for weeks. A couple month later I was diagnosed with PTSD and I was sent to therapy. Right before I turned 16 in November I was diagnosed with bi polar disorder. Now in april 2020 I have been on anti depressants since November and I have 0 sex drive. It put a strain on my relationship with my girlfriend as we were just starting to become sexually active. My girlfriend broke up with me because she was moving and didn't want to do long distance but even before that I never really wanted to have sex. If I did it was very rare like maybe once or twice a month. Here in april I just have 0 sex drive i haven't masturbated or anything in almost a month. Is this a normal thing while taking anti depressants?,28Apr2020,1

205,"So maybe this doesn't belong here. I'm not sure I didn't really know where else to go to talk about this I'm honestly lost. I'm kinda just sitting here in tears right now due to something that has just happened. My name is Dominic and I'm 16 years old and a few months ago got the all clear to stop going to therapy. However, today I'm just feeling really down because I've just made a mess of my life.

In the past few years I've said many sketchy and sexual things that are completely out of line and over the past few months I've been trying to rectify my past errors. I'm trying to be a normal person and to do things right and I haven't said anything as disgusting as I used to in a while. However just today I found out that quite a few people I know have a very big hatred for everything I've done previously and now their trying to gather evidence to show everybody I know that I'm a creep or a sex offender.

I don't personally believe I ever said anything that reaches as far as sex offender, but I have definitely in the past said some very creepy things.

I'm freaking out currently. I can't sleep. I can't even think about anything else. I have been trying so hard to change and get away from what I was before it was too late and now I don't even know if I can escape it anymore. Quite honestly I am terrified. Some random person called me today and just spent the call calling me a creep and then laughing hysterically and I don't know what to do. I don't even know what I can do in this situation. I feel awful right now and maybe that is deserved for what I've said previously but I just want it to end. I just want it all to end it's too much.

Thank you anybody who did read this. I just really needed people to talk to about this.

As of right now I haven't seen any of the evidence that they have since I haven't even been sent it yet but I know such things must exist because I know who I have been in the past. I want to be a good person. And I want to forget about the past but it just got brought up and my insides feel uneasy and my whole body is shaking and I'm lost.",28Apr2020,1
206,"Hello, I hope you're all having a decent day. I was diagnosed with depersonalization over 6 years ago, and I am just now starting to get out of it and just starting to realize my extreme loss of emotion and loss of feeling human is just the brains natural reaction to anxiety. I'm slowly becoming myself again and this good weather is really helping out haha. One of the things that haven't seem to going away yet are my giant pupils. They're fully dilated 24/7 to the point where everything is blurry and everyone thinks I'm on drugs. Also I have to squint so hard when the suns out that it seriously hurts my eyebrows. It gives me a very high intolerance to bright or plain white lights. Is there anything I can do to constrict my pupils asides from furthering my progress of getting out of the depersonalization?

This might not be helpful but if it helps anyone even a little bit, that's worth it. I have a tip for anyone with depersonalization. It may or may not help depending on your specific problems. If you want to change yourself (not fix, because you're not broken :) you need to be spontaneous, you can't think about what you want to do. I know this sounds weird, but you can't let yourself know that you're trying to change yourself, you just have to do it.",28Apr2020,1
207,"I have recently been prescribed antidepressants and I'm horribly embarrassed that I have to take something like this. It's like I've failed in helping myself and now I'm putting myself in a chemical straight jacket.

208,"I (24M) have been feeling suicidal for the past 2 days. It's been a long time since I've been this way. I sometimes feel suicidal and then when I sleep it goes away but right now it isn't. I just can't handle life. I have nothing and nobody. I'm usually optimistic but I can't be right now. I hate everything about myself.

The only thing stopping me is the fact I know how it is to lose a loved one to suicide - I've lost two siblings to it in the past 5 years but what's the point keeping myself alive to save others pain when my suffering also makes them unhappy? I don't know how to make the feeling go away. I won't do it because a part of me still believes I can turn it around but God I just wish it would all end, you know?",28Apr2020,1
209,"I;m 18, and at the beginning of last year,I had a very bad existential crisis after some bad drug experiences. It lasted about a week and I couldn't stop crying. I was constantly looking online trying to figure out what happens after death. I would think that one day my parents are gonna die and I would immediately tear up. I even talked to them about this, and basically just cried like a baby.

After this subsided though, I feel like I've become a psychopath or something. I rarely cry, and I don't feel happiness or sadness. The only times I cry is when I see a sad video about animals dying. I get more upset about animals being hurt than humans for whatever reason. I feel like something must be wrong with me for being this way.

Deep down I've been extremely miserable since then. I think I'm depressed, but I don't feel sadness so idk. 

What could be wrong with me? Does this sound like depression, or have I become a sociopath or something?",28Apr2020,1

After two weeks of quarantine, I‚Äôve gone back to my job as an ‚Äúessential‚Äù worker and it‚Äôs just gotten worse from there, as work has been so much harder since this hit. 

I‚Äôm on the verge of failing every class. I‚Äôve tried to speak with my professors about this and they have been less than understanding. The school isn‚Äôt offering any assistance or pass/fail mechanisms. 

How can I get myself on track through all of this? I‚Äôm beating myself up for being lazy but I don‚Äôt know why I can‚Äôt get myself to do work. This break in routine has killed me.
